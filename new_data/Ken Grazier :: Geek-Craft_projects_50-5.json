When Kay and everyone at Oni saw the last version, we all shouted perfect (almost)! We sent the design back with one subtle but important change: Chamomile needs to be a lot grumpier. We need him to look like we accidentally woke him up from a really good nap and he is not happy about it at all. Once that change was made, we found our perfect Mountain Chamomile. \nThe Mountain Chamomile plushie and woven blanket shown are prototypes and the final versions may be slightly different. The final blanket will be 50\" x 60\". \nIf you're looking for add-ons, don't worry! We've got you covered.  If you back at any level (even the $1.00 pledge), you'll be able to add individual plushies to your pledge through Backerkit once the campaign ends, as well as the blanket, game, and books.\nPLAY\n\nOne of the greatest things about being in the comics and games industry is that throughout the year, we get the opportunity to interact directly with the fans at conventions all across the world. These events give us an outlet to create specialty items that we think fans will treasure, but that are prohibitive to make for retail. This year, we didn't have that opportunity, so many of the projects, like Mountain Chamomile, had to be postponed.\n\nWith Kickstarter, we have the ability to reach our fans directly and bring our creative projects to life. Literally every backer makes a difference and with enough backers, we can continue to connect with fans, share our process, and offer a variety of fun rewards.\nKay O'Neill is an Eisner and Harvey Award-winning illustrator and graphic novelist from New Zealand. They are the author of Princess Princess Ever After, Aquicorn Cove, The Tea Dragon Society, The Tea Dragon Festival, and Dewdrop, all from Oni Press. They mostly make gentle fantasy stories for younger readers, and are very interested in tea, creatures, things that grow, and the magic of everyday life.\nOni Press / Lion Forge Publishing Group is a premier comic book, graphic novel, and games publisher located in Portland, Oregon. Established in 1997, Oni Press\u2019s curated line includes a variety of award-winning original and licensed comic books and graphic novels, including: Adult Swim\u2019s Rick and Morty\u2122, Nickelodeon\u2019s Invader ZIM, Scott Pilgrim, Queen & Country, Courtney Crumrin, Wasteland, The Sixth Gun, Stumptown, Wet Moon, Letter 44, The Bunker, The Tea Dragon Society, The Coldest City, and Kaijumax.\nPlease note that shipping is not included in the prices. Shipping will be charged in the pledge manager based on where you live and on which rewards and add-ons you purchase. We've included a chart for estimated shipping costs with our reward levels and different shipping regions. Whenever possible, we'll bundle items together to save you shipping costs. \n\nPlease note that taxes are also not included in the prices. We are required to collect and pay taxes in specific states and countries. If ordering from California or Missouri, taxes will be added in the pledge manager. If ordering from Canada, VAT will be added to your overall purchase in the pledge manager.  \nWhat is Backerkit?\nBackerkit is a crowdfunding software tool that helps us make sure you get exactly what you want and are charged correctly.\n\nWhen will this happen?\nYou will get an email survey 2-3 weeks after the campaign is over providing a link to a Backerkit survey. In the survey, you\u2019ll add your shipping info and reward preferences and grab any add-ons to see the overall shipping and tax costs.\n\nHow much will I pay?\nThe total cost will be the value of all the items in your BackeKit cart, plus shipping and applicable taxes, minus what you were already charged in Kickstarter through your pledge.\n\nHow Much Do I Pledge Now?\nTake a gander at the banners on the right side of page and click on your preferred reward level. Looking for add-ons? No worries! As soon as you receive your email from Backerkit, you'll be able to add as many plushies, books, and blankets as your heart desires.\n Music: Bensound.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor the Alpine plushie, we've been working closely with Kay O'Neill and the manufacturer to perfect the grumpiest face ever. \n\nThe two main risks for this Kickstarter are unexpected delays in manufacturing or shipping. With a project of this size, customs can sometimes also cause delays in shipping. If the project is highly successful, materials could also take longer for our manufacturer to obtain, although larger orders usually mean faster production. Overseas holidays can also cause a delay in either shipping or manufacturing. We're working with an established manufacturer, one we've been partnered with for three adorable plushies so far. We will always keep everyone updated with all stages of production and shipping, and if there are any delays, you'll be the first to know.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nWe're using eco-friendly polyester and polyester fiber during manufacturing!", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wild Tea Dragon Spotter", "descp": "Support our campaign and follow our story!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["285 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Alpine Plushie Adopter", "descp": "The fluffiest and grumpiest tea dragon!\nShipping and taxes are not included in this price.

See the Licensing section for details!\nEngage the Nazi occupation of France in la petite guerre to throw off the yoke of the oppressors and free your homeland!\nMaquis is a solitaire worker-placement game with variable goals and a play time of approximately twenty minutes. The player places their resistance agents on spaces around town to achieve their goals - blowing up trains, publishing underground newspapers - but at the same time Milice collaborators and Wehrmacht soldiers patrol the area. Agents who can't make it back to the safe house at the end of the day are arrested, and never seen again.\nWith this new edition, we've added some new components to include some more difficult 3-star missions, some new spare rooms and resources, and made some tweaks to the rules & original components to improve clarity and gameplay.\nFor previous backers/customers who got the 1st edition, we have the option on this campaign to order the new components to add to your original game (Backer Level \"Maquis - New Content\"). They'll be fully compatible and will fit into the original box (with some maneuvering \ud83d\ude0a), or you can keep them in the nice tuck box they'll ship in.\nNOTE:  We only plan on printing what we need of the \"Maquis - New Content\" level so there is no guarantee that folks who don't back the Kickstarter will receive the new content separately. Don't miss out!\n\n\n\nTo begin, the player will set up the board, organize the game tokens and  randomly choose two mission cards that must be completed in the allotted number of turns.\n\nThe player will then shuffle the patrol deck and place it next to the side of the board. This deck represents where the Milice patrols will occur during each day.\n\nThe player will choose a location to send their first worker and assign one of their pawns there. They then draw a patrol card, and place a Milice pawn if able. This continues until all of the available worker pawns and Milice pawns are placed. If the Milice find your worker during patrol, they will be arrested!\nYour diligent workers are then free to perform their duties, working toward your two goals. Gather resources, recruit fellow patriots to the cause, and undermine the enemy plans to throw off the yoke of oppression and free your homeland!\n Downloads: \n(for 1st edition - 2nd edition files coming!)\nRulebook PDF\nPrint & Play\nTry it for free on Tabletop Simulator \nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through a pledge manager. \nThese shipping rates listed below are estimates and may change based on 2021 shipping rates & final production weights.

For backers in Australia & New Zealand, pledges will ship from within Australia (Aetherworks).\nFor our EU backers, all pledges will be fulfilled from the EU. We are closely monitoring what's happening with the trade deal with the UK and EU resulting from Brexit and we'll make sure that effective, customs friendly shipping will be available for everyone.\nFor backers in the rest of the world (including the US), pledges will be shipped from China either directly to you or through a local partner. This allows us to offer affordable shipping to everyone across the globe.\nAnd, for backers getting the English version, each additional copy you order doesn't increase the shipping cost! So if you order 1, 10, or 100 copies of the 2nd edition the shipping charge will be $6/$9/$15 depending on your location. :)\nNOTE:  These shipping estimates are for the English version only. We will work with our licensing partners to provide shipping estimates for those versions based on shipping locations. \nIt would be an honor to have Maquis on the shelves of retail stores!

In the PnP and first editions, the day track marks \"completed days\". This wasn't an issue for any of the original PnP missions, but some of the newer ones require you to complete objectives on or before certain days.

This project aims to fund the manufacturing of Zodiac Mermaid pins that I have designed. As of January 12, 2021 all 12 pins have been unlocked! My name is Jess of JellyJessBeans and you can find me on Instagram for more designs and art I make. I have experience making an enamel pin previously so I know what to expect from my manufacturer and have trust in their quality. if you would like to see my previous pin you can find it on my Etsy store.  You can also check out my design process and information about the Zodiacs on my TikTok. I have been drawing most of my life, and have decided I wanted to pursue my passion, so here I am! Thank you so much for taking a moment of your time to look at my campaign!\nThis project aims to fund the manufacturing of the below pins. The pins are all hard enamel, gold plated, at approx. 2 inches tall. They will have two pin posts and come with rubber clutches and will be sent with backer cards that are custom designed for each of the mermaids.\n In the line-up below you can see the pin artwork of each of the mermaids that will be sent to the manufacturers. Below them are each of the backer cards for each of the pins. The cards will be roughly 3 inches tall and will be white, with gold foil to give them that extra special touch! If you would like to see the illustrations of each of the mermaids, please head over to my Instagram to view them all!\n\nI am also offering freebies for certain pledge tiers!\nIf you order 6 or more pins, you will receive a 5x5 inch print of the illustration of each of the pins you want!\nThe initial funding target for the pins is $1300 which allows me to fund the manufacturing, shipping and fees on the first three of the zodiac sign pins! If this goal is exceeded we can start working towards unlocking the next nine pins! For those of you who are curious about how the costs get broken down or where the money goes here is a rough breakdown:\nPin Production: ~70%\nFulfilment and Shipping: ~20%\nKickstarter/Transaction Fees: 10%\n\nThank you for looking over my campaign! If you can't back the project right now, sharing this Kickstarter on social media is a great help! I'll be posting updates here and on Instagram!\nAll pins have been unlocked! Whether you pledge before or after they are unlocked doesn't matter, but you may miss out on the Early Bird specials if you wait too long! At the end of the campaign, regardless of when you pledged, you will be able to choose between any of the pins that we have unlocked. You will also be entitled to any additional freebies we have unlocked by the end of the campaign! This includes the Kickstarter exclusive 1.5 inch mermaid pin for free!\nI have even partnered with two Etsy shops to make custom designed pin boards for the project! They come in 13 inch and 18 inch variants which you can check out below the mermaids. The 13 inch board is being made by WhatsYourInnerGeek. This pin board is a thick, durable foam and has a wood backing. The 18 inch board is being made by UniqueCorkBoards. This pin board is made of cork like many boards you see in stores. I have linked their Etsy shops in their names if you want to go and check out their work!\nThese are custom designed, engraved pin boards, and are priced as such. The 13 inch board will cost $60 USD ($45 + $15 shipping & Handling), and the 18 inch board will cost $80 USD ($65 + $15 shipping & Handling).\nTo increase your pledge you can go to Manage Pledge > Update Pledge > Bonus Support > Confirm. I have also added 2 new reward tiers to get all 12 pins at a discounted rate that includes one of the pin boards!\nCapricorn, Pisces and Scorpio\nAquarius, Sagittarius and Virgo \nGemini, Libra and Cancer \nAries, Leo and Taurus\nKickstarter Exclusive FREE Mermaid Pin\n13 inch board on the left, 18 in board on the right\nSize comparison with my previous 1.5 in pin for size\nPledge Now, Pay Later\nOne way to think of Kickstarter is that it is a pre-order site! The benefit is that you can pledge now for the pins you want, and only pay at the end once we are fully funded; meaning if you need to back out before the campaign ends, you can! This means it\u2019s risk free for all involved! Once the campaign ends I will send out a survey allowing you to pick the pins you want.\nThe fees will not cover any import taxes or customs fees if you live outside the United States, so be aware of those if your country has them!\nJanuary 8: Kickstarter campaign starts and lasts 45 days.\nFebruary 22: Campaign ends, surveys are sent out.\nEarly-March: Funds received from Kickstarter and manufacturing can begin.\nEarly-April: Pins are finished! They are sent to me for grading (quality check) and packaging.\nLate-April: Your pins are sent to you! (Just in time for MerMay!)\nThese are all estimates and due to the pandemic situation delivery of the pins to myself, or to your home may be delayed. Be sure to check if you can receive packages from the US during the pandemic.\nIf you have questions, feel free to ask them! I will add any questions and their answers to the FAQ section as they are asked. If your question isn't answered there or you just need further clarification on something, feel free to contact me! You can get in touch with me through the Kickstarter messaging platform or via social media.\nEtsy\nInstagram\nTikTok: JellyJessBeans", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- If Kickstarter does not reach its goals, you won't be charged anything - your card will only be charged if we reach our goal and you don't cancel before the project end date.\n\n- Delay in pin production (due to errors or COVID-19)\n\n- Delay in shipping due to COVID-19 (USPS is experiencing delays, so please be mindful of this)\n\n- Small design changes (the overall look of the pin will stay the same but it may be necessary to make minor tweaks to metal line thickness or position of enamel to preserve the integrity of the pin)\n\n- Color differences due to Pantone matching and monitor colors\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 13 or more", "title": "1 Mermaid Pin", "descp": "Special Kickstarter pricing! save $3.50 over retail price!

There's something about weird, interesting, emergent gameplay, shared incentives, and cubes stretching across a hex map that brings me joy.\nUnsure what a cube rails game is? That's okay. Some of the most popular titles are Chicago Express, Paris Connection, Irish Gauge, Ride the Rails, and more. These are 30-60 minute games of route-building, share-purchasing, & railroad-investing.\nWhile games in the genre can sound similar, cube rails titles have a long history of doing all sorts of weird stuff: 8 to 16-hour games of logistics in Union vs Central, the meta-think of Northern Pacific's player order, and the entirely wild random share ride of Erie Railroad.\nI wanted to do something different as well.\nCard Rails is a 3-5 player, 20-30 minute cube rails game played on a deck of cards. Instead of giving you a predesignated map, players together create the landscape of the game they are playing, blocking others and bettering their own positions, all while making the tough decision to keep a card for future financial gain or to garner an immediate reward.\n CARDS INSTEAD OF A BOARD? \nBased on player count, you will have a specific number of cards in hand. Each card is different and has lots of information on it. Cards are comprised of hexes, and there are different types of hexes:\nBasic green hexes\nPurple hexes that add value to the Railroad Company\nRed hexes that let you swap out cards in your hand\nBlue Lake hexes that block where you can go\nSpecial hexes with Railroad Symbols that majorly increase the value of a Railroad Company\nA Share of the Brown Company with a Red Swap Hex and an impassable Lake Hex in the middle\nA White share conveniently located in the middle of the card with a Purple +2 Value Hex just below it. But those two 1/2 Lake Hexes could be tricky to build around.\nON YOUR TURN: Take a Share or Build Track.\nTake a Share. This is how you get points. Without shares, you don't score anything!\nDiscard a card from your hand.\nTake an available share of a company. That's it.\nHowever, you can only have 3 shares in total.\nOh, and cards remaining in your hand at the end of the game also count as shares of companies, so discard wisely.\n\nBuild Track. This is how you increase the value of companies. Without high values, you won't score enough points to win!\nDiscard* a card from your hand.\nTake 1 or 2 cubes from any available Railroads and place them on the map, expanding their lines.\n*Are you building into a 1/2 hex (like the purple above)? Then play the card you were going to discard onto the map where you're building into. The hex on the card you play has to match, but nothing else does. Rotate the card to block your opponents.\nBuild into a Purple hex or a hex with that Railroad's matching symbol? That company's value increases at the end of the game.\nBuild into a Red Swap hex? Exchange a card from your hand for any discarded card.\nHOW TO WIN\nThe game continues until all players have a certain number of cards left in hand, dependent on player count. Then players:\nTotal up the value of each Railroad\nReveal the cards in their hands\nMultiply the Railroads' values with the number of shares they have (both as cubes taken earlier and the symbols of the cards in their hands).\nThe player with the highest total wins!\nRules Translations\nJapanese\nSpanish\nFrench\nPortuguese \nCard Rails is a 54-card cube rails game that comes with 60 8mm wooden cubes.

I am only making 100 copies of Card Rails. If you missed out, I'm so sorry. If this does well, it shows me there is a desire for these small box games. More than likely, I will open up preorders for a summer release, you know, when I'm not in the middle of being a public educator in America during a pandemic.\nDue to the volatile nature of the USPS right now, and because this is a short, small project, it's only shipping to the US.

TVs aren\u2019t always convenient so we made a way to take console gaming with you wherever you are without the need of an internet connection.       \n\n\n\nAs lifelong console gamers, we know there may be some PC master race gamers who gawk at the idea of playing Mario on their powerful gaming computer.  But we say the more games we can play, on even more platforms, the better! \nSeamless console docking to your laptop. It's that simple!\nLaptops are Really Versatile Screens\nThe biggest benefit of course is to take advantage of the screen you\u2019re always carrying already.  Not one of those additional portable monitors but a laptop that we use daily for like\u2026 school, work, shopping and creative stuff. \nShadowCast completely hides in the shadows of the original Switch dock!\nLet's imagine a time before 2020... and you were waiting at an airport for a flight to board and you wanted to get a couple rounds of Smash Bros in with a friend\u2026 or two\u2026 or three. Tabletop mode is nice\u2026 but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not the most ergonomic. With ShadowCast you can easily plug your Nintendo Switch to your laptop and play on a screen over 4x the size.\nNot quite as easy as adjusting the viewing angle of a laptop, is it?\nYou Could Always use Another TV\nThere's also many situations where there just isn\u2019t a HDMI display available - many of us are happy with our laptops and integrated desktop computers. I think back to the times when I lived in a dorm room or even living abroad for brief periods where having my laptop, a PS5, and a ShadowCast would\u2019ve been amazing. \nWorks with current-gen and next-gen with up to 4K input\nAnd then there\u2019s always competing for the living room television - whether it\u2019s someone in your household streaming a whole season of the latest Netflix series or just having another gamer in the household. Oh and it also makes having a second television for multiplayer that much more convenient to set up. \nPS5 on an iMac - when a TV just simply isn't available\nOur App Makes the Difference\nAccompanying the ShadowCast is our new Genki Arcade app. We literally have made it easier than reaching for the TV remote and hitting the \"input\" button. We've designed Genki Arcade from the ground up to minimize computing resources and prioritize latency for gaming performance. Just open the app, and it'll auto detect ShadowCast and you'll be playing immediately without any settings to fiddle with.\nTV vs. ShadowCast - HDMI splitter shows a 0-0.02s difference in Smash Bros.\nGenki Arcade (left) is 50ms faster than OBS (right) and uses less than 1/3 of the CPU\nWe've developed a native Mac OS app that's optimized for both Apple Silicon and Intel processors as well as a dedicated app for Windows. Additionally, we're in the process of making a web browser version that allows you to play on shared/public computers and other systems without installing any software (compatibility will vary, for example iPadOS currently doesn\u2019t detect external video devices but we\u2019re confident it will someday!).\nWindows or Mac, we got your Animal Crossing addiction covered\n The beauty of being able to connect your gaming console to your computer means you can actually record, edit, and stream your gameplay. While it may not be at the same level as a professional grade capture card that costs 5-10x more, it\u2019s more than capable for most gameplay capturing needs while being much more flexible and easy to use across multiple platforms. \nWe're making last year's best capture cards feel a bit outdated.\nRecord To Your Heart\u2019s Content\nSure you can use the built-in video recording feature on the Nintendo Switch but that\u2019s limited to 30 seconds - that mean you'll have to rush that epic boss fight or finish that speed-run extra fast.  It's is also a pain to export and you\u2019re limited by an already small internal storage and expensive memory cards. With ShadowCast you don't have to worry about recording length and can rewatch your whole session of Among Us, add your commentary, and refine your strategy.\nWith a 30 second limit everyone is sus!\nWe\u2019ve actually created what we believe is the most simple to use, not just for playing but also to record gameplay videos.  Here\u2019s a sample of a recording of us playing on various consoles with the ShadowCast: \nThese videos are screen recordings of gameplay played off an early build of our dedicated Genki Arcade app.\nPlays Nice with Others \nWe made the Genki Arcade app to be truly simple to use, but for those that need more complexity you\u2019ll be happy to know that ShadowCast is compatible with popular professional capture card applications such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, and much more. This will allow you to capture video with detailed customizations and even overlay various webcam feeds, graphics, and animations.\nIt's pretty much compatible with everything you throw at it\n\nBegin Your Career as an Influencer\nUltimately the main reason for anyone to capture video is so that they can share it with the world. ShadowCast can easily upload your previously recorded or edited videos and even stream live to your favorite platform - whether your team Twitch, YouTube, or FaceBook, we got you covered.  \nTo maximize compatibility across as many platforms as possible, we\u2019ve disguised ShadowCast as a webcam so that it can do a few more party tricks. This means it can actually be selected as a webcam under many typical apps popular today thanks to all the remote working, including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and FaceTime - and further even supports video players like QuickTime and VLC if you don\u2019t have our app installed.\nVideo Chat Your Gameplay\nThis allows you to not only share your gameplay live with anyone, but you can actually play with your friends and see them on split screen just as if you were playing in couch co-op mode in-person.\nYou can play any of your favorite games in split-screen even without being on a couch\nDon\u2019t Settle for a Weak Webcam\nAs an additional benefit, ShadowCast works with all HDMI output devices beyond gaming consoles, including better cameras.  This means you can upgrade your video conference by swapping out your poor built-in webcam for most digital cameras, including DSLRs, camcorders, and action cameras - as long as it supports HDMI out (some cameras require a HDMI-mini/micro converter).  No more grainy, low resolution videos with poor lighting. \nKickstarter compresses these images, but hopefully you get the idea!\nThe Perfect Stay-at-Home Camera Assistant\nIt\u2019s also quite useful for situations where you just need to see what you're photographing or recording on a bigger laptop screen - no need for expensive wireless monitors! \nA better view of your DSLR in real-time so you can skip the expensive screen monitor\nWe actually had the idea of ShadowCast back in 2019 and started to collaborate with  manufacturers of the top video streaming and capture card brands. The timing was a bit too early as the components needed were overly expensive and had originally intended to make a Super Dock. Since then, we've refined the idea, dived into software and made something that we're quite excited to share here.\nMight as well make it as small as possible right?\nHere's also a video showcasing the latency between a TV and ShadowCast. We setup a powered HDMI splitter to show the screens simultaneously with the same baseline:\nPLAY\n\nSetup ShadowCast in 3 simple steps!\nIf you need a more visual adventure we've prepared a short video showing the 3 simple steps in real-time to setup ShadowCast.\nPLAY\n\nThis is really, really small\nDimensions are 25 x 52 x 9mm or 0.98\" x 2.1\" x 0.35\"\nWeighs just 10 grams (latest prototype)\nHDMI 2.0 input brings in 4K video from the latest game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4/5, and XBox Series S/X\nUSB-C output transfers to computer up to 1920x1080 @ 60fps\nGenki Arcade app requires macOS 10.12+ or Windows 7+\nIncludes USB-C 2.0 Cable 1.8m long cable\n\n\n Get more ShadowCasts if you wanted various colors or one for every console:\nGet a Covert Dock, a pocketable dock and GaN charger for the Switch and more:\nGet a Genki Audio, connects 2 Bluetooth headphones to your Switch (and other consoles) works docked, and has a port to charge your Switch:\nGet a Genki Audio Lite, a slimmer portable Bluetooth audio adapter that is optimized for the Switch and Switch Lite (does not fit PS5): \nGet a Force Field Lite, a dual magnetic enclosure grip case with vegan leather to protect your Switch Lite with compatibility for both Genki Audio and Audio Lite: \nIf you're in need of a flexible HDMI, premium USB-C 3.1 cable, or portable metal stand: \nGenki was a brand founded by three guys with a dream to challenge the gaming accessory industry to make more compelling hardware.

Thanks to the unexpected, stupendous support, PNP backers will receive W\u00fcrfel Pie, too! Thanks to a helpful friend, the rules for both games will also be available in French. \"Roll and write\" means that your game components and setup are minimal. \"PNP\" means that you will receive the PDF files for this game immediately after the campaign ends so you can start playing right away!\n The Picts, an ancient Scottish culture, were among several groups to have a hand in thwarting the Roman Empire\u2019s expansion, including the building of Hadrian\u2019s Wall. They were accomplished sailors, traders, and even pirates.\n\nStanding Stones is a blind bidding domino placement game by Benny Sperling. Yep, you read that correctly! Players will use one half of a domino to bid on an action card and the other half to complete a numbered action. The action cards will award resources, change how you use your domino, or allow you to do specific actions better. Players can even send a diplomat to visit another player\u2019s land and utilize one of their actions. Not only are you using diplomacy to do something you might be unable to do on your own, but you are also effectively blocking that action from their use that turn!\n The dominos are surprisingly tactical and wonderfully tactile. They really capture the theme for me when I stand them up on edge, looking every bit like the standing stones described in history and carved by the Picts. The stones represent your power and offer you more goods to feed into your resource converting engine.\nCheck out the rules, HERE, or watch a demonstration video below:\n If you're like me, a major reason you love roll and write games is because they usually have solitaire modes of play. We have a special second sheet which drives an AI opponent designed to make your solo experience an engaging challenge. Princess Eithne will draft dominoes against you and send her emissary to try and slow you down every turn. \nBellow, Derik shows how to setup and play the solitaire version:\n  No problem!\nThe PDF files will include dominoes you can print with the rest of the game\nWe will have thematic domino cards available for purchase through The Game Crafter very soon\nSophia makes and sells incredible hand-cast resin dominoes. \n We met her on Twitter (@thesophia_509) and were absolutely floored by the gorgeous colors and textures she gets from her resin crafts. Her amazing dominoes made this Boston based artist an easy pick for our first community spotlight. Check out her store at PHIAART.\n Because support has gone so far and above expectations, we've rearranged our publication schedule to add Mr. Sperling's first (and my favorite) roll and write game to this project FOR FREE!\n\nW\u00fcrfel means \"dice\" in German. In this game, players are pushing their luck and trying to find the exact right combination of fillings in their pie and serving it up. Dice drafting finds the players hoping for just the right roll without their opponents snatching them away! Tricks and thoughtful play abound in this dice chucker. Is it easy as pie? Time will soon tell as you dig in for that first scrumptious piece!\nCheck out the rules, HERE, or watch a multiplayer demonstration below:\n Or, watch this one for the solitaire version:\n W\u00fcrfel Pie features art and graphic design by the incomparable Jason Washburn (Talon Strikes Studio). Be sure to put eyes on his latest releases as they are also looking and playing great!\n Benny and I have a passion for gaming and would love to publish these games in a format that is both fulfilling and inexpensive. As such, we realized that offering the files for players to Print and Play (PNP) at home was a perfect way to go! In fact, you don't even need a home printer. Since you'll have the PDFs, you can print at work, at a local print shop, or (like I often do) play straight on your iPad, Surface, or other tablet device.\n This unusual format (PNP) allows us:\n    To offer a low entry point into fun games produced on a regular, frequent basis with no extra shipping costs or delays.\n     The freedom to design wild, wacky, and wonderful ideas regardless of typical commercial viability.\n     The opportunity to connect creative creators and makers with a passionate community united by similar interests.\n Honest and responsive communication.\nDelivery immediately following the close of the campaign. \nA referral to at least one indie-maker in our community.\nMore projects just like this every month.\nAnd we\u2019d love to work with you designers out there!

We will get back to you as soon as we can.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nYour pledge must be confirmed within 8 weeks of our pledge manager email to you. If you do not confirm your pledge at this time, you agree that KTBG has fulfilled its obligation to you, and your pledge will become a donation. After the 8-week window, it might still be possible to get your game shipped, based on availability. It is so difficult for us to confirm shipping to different regions of the world when our numbers are in constant flux.\n\nIt is the backer's responsibility to provide us with the correct shipping address and to ensure it is deliverable by typical methods of shipping. Unfortunately we do not ship to PO Boxes. Backers who have provided an expired address, or incorrect addresses will be charged shipping a second time to get their game to them. There is always the possibility of a refund, although the Kickstarter and pledge manager fees are non-refundable.\n\nWe reserve the right to sell our games, for the purpose of keeping our company going, at any point through the production and fulfilment process.

Choose your side, grab your dice, and get ready to roll!\nKAPOW! uses buildable dice, allowing you to add and remove dice faces during the course of battle. This makes for a super-strategic dice-battling experience. With each roll, you decide how to attack, defend, and power up your character by choosing where to place your dice. \nThe battles get more explosive with each roll and as you gain more dice and dice faces. KAPOW! is simple to learn (roll and place), but has layers of strategy as you customize your dice pool and leverage the unique powers of the KAPOW! universe\u2019s heroes and villains!\nCheck out this gameplay video:\n And here is a video showing the Solo Play mode we've unlocked:\nKAPOW! Volume 1 & KAPOW! Volume 2 are each complete two-player games. \nJust pick the one with the characters you like best, or get both by selecting the TEAM-UP Tier to be able to play 2, 3, or 4 player games!\nPorcupine Mega-Hero Unlocked for the TEAM-UP Tier!\nThis is your chance to get Kickstarter Exclusives from previous White Wizard Games Kickstarters you may have missed!\nTo order an add-on, just increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. You will be able to specify exactly which add-ons you are getting using the pledge manager after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\nNote: If you ONLY want add-ons (like the Star Realms High Alert First Strike pack) but don't want any KAPOW!, back the \"Pledge Manager Tier\"\nThis Conversion Kit is for ONLY backers who currently own the first edition of KAPOW! It contains stickers to update your Player and Super Boards, plus the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero: Halfmoon and the Kickstarter Exclusive Mega-Villain: Sawmill Jackson. When purchased along with the KAPOW! Volume 2 Tier, your Stretch Goals will be upgraded to the TEAM UP Tier Stretch Goals.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Star Realms game line.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Hero Realms game line.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Epic Card Game line.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Sorcerer game line.\nAt the start of the game you will choose a hero or villain to play. Each comes with their own \"Super Board\" showing their unique powers, starting dice pool and health. \n\nEach round, players simultaneously roll their dice and secretly place them on their Player Board and/or their Super Board to attack, defend, or power up (gaining more dice and add faces to their buildable Action dice). \n All players then simultaneously remove their player screens revealing their boards.\nPlayer Board with dice.\nPlayers deal damage equal to their attack minus their target's defense. Reduce your opponent's health to zero to knock them out and win the game!\n\n\n\nEach set of KAPOW! comes with two high quality score dials!\nThis is the 2nd edition of KAPOW!. \nThe first edition of KAPOW! was designed and published by 2 Ton Porcupine in 2019. We met the game designers at the Boston Festival of Indie Games and were intrigued by this game. It felt super fast and thrilling with every play.\nWe fell in love with KAPOW!, and brought it into the White Wizard Games portfolio. We took the 1st edition to PAX Unplugged and PAX East,  where we ran tons of demos, and sold through the entire print run. \nThe White Wizard Games and 2 Ton Porcupine teams then combined forces to improve the game play, visuals and components of this already awesome game. In this Kickstarter you can get the new-and-improved second edition of  KAPOW! Volume 1 , and the ALL-NEW KAPOW! Volume 2. \nIf you already have the first edition of KAPOW! Volume 1, it is compatible with KAPOW! Volume 2. In the future, we will post a small second edition rules conversion supplement on our website.\nPLAY\n\n Shipping\nWe will be shipping to backers directly from fulfillment centers in The US, UK,  EU, Canada, Australia, and Asia.\nOur goal is to get product to our backers as soon as possible. When product arrives at one of our fulfillment centers, we will begin the process of shipping to backers in that region without waiting for product to arrive at other hubs. This means that backers in some regions may receive product before backers in others.\nIMPORTANT - For this Kickstarter you will be charged shipping separately after this Kickstarter concludes. This will be done via the pledge manager. What you are charged for shipping will be based on our actual cost to get your rewards to you from your region's fulfillment center plus taxes/fees we were charged to get your reward into your region.\nHere is an estimate of shipping cost by region. Keep in mind, this is just an estimate and cost will increase with add-ons.\nUSA (Contiguous 48): $12-$18\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico: $22-$54\nCanada: $17 - $27\nGermany $12 - $22\nRest of EU: $16 - $29\nUK:  $14 - $18\nNorway, Switzerland, Iceland: $35-$49\nChina, Macoa, Hong Kong: $18-$28\nRest of Asia $29-$59\nAustralia $20-$30\nNew Zealand  $25-$38\nRest of the World: $49-$89\nEU Backers, please note: Your product will be shipped from within the EU. You will be charged VAT in the pledge manager.\nUK Backers, please note: Your product will be shipped from within the UK. You will be charged VAT in the pledge manager.\nUSA Backers, please note: If you are in a state where White Wizard Games is required by law to collect sales tax(currently: Florida, Massachusetts, and New York), you will be charged sales tax in the pledge manger. \nUnfortunately, we don't ship to Afghanistan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Russia, or Ukraine.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThese are exclusive items for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. Kickstarter exclusives may eventually be remade with new art and/or language for general sale.\nThe Kickstarter Exclusive version will be forever identifiable by its original art and/or language.\nNothing is final until it is printed.\nAll art, materials, card text, and packaging pictured is subject to change. The final versions you receive may not exactly match what is pictured here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are veteran publishers with a lot of experience and great products under our belt, but we are also perfectionists. We will have the printer make samples, improve on those, make more samples, round and round as many times as it takes for things to be awesome. This means we may be late with delivery.\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this Kickstarter is December 2021, but please keep in mind this is just an estimate. We will work hard to ship your game on time, but our number one concern is that this product turns out great. If we have to delay delivery to improve the product, we will.\n\nAlso note COVID-19 has thrown off our production and delivery timelines a bit. Hopefully this won't be an issue when this Kickstarter is ready to ship, but it may slow things down a bit.\n\nWe are pretty active on the comments while the Kickstarter campaign is live, so we can get your feedback and input. Once the Kickstarter campaign ends we put our noses to the grindstone working on games, so we aren't on the comments nearly as much.\n\nOnce the Kickstarter campaign ends, you can expect an update about once a month letting you know our progress.

Eduardo Baraf is at the helm of Herbaceous Pocket to ensure it delivers Herbaceous' perfect balance of simple play, interesting moments, and wonderful art in a fantastic, tiny, package.   \n Keith Matejka (Thunderworks Games) - designer of Bullfrogs, Roll Player, and Skulk Hollow - created the additional rules for solo play, loved for its easy, rapid play.  \nHerbaceous is Zee Garcia's #1 relaxing game (and Mike Disilio's #4). The new, great way to experience Herbaceous with a cup of tea.  \n\n\nThe pocket edition of the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion includes Cinnamon, Star Anise, and Peppercorn and adds a little extra spice to Herbaceous' flavorful play. \nAll Kickstarter backers who pledge for Herbaceous Pocket Edition will also receive the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion for Free. This expansion will be available for sale typically for $5 separately on BGG, at Conventions, the PFG Store, etc. It will not be packaged within the base game.     \nMy Mother Gives an Overview of How to Play the original Herbaceous - she has the prototype from our first KS.\nRodney Smith from Watch It Played teaches Herbaceous .

It is an absolutely delightful and very fast playing game that you can really do with just about anyone. This is the perfect game for high tea. \nBower's Game Corner: Herbaceous is a rock solid filler game - great family game, great game night game, great gateway game! \nHerbaceous: Pocket Edition is a Stretch Goal free campaign. We set out to make a perfect, pocket, edition of the classic game. Aside from size, card and component quality is in line with the original game.\n\n\n\nPFG worked with various partners to find a cost effective way to ship a single copy of Herbaceous: Pocket Edition internationally. Unfortunately, in a padded envelope, it is just a smidge too thick for international letter shipping. Therefore it is basically the same cost of shipping a small game (and there are a lot of additional shipping fees these days). \nHowever, since it is so small / light, it doesn't cost more to ship 2 or 3 copies in the same box. If you are outside of the US, I highly recommend buying the double or triple pack to split with a friend or give it as a gift. It is an easy, gateway game for almost anyone.\n> Herbaceous Pocket will be EU Friendly,UK Friendly, CA Friendly\nKeep up on Herbaceous\n                            - Follow Herbaceous on Facebook\nKeep up on Us\n                            - Pencil First Games, Follow Ed on Twitter\n                            - Dr. Finn's Games, Follow Steve on Twitter\n                            - BethSobel.com, Follow Beth on Twitter\n                            - Thunderworks Games, Follow Keith on Twitter\nBoard Game Aggregators\n                            - Herbaceous on BoardGameGeek.com\n                            - Herbaceous on BoardGaming.com  \nIntro Video, Header & Lifestyle Photos: More Games Please, Follow Ross on Twitter ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Herbaceous: Pocket Edition\" is Pencil First Games' fourteenth Kickstarter. \"Lift Off!

We are confident that you will get a game that you\u2019ll be proud to play AND proudly display on your game shelf.\n\nThe art and mechanics for In Too Deep are nearly complete. Once this campaign ends we will tie up loose ends and submit print files.\n\nIt is always possible that delays occur while a game is coming to fruition. This can happen for various reasons such as manufacturing issues, freight delays, and even importing the games to the various regions of the world, as we have recently experienced during this global pandemic. Although we have budgeted 11 months to bring this game to your doorstep, please know that these delays can change our timeline at various stages. Therefore our timeline is only an estimate. We are working to meet our goal to fulfill the game by the end of September 2021.\n\nWe will be using fulfillment partners from around the world so that we can ensure a fast and smooth operation. We have worked with all of these partners many times before, so we are optimistic that everything will go as planned.

Unfortunately the Endeavor: Age of Expansion campaign was delayed in some regions of the world due to Covid-19. We found ourselves just entering into our fulfillment phase when the world shut down. Although the fulfillment didn't go exactly as planned, we have been open and honest about the process, updating backers often.\n \u2022 Wide praise for production quality and gameplay development, as quality products is of the utmost importance to us. \n\u2022 Our designers and artists come to In Too Deep with many years of experience.\n\u2022 Customer service is key to creating a positive backer experience. We are here for you!\n\nOUR REFUND POLICY\n\nWe will refund your pledge within 7 days of the campaign\u2019s end, including all fees associated with the campaign. After that period, we will refund your pledge, no questions asked, minus all of the fees associated with the Kickstarter, payment processing, and our pledge manager. These fees cannot be recovered from Kickstarter/our pledge manager after two weeks of the campaign ending. This project is in CAD, therefore, refunds will be processed in CAD.\n\nWe want you to be happy! We promise to keep you in the loop every step of the way. If you have any questions, send us a direct message, email us at info@burntislandgames.com or simply comment on the campaign. We will get back to you as soon as we can.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nYour pledge must be confirmed within 6 weeks of our pledge manager email to you. If you do not confirm your pledge at this time, you agree that Burnt Island Games has fulfilled its obligation to you, and your pledge will become a donation. After the 8 week window, it might still be possible to get your game shipped, based on availability. It is so difficult for us to confirm shipping to different regions of the world when our numbers are in constant flux.\n\nIt is the backer's responsibility to provide us with the correct shipping address and to ensure it is deliverable by typical methods of shipping. Unfortunately we do not ship to PO Boxes. Backers who have provided an expired address, or incorrect addresses will be charged shipping a second time to get their game to them. There is always the possibility of a refund, although the Kickstarter and pledge manager fees are non-refundable.\n\nWe reserve the right to sell our games, for the purpose of keeping our company going, at any point through the production and fulfilment process.

The countryside is blossoming and you are in charge of it all. The last team of planners couldn\u2019t cut it, so the farmers turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this little farm into a flourishing ranching community, it\u2019s you!\nAgropolis is a standalone Sprawlopolis game. What does that mean? Well it's more of what we built with Sprawlopolis, but instead of more cities, it's farms. It adds a few new twists (livestock and feed fees), and can be played on its own or combined with Sprawlopolis in a fun new way. \nAgropolis will be the 66th game to join our growing line of Wallet Games\nA quick note on Sprawlopolis\nWe've made over 60 Wallet Games by now and it's safe to say that there's something really special about Sprawlopolis. It has been nominated for the Golden Geek Awards for Best Card Game and Best Solo Game, was voted #31 in the 1-Player Guild's People Choice Top 200 Solo Games, and has received the Dice Tower's Seal of Excellence.\nIt's been a wild ride.\nIt's gone on to have multiple sold out printings, and is currently available in many languages from our publishing partners from all over the world. Once again, a very special game and we are really excited to expand on it. \nAnd now, a look at Agropolis\nIn Agropolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new farm from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. \nFirst, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game.\n\nIn this game, you will try to keep Pig Pens adjacent to your longest road, align your Orchards into specific polyomino shapes, and keep your Cornfields on the corners of the map.\nBut  not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they  also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the score that you need to reach in order to win.\n\nThe example above is just one of many, many combinations (816 to be  exact!). Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique  combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.\n\nA look at half of the scoring conditions in Agropolis\nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing countryside, trying to score as many points as possible.\nPlayers will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.\nWatch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap and each road will cost you points in the end.\nNew to Agropolis are the three types of livestock pens, each in two different configurations.\nAnd finally there's the Feed Fee: a fun (and optional) new way to raise the goal just a little bit, making for a tougher game.\nWhen all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.\nCan you meet the demands of the farmers, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate agricultural wonder? It\u2019s time to find out!\n\nDownload the preview PNP today at PNPArcade.com!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/agropolis\nWe'll start with a little coverage of the original game, Sprawlopolis. It's been out for 2 years now and has slowly built up a stable of great reviews and video content. Here are a few of note:\nAnd now for Agropolis. \nhttps://whatsericplaying.com/2020/09/28/agropolis/\nhttps://www.dastardlydesignco.com/post/agropolis-dastardly-review-135\nhttp://www.purplephoenixgames.com/agropolis-preview/\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Combopolis. \n\nUse this expansion to create the perfect mix of city and farm zones in a single game. It adds 6 cards with scoring conditions relying on both Sprawlopolis and Agropolis, along with a few really interesting new rules (you'll draw one card from each game, choose one to play, and then discard the other). It unlocks an exciting world of new combinations!\nFor a look at the Combo game in action, here's How Lou Sees It, starting at 13:44. Feel free to watch the whole video as well. :)\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\nWe usually handle add-ons exclusively through our website, buttonshygames.com, but since Kickstarter has implemented a new add-on system, we are trying it out. \nIf you want to add any of the following to your rewards here, you can do it right in your Kickstarter pledge.

(Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level above.)\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something  extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of  the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the combo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Agropolis!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays. We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to our updated schedule.

The goal in placing habitat tiles is to create contiguous corridors by matching rivers, prairies, wetlands, forests, and mountains. Once habitats are placed, players populate them with the wildlife species that each habitat supports. Each species has their own spatial requirements and connections to one another and their ecosystem! \nCascadia is a modular, dual-layer puzzle, with variable scoring conditions that is simple to learn, but challenging to master!\nCascadia comes with a variety of spatial wildlife goals allowing you to mix and match new challenges each and every time you play! There are hundreds of unique puzzles to explore! Create stunningly beautiful terrain maps as you build your own personal environment, while competing with others for the habitats and wildlife you desire!\nKickstarter backers of Cascadia receive a set of 5 Tarot-sized Promo Wildlife Scoring Cards FREE! With the addition of these cards, players will be able to mix and match even more goals. These promo cards are a special THANK YOU to all backers for being early supporters, and will not be included with future copies of the game!\nWant to learn about Cascadia in just 1 minute? Check out Board Games In A Minute's quick overview!\nCheck out this How-to-play video by AnnaMaria of Girl's Game Shelf!\nLearn all about Cascadia with Theo from Geeky Gaymer Guy in this game overview!\nSolo Mode\nCascadia can be played solo! The solo mode elegantly simulates a 2-player game experience by turning the tile and token drafting into a cascading market. Players must make difficult decisions about which tiles and tokens to take, as each turn brings changes to what is available. The solo mode is a quick and relaxing experience that is simple to learn, and does not require the upkeep of an AI player, while still offering interesting puzzly choices and challenging thresholds to overcome.\nGavin McGruddy of MyAutoma has uploaded a great browser-based demo of the Cascadia Solo Mode, so that you can try it out for yourself! This demo will let you play the recommended starting group of Wildlife Scoring Cards! Challenge your friends to see who can get the highest score! Try it out here!\nCascadia also has a Family Variant! If you are playing with children, those new to gaming, or you just want to make the puzzle a little simpler, you can play with the included Family Variant Wildlife Scoring Card. This streamlines the wildlife scoring so that each animal scores in a similar way, reducing the number of different scoring conditions to learn, while still offering challenging puzzly gameplay. In addition to the Family Variant, the Wildlife Scoring Card features a flip side with an Intermediate Variant. This mode increases the challenge of the spatial puzzle a bit, without adding more complex scoring conditions. \nWith this range of gameplay modes, Cascadia can be tuned to offer different game experiences to different players, depending on experience level.\nCascadia provides a fantastic mix of approachable game play with strategic depth. It is a natural follow-up to our wildly successful first publication, Calico! We wanted to provide fans of gorgeous puzzly games another easy-to-teach, yet challenging-to-master game. Our collaborative team has worked hard to make Cascadia an accessible and exciting game for a range of audiences.\nWhile it can be a fun gateway experience for new gamers, it provides more experienced players with variable goals, tension of managing habitats and wildlife simultaneously, and a great mix of long-term strategy and short-term tactics. This makes the challenge and reward of each puzzle extremely satisfying! We are very proud of the gameplay and quality of the product.\nWe know that gamers love sharing the hobby with their friends and family and Cascadia is the perfect game to do just that!\nThe members of our team have years of experience working on a number of successful projects, from Point Salad to Overlord! What we think these games all have in common is their attention to detail and focus on great gameplay and amazing product quality.\nLast year, 6,724 backers joined us on the journey that made Calico possible. Since then, the game has received various accolades - from being one of the most anticipated abstract games of 2020 on Boardgamegeek.com, to praise from countless reviewers.\nThe Dice Tower gave our first game, Calico, their prestigious Seal of Approval!\nSince this is only our second published game, Cascadia does not currently have access to broad distribution in order to be available in retail stores. This means Kickstarter is your first and best opportunity to bring Cascadia home! The Kickstarter Edition comes with free promo cards that will not be part of a standard retail edition, even if the game does make it into distribution.\nOur philosophy is that our backers are major contributors to our passion and our business. We do not take this lightly, and we know there is always risk in backing a crowdfunding campaign. Because of this, we want to make sure that our backers get the best possible experience and we show our appreciation for their early support. The pledge levels you are backing this product at are set to give you the greatest possible value, as well as subsidized shipping, as our way of saying thank you for your support. You are all special, and have a big hand in the success of the game - we can\u2019t do this without all of you, and we appreciate that! \nWe also look forward to chatting with you about the process and the game overall. We are focused on you and anything we can do to improve the backer experience!\nRetailers\nCertified brick-and-mortar retailers interested in backing can reach out through our website form (www.flatout.games/cascadia-retailer). Interested retailers will be invited to our pledge manager after the campaign has ended.

We believe that we are presenting you with a complete and refined game that is fantastic, right out of the box. However, there are plenty of component upgrades and little extras that simply will not be possible without a larger initial print run. \nAs we get funding, we\u2019ll be going on a trek together! As our numbers grow, we will be reinvesting extra money into upgrading the quality of the game components and finding fun bonuses along the trail!\nThe more funding we can achieve as a team, the better everyone\u2019s copy of the game will be, so please share this project so that we can get the game \u2018to the peak\u2019! \nWE DID IT!\nThanks to all of our amazing backers, we have reached the peak and the game has been fully upgraded with all of these fantastic extras!  \nCheck out Rahdo's Final Thoughts on Cascadia!\n Check out Jeremy's Final Thoughts of Cascadia on Man vs Meeple! \nCheck out Fiona and Amy's Review at The Game Shelf!\n Check out Eric's Review at What's Eric Playing!\nSee why Cascadia earn's Steph's Super Rainbow in her review!\nCheck out Tantrum House's Overview Video with Shantelle and Sara!\nCheck out Slickerdrip's First Impressions of Cascadia!\nWatch Theo's Overview of Cascadia!\nCheck out what Our Family Plays Games has to say about Cascadia!\n Check out The Cardboard Kid's Review of Cascadia!\n Check out Eric's Cascadia Review at The Cardboard Hoard!\nCheck out Marti and Sarah's Review of Cascadia at Open Seat Gaming!\n Check out Brian's review of Cascadia at Colorblind Games!\n Check out Jonathan Liu's Review at GeekDad!\nCheck out Plumpy Thimble's Review of Cascadia!\nCheck out what Ruel had to say about Cascadia on the Projects We Love Video! \nCheck out Andy's Review at Meeple Mountain!\nCheck out Jess's preview on Gameosity!\n Check out Ken's Review at Geek-Craft!\nCheck out BJ's interview with Molly and Shawn on Board Game Gumbo!\n\n\n We know that part of the challenge of backing a Kickstarter campaign is that there is a considerable cost attached to shipping games from our manufacturing partners directly to your door. We would like to help with some of that burden, so we are offering a discount off of our quoted shipping rates to all of our backers.\nDuring our last campaign for Calico, we subsidized over $20,000 in backer shipping charges to help pitch in, and we're continuing with that trend here.\nShipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager. Using the pledge manager, you will be able to confirm your rewards, confirm your address, and finalize your order. We have included shipping estimates for some common geographical areas in the chart below. Please note that these are estimates and the actual costs of shipping could change based on many circumstances. The game will ship in 2021 and there is some uncertainty about how much global shipping will rise over the next year. We are dedicated to getting you the best possible value for shipping and are committed to shouldering a portion of the burden of shipping the game to you. We will provide customs friendly shipping to the USA, Canada, the EU, and Australia. \nBacking for additional copies of the game will offer lower per-unit shipping costs.\n\nFlatout Games is a board game design collaborative founded in 2017 by members Molly Johnson, Robert Melvin, and Shawn Stankewich. As a design collaborative, they have several designs under their belt, including the 2019 Dice Tower Family Game of the year, Point Salad (2019, AEG); Truffle Shuffle (2020, AEG); Public Market (coming 2020 from Talon Strikes Studios); and Dollars to Donuts and Abstract Academy (coming 2021 from Crafty Games).\nWhat's this 'CoLab' all about?\nIn early 2019 Flatout Games opened its doors to create The Flatout Games CoLab. The CoLab is an opportunity for the founding members of Flatout Games to team up with awesome established and emerging folks in the board game industry and make cool things together. In 2019, the CoLab brought you Calico, which had over 6,000 backers on Kickstarter, and our team is back together, with our new member, Randy Flynn on board!\nOur approach is to build the best possible experiences by involving everyone in the entire process. We strive to build passion in each of our collaborators through shared efforts and shared profits. This publication of Cascadia is a passion project of everyone involved, and we are all part of an interconnected team - we take risks and are rewarded together. We hope you will join us on our journey!\nLet's Meet the Cascadia Team!\nThe CoLab teamed up with Beth Sobel to bring you the artwork in Cascadia! You can check out her work here!\nDylan Mangini, our graphic designer makes amazing board game apparel as well. If you're looking for some sweet new threads, check out www.teebletop.com!\nFlatout Games is focused on creating innovative and elegant game experiences. We love puzzly games with simple rules, high replayability, and great tension! Players\u2019 options and decisions should be complex, rules should not be. We love products that are immaculately detailed, and designed with clarity and simplicity at the forefront.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to people who have helped make Cascadia the amazing game that it is today!

We would love to bring it to life, and with your help, we can make that dream a reality!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has its risks - there are plenty of circumstances within and outside of our control that could come up. Since this is our second crowdfunding campaign, we have the experience of a successful campaign under our belt. We have also done our homework and been actively engaged in reaching out to others who have been successful. We are Superbackers ourselves, proving our commitment to the amazing community on Kickstarter, and we have followed along on many other campaigns. In addition, the members of our CoLab have been involved with a number of successful campaigns in the past, so we feel we have positioned ourselves with the knowledge and experience required to make sure things go as smoothly as possible.\n\nWe have already done a considerable amount of the legwork involved in getting this game made and getting it into your hands. We have completed design and development, nearly completed artwork, and lined up manufacturing and logistics. We have a plan to get the game completed to the highest degree of quality and get it in your hands as soon as possible.\n\nWe are also committed to being open and transparent about our process and the challenges and triumphs associated with it.

We take great pride in the quality of our games, since we know that a well-made game is one that will stay on your shelf and provide many hours of enjoyment without becoming dated and ending up as waste.\nReusability and recyclability\nAt Flatout Games, we strive to use reusable and recyclable materials whenever possible. This production of Cascadia uses cardboard and wooden components that not only look and feel great, but are easier to recycle. We also try to avoid the use of plastics in packaging and shipping materials in order to reduce our impact.\nSustainable materials\nFor the production of Cascadia we chose to go with simple materials (cardboard and wood) because they are relatively easy to source and they can be produced with very little waste byproduct. Avoiding using plastics that consume fossil fuels and focusing on renewable resources like forestry products helps us to reduce our impact.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe shipping and fulfillment of this project will be carried out by multiple regional fulfillment centers around the world to reduce the overall energy expended to get games to backers.

Through careful planning and placement, the aim is to make the most money from selling your buildings.\nThe city is populated by increasing numbers of people (wooden meeples), each with their own preferences. These hipsters, tourists, shoppers, and parents increase the value of any buildings they occupy, and they move from street to street as they are scored. You'll need to locate your buildings carefully and attract the right crowd to earn more than your opponents!\nLay tiles and influence people!\nSome of the building tiles found in Streets.\n\nYou can download the draft rules here. The final rules will look much nicer!\nStreets is really easy to teach! If one person knows the rules, you can open the box and be playing in less than 5 minutes. Here's the basics:\n1. On your turn, place a building into the city.\nAdd meeples according to the colour and number of icons at the bottom of the tile you played. You'll also add an Ownership Token in your player colour.\n2. When a Street is Enclosed, all buildings in it are sold for money.\nCalculate how much each building is worth based on the Valuation in the top right corner, adding $1 for every meeple.\n3. Meeples move to new buildings.\nThe player who enclosed the street moves the meeples on it to new buildings of matching colours on unenclosed streets. Meeples who can't move stand up and get FOMO (fear of missing out), and they'll move immediately to matching buildings when new ones are built.\n4. Earn the most money to win!\nThere are lots of opportunities to create scoring combos, and to profit from other players' buildings. The number of meeples in play increases as the game goes on, raising the stakes and the tension! Though the game is suitable for new gamers, these dynamic mechanics create a lot of depth that seasoned gamers will enjoy.\n The Business expansion makes use of the icons on the top left of every building tile. Each building has one or more Home, Shop, Restaurant, Recreation, or Wild icon on it.  \nBusiness tokens and some of the tiles that generate them.\nWhenever a street is scored, every player with a building in that street gets to take a business token matching the icon on one of their buildings. At the end of the game there's a $10 bonus for the player with the most tokens of each type, and $10 for every set of all four tokens.  \nA simple addition to the game, but a big change to the way you'll play! Included in every copy of the game are seven Consultant cards (70x120mm tarot size) which give each player a really powerful and unique special ability. Deal one Consultant card out at random to each player during setup and you're good to go! \nSix of the seven Consultants that come with the game.\nBoth of the expansions are optional, and we recommend playing without either of them the first time you play, or if you're playing with a group that prefers simpler games. The expansions add extra crunch to the decisions you'll make as you play!\nRahdo's reaction to playing with the expansions.\nA game of Streets in progress.\nStreets can be played by one player versus an AI opponent called The Grifter, using a simple set of rules and no extra components. You can find more information on this in the draft rulebook.\nYou can watch a full solo mode playthrough video on our YouTube channel.\n\nMore building tiles - they're the same in standard and deluxe editions.\nWe've taken great care to ensure that Streets offers excellent value for money right out of the box, and we've come up with a number of cosmetic and usability upgrades to both editions of the game that we can include even at the minimum funding goal. Rather than throw everything at you at once, we'll reveal these additions as the campaign goes on. Since we've already budgeted for them, they won't be tied to the overall funding level, but we will make you work for them :D\nNew artwork will be revealed below...\nThe more copies of the game we order from the factory, the cheaper they become. We can use those savings to add some cool new content for backers at no extra charge. The more backers who join us, the more extras we can include for everyone.\nIn short, more backers means more free stuff for everyone! The free promo pack is our way of saying thankyou to backers for supporting this campaign. After the campaign it will only be available direct from Sinister Fish Games at an appropriate price plus shipping.*\n* The deluxe edition and promo pack will be available in limited numbers from retailers who back this campaign, but it will not go into general distribution, and there will be no restocks.\nThere are two versions of Streets; standard and deluxe. They both contain exactly the same gameplay content, but the deluxe edition has some upgraded components.\nScreen printed wooden ownership tokens (same in deluxe and standard editions).\n\nDeluxe wooden money tokens.\nDeluxe meeples.\nDeluxe business tokens.\nThe creators of these videos were paid to showcase the rules and components of Streets. These are not reviews of the game.\nIf we reach our funding goal, all pledge information will be passed over to our partners at BackerKit after the Kickstarter campaign ends. Their pledge management system allows backers to pay for shipping, to confirm or update their shipping address, upgrade or downgrade their pledge, and add extra items.\nIt is necessary for every backer to confirm their details in the pledge manager in order to receive their rewards. We'll give clear instructions on how to do this when the time comes. It's quite simple, you'll just need to keep an eye on our updates after the campaign ends.\n We are making the previous game from Sinister Fish and Haakon Gaarder - the Golden Geek Award nominated Villagers - available as part of this campaign. You can pledge for it (and the Kickstarter Expansion Pack) alongside the standard or deluxe copy of Streets by selecting the relevant pledge level here on Kickstarter. Villagers will also be available as an add-on item in the pledge manager.\nVillagers was a nominee in the Golden Geek Awards for Best Card Game of 2019\nBackers in the United Kingdom will receive their copy of Villagers and the Kickstarter Expansion Pack in October / November 2020 as we have stock in our UK warehouse (aka Dave & Carly's garage). Shipping is free for this.\nBackers outside the UK will have their copy of Villagers and Expansion shipped at the same time as Streets, with shipping charged separately in the pledge manager. See below for shipping cost estimates.\nWe are not reprinting the Villagers playmat or Coin Chest at this time.\nWe will charge backers for shipping after the campaign ends, closer to the time we actually ship. We'll do this via BackerKit, our pledge manager.\nInternational shipping prices are currently volatile because of the pandemic, and there are surcharges applying to many destinations. We want to minimise the chance of the final price we pay being significantly different to the price we quote now. By doing this we'll be able to give backers the best possible shipping price. On top of that, we will subsidise shipping by \u00a33 (about $4 / \u20ac3.50) for every backer, and UK shipping will be free. Wherever practical, we will pay local taxes and import costs. See the table below for more information.\nTo help us offer the best prices to our backers, we will send rewards from various shipping hubs around the world. Everything is subject to change, but our current plan is this:\n Sinister Fish Games (that's us!) will ship to the UK.\n Meeple Logistics will ship to all EU countries, plus Iceland and Switzerland.\n Pick & Pack Logistics will ship free of tax and customs to Canada\n Grimfield Games will ship free of tax and customs to Norway.\n Flat River Group, our retail distributor, will ship to the USA.\n VFI Asia will ship everywhere else.\nWe are investigating a better option for Canada - the deluxe version exceeds the import tax limit, which we'd overlooked previously. \nDue to pandemic related restrictions, we cannot currently offer shipping to India. We hope the situation there improves soon.\nWe will deliver the game as soon as is practical for each region. Not everyone will receive their pledges at the same time. We will delay the retail release until pledges have been shipped, but we can't guarantee that everyone will have received their pledge before the game appears in stores. \nIf your reward is lost or returned to us we will send a one-time replacement free of charge. If your reward is returned to us due to you submitting an incorrect shipping address, we will ask you to cover the cost of reshipping it. Lost rewards (that are not returned to us) with incorrect shipping information cannot be reshipped or refunded. Before your reward is shipped you will be able to check that your address information is correct and to update it if necessary.\nStreets is available to play online right now via Tabletop Simulator, which is available on Steam. You can play solo, or with up to 4 other players. Just follow these links and subscribe so you can download the necessary files.\n1-2 players\n3-5 players\nSetup instructions and a link to the rulebook are provided.\nStreets is available to back at retail level by physical stores only. Retailer information can be found here.\nWe recognise the urgency of the climate crisis, and we want to try and minimise our environmental impact. We are planning to use FSC certified wood products in Streets, and we aim to partner with an established tree planting organisation to overcompensate for the greenhouse gases generated by the manufacture and transport of Streets. We will share more details later in the project.\nThe price of the game includes a small allowance for the increased cost of FSC wood.\nAll tree planting expenses will be borne by Sinister Fish Games.\n If you'd like to keep up with Sinister Fish, we can be found at the following:\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYouTube\nTwitch\nDiscord\nAnd specifically for Streets:\nStreets Facebook Group\nStreets on BoardGameGeek\nStreets on SinisterFish.com\nSinister Fish Games is a small family business with one full-time employee, one part-time, and one toddler. We will do our best to answer support requests during office hours (GMT) on weekdays. We can't guarantee an immediate response, but we answer every message and we will get to you.

As long as we remember that there's a real person behind every username, and treat each other with respect, then it's all good.\nStreets has been a labour of love for the following humans:\nHaakon Hoel Gaarder is the game designer, artist and graphic designer behind Streets and Villagers. He has a background as an animator, specialising in character design and infographics, using animation to communicate complex subjects in a fun and simple way. Haakon lives in Oslo Norway, and loves exploring large cities. This love of urban life inspired him to make Streets.\nHaakon has recently started using Instagram, where he shares behind the scenes content and bits of trivia about his work.\nDave is the owner of Sinister Fish Games, publisher of Streets and Villagers. He has had various careers, more recently in print & signmaking, graphic & web design, and making leather armour & props for film & cosplay. He has been running Sinister Fish full time since 2017. He lives in Lincoln, England, with his partner, their son, and one and a half cats. \n Carly plays an important role in the day-to-day running of Sinister Fish, including customer support, event organisation, planning, and office management. A keen negotiator, she once talked her way free-of-charge out of a Vodafone contract with 18 months left on it. She lives in Lincoln, England, with her partner, their son, and one and a half cats.\nFollow our progress on KickTraq!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a good working relationship with our Chinese manufacturer, Whatz Games, who we've been working with for several years.\n \nAs with any Kickstarter project, the usual risks apply.

Players take the role of fantasy heroes: facing challenges, adventuring through the realm of Ulos, and making decisions that change the story \u2014 and the kingdom \u2014 forever.\nAfter a thousand years of peace, Dragul armies raided from the north, prompting you and every other loyal citizen of Nalos to sign up as soldiers of the King\u2019s Guard. The armies of Nalos fought long and hard against the North\u2019s monstrous generals and their minions, finally turning the tide of the Dragul Invasion.\nIn each of the game's 12 storybooks, you\u2019ll be asked to make choices, complete skill checks, and fight battles that will permanently alter the world of Ulos for that adventure and in future adventures. You\u2019ll find new allies, make enemies, and uncover secrets that will change the world around you.\nWhatever choices you make, someone will remember \u2014 and respond.\nChoose from one of 21 pregenerated characters, or import a favorite Roll Player character and take them on a heroic journey. Each character brings unique attributes, starting cards, class abilities, and backstories to your adventure.\nPregenerated Characters\nImporting Characters from Roll Player\nRoll Player Adventures does NOT require the Roll Player base game or any of its expansions to play, though it\u2019s possible to import characters generated in Roll Player using any number of its expansions. Do you have a favorite Obnoxious Saurian Fighter who grew up as a Street Urchin from your last game of Roll Player? Bring them along\nEach of the 17 races and 36 classes have unique portraits and class abilities in Adventures!\nConvert your attribute scores and use them to build dice pools during your adventure!\nEvery market card from Roll Player has a new dice-manipulating counterpart in Roll Player Adventures!\n Note: Roll Player products will be available individually in the pledge manager.\nRoll Player Adventures has 11 adventure books that form a continuous campaign, and 1 infinitely replayable sidequest that can be played at any time. In a session of Roll Player Adventures, you\u2019ll explore a new area of the world of Ulos, represented by a unique adventure map. As your party travels around the map, you\u2019ll read aloud from that adventure\u2019s storybook and choose how you\u2019ll approach each encounter.\nDuring your adventure, you'll encounter strange creatures, solve puzzles and mysteries, and discover new areas of the map to explore.\nRoll Player Adventures blends an immersive branching narrative with cooperative skill checks and combat encounters. These dice placement puzzles echo the satisfying, puzzle-solving features of other Thunderworks Games hits such as Roll Player and Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale. In each combat or skill check, players manage their resources to fill dice slots with dice of specific colors and numbers. With clever play and the players can attempt to overcome the obstacles on the path of adventure.\n\nSpend stamina from your character\u2019s attributes to add specific colors of dice to the dice pool: \nThen play cards from your hand to manipulate the dice and solve the puzzle:\nIf you lose a combat or fail a skill check, there\u2019s no replaying a scenario or rolling up new characters. You now need to deal with the consequences of your failure, and see how the world changes in response. Even death is a new adventure \u2014 with its own 10-encounter storyline.\nRoll Player Adventures has several systems dedicated to remembering the results of your actions. Together, they represent an incredible amount of responsiveness from the game world to player choices. Importantly, these systems also can interact with each other, giving nuance to relationships \u2014 you may choose to gain a temporary ally in an adventure, but be regarded by them differently because you\u2019ve offended their faction in the past.\nAt the end of each adventure, you\u2019ll spend your earned gold and experience points to advance your characters, improving your party for the next adventure. There are 100's of unique abilities to discover and many ways to specialize.\nWant to try Roll Player Adventures for yourself? You can play through a draft of Adventure 1: Battle at Blacklake on both Tabletopia (Free!) and Tabletop Simulator. \n Rahdo Runs Through - Runthrough\nThe Nefras's Judgement expansion is available as part of the Immortal Knight and World of Ulos pledge levels. In this expansion, Nefras, the Snake of Years, will judge each character in your party as they make personal choices that are woven through the storyline of your campaign. Uncover your backstory and choose your alignment in Roll Player Adventures: Nefras\u2019s Judgement.\nDuring a campaign including Nefras's Judgement, each character in your party plays through one unique backstory quest that spans across multiple adventure books.\nFor example, if a character in your party had a \u201cDetective\u201d Backstory, you might slowly uncover clues about a murder, scattered through the adventures in the main campaign, finally either solving the mystery or sending an innocent insectoid to Kulbak prison in the storyline's climax.\nWhen setting up the Nefras\u2019s Judgement expansion at the start of a Roll Player Adventures campaign, players can use the backstory provided with a pregenerated character, or they can import the backstory and alignment from a character built using Roll Player.\nAs with previous projects, we'll be shipping all pledge levels from reputable fulfillment partners around the world. This project is EU, UK, CA, and AU friendly. This means that rewards bound to those regions ship from within their respective regions so backers in those regions will not pay any VAT, customs, or duties on their games upon arrival at their address. Outside of these areas, we cannot guarantee friendly shipping.\n    ------ PLEASE NOTE: SHIPPING IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE PRICE ------\nShipping will be charged in the pledge manager at the conclusion of this Kickstarter project based on pledge level and region.

Here's how you play!\nThe Thunderworks team has been working on this project for over three years. The scope is bigger and more ambitious than any project we've done in the past. It's a project born out of love for both narrative adventure games and the passion players have for the other games in the line. We are excited to bring such a big game to you from a small team.\nBut, printing a board game with a scope this large is expensive, and Thunderworks Games is a small company. Without the help of backers on Kickstarter, Roll Player Adventures simply will not exist.\nWe need your support to make this game a reality. The design is complete. The art is complete.

I've outlined some common areas of risk in boardgame projects and how I've done my best to address them.\n\n> Artwork: All the artwork for the game is complete, with the exception of any images added due to achieving stretch goals or any last minute tweaks before sending the final files off to the manufacturer.\n\n>Development: All twelve books of Roll Player Adventures are complete and have been extensively playtested. We are currently playtesting the full campaign with final art and most of its graphic design to make sure everything is just right before we send the game into final layout for manufacturing.\n\n> Component Quality: I've worked with and built a great relationship with one of the best game manufacturers around, Panda Game Manufacturing (www.pandagm.com). Their proven track record on games like Eclipse, Terra Mystica, Pandemic, Belfort, and Mice & Mystics, proves they make great games with a high standard to quality. They've printed all Thunderworks titles to date.\n\n> Delivery Timeline: Unexpected delays out of my control can always occur (i.e. component shortage, manufacturer issues, customs delays, etc...). For the production schedule of Roll Player Adventures, I've used conservative estimates to account for unknowns and bumps in the road.\n\n> Fulfillment: I have received multiple estimates and will be working with established fulfillment companies that have proven track records for delivering quickly and efficiently all over the world.\n\n> Eighth Project: Even though this is my eighth Kickstarter project, I have continued to spend endless hours researching Kickstarter as well as participating in many Kickstarters. I have done my best to foresee and minimize any obstacles or stumbling blocks.\n\nIn addition, in my life outside of this campaign, I have over a decade of project management experience on large-scale software projects. I will continue to leverage that experience and apply it to this project by anticipating issues and sidestepping hurdles that may arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "Make your mark on the future of Ulos!\n- This and all other pledges will get you access to the pledge manager after the close of the campaign.\n- Shipping to be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager.

Evidence can be put towards individual success by investigating the three Chapters that make up the game's timeline, or towards a shared pool of Evidence dedicated to foiling the Final Plot itself and preventing the Syndicate from dominating New Dawn City for good. \nEvidence is filed into the Chapter for personal gain, or into the Final Plot to foil the Syndicate's plans as a group!\nEach turn, you'll hook into the mind of a criminal, then you'll gain Grip with every criminal you control. As your Grip increases with criminals, you'll gain access to their unique skills, and develop the stamina to extend your turn and accomplish more. \nA player hooks into the Smuggler, and gains enough Grip to activate its unique Skill!\nNext you'll put your hooked criminals into motion in the zones of New Dawn City. You can move criminals about, transport crucial items, activate the unique zone powers if the coast is clear, trigger powerful criminal skills if you have enough Grip, manipulate the unsuspecting local security forces, and engage in other activities designed to bring you ever closer to the heart of the Syndicate. \nThere are lots of possibilities... the game provides a deep toolkit for achieving your goals!\nYou'll need to put everything in place for the Syndicate's criminals to carry out their nefarious deeds. When everything has been arranged and a crime is committed, you'll earn Intel and Evidence, and unlock more serious crimes in that storyline. Your presence in the minds of the criminals lets you influence their approach... dangerous behaviour will earn you more Intel on the Syndicate's operations, but it also destroys Evidence and earns you more Dilemmas. \nSide Crimes are simpler but less rewarding. Story Crimes get more complex and more rewarding the further into a storyline the group pushes!\nDilemmas are tricky; they come with tempting rewards, but also dangerous Corruption. At the end of each Chapter you'll be forced to choose half of your dilemmas to keep as Permanent Corruption... the ones you keep could be richly rewarding, but the best rewards come with the most corruption! Losing control could drive you over to the Syndicate's side if you're not careful... and it's hard to know for sure if you are the most corrupt agent!  \nYou want big rewards but can you risk the corruption? That's the dilemma!\n At the end of the game, the least-corrupt player earns a bonus. The most-corrupt player has gone in too deep, and will suffer a massive penalty... if the plot was foiled! If enough of the needed Evidence has been filed, the plot is foiled and the In Too Deep player suffers the price of their corrupt ways. If the plot wasn't foiled however, that player reaps the benefits of their troubling tactics with no penalty at all. All players cash in their Dilemmas, and when the dust settles, the player with the most Intel wins the game! \nReady for more?

Hit the button below to be taken to the game's Workshop page. Please note that you will need to own a copy of Tabletop Simulator in order to download and play. \n_______________________________________________________________\nIn the world of Prisma Arena, every hero - like every player - is unique. We've worked hard to ensure that you'll be able to see yourself in the characters you can create, so before your first game of Prisma Arena, you will personalise your Hero\u2019s appearance. Using removable stickers, you'll have a variety of options open to you such as new faces, haristyles and much more. While all Heroes start out with the same ability, as you train in the Arena and rise through the ranks, you will unlock new uniforms and incredible Prisma Powers that you can mix and match to suit to your personal preference and playstyle. We can't wait to see who you bring to the table!\n_______________________________________________________________\nWe've worked with some of our favourite content creators to see what their thoughts are on Prisma Arena!  \nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nAt Hub Games, we are determined to always offer the very best product from the start. We\u2019re also very aware that games are luxury items, so want to ensure the widest audience possible by offering our range at the best price possible. Everything you find inside the Prisma Arena box is the best that it can be, meaning that we\u2019ve got no need for Stretch Goals or Kickstarter Exclusives. You simply get a great game, manufactured to our exacting standards, earlier than anyone else, at a price that\u2019s lower than you\u2019d see in a store. This way everyone gets everything, and folks who miss out on the Kickstarter don\u2019t have to worry about getting less content in a game. We\u2019ve been working on Prisma Arena for over two years, so we want everyone to enjoy the full experience!\nSo, what do you get inside a copy of Prisma Arena? \n  _______________________________________________________________\nWe're keeping the Reward Levels as simple as possible for this campaign. If you want to pick up a copy of Prisma Arena, that's \u00a325 (approximately $30 USD / \u20ac28, or however much that converts to where you are in the world). If you want an additional copy, great! Each one costs the same amount - \u00a325. We'll then work out your shipping costs in the pledge manager when we're planning delivery. And if you're not all-in, no worries! Backing us at the \u00a31 level gives you access to all news and updates throughout the campaign, as well as the pledge manager later in the year.\nCertified Retailers will be able to pick up cases of Prisma Arena at a reduced rate. For more information on this, please see the Details for Retailers section below! \n_______________________________________________________________ \nWe are working alongside experienced shipping companies and have found pricing that we believe to be the most competitive around. Although you will not be charged for shipping during the Kickstarter for Prisma Arena, please be aware that the costs for shipping will be added the pledge manager after the campaign. The estimated costs are found below. If you require information on pricing for a specific location, please get in touch to ask!\n  ______________________________________________________________\nHub Games is determined to support Brick and Mortar stores by offering them the possibility of pledging for a retailer package. This includes a free demo copy of the game and an organised play kit for each case ordered, so you'll receive five copies for sale, one for demo, and a Launch Kit. The Launch Kit is a release celebration event, meant to not only provide a space for Kickstarter backers to enjoy their new game, but most importantly to introduce the game to new players who missed out on the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe kit will be available to both retailers who support the campaign and those who will purchase the game through traditional distribution networks.\nFor more information about the retail pledge, the launch kit and organised play events, please contact corina@wearehubgames.com \n_______________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPrisma Arena has been in development for over two years at the point of campaign launch, and has been tested by the widest variety of players available, from first-timers to experienced gamers.

Never have an itchy or irritated butthole again from improper cleaning with toilet paper.  \nYes there\u2019s other bidet attachements out there, but we spent hundreds of hours watering our butts to fine tune the angle, stream and pressure of the Narsehole for your tender areas.   \nIf Your Butt Could Talk -  \u201dImagine a life where im never irritated. You rarely see me, but you can feel me when I\u2019m upset.  Please start using water, it\u2019ll make me happy and when I\u2019m happy, you\u2019re happy.\u201d \n How does Narsehole connect? It attaches in-between the seat and bowl and connects to the fresh water supply coming out of the wall via an included hose splitter.\n\n Perfect for any occasion: You can activate the individual nozzles for the starfish or the clam, or both nozzle sprays at the same time for the dreaded diarrhea days. This will take care of your whole butt and restart you back in the game of life as if nothing was ever wrong in the first place. Side note - thought about what you wanna get your grandparents for Christmas this year? (wink)\nWhat\u2019s the \u201cClam\u201d for? If you happen to find yourself in ownership of a vagina on your frontside\u2026set the directional knob to the \u201cClam\u201d, turn the water on low:) Water is an effective way to remove bacteria and prevent UTIs. \nWhat is the temperature of the water? It\u2019s cool/room temperature water. It\u2019s kinda like splashing your face with water in the morning...a nice little wake me up :) \n How do I poop with the Narsehole? Poop, play on your phone for a while to make sure it\u2019s all out, turn the direction knob to the \u201cstarfish\u201d and the water pressure knob to desired spray, turn water off, pat dry with a few squares of toilet paper or hand towel, and you\u2019re done. \n What types of toilets can Narsehole attach to? Almost any toilet. Everything is included in the box to connect to the common household toilet.\nDoes the Narsehole require electricity? Nope. It\u2019s powered entirely by your fresh water supply. That means if your power goes out you can still clean your butt! \nNEW - Two Handle Options!\n Spray Nirvana: The Narsehole has a spray stream with separate nozzles and pressure controls for both the starfish and the clam. Trust us, all sprays are not created equal, we spent hundreds of research hours watering our butts to fine tune the Narsehole\u2019s stream in order to take the best possible care of your tender areas! Wanna roll the dice and save five bucks on Amazon? You\u2019re risking getting either a small and pointy spray (ouchie!) or the super soaker that gets your entire bathing suit region wet (might as well just hop in the shower).\nPLAY\n\nNo More Wiping Yourself Raw!\nNo More Dingleberries!\nNo More Aggravating Your Hemorrhoids Before the DMB Concert!\n\nWould you use toilet paper if you pooped out your belly button?  No? then why is it good enough for your butt? \n Toilet paper is a 38 billion and 10 million tree a year industry in the U.S. Save money, the environment and your butt. \nDay of the Nareshole Shoot\nWe\u2019re four dudes that used water to clean our butts for the first time in our mid 30\u2019s. It was amazing, faster, more efficient and it left us feeling clean and fresh! We were shocked. \nOur goal -  Is to red pill everyone on water over toilet paper and to make sure their first experience is with a spray that\u2019s gentle but firm, if they need it to be.  \nBelow is our estimate for standard shipping charges, with $5 \u2013 $20 decuted (Nareshole\u2019s covering percentage of shipping to keep the cost down) Because this estimate is based on our expected volume for this campaign, it could be subject to change depending on the final result. These charges may also change if you add additional products during the survey process. We want to keep this process as simple and accurate as possible, while avoiding any false promise or unexpected charges.\nCustoms, Duty, and VAT charges: In some cases, international backers outside of the USA will be required to pay additional customs, duty, and/or VAT charges. We cannot control this additional charge, and it will be the backers responsibility to cover once they receive the selected reward. Any questions regarding this additional charge should be addressed directly with the backers customs office.\nQ&A\n1. How does Narsehole connect? It attaches in-between the seat and bowl and connects to the fresh water supply coming out of the wall via an included hose splitter.\n2. What types of toilets can Narsehole attach to? Almost any toilet. Everything is included in the box to connect to the common household toilet.\n3. How do I use the Narsehole? Poop, play on your phone for a while to make sure it\u2019s all out, turn the direction knob to the \u201cstarfish\u201d and the water pressure knob to desired spray, go back to playing on your phone while moving your butt around a little bit to be thorough, turn water off, pat dry with a few squares of toilet paper or hand towel, and you\u2019re done.\n4. Is it sanitary for multiple people to use the same Narsehole? Yes. Narsehole is designed to be clean and hygienic with a self-cleaning, auto-retracting nozzle and full-length nozzle guard. i.e. it\u2019s a million times more sanitary then using toilet paper.\n5. What\u2019s the \u201cClam\u201d for? If you happen to find yourself in ownership of a vagina on your frontside\u2026set the directional knob to the \u201cClam\u201d, turn the water on low:) Water is an effective way to remove bacteria and prevent UTIs.\n6. Does the Narsehole require electricity? Nope. It\u2019s powered entirely by your fresh water supply. This also makes it easier to install.\n7. What is the temperature of the water? It\u2019s cool/room temperature water. It\u2019s kinda like splashing your face with water in the morning...a nice little wake me up :)\n8. What\u2019s the difference between the Narsehole and the less expensive options on Amazon?  The cheaper ones have one nozzle (not worth your time) and 90% of dual nozzles are $70-$150.  We tested all the (direct from China) Amazon models and the truth is, you get what you pay for \u2014 if you\u2019re used to boxed wine, you\u2019ll still think it\u2019s good \u2014 but the Narsehole is for people who like that fine wine! We\u2019re not judging, but ask yourself, which person are you?\nDesign/Prototype - Our main focus on design was finding the perfect spray for both the starfish and clam.  Testing hundreds of different angles and hole patterns, we finally found the perfect spray and are excited to bring it to a butt near you coming this July:)!!\nInitial Design Scetch\nDesign Process & Progression of Nozzles\nPrototyping Nozzles for Perfect Spray", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe supplier has been established, vetted, and final samples have been tested and approved.

I picked the ones that resonated with me. I'm so glad the There is no planet B pin was offered, I've been watching it for a long while but never got to buy it. The Sashimi one is so small and cute!\"\n\"The bag is huge. Loved the pockets. I'm kind of hesitating using it for groceries ... it looks good this way, I really don't want to stain it.\"\n\"The lanyard feels nice. I hope I get the opportunity to use it.\"\n\"I just received my pins and bag and all I can say is WOW! The pins are just gorgeous! I'm so happy with them. I'll be proud to display them in my collection. The pin is stunning. And I am so, so happy I decided to get the tote bag !!! It's incredible! Nice, heavy canvas, zips and pockets and it's HUGE! It looks extremely well made and will last for years and years. Thank you so much for such beautiful items. I'll be backing any of your future Kickstarter campaigns, that's for sure!\"\n\"Such an amazing artist!Was able to pick them up cause I was local. They look even better in person. Can't wait to display them in my collection it's just perfect!\"\n\"The tote is such good quality can't wait to use it either!\" \n Timings \nPin & tote manufacturing at this rate will be complete by end of June for a Mid July arrival to me.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere's always a risk in delays when manufacturing as there is a lot of hand work. Things that could go wrong include: too many seconds quality pins, slow shipment, manufacturer errors, etc. However, I've worked with my manufacturer for years of designs and they are very prompt and produce great pins! I don't see many things happening that would delay the production for too long and if there are any errors they have always promptly remedied with a fixed batch.\n\nThere may be minor differences in the actual pin vs what you see in my mockups due to hand enamel filled precision, color matching. These should just be small changes though and the pins will be close to what you see here as much as possible!\n\nPackages may get lost without the right address, so please double check your address to be sure that it's correct! If packages do not arrive over 2 weeks past estimation, I will ensure I correctly make a solution to get the product to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 20 or more", "title": "\u2661 ANY 1 PIN", "descp": "\u2764 choose (1) pin from the unlocked pin collection or Add-Ons.

It's Free, featuring over 20 spells, and the entire Day 1 from the final game! Available for Windows and Mac. \nA young girl named Vasilisa, destined to become a witch, decides to throw her fate away and marry her beloved - but that dream is shattered when her betrothed dies under mysterious circumstances. \nAching for her lost love, Vasilisa seeks out Black Book - a demonic artifact, said to be powerful enough to grant any wish to the one who uncovers all 7 of its seals.\nStep into the shoes of a devil-fighting sorceress, and travel the province of Cherdyn to unseal the Black Book - and solve the plights of people in need.\nThe game takes place in a setting unlike any other - a 19th century countryside, where Slavic myth neighbors reality.\nFantastical creatures, elemental spirits and demons exist alongside ordinary folk. Some of them are evil, some are not. Yet, only a select few are able to perceive, let alone communicate with the otherworldly beings. \nVodyanoy - a male water spirit\nBlack Book features a wide variety of mythological creatures: from some that you may recognize, like Chorts and Drowners - to other, more obscure ones.\nWe took extra effort to achieve authenticity in our portrayal of these creatures - using old texts of classical myths, illustrations from folk tale books, and every other source we could find as reference. \nLeft: Vasilisa the Beautiful, 1899 by Ivan Bilibin\nBlack Book is a unique opportunity to get acquainted with the world of Northern Slavic mythology, shaped by its history and tradition. The game was developed by the people who grew up with these folk tales, and consulted with historians and anthropologists to make sure the game\u2019s narrative accurately represents the beliefs of their ancestors.\nEvery Chapter's main goal is for Vasilisa to unlock a Seal of the Black Book - and to do so, she will have to challenge the mysteries of the otherworld.\nBattle demons and other mythological beings, help ordinary townsfolk with their troubles, and solve the mystery of the all-powerful Black Book! \nBattle otherworldly forces using a unique card-based combat system. Each turn, Vasilisa has to compose a spell by putting together multiple cards - each with their own special effect. \nSome cards work better together - so be sure to create a perfect combo for maximum damage!\nThroughout the game, you'll always be adding new cards to your arsenal. There are multiple ways to obtain new cards - from buying them at the shop and getting them as rewards for quest completion, to getting them as drops from enemy encounters.\nCollect different cards and build decks that fit specific situations! \nOn her journey, Vasilisa will meet some people (and not just people), who wish to aid her in her cause - each with their unique backstory and ability, that will definitely be helpful in battle. \nTo grow stronger, Vasilisa sometimes relies on the aid of Demons, whom she sends out to do her bidding. Recruit demons, and pick out ones with the right abilities to get the job done properly.      \nIn Black Book, we do our best to emphasize the dark atmosphere of mythological stories with the help of music and sound effects. In the game we combine electronic music and folk musical instruments. We studied authentic recordings of folk songs - some tunes were recorded hundreds of years ago, and will now be reborn in our game.\nMikhail Shvachko is the composer of the game, breathing life into the world of Black Book with his music. Previously, he did the music for our previous game, The Mooseman - which can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/mikhail-shvachko/sets/themoosemanost\nIf you want to get a taste of what to expect when it comes to the unique sound of Black Book, you can find some of his latest work here: \nAside from Mikhail's work, in Black Book you'll hear live choral music, performed by the student choir of the Perm Regional College of Arts and Culture.\nIn Black Book, you'll unlock new songs as you explore additional locations and do side quests. You will be able to listen to them in a special section in the game menu.\nThanks to reaching the first stretch goal we\u2019ll be doing an english voice over for Black Book \u2014 this was made possible through the support of each backer! \nHere\u2019s the list of voice-over actors we confirmed: \n Sarah Anne Williams as Vasilisa (Jinx \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d, Chihaya Mifune \u201cPersona 5\u201d)\n Kyle Hebert as Egor (Ryu \u201cStreet Fighter\u201d, Kamina \u201cGurren Lagann\u201d)\n Daman Mills as Nikolai (Frieza \u201cDragon Ball Super\u201d, Kai \u201cBeastars\u201d) \n Ben Diskin as Proshka (Mega Man \u201cMega Man 11\u201d, Aida \u201cBeastars\u201d)\nIf you feel like helping us grow the community around Black Book, we\u2019ll be happy to reveal some content as milestones are reached. Join us on Discord to enjoy content reveals!\nBlack Book supporters, who commit to a pledge in relevant tiers, will see themselves in the game - or help us design unique in-game content!\nThroughout the world of Black Book, multiple gravestones will be scattered. These are not your regular gravestones - these are a token of our eternal gratitude, in remembrance of those who pitched in to make our dream game a reality!\nEveryone's name from Adept pledge (or limited Backer Relief Plus) and forward will be immortalized in the game in those gravestones, so don't miss out on the exclusive chance to find yourself among the beautiful backdrops of Cherdyn!\nOne of the core features of the game that we're really proud of is the unique visual style of the Black Book. That includes every visual aspect: the locations, character and enemy models and animation, and last, but not least - the character portraits!\nIncluded in the Occultist pledge, you'll get the chance to see your own appearance, drawn in Black Book's artstyle, in the game itself! The development team will contact you and ask for a photo, which the artist will use to commission a portrait (which is also available on its own in the Herald pledge) - and then we'll pick out a place to include it in the world of the game!\nThe entire Black Book's combat system revolves around cards. Each card has a unique property - and if combined with others in the right way, can deal massive damage to the unholy creatures that roam the land. With the Hexer pledge, you'll get to design the look, name and in-game properties of a combat card that Vasilisa will use in her demonic encounters. Still, remember - setting and game balance restrictions do apply, and the development team does have the final creative control over cards included in the final game. \nThroughout her journey, Vasilisa will find herself in many uncommon situations - from solving domestic disputes to confronting demonic creatures, who are known to terrorize human folk. Black Book will be filled with lots of unique in-game events - and with the Sorcerer pledge, we'll include your own scenario in the game as well!\nLater on in the development cycle we will contact you, and ask you to submit a short scenario - which we will then discuss and edit with you, and include it in the main game. But please keep in mind that setting restrictions do apply, and the development team does have the final creative control over the events included in the game.\nWant to leave a bigger impact on the events transpiring in Black Book? Then the Warlock pledge is the way to go!\nA side-quest consists of several in-game events, usually ranging from two to three - and tell a bigger, more developed story. As with the previous reward, we'll contact you later on, and after edits and approval from the development team, we will include an entire side-quest of your making in the final product! Be warned, setting restrictions still apply, and the development team still has the final say over in-game content of this calibre.    \nAfter finishing our latest project, The Mooseman, we\u2019ve wanted to return to the idea of making a game based on Slavic mythos - but this time, something much bigger in scale.\nWe\u2019ve been working on Black Book for quite some time. During that time, we\u2019ve accomplished a lot - from refining the game\u2019s visual style and character design, to writing the story and developing the proper combat system.. The result of our work so far can be seen in the demo - but there\u2019s still a lot left to be done until the game is ready for release.\nWith the extra budget acquired from Kickstarter backers, we aim to add many new features to the game: some of them planned, but scrapped due to time and money constraints, and others completely new.\nAside from gathering the funding required for development, crowdfunding would allow us to directly engage with the gamers all across the world - and, with their help and feedback, make The Black Book the best game it could be.\nWe're aware that the current gaming landscape is about to undergo major changes. With that in mind, we want to make sure that Black Book will be available on PC, as well as current and future consoles - so that all of our audience gets to enjoy the game, no matter what their main gaming destination is.\nWe intend on supporting all current generation platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch. \nOne of Black Book's core features is its rich, text-based narrative - and we believe that we owe it to the players to make sure this narrative is to you in full. We are already working with a professional editor, making sure that the English version of the game meets the high standards that our audience has. And currently, we expect the game to be available in the following languages upon release:\nMorteshka - The Developer\nOur projects are mythology and ethnic-based with the narrative and worlds supported by historical facts and folklore. Our first project, The Mooseman, was released in 2017 on Steam, and in 2018 on AppStore, Google Play, and modern consoles.\nThe name of the studio comes from wordplay of \"Mort\", which is French for \"dead\" and Komi for \"a man\", and \"Matryoshka\", the famous Russian doll.\nHypeTrain Digital - The Publisher\nBlack Book is being published by HypeTrain Digital, an indie game publisher for PC and consoles. They provide initial funding for developing the game and porting it to consoles and helping us with the Kickstarter campaign.\nHypeTrain Digital work side by side with independent teams to successfully ship their masterpieces to a worldwide audience. Their titles include: The Wild Eight, Stoneshard, DESOLATE, Police Stories, 12 is Better Than 6.\n-\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Mooseman was our first project as a team - and during its development, we learned a lot about what it takes to make a game from start to finish. While we are confident in our ability to deliver the game on time, Black Book is a project of a bigger scale, compared to Mooseman - and so, there is a chance that the release date would be changed further down the line. \n\nHowever, as we've said before \u2014 making Black Book as great as it can be is our priority number one. Throughout development, we will keep you informed about all updates and issues. \n\nWe thank you for your faith and support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Follower", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["78 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Reader", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["2,173 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Wanderer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["574 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Loyalist", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST\n\ud83d\udce9 DLC Skin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["514 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Believer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n2\u00d7 \ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST\n\ud83d\udce9 DLC Skin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["223 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Adept", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n2\u00d7 \ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits -

Instead of playing as only 1 civilization in 3 hours, each player could now play as 3 civilizations in 30 minutes!\nWith the help of the unique gaming mechanism, the set-up for every game is greatly different, providing a high replay-ability to players. During the game, players will rise civilization to collect resources, research technologies, build wonders, and prepare for war. Eventually, every civilization may become less powerful as the population may drop in different ways, or simply because the era is changing. (Not all civilization can adapt to a new era, as we know it from history.) It will be time for you to raise another kingdom! The new kingdom can inherit the advantages of the former civilization to continue the legend in the game. As the rise and fall of 3 empires, a unique set of the civilizations of yours will finally arise! \nPLAY\n\nAt the beginning of a game, 8 action cards are shuffled to form a time track in random order, then place the permanent action card at the upper left of the time track.\nIn each player turn, the player take actions by assigning worker tokens to the action slots. Only the 3 actions on the permanent action card AND the 3 actions right under the permanent action card are available to choose.\nWhen all players have finished their turn, the current round ends. Move the permanent action card to the right by 1 card slot when a round ends. As a result, 1 action card of the previous round will become unavailable, and 1 new action card will be available for the next round, creating a new era!\nBesides taking actions to develop empire, each player could rise civilization card to gain more powerful abilities and reset population(number of workers). Civilization cards you own are stacked to show your current civilization with its main ability, and the legacy ability of your previous civilizations.\nRising new civilization is very powerful, but the number of civil. card each player could own is limited to 3. So the timing of \"Rise and Fall\" is a critical decision to make.\nAfter 6 rounds, whoever has the most points wins! \nFor detail rules, please check out the following links:\nDownload / Game Trial\nRule Book v1.5 (English) PDF\nRegola v1.5 (Italian) PDF\n Regel v1.5 (German) PDF \n R\u00e8gle v1.5 (French) PDF \nTry it free on Tabletopia ! \nNote: All the above rule books are not the printed version. \n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through the pledge manager.

In Tramways (required to play these two expansions), the aim of the game is to finish the game with the most happiness.\nIn Tramways: The Moon and Tramways: Mars, you will first build the board by arranging a number of modules (depending on the number of players).\n  In these two expansions, the outer edges are linked by Roman numerals. As you would expect on a planetary map, you can build off one edge of the board and continue on the other side!\n You will also play these two expansions with a new special development card.\nCards with two icons in ONE slot\n The Tramways Dystopian box can fit all other expansions already released in 2017&2018...\nIn addition to the build-around-the-board mechanism, you will need to manage night & day.\n  During each turn, one of the modules are found in the night and no more deliveries can be made, making all buildings \"black\". On the next turn, the night moves on and it is the next modular board that sinks into the night. All these changes will need to be taken into account as you plan your actions.\nIn this expansion, the Martians become a new type of passengers. The green discs of the Tramways base game are used as Martians and you will need to move them as many times as possible.\nHowever, Martians will only travel to buildings already containing a Martian.\nIn order to move a Martian, you must play a magnetic strip, as usual, but you must also discard a rail worker.\nThe network will also have to stay connected and you will have to start the game by building from one of your parcels. \nYou can find the English rules HERE.\nTRAMWAYS is a game for 2\u20135 players, lasting about 30 minutes per player. It is set in the same world as Small City, also published by Alban Viard in 2015. Fans of this universe will recognize the city theme and challenging yet intellectually rewarding mechanisms.\nTRAMWAYS is a pure pick-up-and-deliver game \u2014 OK, with a twist of card management, but no randomness \u2014 in which players are trying to build their networks into a full-blown transit map. \nIf you want to know more about the original campaign click HERE \nThe goal of the game is to have the most Happiness points at the end of the game. \nYou earn Happiness points by moving passengers, building new railways, and constructing new buildings. You take on the role of investors in the early 1920s who are trying to develop the most efficient rail network. You collect tickets (cards) throughout the game and use symbols on them to take actions.\nThe more efficiently you use your cards, the more you can do with them, but the more you must increase your stress level, as well. Stress is tracked on your personal board, and counts as negative Happiness points at the end of the game. \nYou can add to your pledge any add-ons you like, just add the total to your pledge. I will send you the survey after the campaign for confirmation. There will be no pledge manager later, you need to increase your pledge by the amount.\nExample: One copy of Tramways: The dystopian Expansions + One copy of Tramways Engineer's Workbook = $24 + $25 + $5 (SC) = $54 (no additional SC)\nWe'd love for you to try Tramways before you back the campaign! The game has been implemented on Tabletopia, and you can play for free here:\nI have designed and developed several boardgames during the last 9 years such as Tramways, Small City, CliniC, Card City XL, Town Center and many expansions for these games. \nFor this project, I have worked with 2 awesome graphic designers\nSampo Siki\u00f6 is the graphic designer of Eclipse and Tramways. I like working with S because he is a genius to sump up complexe ideas with one minimalistic icon. \nTodd Sanders lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he works as a graphic designer, publisher and furniture maker. He has a great renown as a solo board game designer.\nMany of his games have already been published: Pulp Detective, Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden,  IUNU and They Who Were 8\nBecause you are helping me finance my project, I will help you finance your shipping: I will pay part of the cost, so you only have to pay $5 for shipping a game of this size. It is the least I can do. \nAlso there won't be additional shipping costs for any adds on you will purchase during the campaign !\nLike our past campaigns for games such as Tramways, the Tramways expansions, Card City XL, and the Tramways Engineer's Workbook, we have respected the delivery time, and in some case, boxes were even delivered earlier than expected (depending on how complex production of the game has been).\nFor example, for the Card City XL campaign or Pulp Detective campaign, thanks to very rigorous management of the files, and great contacts at the manufacturers, we managed to deliver the game 2 months early! \nThanks to Ludicreations for their help during the campaign.\nFollow my projects on Twitter : https://twitter.com/AlbanVIARD?lang=en \nBecome a fan on BoardGameGeek : https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233149/pulp-detective ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAVStudioGames has already put a substantial amount of money into the initial illustration and graphic design. \nWe now need your help to traverse the final route: Producing the game.

I'm a photographer, artist, pin maker, and this is the third Kickstarter i've launched. I've worked as a freelance photographer, lived abroad in England,  traveled around Europe photographing different countries, I have a full time job at a rad tech startup, I own a pin company, I have both a bachelors and a masters degree, and my baking skills are Great British Bake Off level. All of that sounds really great on paper, but what that paper doesn't tell you, is that I struggled through hours and hours of work, and frustration, to accomplish those things...i've got ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. First and foremost, ADHD is my main squeeze, anxiety and depression are a result of living with ADHD.\nAs is common with girls and women, I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until later in life. When a psychiatrist first said \"My professional opinion is that you have ADHD\", I just didn't believe her. I was a good kid, did marching band for 8 years, I did really well in school, and I was at the top of my class during my undergrad \u2013 surely she was mistaken. \nI researched the f*ck out of ADHD. The more I read, the more I realized that I carried the same misconceptions and ideologies that the general population does. I thought ADHD meant that you had trouble concentrating or sitting still. What I learned is that everything about ADHD is so complex, that it borders on being incomprehensible at times. Even the term Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is misleading and incorrect in describing what it is. The symptoms, the brain chemistry, the cognition, the neurological and genetic theories, are so far beyond \"not being able to pay attention\".  Every time I did research, and read about other people's stories, it was like someone was telling a story from my life. \nI studied film and media theory for my undergraduate degree, so for my master's degree I chose the Film, Photography, and Media studies program at Leeds University in England. One of the best things about studying media, is that it is so pervasive, that you can study pretty much any topic. The concentration of my master's degree was studying the representation of people with mental illnesses, and the associated stigma, through media, from the 19th century to the present (talk about getting really niche. I studied everything, from how people with mental illness were represented, to associated stigmas and their detrimental effects to all of society, and even what happens in the brain of a person with a mental illness, when they consume media. This resulted in a 42 page thesis and a photo essay that took a look into the small and intricate cues of my \"disorder\". Getting a post-graduate degree with ADHD was arduous, but at that time, I did it without stimulant drugs like adderall, and I graduated with honors. \nWorking on that graduate photo series.\nOne of my dreams in life is to give a TED talk on ADHD, breaking down how the ADHD brain works, and what life is like living in a world where your brain works differently. I would gladly sit here and debunk whatever misconceptions are out there, but then we'd be here for years. This is just my story, but the whole campaign isn't just focused around ADHD. Needless to say, mental illness, mental health, and stigma are topics that are very near and dear to my heart. I have wanted to create this project for a very, very long time.\nThe cover image of the photo series for my graduate thesis.\n\nWhile you're perusing through the project, please keep in mind the following:\nYou'll find that the first 9 pins of this project focus only on ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression. I am aware that they are not the only mental illnesses that exist in this world. In fact, there are a multitude of different illnesses, disorders, and conditions. Mental health is unique to everyone, so I can only speak from my own experiences. While I would love to branch out and make pins for other illnesses, so that everyone feels heard and represented, I don't feel like I can interpret an illness that I have not experienced or lived through. I don't feel that I have that authority. \nWhile these pins are based off of my experiences, my hope is that maybe you'll find a pin that you can also relate to. If any of these pins resonate with you, remember that you're not alone, because I, as well as millions of other people, have gone through the same struggle. We may experience our illnesses in our own unique ways, but there are some common stigmas and experiences that we have all had to face. I also understand that some people may disagree with what I have to say, and that's totally cool, no one is forcing you to pledge to the campaign. \nWhy did I title this campaign \"Own your Stigma\"? \u2013 Also a long story.\nWhen I was first diagnosed with three mental illnesses, I felt guilty, selfish, like I was a burden. I didn't want to believe it to be true about myself. I went to therapy, tried some medications, and kept it all on the down low. Then over the course of 6 years, in my early adulthood, I went through experiences that were traumatic for me. Soon after that it just kind of clicked for me. I was sitting in my room and out loud to myself I just said \"This is so f*cking dumb. I didn't choose this, my mental health problems are not my fault. Why have I allowed other people to dictate how I feel about my own life?\" It may have just been something I gained from age, or from some empowering sociology classes in college, but my best guess is that I came face to face with one of my deepest fears. Ever since then I have been 100% percent honest and open about my mental health, and the fact that I take medication and go to therapy. I realized that if you can just be a genuine person, and communicate honestly and openly to others, you'll learn that there are so many other people fighting the same fight, that have the same fears that you do.\nWhen someone stigmatizes you, for whatever reason, they're exerting power over you. This doesn't mean that they're always doing it maliciously, sometimes it's out of sheer ignorance or lack of knowledge. When I was younger, if someone called you a slut, it was an insult. If someone were to call me that today, i'd probably find it funny and laugh. It's a good example of a word that carried a stigma, and instead of fearing that stigma, overtime, women just took ownership of the word. We started speaking out about slut shaming, and about how women should be able to be open about their sexuality. Women took ownership of that label, and once we owned it, we took the power back. \nIf someone tells me i'm being over emotional, I say \"yeah? so what. What's wrong with showing emotion?\" People don't know how to respond to that because then they have to admit, out loud, the unspoken rule that we always have to keep our emotions in check. A really sh*tty ex once called me crazy and erratic when I became emotional and anxious, from discovering his unfaithful activities and compulsive lying. Needless to say, that relationship did not last, and it has been over for some time. When we first got together, I had failed to see the red flag when he told me \"his ex had depression and emotional problems, and that she was crazy\". Recently, we had contact where we got on the topic of our relationship. He told me that he couldn't be calm and faithful when someone, (meaning me) was so volatile. Ironically, I had never even raised my voice at him, until I found out what he was doing behind my back. Let me interpret what he was really saying, \"I was unfaithful, and I didn't like your emotional and behavioral response to that, so that justifies my unfaithfulness.\" He tried to stigmatize my ADHD by saying I was erratic. He used my ADHD and anxiety as a scapegoat so he couldn't be held responsible for the pain he had caused me. At that time in our relationship, I had responded with a completely unapologetic emotional response. Did I take the high road, probably not. I said some terrible things out of anger, and did a few things out of pettiness. A good amount of time has passed since then, but from our last encounter a few months back, it's clear he hasn't changed. Many people have asked why I stayed so long. He had his own mental health issues, addictions, and vices, and for the longest time I was patient, forgiving, and I made every attempt to be understanding and to not stigmatize his issues...but I was not met with the same compassion. Indeed this is a long story of an ex, that involved so many more factors, but the importance here, is that this was the most traumatic time that anyone had ever used a mental health stigma to manipulate me, shame me, and take away my power. For a long time I was angry that I let someone do that to me, I felt weak, like I wasn't the strong, independent woman I wanted to be, but it was the most pivotal moment in my life. It was the moment I realized that if I just took ownership, than my ex, or anyone else, could never have that power over me again. I owned the stigma he tried to place on me, I took the power back, and I became a stronger, more empathetic, and caring person. \nWhen this Kickstarter meets its base goal, the first three brain pins will be unlocked. All pins after that will be unlocked when they hit their \"funds raised goal\". The pins will first be sold at an early bird price of $8 per pin, however, there are a limited quantity of early bird spots. When the early bird spots are gone, each pin will sell for $10 each, unless noted elsewhere. This campaign involves 20+ pin designs. More pins will be uncovered as our funding increases. All pins in this campaign are hard enamel, unless noted elsewhere.\n*Please Read \nThe Once Daily pin is the first time we are experimenting with new materials. The left side of the pill will be filled, by hand, with a special epoxy. This is so we can create the look of a pill with one colored half of the capsule, and the other side clear. We've ordered a test batch of these pins from the manufacturer, because I personally will be filling each pin with the epoxy. If the test does not work, and we realize this was a bust, we'll still produce these pins. The only change is that the clear part you see on the left will be filled with stained glass enamel. Stained glass enamel is not clear, but it does create a unique look.\n The freebie pin is only included in pledge levels that include pins, meaning if you only pledged for the stickers, you won't receive this. \n*Please Read \nThe Mosaic Heart is a pin that will contain stained glass enamel. The white part you see is regular white enamel, but the colored sections will be stained glass enamel. This process means that all the colored spots will be cut outs, that are then filled with an epoxy/enamel mixture. This produces an opaque look, somewhat like, well stained glass. If you hold it up to the light, the colored parts will show some light. While stained glass enamel can be beautiful, it is sometimes hard to produce, and can be risky. The color of the stained glass may vary from pin to pin, and there is the possibility of a few very tiny bubbles in the enamel. These should be minor things you will barely notice. The most important thing to note here is that this process can be expensive. If you choose this pin as one of the designs for your pledge level, it will be the only time you'll be able to get it at that price. After this campaign ends, this pin will retail for somewhere between $12-$15. If you've never seen stained glass enamel, google it, and you should find some examples. \n *Please Read \nThe rainbow pins you see above are what's called anodized, or rainbow, metal. The metal plating is a rainbow color that looks really nice in the light. Pins made with anodized metal will always be soft enamel. All pins in this campaign are hard enamel, unless noted otherwise. Below is photo of our logo pin so you can see what this metal looks like. \n *Please Read \nThe Spectrum pin will contain stained glass enamel. The white opaque part you see, inside the prism, will be a milky opaque stained glass enamel. If you hold it up to the light, some light should shine through the stained glass part. While stained glass enamel can be beautiful, it is sometimes hard to produce, and can be risky. The color of the stained glass may vary from pin to pin, and there is the possibility of a few very tiny bubbles in the enamel. These should be minor things you will barely notice.\n I'm more than happy to create more label pins. I like fonts.\nIf there is a label pin you'd like to request, please message me directly. Please message me with the mental illness, condition, or disorder, and how you think it should appear as a label. For example, if you have Bipolar Disorder, should the pin read Bipolar Disorder, or just Bipolar. Please also keep in mind that I will only create labels for another three conditions, because if I made one for every condition, we'd be here all damn day. Please don't message me with a physical illness or condition, for now  i'm only making these for mental illnesses recognized in the DSM-V. (i.e. Autism, Bipolar, PTSD, OCD, etc). I know there are some people who have qualms about \"labeling\". This pin isn't saying that your illness is all you are. I wear my ADHD related pins in hope that if someone wants to ask, i'm more than happy to answer any questions... and the next time my partner looks at my disorganized room with a smirk, i'm going to smile and point to this pin. Even though i'm only making another three label pins, this doesn't mean there that others won't appear in the future. Another note: It might seem that this stretch requires a much larger sum of funds raised to unlock. This is because even though these pins are small, they call for three seperate mold fees. Mold fees are paid only once, but they impact the cost when producing a new pin.   \nFreebie pins are only included in pledge levels that include pins, meaning if you only pledged for the stickers, you won't receive this. \n*Due to the nature of this pin and it's complexity, it's subject to change. We'll notify you of any changes made to this pin before your survey lockdown.\n\nThe other day I did a rough estimate of how many pins we\u2019ll be manufacturing...and it was over 20K. That\u2019s alot of pins which means alot of backing cards. Now I know there are some of you out there who collect backing cards, some of you just throw them away, and some of you even graciously offered to not have one, but I like backing cards. I like designing backing cards, I like quality cards, and even before I launched this campaign, I was designing the backing cards for it in my head. I wanted to try something new, and having a campaign with such a high volume of pins, meant that this was the time to try it. So here\u2019s how the backing cards will work. We\u2019ll be using 4\u201dX6\u201d, 22pt stock, postcards, and each card will hold 4-6 pins depending on size. If you purchase one 1-2 pins, you\u2019ll receive your pins on a typical square backing card. If you purchase say 7 pins, then you might get 5 of them on a postcard and two on regular sized backing card. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to choose whether you receive postcards or individual backing cards, and you won\u2019t be able to specify which pins go with which cards. While buying more than 20K regular backing cards is possible, it would mean we would have to cut the quality. I won\u2019t do that for this campaign because I have a special idea in mind. Let\u2019s say that you purchased 5 pins, so you\u2019ll receive them all on a postcard, but you\u2019re really adamant about a single, regular sized, backing card, because maybe you want to give one pin as a gift. In this case you\u2019ll be able to purchase a single backing card in the add-ons section for 25 cents a piece. (also take note that freebie pins come in the regular factory bag and not on a backing card)\nAfter this Kickstarter campaign has ended, Kickstarter will collect the funds for your pledge level. If your payment is declined, Kickstarter allows you 7 days to \"fix\" your pledge. If you miss the 7 days, you will still have the opportunity to reinstate your pledge through your BackerKit survey. After these 7 days have passed, we will send you a survey from a pledge manager called BackerKit. This survey will first ask pledge level questions, this is where you designate which designs you want. Once you've finished your pledge questions, the designs you've chosen are automatically added to your item list. After pledge questions, you'll go through an add-ons section (sort of like an exit through gift shop situation) Add-ons are optional, and do not affect the items from your pledge level. We haven't posted pictures yet, but here are some things you can expect to find in the Add-Ons section.\n- Stickers (both sticker packs, and individual stickers)\n- Locking backs\n- Pins from previous campaigns or what we have in stock at that time\n- Any extra pins you might want from this campaign\nKeep checking back, as i'll soon add the sticker design mockups. \nStickers\nBelow are the first four stickers for the add-ons section. There are more to come, and not all are just sticker versions of the pins. The stickers range in size from roughly 2\" - 5\". \n\nIt's hard to show what a holographic overlay looks like on a sticker mockup. It's essentially and overlay that reflects back a full spectrum of rainbow colors when you move it around in the light. Below are holographic stickers that Snarky Co. has made in the past. \nWhat is an Add-On Stretch Goal? \nThe reason we use a pledge manager like BackerKit, is because it allows us to create more comprehensive surveys, and streamline our shipping process. BackerKit has a feature called an Add-On Stretch Goal. For my first campaign, I had an idea for a t-shirt design, but I didn't know if anyone would actually want to buy it. So I contacted some screen printing companies, priced out t-shirts, and then added it to the add-ons section of the survey. Three people ordered it. Whenever you manufacture a product, there's a minimum order quantity. The minimum quantity is usually the product at is highest price. To have t-shirts printed, I needed 50 people to order them, and that didn't happen. I ended up contacting those three people and letting know that I had removed the t-shirt from their order, and that they wouldn't be charged for it. \nThe add-on stretch goal will show up in the add-on sections, and it'll have a banner that says something like \"Hey we need 50 people to make this happen\". As people add this item to their carts you can see whether this product is going to be made or not. When you complete your survey, if you add any extra items, you'll be prompted for your card details. You won't be charged when you complete your survey. You'll be charged at the lockdown date, and we'll notify you when that date is. If we don't meet the minimum quantity for an add-on stretch goal you may have ordered, then it is removed from your order, and you are not charged for it. This allows us to put out other products like patches, t-shirts, and key chains, to see if people actually respond to them. It's essentially a fail-safe, if we like a t-shirt design, but then find out no one else does, we aren't stuck manufacturing 50 t-shirts because only one person ordered it. \nWe are still talking to manufacturers to work out pricing on all these items, so we don't have a price estimate at the moment. What we do know, is that we are offering add-on stretch goal items at a discounted price to Kickstarter backers only. If you pre-order these items after the campaign, you'll order them at full price. \nPatch\nBelow is a somewhat blurry photo of a chenille patch. The red and light green are the chenille, which is a soft fuzzy material. The seeds and stem are done in embroidery, and the black outline is felt. Chenille patches are often what you see on varsity letterman jackets. \n T-Shirts\nDuring the Kickstarter campaign you can pledge a monetary amount in any of the pledge levels. Your money won't be withdrawn from your payment method until the end of the campaign. Funds will only be collected if we meet our goal. \nAfter the campaign ends, your funds will be drawn from Kickstarter, and then you will be sent a survey to pick out your rewards and add your shipping info. We will be using a pledge manager called BackerKit to send out surveys. There will also be an add-ons section to your survey, where you can add on extra items, such as sticker packs, locking metal backs, or additional pins. Payment details will be collected in your survey to pay for any last minute added items. \nOnce the funds have been released from Kickstarter I can start production!\nPlease Note: \nOnce orders have been locked down we have a no refund or return policy. After orders are locked and funds are secured, production orders will be placed and paid for. The amount of funds determines the quantities that we need to fulfill this campaign. We will only offer refunds for extenuating circumstances or if you rewards were damaged in transit.  \nShipping for your pledge level will be collected on Kickstarter during the campaign. This project is only shipping to the following countries: USA, Canada, The United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland. \nIf there is another country you'd like us to consider shipping to, please contact us directly. We will attempt to see if we can arrange to ship to your country. Shipping fees for other countries have not yet been determined, but when you contact us we will give you an estimate. \nPledge Level Shipping is a fixed rate that is based off of the amount of pins in your pledge level. Keep in mind some pledge levels have as little as one pin, and some pledge levels have as many as 20. We will be using the U.S. postal service for shipping. \nUnited States: $4 - $10\nCanada: $11 - $25\nUnited Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland: $15 - $25\nIf you choose to purchase extra items in the add-ons section of your survey there may be added shipping fees. Any extra shipping fees are based on the weight of your package, for example, adding a sticker pack has no additional shipping fee, but adding another four pins may have a shipping fee. \nWhen shipping internationally we will make every effort to properly fill out customs forms. We will abide by your countries customs and shipping laws, which means we will denote the package value as the cost of your order, and mark this as merchandise. Please do not ask us to change the value of your package, or mark it as a gift. We are not responsible if your country holds your package and requires extra payment to release it. \nBelow you can find the estimated timeline for this project, as well as the funds breakdown. \nMarch \u2013 Kickstarter Campaign Begins\nApril \u2013 Kickstarter Campaign Ends and funds are collected\nApril \u2013 Surveys are sent out\nApril/May \u2013 The pre-order store is open\nMay \u2013 Orders are locked down and sent to the manufacturer\nMay/June - Pins are in production\nJuly \u2013 Shipping of rewards begins (the reason rewards will not ship until June or July is because it takes several weeks to manufacture the pins, package orders, and send them out) If all materials are produced earlier than the estimated shipping start date we will of course begin to ship in asap.\nKeep in mind that July feels like a long ways off, but for our last two campaigns we shipped well before the estimated ship date. Our first campaign was supposed to begin shipping in February 2019, and instead we sent out our last 20 orders in February. Our second campaign was set to begin shipping in April and we started shipping the first orders in the last week of February, and the remaining orders will all be sent out in mid march. We've consistently shipped early so far. We can't make any promises for this project because sometimes with crowdfunding there are unforeseen circumstances, but if all goes well like the last two campaigns, you should get rewards before July. \nCheck out our social media pages, Etsy store, and previous campaigns!\nSnarky Co. Pins - Our First Kickstarter.\nKiller Queens - Our Second Kickstarter. \nwww.snarkyco.com\nInstagram\nPatreon\nEtsy\nThe Things to Know section contained our policies for this campaign, but we've now moved it to the Risks and Challenges section of this page. Even though we've re-located our policies, they still apply. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'll be using trusted manufacturers that i've worked with before, but occasionally, minor mistakes can be made, and delays in production can happen. \n\nI will always be upfront with backers along the way. I will disclose any setbacks, delays, and any other pertinent updates.\n\nIt's important to understand that this is a crowdfunded campaign. Crowdfunded campaigns are often subject to delays due to unforeseen circumstances. Please also understand that money pledged to a crowdfunded campaign is a donation or investment. This is not an online store and you will not immediately receive your rewards after pledging.\n\nPlease note that minor changes may occur in production, and that the images presented here are my mock up designs. There is a possibility of slight changes in color and size, but I don't foresee any major issues.\n\nPin Grades\nThe Snarky Company offers two grades of pins, First Grade, and Second Grade. First Grade pins are really the only pins I offer in my online stores, and they are the only ones available for Kickstarter campaigns. Second grade pins are only available through online stores, and currently we're not offering any. Our pins are handmade and they may have minor cosmetic imperfections. \nExamples of expected First Grade imperfections:\nSmall buff marks, scuffs, or scratches on metal/enamel\nSmall specks, pores, or bubbles anywhere on the pin\nSlightly low or uneven fills\nSlightly misaligned screenprinted details (for pins with screenprinting)\nSlight variations in the distribution of giltter\nSlight defects in text (this is usually only in pins with small text)\nWe want to make you aware that these First Grade pins may have small imperfections, but 99% of the time, these imperfections are non-existent or not noticeable. \nAn important note about color and size.\nIt is crucial to understand that while we have made pins before, the pins in this Kickstarter have not yet been manufactured. The designs you see on this page are only mockups, which means the final product may have slight changes in color and size. Taking your two dimensional design, sending it to a manufacturer, and receiving a three dimensional, physical object is difficult. From our experience, the majority of our pins turn out looking like the mockup design. \nThere are so many variables when you see a mockup that you are viewing on your computer or phone. Different computers, phones, or other devices have different screen settings which means we may not all be viewing the same coloration. We use a Pantone Solid Coated book to choose the colors for our designs. The manufacturers use those Pantone numbers to know which colors to mix and apply where, however, looking at a Pantone swatch on paper, is different than looking at a Pantone color in enamel. \nEach mockup has a rough estimate of what the size will be. Our sizes are either specifying the general height of the pin, or width of the pin, however, the actual size of the physical product may vary. \n\nGlitters\nWhen you view a mockup design that has components with glitter, it is crucial to understand how glitter overlays work in Adobe Illustrator. Glitter textures are artificially created in Adobe illustrator. We have glitter textures in various shades for each color, but they come no where near to the hundreds of different glitter colors that manufacturers offer. The mockup design may show you a section of dark blue glitter, that has flecks of dark blue and silver, however, the physical glitter may contain specs of other shades of blue, green, or silver. When you see a mockup design with glitter, understand that the glitter overlay is to give you an idea of the general color of the glitter, and where it will be on the pin. When a pin has holographic glitter, it will be labeled as holographic glitter. Holographic is what you could call rainbow glitter, each spec of glitter can reflect various different colors. What you should know about holographic glitter is that it reflects different colors depending on the enamel it is placed in. When placed in white enamel, it reflects a shade of light blue, when placed in black enamel it reflects a shade of green. \nRefunds or Exchanges\nAfter the campaign has ended, you will have ample time to make your pin selections in your BackerKit survey. You will be notified before surveys are locked down and any add-ons are charged. Once your order is locked down, we have a no refunds or exchanges policy. The only time we will issue a refund or replacement, is in extenuating circumstances, or if your pin arrives damaged (please read the section on pin grades to determine if your pin is damaged). Examples of damaged pins are, posts that are bent and unusable, posts that may have fallen off, or whole chunks of enamel that are missing. We will also offer refunds or offer to reship an item if it is missing from your order. \nRubber Backs vs. Locking Backs\nEach pin from our campaign will come with rubber backs, but we highly recommend purchasing locking backs. If you choose to adhere your pin to a jacket, bag, or other item, with a rubber back, and it falls off, we will not replace the missing pin. We do offer locking backs through our add-ons section in your survey. \nShipping Policies\nPlease visit the shipping section to read about these policies. \nComments\nMental Illness can be a very intimate and personal topic. Any one who leaves a comment that I determine to be rude, defamatory, or ignorant, will be blocked with no explanation. \nThe Denim Jacket Pledge Level\nIf you pledge for this tier, after the campaign has ended, we provide a sizing chart where you can choose your size. We'll provide 1-3 different options for jackets. We prefer Levi's jackets, but we have other chosen brands that are also great quality. From the options we provide, you'll get to choose which jacket style, color (if that style has color options), and of course your size. For the collector's box you have three options for engraving. You can choose just our Logo, just your name, or you can choose to have the Logo and your name. You'll receive one of each pin, and if that pin has multiple color options, you'll receive one of each color (for example, the Pill pin comes in four colors, you'll get all four). All pins will come on backing cards, with locking backs, and arrive packed in the collector's box. Please be careful when choosing your jacket size, as we cannot provide an exchange or refund if it does not fit. Once your pledge level is locked down (you'll be notified before the lockdown) the pledge level is non-refundable. If any of your items are damaged in transit, we will replace them though. If you purchase this tier as an international backer, we properly fill out all customs forms, but we will not be held responsible if your country loses your package through their mailing service (this means once the package is no longer with the USPS), or if they hold your package and ask for additional VAT, taxes, or fees. You'll also receive any add-on stretch goals that are successfully unlocked. If any add-on stretch goal is not unlocked, it will not come with your order.

Even bringing in someone new to help with shipping is challenging because it takes a good amount of time to teach them everything in order to understand how to navigate 100+ SKUS and a new shipping software.

The Fail Faster Playtesting Journal will guide you throughout your playtesting process to ensure that you\u2019re capturing the right information as well as guide you towards improving your design. \nAt its core, the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal contains pages to keep track of 36 playtests. The journal is most useful if you dedicate one journal to each game that you are designing, but you could easily use one journal to keep track of all the different games you\u2019re designing. Each section has been tested and planned for optimal use of space.\nHere's an overview of what's included in this journal. Scroll down lower to see more details about each section of the journal. \nHere's a video of Jamey Stegmaier going into more detail about his thoughts on the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\n\nThis journal got a lot better as we achieved certain thresholds! We earned badges throughout the campaign and once we earned enough badges for a stretch goal to be unlocked, we held a poll. The poll asked if you preferred to redeem the badges for the first stretch goal, or if you preferred to wait and save up the badges for a different stretch goal. Majority prevailed! With 12 badges left at the end of the campaign, there was one more vote, but we can't edit the campaign once it's closed, so here's a snapshot of where we ended up:   \nVIDEO EXPLAINING STRETCH GOALS\nHere's a video explaining how the Stretch Goals work, in case this didn't make any sense! \nRED TROPHIES\nWhenever we made it to the end of any row in the Stretch Goal chart, we also unlocked a RED TROPHY! Red trophies unlocked more content for the journal and didn't cost any extra badges! Here's what we unlocked:\n1) Contract Checklist: A checklist of everything you need to consider before signing that contract! \n2) Blind Playtest Feedback form: A form to provide your blind playtesters to ensure you get the feedback you need. This will only be included in the PDF since it doesn't really make sense to include in the final copy of the journal. As a reminder, everyone who backs this campaign for at least 1 physical copy of the journal will also receive the PDF! \n\nFail Faster is the culmination of ideas from Jay Cormier who co-designed all of the games pictured above, with many more signed to come out soon.  He has detailed his journey on how he got his games published along with Sen-Foong Lim, at www.bamboozlebrothers.com. He teaches Game Theory at the Vancouver Film School and has done so for the last 6 years.   \nIt's possible that content and images shown below could change by the time we go to print. Mostly this will be due to listening to feedback from you, the backers!\nPlaytesters and Scores: The top left corner includes spaces for name, version, number of tests and date. Then an area to write your playtesters name - including a box to indicate if it's their first time playing the game and columns to keep track of various scores, or even times when players achieve specific thresholds.\nTimes: Here\u2019s where you can keep track of the time it took to explain rules and play your game and if you were able to play to the end or not.\nRules Changes and Focus: Do you have any rules changes since your last playtest that you don\u2019t want to forget? Write them here before you start your playtest. Then keep track of any observations you have as well as any questions your playtesters asked you while playing.\nWinning Strategies: Keep track of the winning player\u2019s strategy up here to see, over time, if there are dominant strategies. There's a nice reminder here to take a photo of the end game state. This can be useful when analyzing afterwards.\nFeedback: Feedback from your playtesters is written here. The questions that are asked vary on each page, and start by assuming you\u2019re in the Alpha phase of game design and by the end of the journal, the questions are more geared towards games in the Gamma phase. \nAdditional tools and resources\nThe journal is full of other interesting tools and resources that will help make you a better game designer.\nDesigner Progress \nOn the fold out cover, ten behaviours have been identified that, when followed, will make you a better playtester of your game and ultimately, a better designer.\nWhen you have accomplished one of these behaviours in your playtest, shade in the next box. When you reach a badge on any of the rows, flip open the fold-out cover and colour in that badge on the front.\nIf we unlock the sticker stretch goal, then the journal will come with stickers of each badge which will really pop when placed on the cover!\nYou can also keep track of your overall designer level by totaling up the number of badges you\u2019ve earned from previous journals. Write in the lifetime sum total in the top of your journal. If we reach our sticker stretch goal, then there will be stickers available to indicate your level as a designer for all to see.\nGame Idea Generator\nThe inside of the fold-out front cover contains a Game Idea Generator. Simply roll 2 dice three times to get a random Mechanic, Theme and even a Constraint. Don\u2019t have 2 dice lying around? No worries because that\u2019s also built into the journal.\nSimply flip the journal open to any page and the bottom left corner will have a random 2d6 result. This can be handy while playtesting your game if you forgot dice. Twenty-six of the middle pages also have a random letter tile on it for those games that require a random letter.\nHow to Get Your Game Published (in PDF version only)\nThere's a guide showing you how to get your game published. \nManufacturer Considerations\nThe back cover will have a page full of information from manufacturer, Panda that will help you as a designer.\nScoreboard\nThe inside back cover has a scoreboard in case you need one during your playtest. It folds out too, so you can still use the rest of your journal! It also has a metric ruler along the side. \n Goals\nThe front page has an area for you to write your own SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound), and if you work towards those goals, they too can earn you badges that you can put on the cover.\n\nProtips\nThe bottom of each playtesting page contains a different ProTip that comes from over 10 years of designing board games.\n Game Crafter Coupon\nEvery Kickstarter version of the physical journal comes with a $5 coupon for The Game Crafter - a great source for components as well as print-on-demand games. The retail version and any digital version will not come with this coupon.\nWatch Jay Cormier get interviewed by Edo about Playtesting as well as the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\nHere's an interview by Inquisitive Meeple where Jay Cormier dishes out a lot of facts and history about the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal\n\nPhotos: Dylan Hamm, www.dylanhammphoto.com\nVideo: Nathan Watkins,  nathanwatkinsfilm.com \nWeb Design: Jason Gorber, www.bearshark.com\nGraphic Design of Journal: David Mak, www.honeycombgraphics.ca\nSocial Media Consultant: Gerald King III,  ko-fi.com/mrking ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I've had numerous games on Kickstarter (Belfort, Tortuga, This Town Ain't Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us, But Wait There's More, In the Hall of the Mountain King), I've never had to run one myself.

What if the story depended on the choices YOU made? \nSound familiar? You've probably heard of game books where you get to choose your path by reading a series of text paragraphs each ending with a fun choice. But what if...\nWhat if a game book implemented GRAPHICS into the game play? What if instead of text driving the action, text AND graphics combined to create a visual sensory experience?\nLast year, we first introduced you to the next evolution of game books with Season 1 of Graphic Novel Adventures. And now we are back with MORE!  \nThe Ultimate Gamebook Experience\nThese books are an incredible gaming experience. And they are so accessible even to those of you that have never played a gamebook before. Most of the books are one player, but in Season 2 one of the books even supports playing with 2 players! \nProduct Highlights:\nThere is zero setup time. Open the book and begin playing. Start and stop at will, play time is whatever you want it to be.\nThey tell a cohesive and engaging story.\nThey include puzzles, riddles, hidden numbers, and other challenges that will test you at every step.\n\"I need a game to play on an airplane tray table\" - Look no further!\nThe books feature a variety of themes and story lines each with different rules and gameplay twists on the core system.\nIf you were here for season 1 you already know my opinion... This is the BEST game book experience out there.\nStill not convinced? Let's take a peek inside... \nIn Mystery! you are a new recruit trying to join the Legion of Champions, the most famous super hero group of all-time. You'll have to prove yourself. Experience the trials with Mystery, Miracle Woman, ShadowDark and others in this hilarious and fun filled adventure!\nNew recruits are needed.\nLooking at your character sheet, you'll get to name your super hero and then decide how to split your 3 starting hero points between Flight, Strength, Super Senses, and Super Rich. As you progress, you will be able to increase your stats in the skills of your choice! There is even a high tech metamorpher machine that will allow you to reconfigure your stats during the game, but you might want to be careful using that as there could be, well, er, side effects. Ultimately you'll need to earn enough hero points to become a full fledged member of the Legion of Champions!\nLet's look at one of the scenarios that might come up in the book...\nHow would you handle this situation?\nDid you notice the QR code on the page? One of the special features in Mystery is that you have a high tech watch you can use to get instant information and tips. If you have a QR code reader on your phone, go ahead and scan it now. If not, or you prefer not to have a device on hand, don't worry, the QR codes are completely optional!\nSo which choice would YOU make? Want to know what happens? Well pledge for these books and you'll be able to find out this and soooo much more!\nSo many doors, so little time!\nAll of the books have choices of where to go and what to do. You'll encounter foes, puzzles, traps, riddles, and much, much more! Not every path is safe though, so choose wisely! \nYou don't want to miss spotting a hidden number that could be critical to your objective... Can YOU spot the hidden number in the frame below? (Don't worry, the below frame is modified. This is not an actual hidden number in the book - as to not spoil anything)\nIf this was real and not just a made up example, you would flip to panel 101 and perhaps discover one of Mystery's most intimate secrets. \nI can tell you want MORE! Well to experience all these books have to offer you are going to have to pledge for the set. But let's look at an overview of the other four, shall we?\n Ready to continue where Sherlock Holmes: Four Investigations left off? Well look no further than Sherlock Holmes & Moriarty: Associates! In this book, not only can you play as Holmes and Watson, but now you can also choose Moriarty! He's joined the team under peculiar circumstances... \nThe Napoleon of Crime seems to have made arrangements.\nQuestion suspects without fear of offending them knowing your ability to coerce and threaten them will produce useful information!\nQuestion suspects as Holmes, Watson, OR Moriarty.\nIf things go south Moriarty is willing to use... less conventional means.\nWill you solve the cases with the help of your arch nemesis? And has he really changed his ways? Or is he up to something sinister? \n In Sherlock Holmes: The Challenge of Irene Adler, there is a new detective in town! Irene is now competing with the Baker Street boys for business. But will she truly be able to rival the skills of Sherlock? \nA entirely different game is afoot.\nPlay solo, or head to head against another player each taking on the role of either Sherlock Holmes or Irene Adler. Only by using your wits will you prove yourself to be London's Greatest Detective! Will you best your opponent in this battle of wits? Or will your opponent come out on top?\n In Pirates: The Great Chase, you can choose one of three Pirates with a different set of stats. Your goal? To find the prisoner that just escaped your ship and is swimming  toward a nearby island.\nYou can't just let prisoners escape!\nThis is a true treasure hunt and you will really need to keep your eyes peeled for hidden objects along the way! You never know what you'll come across that could be helpful later on! \n In Pirates: The City of Skulls, you'll continue where your adventure left off and explore the bustling pirate town. Will you be able to unlock its secrets and find what you are looking for?\nFeaturing a new stat to track, your piracy level, this Pirates book is sure to satisfy. \n ________________________________________________________________\nWe are so excited to bring you these books.

Here are some quotes and videos from some of them.\nBoardgames and Bourbon - Glenn Flaherty\n\"If this is any indication of what this second season has overall over the first season, it is an evolution of the story telling. I can definitely recommend [Mystery].\"\n90 Second Nerd - Nick and Jenny \nBeyond Solitaire - Liz Davidson\n \"I am really happy with what I've experienced while playing the Graphic Novel Adventures series so far, and based on the strength of Mystery, my expectations remain high.  This project is an instaback for me.\"  \nPraise for GNA Season 1\nThe Dice Tower review of Graphic Novel Adventures - Season 1 \nUnfiltered Gamer Review \nListen, if you are a genius and lucky enough to get through one of these books on the first try, well then we bow to you (unless you cheated). But the chances are if you are playing legit, it will take you at least a handful of tries to complete one successfully. You are looking at several hours of game play in each book. And these books are the sort where you can put them on the shelf for a year or several months and you'll be able to revisit them again unless you've got one of those photographic memories where you never forget anything! \nGreat news! The season 1 books are available now! Please support your Friendly Local Game Store by purchasing there. If they do not have them, they can probably order them for you if you are in the USA or Canada. But if you still can't find them, you can purchase them directly from us at vanrydergames.com\nFor international locations outside of the USA and Canada, please check your local stores as  these books and/or others may be available from other publishers in your language.\nWe MAY offer the Season 1 books in the pledge manager after this campaign, but that is not guaranteed. And if we do we will not be able to ship them until Season 2 is ready.\nGraphic Novel Adventures are self-contained games within a book and are English translations we are printing under license of previously released French game books from publisher Makaka Editions. As a result, we will not be offering stretch goals for this campaign. However it should be noted that the more we achieve with this campaign, the greater likelihood we will be able to translate and produce MORE Graphic Novel Adventures! \nWe are planning to be able to deliver these books very quickly and are targeting August or sooner for our delivery estimate. For Season 1, we were able to deliver in just a few short months and we are confident we can achieve similar results with Season 2.\nWe are offering retailer pledges for USA/Canada retailers ONLY that are interested in purchasing case quantities. This is simply our greatest retailer offer we have ever had so we hope our retail partners will be interested! \nTo take advantage of this offer simply back for $50 to commit to buy. Then, prior to shipping from the factory we will ask you to finalize your quantity commitment, but you can pay your remaining balance at a later date prior to final shipping. Pricing is 50% off of KSP (Kickstarter Shipped Price) or $42.50 per set. Minimum order quantity is 4 book sets.\nAdditionally, as a special thank you for supporting our GNA book line, we will send Brick and Mortar retailers a custom display to use for the GNA books in your store, a pre-release store demo copy of The Crusoe Crew - the upcoming co-operative GNA game, and we will produce a \"How to sell a GNA book\" video for you to share with your employees! And we will send these items as soon as they are ready for use with your Season 1 GNA books you carry now  - NO NEED TO WAIT for your Season 2 product to arrive! \nVan Ryder Games will pay the shipping for retail pledges. We are not trying to make money off of retailers with this deal. We are trying to earn your commitment to the brand while giving you amazing margin to get started (or continue), as well as all of the tools you need to succeed in selling the books! \nThis offer is LIMITED. We will verify all retailers! \nRetailers interested in stocking Season 1 - which is available NOW! - can do so by contacting your distributor of choice.

In PARKS, players will take on the role of two hikers as they trek through different trails across four seasons of the year. While on the trail, these hikers will take actions and collect memories of the sites they visit\u2014memories being the resources in the game. Players will trade in these memories to collect National Park cards, mementos, at the end of each hike. You'll be able to purchase equipment and fill canteens to make your hikes more efficient, but at the the end of the year, it's the Park cards and photos you have collected along your journey that will win you the game. Welcome to PARKS!\nWe have all been inspired by our world at some point. In fact, if you\u2019re like the people in the audio journals we've been sharing, then you have an inspiring memory of an experience you had in the wild. The Fifty-Nine Parks Print Series reached out to us and captured our imagination with the beautiful artwork they are creating in celebration of the United States National Parks. We could not think of a better way to help celebrate with them than to develop a game that makes use of this beautiful work and helps give back to the Parks themselves.\nWe\u2019re committed to honoring national parks. Because of your help bringing this project to life, we will be making an annual donation to the National Park Service for the lifetime of this product. This donation will be based on gross retail revenue each year.\nAdditionally, Every dollar added to the tip jar in our pledge manager will be included in our first year\u2019s donation.\nPARKS' solo adventure puts you back on the trail, but this time alongside Park Rangers! Rangers will be moving alongside you as they take care of the Trail. In order to visit a site with a Ranger on top of it you'll need to use your Campfire just like in the main game.  Enjoy your hike, but don\u2019t take too long because the Season ends when the Rangers finish the trail!\nSolo Mode Includes:\n2 Hikers vs 2 Rangers\nRanger Movement correlates to the Gear cost revealed that turn\nRangers pick up Weather (Sunshine or Water) on Tiles they land on and it is placed in their Tracker\nIf Rangers collect three Sunshine or three Water, then the corresponding event is triggered such as a Government Shutdown. After its action resolves, a new card is revealed\nRangers skip over tiles with Hikers as they don't want to impose on the Hikers' experience of the Trail, but they don\u2019t mind sharing a space with each other\nThe first Ranger to reach trail end will close down a Park and select an additional effect\nHikers caught on the trail when season ends cannot take any further actions until the next season\nOfficial Solo Rules available in the rules folder above\nOur love of board games all started with a standard deck of cards\u2014so when Fifty-Nine Parks brought up the prospect of doing playing cards as well, we jumped at the opportunity! Each face-card will house a park for a total of 12 Parks in the deck. In this set you\u2019ll find: Acadia, Arches, Everglades, Grand Canyon, Great Smoky, Joshua Tree, Mount Rainier, Olympic, Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion. The deck will be made with the United States Playing Card Company on premium card stock featuring sustainable forest paper and vegetable-based and metallic inks. \nThe items below are things you can add to your order through Backerkit after the campaign is over.\nHow do I add these cool things?\nYou can look through the items below, select the ones you are interested in, see how much they all cost, and add that amount to your pledge right now if you want.

The strength of the series comes from an eclectic mix of artists and the unique beauty of each park. Every screen printed poster is printed here in the USA.

The full series is currently being archived by The Library of Congress.\nVisit their website for more details and to view their collection of wonderful prints, many of which are available for purchase.

It will be their responsibility to guide the other player(s) to complete all of the MISSION OBJECTIVES using only a set of 11 special COMMAND CARDS. They are not allowed to speak. \nThe other player(s) take the role of the CADET who must complete the three MISSION OBJECTIVES within the time- or round-limit using the COMMAND CARDS they receive from MISSION CONTROL. They will receive five of these cards at a time and will have to decode the order they actually belong in because they must be shuffled before given to the CADET each round.\nYour Goal: Cooperatively fix the station before time runs out by deducing the correct order in which each set of instructions belongs, until all of the MISSION OBJECTIVES are complete. MISSION CONTROL is allowed to reveal when a MISSION OBJECTIVE has been completed, but that's all they can say until the end! But, if you run out of time on the clock, or exhaust your total number of TRANSMISSIONS before solving all three, it's GAME OVER. \nClick to Watch: UNFILTERED GAMER's review\nDynamic tile art!

CADET: Arrange the EMPTY CORRIDOR tiles as shown in the animation below. Shuffle up the OBJECT/STATION tiles Repaired (Green) side up and deal them out in the empty squares. Then flip over 8 tiles in the diamond pattern below to the Damaged (Red) side. Last, place the Cadet Meeple in the center tile on the board.\n2. MISSION CONTROL: Shuffle up the three MISSION OBJECTIVE decks and draw one off the top of each, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Only you are allowed to look at them. Do not show them to the CADET. These are the Missions you will need to complete in order to win! (This part is called the PLANNING PHASE)\n3. BEGIN PLAY! MISSION CONTROL selects five of the 11 COMMAND available to them, (hopefully five that gets the CADET closer to completing a MISSION OBJECTIVE,) shuffles them, and gives them to the CADET face-down. \nThe Cadet must place those five COMMAND cards in the order they believe is correct, and then execute those commands in that order. (This part is called the DECODE PHASE)\nAfter executing the five commands, return the COMMAND CARDS to MISSION CONTROL. If the conditions were met for any MISSION OBJECTIVE at any time, even if for just a split-second, that MISSION OBJECTIVE is completed and may be revealed to the CADET.\nRepeat step 3 until all of your MISSION OBJECTIVES are complete! \nNext, you'll be ready to make the game even more exciting with:\n\nClick to watch: GEEKYGAYMERGUY's review\nNow with full-color tiles!\nTabletop Simulator sold separately, but the module is free for backers!\nClick to watch: BOCK'S GAME REVIEWS Incoming Transmission review\nSee the Stretch Goals section for even more!\nLoad up the app and use the Tabletop Simulator demo or Print-and-Play to try them out together!\nWhat the Incoming Transmission Companion App IS: \nIt is a digital helper that can add sights, sounds, and extra features to your game that are unrealistic to expect a human to manage while playing.\nIt enables additional play modes and enhances existing ones without detracting from the core of the game.\nIt will keep track of certain information for you and provide a unique gaming experience.\nIt is an OPTIONAL TOOL, you do not have to use it in order to play Incoming Transmission.\na FREE application for all players of Incoming Transmission.\nWhat the Incoming Transmission Companion App IS NOT: \nIt is not required in order to play or fully enjoy Incoming Transmission.\nIt is not supported by, nor shall it include, any third-party ads.\nWhile the current demo is web-based, internet access will not be required to use the final application.

What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nHere it is, blunt and forward. We ran a KickStarter campaign for Incoming Transmission last Summer. It funded, and we were happy! We immediately started finalizing assets and began the long task of working with the manufacturer. \nHowever, there was a long list of improvements & features we weren\u2019t able to add due to not reaching certain stretch goals and we strongly felt that they should be part of the project. We asked our backers if we should attempt to sell an expansion at a later date, run a short Kickstarter to unlock those items, or just leave it alone. Over 90% of our respondents said we should go for another Kickstarter, and as we want to support our supporters, that is exactly what we are doing!\nThis campaign will not create any delays in production, for you or our previous backers.

Production on schedule thus far (subject to improvements based on the performance of the current campaign)\n\nThe publication of a board game is a complex process with many variables and parties involved from multiple countries. It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers with well-developed relationships with their suppliers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects. We have met unique challenged in each of our previous campaigns that have only equipped us with more experience to prevent similar delays again.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done extensive pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art is 99% complete. The production quote is in-hand and ready to be initiated. Several fees and partners have been paid in advance for this production, as well.\nThis process has been improved due to the challenges encountered in previous projects, and we have prepared even more in-advance than years past.\n\n2. We are working with a highly-experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods, pre-press checkpoints, and freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We also plan to provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with experienced fulfillment partners with a wide range of options. Amazon has been immensely effective for quickly distributing our products within the USA. We will again consider our options for international shipping when the time comes, both Happyshops and ShipFromChina have worked out very well in the past.\n\nAs always, we will pay close attention to our shipping and manufacturing options to make sure we are making responsible decisions all the way down to the end-user's experience. We delayed Overworld's production intentionally to ensure the components could be improved to the standard that our backers expect to receive and we aim to never need do so again.\n\nThe only thing we are more dedicated to than the quality of our products is backer communication. We will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. We will be present daily during the project to answer any questions you have! We read every comment. We will also provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress throughout the entire journey, we want you to be a part of the creative process as early-adopters of our products.\n\nThank you for your confidence and support!!

If you're interested in purchasing the original Pixel Glory, you can visit our website for more information!  \nhttps://www.zaftygames.com/collections/pixel-glory\nPixel Glory - The Heroic Dungeon is a new expansion featuring 5 new exclusive spells, and 51 familiar monsters but with all new abilities and a heroic difficulty - this is a difficult dungeon to conquer, even for the best wizards.  \nDue to us reaching a special stretch goal, all cards in the heroic dungeon are holographic!\n\nWe sold out of Pixel Glory: Light & Shadow, and it's time to reprint!  We've been a publishing company first on Kickstarter with the original Pixel Glory back in 2013!  We don't like the idea of trying to maximize profit and essentially exploit our Kickstarter community.  \nThe Kickstarter community is single handily responsible for changing our lives, and helping Russell and I launch a game company that was originally expected to be a resume booster into a company that is slowly becoming our life's work.  We're more interested in expressing gratitude to the community that's willing to pay money to support our games months in advance than to look at them as wallets that we should work to exploit more money out of.  We've actually stopped spending money on advertising and doing stretch goals for our Kickstarters because it just doesn't sit well to prioritize income off the Kickstarter community for us.  \nPay What You Want is intended to let people get the new stuff for the game they already own for essentially free. If you want to pledge more, that's awesome!  Seriously, thank you.  \nIf not, that's awesome too!  You already own our game which is amazing, and you want the new stuff for it which means you probably like it, play it, and share it with others which is amazing.  A minimum pledge is far from anything other than your support, and we're super grateful.  \nWe are a small team of ladies and gentlemen that like to treat gamers like the ladies and gentleman that they are. This means, we will provide you with an experience that is professional, honest, transparent, and most importantly, respectful from beginning to end. It's a horrible thing to see hobby game companies treat the people that keep them afloat as just a customer, and that is not what we are about. \nBy March, we have published seven games with several expansions. We have successfully fulfilled 9 Kickstarters, delivered the majority of those campaigns early, and released two games without Kickstarter.  We look forward to successfully delivering the rewards from this, our 10th, campaign!

Over the past decade, our library of gateway and filler games have entertained, inspired, and provided an opportunity to make memories around the game table, and it all started with our flagship title, Tsuro: The Game of the Path.  We couldn\u2019t think of a better way to celebrate this 10 year milestone than by returning to the series that started it all - so we welcome you to the launch of a brand new Tsuro game!\nLong ago, a vengeful god stole the stars from the night sky. To illuminate the night, brave people released glowing paper lanterns toward the heavens. This act of hope summoned clever magical phoenixes, who soared through the sky and raced toward the lanterns. \nAs the birds flew from lantern to lantern, their enchanted touch transformed the lanterns into brilliant new stars! Before the people's very eyes, the night sky became illuminated with beauty, all because of the firebirds.  The phoenix that creates a constellation of seven new stars will illuminate the night sky and once again restore balance to Tsuro...the path of life! \nIn Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, an exhilarating new entry in the classic Tsuro series, each player is a phoenix, soaring across the board in an effort to reach glowing lanterns and transform them into new stars in the night sky.  The first player to collect seven star tokens wins the game!\nTsuro: Phoenix Rising builds upon the foundation of classic Tsuro \u2013 you must play tiles to extend your path, traverse the board, and be aware of your surroundings \u2013 but it adds exciting new features such as double-sided path tiles that allow for diagonal movement and can be flipped and rotated to choose your destination, as well as a revolutionary new molded board.  As a phoenix, you also have the astounding ability to rise from the ashes and return to the board once per game! \nAll New Gameplay! \u2013 Become a phoenix!  Soar across the board, flipping and rotating the double-sided tiles to build your path on the revolutionary new modular board.\nNew Twist on classic Tsuro \u2013 Builds upon the foundation of Tsuro \u2013 create your path, stay on the board \u2013 but introduces exciting new elements such as set collection, strategic board manipulation\u2026and the ability to rise from your ashes and return!\nExclusive Kickstarter Content! \u2013 Pledge now so you don\u2019t miss out!

Some core gameplay elements remain, such as placing tiles and moving your pawn along the path.  However, as a Phoenix, your turns in the game will now consist of extending your path, moving your Phoenix pawn, transforming Lanterns into Stars, and scoring Stars to make a constellation!\nFor additional copies of the standard retail edition of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising, manually add $40 per game to your pledge.

Retailer orders will be shipped with all other Kickstarter orders prior to standard distribution. Your final order and payment will not be finalized until the game is ready to ship.  Orders must be placed in case quantities (6 units per case); maximum two cases per location. \nPhysical store verification will be required; you must provide the store name, store address, phone number, EIN number, and website or Facebook page.

Result of the verification process by Calliope Games will be final.  \nNOTE: International retailer copies will be shipped at the same time as all international backer copies; international freight forwarding may cause delays in fulfillment.  \nThe truth is, we packed all possible quality and value in the presentation of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising.  Upgraded tile thickness?  Done.  Fancy components?  Included.  Amazing tray?  You got it!!  So we can't approach stretch goals the same way other campaigns might.\nInstead, we are going to treat stretch goals as a bonus for backers, to celebrate the entire Tsuro series!\nEveryone at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer pledge levels will receive all unlocked stretch goals when Tsuro: Phoenix Rising is fulfilled!  No additional charge or shipping will be required!  \nA note about grouping multiple copies of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising:\nEach copy of Tsuro: Phoenix Rising at the Standard Retail Edition, Kickstarter Exclusive Set, Legacy of Tsuro, or Way of the Retailer levels will come with one of each stretch goal item, so you can put together a group pledge and every copy will come with the goodies!  This also means retailers will be able to provide the stretch goal items for all copies!\nWe are offering subsidized shipping costs in order to strike the best balance of value for our backers and actual cost to us. We have strategically partnered with trusted fulfillment partners around the world experienced in shipping Kickstarter rewards.\n*See Update #2 for list of EU Neighbor countries. \nThe above costs reflect the Standard Retail Edition and Kickstarter Exclusive Set pledge levels; Way of the Retailer and Legacy of Tsuro levels may be slightly higher due to quantity of boxes to be shipped.  Shipping costs will be charged after the campaign ends through CrowdOx. \n10 years ago, Calliope Games began as a collaboration between Dawne Weisman, Jordan Weisman, and Ray Wehrs. All of us are experienced game industry professionals who have worked together since 1999 when we collectively launched WizKids. Calliope Games has been producing and selling quality tabletop games since 2009. Our products are inspired by family for families. To date we have released 19 titles, many of which were brought to life here on Kickstarter!\nAt Calliope Games, we publish fun, affordable, family-style tabletop games for all to enjoy.  \nWith gamers in mind, our games make the perfect \"gateway\" or \"filler\" game. They allow you to easily draft your non-gamer friends into your favorite hobby. Calliope games are excellent for starting out game night and are easily played between heavier games. It\u2019s important to point out to our non-gamer friends that we do take a slightly different approach to the games we produce. At Calliope, we focus on entertaining adults; however, the games we produce allow children to compete with their parents without the parents \u201cthrowing\u201d the game. It\u2019s a really a pretty simple concept; instead of having the parents step down into the child\u2019s world, we are inviting the child to step up into the parents' world.  \nFor gamers and non-gamers alike, the results of our efforts are games that are accessible by all players regardless of skill level or age, play in under 60 minutes, are affordably priced, and most of all\u2026 are a blast to play!\nIf you would like to add other amazing games from our catalog to your pledge, you may do so by manually adjusting your pledge using the amounts below.

The biggest foreseeable risks we currently face are manufacturing in China and shipping issues from China to our warehouse here in the US.\n\nEach of these risks is greatly minimized with Calliope Games. Our factories have been with us for many years. They know how we work and the quality we expect. In addition, our freight forwarder and fulfillment teams are world class and have over 30 years of expertise to rely upon. If any issues arise, we will know of them far in advance and will be able to overcome them.\n\nUpcoming tariffs may influence costs as well. Typically these are 10%-25% of our total manufacturing cost. Should tariffs affect prices, these will be reflected in the post-campaign shipping and fulfillment cost.\n\nAs far as the unseen risks... we know they are there and we have built a safety margin into our costs of goods sold to prepare us for the unforeseen.

A modern version of the classic game Rallyman, complete with all new illustrations and fine-tuned rules, Rallyman GT will have you pushing your luck to be the first over the finishing line!\nRoll your dice to race along the track as fast as you can, but beware \u2013 get too many Warning signs and you\u2019ll spin out!\nRallyman GT is an addictively simple racing game with a lot of strategic depth. Plan your trajectory with care to tackle dangerous turns, cut off other drivers and burn that rubber until your luck runs out\u2026\nA fast, exciting racing game with simple mechanics and rules\nA fun new take on the classic game; Rallyman GT is a multiplayer, GT version of the original, optimised for racing against your friends!\nSolo players won't feel left out though as the game's renowned Solo mode is also back with full support!\nA beautiful new edition with artwork by Lo\u00efc Muzy\nHexagonal tiles allow players to create their own tracks\nA 1-6 player game lasting around 60 minutes.\nRallyman: GT tracks are made of hexagonal tiles that you may set up however you wish! You can either use one of the 8 tracks included in the Rule book or invent your own. With 32 double-sided tiles to choose from, the possibilities are endless!\nTiles have one Urban side with 2 lanes and one Rural side with 3 lanes. Try racing on both and see the strategic possibilities that open up or, better yet, use the converter tiles to create bottlenecks, wide open straights and more!\nOnce track setup is complete, the players begin the race in the starting grid. Their positions are chosen randomly by drawing speed tokens, and the player in Pole Position becomes the First player.\nRallyman GT is a roll and move racing game, so to move, you\u2019ll be rolling dice!\n\nThe base mechanic of the game is very simple: 1 die = 1 space of movement.\n\nThese dice do not have values as you would find on a regular D6, but each die has one or more Warning signs. Rolling a Warning sign still allows you to move, but if you accumulate too many in one turn you\u2019ll lose control of your car and spin out, losing time and potentially taking damage\u2026\n\nAt the start of their turn, the active player plans out their trajectory by placing their dice on the track, following the route they plan to take.\n\nThere are three types of dice to choose from:\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your trajectory by laying your dice out on the track, you\u2019ll have a choice to make. You can choose to either roll your dice one by one, which allows you to end your turn whenever you choose if you\u2019re getting too many Warning signs.\nOr, if you\u2019re feeling lucky, you can choose to go Flat Out, and roll them all at once! If your roll is successful, you gain the same number of Focus tokens as the number of dice you rolled.\nFocus tokens are a precious resource during the game \u2013 allowing your driver to have brief spurts of intense concentration. You can spend Focus tokens to secure your dice rolls - automatically passing them without the risk of getting a Warning symbol, so use them wisely!\nIf you get too many Warning symbols in your roll (3 in normal conditions), then you spin out! The consequences of a Loss of Control are determined by the gear you were in at the time, and the Danger level of the terrain you were driving on. Each player has a Dashboard card showing how to resolve their Loss of Control \u2013 from simply starting their next turn in gear 0, to skipping a turn and/or drawing damage tokens!\nThese damage tokens are drawn at random from a bag and have different effects, from changing the weather conditions to giving you less dice to roll. Damage tokens are cumulative and can add up fast! Making a Pit Stop will allow you to repair damage to your car, but will cause you to lose even more time, which might make you think twice about taking too many risks\u2026\n\nThe core box comes with two Dashboards for each car: one with Asphalt tires and one with Rain tires. Asphalt tires are great all round tires but lose a lot of their effectiveness in the rain. Rain tires are much more effective in wet weather but slightly less so on dry roads.\nHowever, in this Kickstarter version of the game you'll be recieving an additional set of tires: Soft tires! These tires provide excellent traction, however they do wear out VERY fast so you will no doubt have to perform a pit stop at some time during the race, especially if you're doing more than one lap!\nYou can start a race with the tires of your choosing and, should you feel the need; you can perform a pit stop during the race in order to simply swap out your tires (Ie. Changing out one dashboard for another).\nThe base mechanics of Rallyman GT may be simple, but don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 the game has a lot of strategic depth to it that will keep players coming back for more !\n\nThe tracks in Rallyman GT contain challenging twists and turns, represented by corner spaces. These spaces have speed limitations and special conditions that drivers must adhere to in order to cross them safely. For example, some spaces may only be crossed while going at a certain speed or lower. Considering that you may only roll each Gear dice once per turn, these speed limitations can make things tricky! Others cause the driver to automatically add a warning sign to their roll. Some of these conditions can be avoided by moving into the space diagonally instead of via the same lane - in the same way as cutting across makes taking a corner easier in real life driving - so choose your trajectory carefully!\n\n  Of course, during a game of Rallyman GT, you\u2019re also going to have to deal with other drivers!\n\nOther vehicles can get in your way, forcing you to make difficult manoeuvres on dangerous corners, or even cutting you off completely! Speed is vital \u2013 you cannot overtake another car unless you\u2019re going at the same speed. This can push you to make strategic - and often risky - choices to avoid being left behind.\n\nAt the end of their turn, players must place a Speed marker next to their car, showing which Gear they were in at the time. The Speed tokens have both a black and a white side, to help players keep track of who has already played their turn.\nIn Rallyman GT, speed is everything: at the start of each new round, the turn order will change. This determined by:\n\nSpeed: the player with the highest speed\nDistance: In case of a tie, the player the furthest along the track goes first.\nInside Lane: In case of a tie on speed and distance, the player on the inside track relative to the next corner goes first. \nSo, ending your turn at the highest speed possible may result in you playing twice in a row. Or, you might prefer to hang back on certain key spaces on the track to give your opponents a hard time!\n  If only one player crosses the finish line during the round, then they take the trophy! If several players cross the line during the same round, then the winner is determined by the exactly the same criteria as the turn order: Speed, Distance, Inside Lane!\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the original Rallyman games, or if you\u2019re just a lover of solo games, then fear not - Rallyman GT also has a great Solo Mode, which will allow a single player to go up against the clock to get the best lap time possible!\nSolo Mode is played almost identically to a multiplayer game of Rallyman GT. At the end of each turn, the player simply jots down their Speed (meaning the gear the ended their turn in) on a Print and Play scoring sheet. Depending on your speed, a certain number of seconds will be added to your overall time. At the end of the race, leftover Focus tokens will take seconds off your result. So, do you use them to play it safe, or do you go try for the best time possible?\n\nOnce you have your total lap time, will you be able to beat it? Take part in monthly, community organised races and test your mettle against other pilots!\n\n\nYou can download the Beta Rulebook HERE.\n\nPlease note that this is a BETA rulebook. It has not been set out for print. It may be subject to minor changes and some grammatical errors may still be present.\n\n\nHow do I include add-ons in my pledge?\n1.

A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to complete it. Here you'll be able to tell us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase.\nWe\u2019ve been working on Rallyman: GT with JC for the better part of a year now. After many internal development sessions, feedback from playtests at major events and from the previous rules document which has been available online for some time now; we\u2019ve arrived at the current rules set which we\u2019re very happy with.\nAll Core box content, Expansions and Stretch Goals have been fully developed and tested.\nGraphically, the majority of the core box is complete with only a few minor elements left to finalise. The expansions and stretch goals are partially illustrated and should be completed by January next year.\nPre-production wise the entirety of the project has already been reviewed and approved by the manufacturer so we\u2019re expecting no serious issues during production.\nTherefore, we\u2019re expecting a very smooth finalisation phase, post campaign, and look forward to getting your games to you on time, if not earlier!\nHowever, all this depends on the route the campaign takes. We have prepared as much as possible but developments during or after the campaign may cause delays so please bear this in mind!\nJean-Christophe Bouvier burst into the French boardgaming scene after the success of the original Rallyman. Designed and developped by him, then sold from his home garage, the game was a hit and continues to be quite a find in the second hand market! As a Rally driver himself, he wanted to make a game that represented his passion. The original Rallyman has been out of print for over 6 years, but has maintained a base of loyal fans who continue to play to this day.\nYou can read our interview with JC HERE!\nIllustrator and character-design specialist, Lo\u00efc Muzy has been working in the world of gaming since 2008 and as Holy Grail Games' in-house illustrator and Art Director since early 2018. He started by designing minatures for wargaming, then made a name for himself in the world of board games (Fire team zero, Mythic Battles, Orcquest,...). He has also worked on video games projects, such as some based in the Warhammer 40000 universe. He's best known for his illustrations for Call of Cthulhu (role-playing and other derivative products) as an illustrator with Sans-d\u00e9tours editions. Lo\u00efc has been painting figurines for over 20 years, and is passionate about fantasy universes.\nHoly Grail Games is a board game publisher that was born from its creators\u2019 desire to make great, unique games. HGG brings together the experience and passion of Jamie Johnson (community manager on multiple projects including Conan and The 7th Continent Kickstarter campaigns), Olivier Melison (entrepreneur, passionate player and game author) and Eric Dubus (History teacher, Game author and human loudspeaker). They couldn't do that however without the help of the rest of the team including Georgina, Quentin, Owen, Raphael, Jonhatan, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois...\nWell, the real question is - why not? Kickstarter and crowdfunding in general are amazing tools for game publishers and have revolutionized our industry. Financially it is one of the most beneficial routes of publishing and helps us ensure that everyone involved in the project earns a good living from each game. At the end of the day, this is what allows us to continue doing what we love! Kickstarter is also an amazing communication tool, allowing us to reach out directly in a unique and engaging way to those most interested in what we have to offer.\nBut that's not all. Beyond good business sense, Kickstarter allows us to prioritise quality over quantity. It allows us to only deal with games that we love and believe in 100%, taking the time and care necessary to push their development as far as it will go.\nWith the leeway and support afforded to us by these kind of projects, we can take a normal gaming experience and make it extraordinary. Via both material and content, our aim is to have all our games provide a unique, exciting, engaging and luxury experience!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game by November 2019. This may seem like a long time as the game itself is already quite advanced (as detailed in the \"development\" section). However, knowing the intricacies of board game design, manufacturing and shipping, we'd rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\nShipnaked will be taking care of North America whereas Meeple Logistics will be ensuring delivery In Europe and the surrounding regions as well as other worldwide destinations.\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge. We have however done our best to reduce the costs as much as possible. After the campaign has concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase.\n \"Friendly Shipping\" means that you'll pay no import tax in Europe, the US & Canada.\nBelow are the prices for delivery of one copy of Rallyman to each Country.\nPurchasing multiple boxes and/or expansions will incur a small increase in postage costs to cover packaging and handling.\nAdditional copies of the core game will cost around 3\u20ac in shipping\nAdd ons will cost an additional around 2\u20ac in shipping depending on the size.\nIf you have any questions about shipping, please don't hesitate to ask us in the comments section!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first Kickstarter.

This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees (10%)- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked. After that date we will not be able to process refunds.\n\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented whilst the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Rallyman: GT 1.1 rules", "update_content": "Greetings Drivers!\n\nFirst of all, a happy new year to all of you!\n\nWe have some pretty cool stuff for you today: The revised Rallyman: GT rulebook!\n\nWe touched on it previously, but with the success of GT since its release and Dirt on the horizon, Rallyman is much more than just one game now. We want each new addition to stand on its own, but be compatible with one another so as to give you guys as many different racing experiences as we can!\n\nWith this in mind, we went back to the original GT rulebook, not just to integrate the feedback we\u2019ve received since the game\u2019s release last year, but also to create a good foundation for what would be following in its wake. This includes making sure that the structure, terminology and general spirit of the rulebook could be used in any racing setting. The goal of this is that whatever Rallyman you pick up in the future feels and plays like a Rallyman game should.\n\n\nOne of the core mechanics of Rallyman is how the turn order is decided each round. For GT that\u2019s Speed > Distance > Position. Distance refers to how far along the track a player is, and to the existing text we\u2019ve added the following line:\n\n\n\nThis is a very minor change in terms of determining the turn order and in that respect isn\u2019t even needed. However, by referring to the front edge of the car\u2019s space we can easily clarify some other situations, such as Fast Lanes.\n\n\nWhilst the original rule did have the advantage of being simple, there are some rare situations where it becomes too much of a hindrance for those in no way involved or near to the Loss of Control that caused it.\n\nSo, at the cost of slightly complicating the rule, we\u2019ve made it much more thematic and less impactful on players not in the vicinity of the crash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re big believers in gaming aids as tools to help speed up gameplay. However, the ones in Rallyman didn\u2019t really have enough space to contain a pertinent amount of information on each element. It was still passable in English but in other language versions the font had to be reduced a lot in order to make things fit.\n\nTherefore, we\u2019re removing the gaming aid cards from future print runs and replacing the illustration on the back of the rulebook with a full page gaming aid that players can pass between them. It includes much more information as well as page numbers for quick-referencing more detailed rules.\n\nThese are the three biggest changes present in this new version but you\u2019ll find all the corrections and clarifications from the FAQ/errata document in the rulebook as well as other things such as the Redline rule.\n\nAlso, this document is not final. We\u2019d love to hear what you have to say about these changes and if you think there\u2019s anything we could make better!\n\n\nThe DIRT campaign included a \u20ac2 errata pack that replaces the handful of errors in the original campaign. Please note that we will not be able to include a printed version of the new booklet in this pack. As you may know, we priced the errata pack at cost. The downside to that is there\u2019s no wiggle room to add anything else to it. We will of course make both a low res and print quality version available for you to download. If we have the possibility of making this updated rule available in a future campaign, we will endeavor to do so.\n\nHope you guys like the changes, let us know below!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Rallyman: DIRT is ending soon!", "update_content": "Hi Drivers,\nWe just wanted to let you know that our campaign for Rallyman: DIRT, which is currently running on Kickstarter, ends today at 8pm CEST.

Once each year, Taron releases the toughest gang of war prisoners into the royal Colosseum to fight for their freedom. \nIn Lockup: A Roll Player Tale, players command squadrons of captured minions. They must keep their suspicion from the guards under control while hiring the strongest crew and building the most powerful items. The crew with the highest reputation wins the game and a chance to fight for their freedom\nLockup is a worker placement game with elements of bluffing, set collection, resource management, and variable scoring to make sure each game feels different. Collect and play tome cards at the right moment to get the upper hand. Each player's crew has members with different strengths and abilities. Knowing when and where to use each member of the crew is key to success in Kulbak. \nLockup is played over six rounds. Each round is divided into three phases:\nROLL CALL - Players take turns placing their minions in different parts of the Kulbak Prison, some face up showing a unit's strength and some face down, hiding the strength from the other players.  \nLIGHTS OUT - Each area location on the board is scored based on the strength of each player's crew. Players receive resources and have opportunities to recruit goons and build items.  \nPATROL PHASE - The game board is prepared for the next round of play. The guards then patrol Kulbak and can call a raid, punishing the players who have attracted the suspicion of the guards in previous turns.\nWhen playing the Solitary Mode of Lockup, the player is isolated in an old wing of the prison. Instead of playing against other players, the player is playing against an automated opponent \u2013 the guards.\nEach round, the guards are dispatched to different locations of Kulbak, and are slowly revealed, sometimes even calling for reinforcements. \n Gain the upper hand on each of the three levels of difficulty in Solitary Mode and score higher than the corrupt guards to secure your position at the top when King Taron arrives.\nWant to take a closer look to how Lockup works?

Capture the hearts of weapons to level them up in this \u201cshack-and-slash\u201d dungeon crawling adventure. Forge relationships and save Love itself!\nWe've decided $200k USD is our final stretch goal. Although we'll continue using your money to improve the game's polish and quality, we don't feel comfortable promising any further features or additional content. So... thank you for making our dream come true! Now it's our turn to repay the favor.\n Boyfriend Dungeon is an action-RPG dungeon crawler in which the weapons you use transform into beautiful people -- take them on dates to level them up and become more powerful together.\nDate up to nine weapons, from dancing swords to heart-piercing daggers\nGenerated action-combat dunj and challenges! Stay sharp!\nVarious combat styles. For example, hit hard and dodge quickly with the dagger, or take on crowds with Lasersaber\nInclusive, tasteful approach to gender and sexuality, including male, female, and non-binary romance\nLet's get to the point: take your weapon-babes on romantic outings, such as to the club or the beach\nThe couple that slays together, stays together.\n This campaign not only supports us making our dream game, but also offers you once-in-a-lifetime merchandise, including weapon-dating-based mugs, body pillowcases, pins, and other extremely practical objects.\nAwards: Boyfriend Dungeon has already won two awards at BitSummit, and has been selected for showcases, including the PAX West Indie Megabooth and the Damage Camp Arcade 2018.  \nPlatforms: Boyfriend Dungeon is developed by us, Kitfox Games, and we already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC, Mac, and Linux! Check out our Steam coming soon page and after you back us, feel free to add us to your wishlist\u2026\nWe will also offer DRM-free versions of PC, Mac, and Linux via the Humble Store.\nWhat about consoles? Or other stores? We\u2019re not ready to talk about consoles yet, sorry! This campaign is specifically to support us being able to make the best possible desktop version and merchandise.\nKitfox Games is an award-winning game studio. Boyfriend Dungeon is the fourth title we're bringing to Steam. For more information about our past games, scroll down to the section below entitled The Team.\nAs of the start of this campaign, we've now revealed all 5 of the weapons you can date (Talwar, Dagger, Epee, Lasersaber, and Glaive).\nThis campaign, in addition to helping us finish the game, will fund a 6th weapon... the cat, Brass Knuckles!\nWe don\u2019t want to give away too many spoilers, so we won\u2019t tell you everything about the weapons, but we\u2019ve prepared these dating profiles so you can get an idea of who you might prefer! If you're more interested in their combat abilities and play-styles, scroll down to see their individual tactics.\nAlternately, you can take our Wielder Test to see which one we would recommend for you.\nThe talwar is a type of curved sword or sabre from the Indian Subcontinent. (Wikipedia)\nSunder says: \"Hey, gorgeous. I didn't expect to meet someone like you in the dunj... I hope I can keep you safe. I've been around a while but don't believe everything you hear -- some people are jealous, or don't know how to forgive. But you're the open-minded type, right?\"\nDaggers have been used throughout human experience for close combat confrontations... (Wikipedia)\nValeria says: \"Oh, hey, you're cute! So.. what's your deal? You can tell me. If you want to, I mean. What? Oh, don't worry about him. He's just an old friend, looking out for me. Let's talk about you instead. Maybe you should come by my studio sometime and I'll paint you..\"\nThe entire body is the valid target area. A successful \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer must be able to anticipate their opponent's moves and strike their opponent at the correct time. (Wikipedia)\nIsaac says: \"Goodness. Let's get down to facts, shall we? I may be new to the dunj, but I know plenty about fencing. Hold onto me tightly, but not too tight. Deep breaths. Parry, then thrust. Practice makes perfect.\"\nWhen a Lasersaber powers up, he can be dangerous, but most of the time, he prefers to recharge his batteries.\nSeven says: \"Hey. I want to keep our.. friendship.. secret for now, if that's okay with you. My agent and fans are a little high-maintenance and I just want to relax. Maybe we can watch TV together sometime?\"\nThis class of polearms [is rated] above all other individual hand-to-hand combat weapons. (Wikipedia)\nSawyer says: \"UHH! I'm late for class, but.. hi! Um. Since you seem to have your life together, maybe you can show me how to cook? Would that be okay? I wouldn't want to waste your time. Let me know, but no worries if you're too busy.\"\nAnd this Kickstarter, if it succeeds, will help fund a sixth weapon, Brass Knuckles! \nBrass knuckles are designed to preserve and concentrate a punch's force... (Wikipedia)\nPocket says: \"Meow! Mew meow meow. PRR!\" Then he curled up in a ball and fell asleep. When we tried to reach him for further comment, he growled and hissed at us! It seems he's not a lapcat by nature.. and certainly not a romantic partner. Platonic love can be fulfilling, too!\nRowan says: \"Hi? This is sudden for me. I'm going to need some time. I'm - never mind. I don't want to bother you. I'll call you, but... please be patient.\" \nThrough your support, we've funded Rowan the Scythe, our second dateable non-binary weapon! They're being designed by Hato Moa, creator of Hatoful Boyfriend.\nLeah says: \u201cHey, cutie. Thanks for including me. I usually like to train alone, but maybe we can try the dunj as a team sport. It\u2019ll be an adventure. Just promise you\u2019ll try your best\u2026 and play fair.\u201d\nYou've manged to fund Leah the Hammer as another stretch goal, our second dateable female weapon!\nAxe says: \"It's a beautiful day, so... what do you say we leave these computers behind and just go hang out on the beach? Feel free to come surf with me, but... I might not talk much. I hope that's okay. I'd still like your company.\"  \nYou funded the Axe! His name will be voted on in our exclusive Discord server (any reward tier at VIP/$35 or above). Invites will be sent out for it soon after the Kickstarter ends, so hold on tight!\nYou\u2019re free to date only one weapon if you are the monoblade-ous type of person, but nobody minds if you favor grabbing multiple hilts. As you level up your love with them, each Love Rank lets you proceed further with that character\u2019s plot line(s), and also offers combat bonuses.\nYou\u2019ve been unlucky in love, but you came to Verona Beach to learn from your Cousin Jesse, who\u2019s promised to help you out. Who are you exactly? You choose! You can customize your character, and choose from him, her, or them as pronouns. This doesn\u2019t affect who you can date or what options you have.\nFair Verona Beach, where we lay our scene, is in many ways a typical southern California town. The weather\u2019s great, the surf is high, and the slang 'dunj' is dangerous. In this gig economy, some people turn to killing monsters for a quick buck\u2026 while others discover they can transform into weapons.  \nVerona Beach is populated by various other people (baristas, security guards, shop keepers, etc). They\u2019re mostly pretty nice, and some of them even care about you!  \nBut something darker lurks in Verona Beach\u2026\nUnfortunately, kissing can\u2019t solve all of your problems. Sometimes, you need a sword. Wait, stop kissing the sword. Wield it instead!\nThese days, kids get money and meet people by killing monsters in the dunj, making the world a safer place in the process. Be brave -- local authorities are willing to give you basic medical attention afterwards. Clearing local infestations is a group effort!    \nThe first dunj is the Verona Beach Center, a mall overrun by creatures most hideous. We have two more dunjs in progress, the Nightclub and something secret! Each dunj features different monster types, challenges, music, potential romantic spots to find, and secrets to discover.    \nBoss monsters may also interrupt your dunj flow, so train up and make sure you and your weapon are both ready for a tough fight!  \nBoss concepts\nSometimes there are enemies that swarm; sometimes you need to focus your attacks; sometimes you need to move around to avoid an onslaught! Some weapons will be better-suited to some dunjs and enemy encounters than others.  \nIt\u2019s up to you to find the best tactics in each situation\u2026 or you could just get more experience and level up until you one-shot them, if you prefer. A general idea of how each weapon plays: \nLeft: Talwar | Right: Dagger\nTalwar attacks and combos tend to cover a wider area, while Dagger attacks and combos tend to be quick and focus on a narrower area. \nLeft: Epee | Right: Lasersaber\nEpee attacks and combos tend to require precision but have the capability to stun, while Lasersaber attacks and combos can be upgraded to reflect projectiles and do ranged attacks! \nAll of these (plus the development of Glaive and Brass Knuckles) are likely to evolve as we continue to work on the game. We\u2019ve made good progress, but our Kickstarter backers will help us nail down many of the details in the coming months. \nWhat if it\u2019s too easy or too hard? We\u2019ll have difficulty modes, but we\u2019d also like to offer special challenges and opt-in modifiers for folks that want to, for example, make enemies have more health, or want to fight optional bosses, in exchange for more loot. This means the game will be complete-able at a basic level even by folks who normally stick to dating sims, while also offering some \"fun\" to those poor masochists who have been damaged by Dark Souls (you know who you are). \nA good relationship with your weapon starts with a romantic date. Luckily for you, Verona Beach is filled with dreamy date spots like the local museum, sunny beach, or flashy nightclub. Make the right choices and you might find your weapons warming up to you!\nAs you date each weapon, you\u2019ll learn more about them and earn their trust, making you a more effective team in combat. \nBut, in this game as in real life, every relationship is a little bit different in its benefits and demands. Some partners will teach you how to do more damage, while others will help you use skills more effectively.\nEven when you're busy slaying monsters, the dunj will feature spots for some mini-dates, because love knows no bounds. Above all, you'll be able to cultivate meaningful relationships full of supportive and inviting weapon babes... it just might take a bit of charm to get them out of their sheathes. \nYou\u2019re probably wondering what you\u2019re going to get from backing! Well, I mean, other than the eternal love and gratitude of the Kitfox team, of course.\nReceive a dev-signed postcard from Verona Beach! Available in the Long Distance Relationship tier and above.\nThe Kickstarter-exclusive enamel pin, available in the Bae Box Set tier and above.\nThe Bae Box Set includes an elegant rose USB key, in which to hide your heart's secrets.\n  Everything in the Bae Box tier. Includes: the game, soundtrack, rose USB key, enamel pin, and sticker sheet, all in a beautiful box for your shelf.\nTemperature changing Boyfriend Dungeonmaster mugs of infinite thirst. Included in the Ultimate Collector's Edition.\nTransform Talwar OR Dagger at will from their human form (front) to weapon form (back). One of your choice is included in the Ultimate Collector's Edition.\nThis super-soft, high-quality cotton blend Sword Smoocher shirt color combo (white on black) is only available via the Ultimate Collector's Edition tier!\nEverything in the Ultimate Collector's Edition tier. Includes: T-Shirt, Messenger Bag, Stickers, Soundtrack CD, Mug, Pin, USB Rose game copy, Collector's Edition Box Set, and a Body Pillowcase of your choosing\nThe music, sound effects and audio design overall will be managed by Omar Dabbous, audio designer of GNOG by KO_OP.  \nThe soundtrack of Boyfriend Dungeon is an hour of all-original summery weapon-pop from the master composer Marskye (also of GNOG), often featuring the vocals of Madeleine McQueen.    \nTheir collaboration has already produced a few amazing tracks, including the main theme song you hear in the trailer, \u201cWithout a Weapon\u201d (Soundcloud link):   \n  And, presented here for the first time, a preview of the new soon-to-be-hit single, Spellbound:\n If you back the project now, you\u2019re sure to get notified when we post more songs and track previews in the future, during and after the campaign.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Background Illustration: Jessica Mao is creating most of the game\u2019s background illustrations! They're an illustrator from Toronto, currently working as a Jr. Art Director for mobile games in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their past work includes animations and illustrations for Titmouse, Studio Yotta, Konami and Penguin Random House. Jessica would transform into a Shield in the dunj.\nAnimation: Sunder Raj from Particle Beam made the beautiful animation of Talwar's transformation! We'd love to hire Particle Beam to make transformation sequences for the rest of the weapons, but we'll see what we can afford... Sunder from Particle Beam would transform into a Durian in the dunj.\nJapanese Localization & Publishing: We loved working with Kakehashi Games to bring the best version of Moon Hunters and The Shrouded Isle to Japan, so we'll be working with them again for Boyfriend Dungeon. The lead of Kakehashi, Zach, would transform into a Kusarigama in the dunj.\nMerch Design & Manufacturing: We were really impressed by the Moon Hunters indiebox, so we decided to work with them to create the Boyfriend Dungeon merch, which resulted in the luscious tiers of rewards here. If you're looking to make money from shirts & pins, we recommend Indiebox, so hit up James at ConferenceMerch.com (tell him Tanya sent ya)! The lead of Indiebox, James, would transform into Nunchucks in the dunj.\nHey, we're Kitfox Games! We're an independent Montreal-based games studio with a soft spot for exploring and discovering new, dangerous worlds. Previously, we made Shattered Planet, Moon Hunters, The Shrouded Isle, and in addition to making Boyfriend Dungeon we're publishing Six Ages.\nThe Boyfriend Dungeon team\nTanya X. Short (@tanyaxshort): Captain, Lead Designer. Led Kitfox in creating Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and wrote for and published The Shrouded Isle. Previously was a senior designer on The Secret World and Age of Conan. Tanya has never said she didn't date a weapon, so you could probably say this game is based on a true story. Nobody can prove otherwise. Tanya would transform into a Sabre in the dunj.\nXin Ran Liu (@xinranliu): Art Director. Previously art directed Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and illustrated tons of different things, from book covers to band posters to game concept art. Xin would transform into a Chakram in the dunj.  \nMarcelo Perez (@scientistsloth): Lead Programmer. Marcelo (almost) single-handedly coded the Moon Hunters cooking system and also ported Moon Hunters to all the consoles! Now that he\u2019s almost recovered from such a feat, he\u2019s making sure Boyfriend Dungeon is better-structured for porting. Marcelo would transform into a Meteor Hammer in the dunj.\nKira Boom (@snowkittykira): Dungeon Programmer. Kira was the primary combat programmer for Moon Hunters, and previously did lots of programming on FRACT OSC. She\u2019s also part of Mindfungus, which released the adorable Cityglitch! Kira is a wielder, not a weapon.\nVictoria Tran (@thevtran): Community Manager & Public Relations. Victoria has been managing the Kitfox events, community, press, and social media for over a year now, so if you\u2019ve fallen in love with silly Boyfriend Dungeon gifs, that\u2019s her genius. Victoria would transform into a Bread Knife in the dunj.  \nHey, I Remember Moon Hunters!\nThank you to everyone who backed our first Kickstarter in 2014! Because of their help, and other funding sources, we were able to create our first big game, Moon Hunters! Moon Hunters sold decently well and won some awards, so, it\u2019s hard to complain. Plus we released it with only a few months of delay -- not bad.\nWe learned a few lessons along the way, which we\u2019re applying to Boyfriend Dungeon, like to carefully structure support for potential future DLC. There was also Shattered Planet and the Shrouded Isle, but we didn\u2019t Kickstart them. I hope you still bought them. We sure learned a lot from those, too.\nThere are also a few Kitfoxes working on a different game (you might wonder where Jongwoo went, for example), but they are using a different source of funding, and none of the Kickstarter money will go to them. Speaking of which... \nWithout your help, we don't know when Boyfriend Dungeon will happen or when we can finish the game as it demands. Plus, with this campaign, we can add the cat as a weapon and make all of the dates, dungeons, and everything in between as polished, beautiful, and amazing as they can be. \nWe loved the input we got from Moon Hunters backers, but we felt like we didn't use it enough because we weren't ready for all of your ideas! So we want your feedback to help us shape the game in the years to come.\nWe\u2019re going to be especially interested in feedback on:  \nBalancing and pacing  \nCharacter story arcs & tone/content \nNew item/equipment ideas\nAlthough early beta-testers (from CAD$35+) will have the opportunity to give the most hands-on feedback experience with us, we will post regular updates to Kickstarter, and all backers\u2019 comments will be welcomed and shared among the team.  \nPLUS we wanted to make some unique limited-edition merch and pre-ordering those mugs and t-shirts and pillow cases makes it easier for us to see how many to make. :)  \nPlease back us so that we can get your input, and also deliver sweet merch to sweet people.\nWe\u2019ve already been working on Boyfriend Dungeon for over a year! But this Kickstarter helps us understand how many fans are out there, and how much we can afford to keep pouring our hearts (and wallets) into it.  \nThis is roughly how we will split up the funds:\nAnd, with your help, we not only reached our goal... we reached all of our stretch goals! So we decided to stop scoping up, past $200k, and make the game the best it can be, with the features and content we are already planning. Thank you so much for believing in us!\nOur current language support plans include only English, French, and Japanese, due to the amount of words. We may consider others, depending on community involvement.\nAs for the development schedule, we\u2019re currently in the midst of production that we hope will finish next year, but we will work with Indiebox to mail your physical rewards as soon as we can, even before the game releases.\nThanks for all of your excitement, enthusiasm, and support. If you can't afford to buy the game, we understand.. but please tell any friends or acquaintances you might have that CAN -- every dollar and/or wishlist helps.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKitfox Games is an award-winning studio that has released multiple games, including successfully releasing a Kickstarted game previously (Moon Hunters).

Baker also get the enamel pins at special discounted price!\nTIMELINE\nAugust: Kickstarter starts  \nMid-September: 14 day processing for funds to deposit into bank.\nOctober: Production begins.  \nNovember: Get pins from manufacturer, check out their quality and ship out your pins and rewards.\n\nCOST BREAKDOWN\n\nPin production 70%: The majority of the funds are used to produce the enamel pins as well as cover the manufacture fees and shipping costs. \nShipping & Packing 20%: This is to cover any and all supplies needed to ship out rewards to the bakers which may include: bubble mailers, clear bags, backing cards.. and also the shipping fees that correlate with how many enamel pins you will be receiving.\nKickstarter Fees 10%: Kickstarter charges every successful project a small fee for operating through them as well as all credit card transactions.\n\nPREVIOUS WORK", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter project and is a big responsability, but I'm sure it will works well.\n\nI count with a great manufacturer and the result will be very good. But if there is any setback with the quality of the pins, I will contact my manufacturer immediately to solve the problem (in that case it would be a 2/3 week delay aprox). Enamel pins are filled and polished by hand, so the finish of each piece may vary. I will work closely with the manufacturer to ensure that they are of a good standard and will update backers should any issues arise. I will also personally sort through the pins that will be shipped to backers to make sure I do not send any flawed pins.\n\nAlso I have Etsy, so I have a lot of experience with orders and shippings so you don't have to worry at all.\n\nThe postage method provided for rewards is tracked and certificate for backers. I use Correos postage National and Internacional. Shippings are included in the price you pay, but international backers are responsible for any additional import taxes or customs fees established by their country (usually is not the case).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac6 or more", "title": "\u2661 Three Stickers \u2661 Full Set", "descp": "You'll get;\n- Jiji The Cat sticker\n- Kaonashi No-Face sticker\n- Magpie and Boh sticker\nPrinted on heavyweight UV resistant vinyl, between 4x6cm big.\nINCLUDES:\n3 Stickers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac12 or more", "title": "\u2661 One Pin \u2661", "descp": "You'll get:\n- One pin of your choice from all unlocked pins.\n- Free sticker\nINCLUDES:\n1 Hard Enamel pin\nFree Sticker", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac22 or more", "title": "\u2661 Two Pins \u2661", "descp": "You'll get:\n- Two pins of your choise from all unlocked pins.\n- Free sticker\nINCLUDES:\n2 Hard Enamel Pins\nFree Sticker", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac33 or more", "title": "\u2661 Three Pins \u2661 Full Set", "descp": "You'll get;\n- Three pins of your choice from all unlocked pins.\n- Free sticker\nINCLUDES:\n3 Hard Enamel Pins\nFree Sticker", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac38 or more", "title": "\u2661 Three Pins + Three Stickers \u2661 Full Set", "descp": "You'll get;\n- Full Set of three pins (if unlocked)\n- Full Set of stickers\nINCLUDES:\n3 Stickers\n3 Hard Enamel Pins", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Early Bird \u2661 One Pin \u2661", "descp": "You'll get;\n- One pin of your choice from all unlocked pins.\nINCLUDES:\n1 Hard Enamel pin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac18 or more", "title": "Early Bird \u2661 Two Pins \u2661", "descp": "You'll get;\n- Two pins of your choice from all unlocked pins.\nINCLUDES:\n2 Hard Enamel Pins", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac27 or more", "title": "Early Bird \u2661 Three Pins \u2661", "descp": "You'll get:\n- Three pins of your choice from all unlocked pins\nINCLUDES:\n3 Hard Enamel Pins", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "5 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "All rewards have been sent!", "update_content": "HI guys!

MEEPLOID PANIC AND SIGNAL BOOST CARDS INCLUDED!\nIncoming Transmission is a 10-30 minute, 2-5 (or more) player, game of deduction and strategy. Players must work together to achieve victory, but each side plays with slightly different rules. \nShuffle the tiles, Deal them out as shown, and flip 8 of them over either randomly or in this diamond pattern. Also place the Compass tile near the board so everyone can agree on which way \"North\" is.\nPlayer one takes the seat of MISSION CONTROL. Their job is to review the MISSION CARDS, which only they are permitted to see, and plan the best course of action to fix the station. \nPlayer two, and any additional number of players you wish to add, take(s) the role of the CADET, the lone survivor on the Station. \nThe Cadet side, if more than a single person, may speak freely amongst themselves. These are the multiple voices arguing in the head of the space-mad Cadet. MISSION CONTROL MAY NOT SPEAK and should remain completely poker-faced to the best of their ability to play in the spirit of the game.\nEach round, Mission Control will secretly choose 5 cards from the 11 available COMMAND CARDS which have simple one-word instructions (EAST will move the Cadet one tile East, and so on) and SHUFFLE THEM.\nThey must choose carefully because only 2 of each direction are available and 1 of each interaction command (COLLECT, DEPLOY, and REPAIR) exist in the deck.  \nDamaged tiles must be Repaired before they can be picked up or used to complete a Mission. Colorblind-friendly iconography helps to differentiate the Repaired side from the Damaged side.\nUpdated to be even more friendly to players with Color-Vision challenges\nAfter Mission Control shuffles the 5 Command cards and then turns over a TRANSMISSION CARD. These cards will be made into a stack when you set up the game, each one counts for one round of Communication before the Station self-destructs. The Transmission Cards will show you the current communication conditions. \n- ? - Lines are ordinary shuffled commands.    \nNumbered, Green Lines allow Mission control to show the Cadet a specific command for the register shown on the Transmission card. If 3 is lit, then Mission Control may indicate which Command should be performed third.  \nError, Red Lines force Mission Control to pick one additional Command Card at random from those they did NOT select for their 5 to give to the Cadet, and add one at random to their Command Card selection, shuffling it in.\nThe Cadet will need to examine the mixed-up Command Cards and decide how they should be re-ordered. They will need to be very careful in their selection, sometimes clues from previous rounds will be all they have to make the decision easier. Once the Cadet has locked-in their Command Card order, they will execute the commands from left to right, moving the Cadet meeple (which always begins in the center of the board) and Station Tiles accordingly.\nFor each Mission the Cadet completes, they may be rewarded with a SIGNAL BOOST card:\nHow many more can we add with the new Social Media stretch goals! Scroll down to find our more!\nIf Mission Control can guide the Cadet to accomplish the tasks on each Mission Objective Card before exhausting the Transmission Card stack, you win!

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects. We have met unique challenged in each of our previous campaigns that have only equipped us with more experience to prevent similar delays again.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done extensive pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 80% complete. The production quote is in-hand and ready to be initiated. Several fees and partners have been paid in advance for this production, as well.\n\nThis process has been improved due to the challenges encountered in previous projects, and we have prepared even more in-advance than years past.\n\n2. We are working with a highly-experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods, pre-press checkpoints, and freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We also plan to provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with experienced fulfillment partners with a wide range of options. Amazon has been immensely effective for quickly distributing our products within the USA and ShipFromChina worked very well for us with Fire of Eidolon and we expect it will again when Overworld is finished Manufacturing. \n\nAs always we will pay close attention to our shipping and manufacturing options to make sure we are making responsible decisions all the way down to the end-user's experience. We delayed Overworld's production intentionally to ensure the components could be improved to the standard that our backers expect to receive. \n\nThe only thing we are more dedicated to than the quality of our products is backer communication. We will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. We will be present daily during the project to answer any questions you have! We read every comment. We will also provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress throughout the entire journey.\n\nThank you for your confidence and support!!

As a village founder you'll invite people from all walks of life to live and work in your expanding community. If you can recruit the right people to form lucrative production chains while balancing your food production and building capacity, your village will become the most prosperous and you'll win the game!\nIn solo mode, a lone village must prosper against the machinations of the very ill-tempered Countess.\nBasic villagers - the backbone of any good village!\nStretch goals are divided into three camps: base game upgrades, expansion pack content, and upgrades to the Coin Box. Any expansion content we unlock during the campaign will be included in a free expansion pack for everyone who pledges to receive the game. The expansion pack and Coin Box will be sold separately at retail.\nNo money was exchanged for any of our reviews.\nIf you'd like to see the work-in-progress rulebook, you'll find it here.\nTom aka Slickerdrips plays through a two player game:\nVillagers is played over several rounds, each with two (or sometimes three) phases. \nIn the draft phase, players take it in turn to take villager cards from the face-up or face-down cards of the central road area. Whenever someone takes a face-up card, it is immediately replaced from the leftmost stack of face-down cards. The number of villagers a player can take in the draft phase depends on how much food their village produces. \nIn the build phase, each player places villagers from their hand into their village - putting them to work. You can play as many cards as you have builders in your village. \nThere are two market cards, tucked away under the second and sixth stacks of face-down cards on the road. When a market card is revealed, there will be a market phase this round, right after the build phase. \nDuring the market phase, players count up the total amount of gold produced by the people working in their village. At the end of the second market phase, the player with the most gold in their supply wins the game.\nAs you can see, Villagers is quite simple, but it's not that simple, there's some other stuff going on, so let's talk about...\nEach villager is part of a production chain. Villagers must be placed in the correct order in their production chains. Longer production chains give you more resources, but require more draft and build actions to put into play. \nSome villagers need special tools or equipment to start working, and they have padlocks on them. Padlocks must be unlocked by paying the bank, or a villager of the type specified - called the unlocker - 2 gold. If possible, this gold is paid direct to the unlocker, and the coins remain on their card for the rest of the game, scoring extra gold during each market phase. This interaction makes it possible to profit from what other players are doing. \nA silver coin icon indicates that some villagers score a conditional amount of gold at the end of the game. They offer many extra scoring opportunities, and you can play two of the same to double your bonus! \nSpecial villagers can make a big difference. Some are like wild cards, helping you create your production chains, while others can create scoring opportunities, or help you in the draft phase. \nIn solo mode, a lone village must stand against the evil Countess, an AI opponent who seeks to restore her former glory at any cost. The early rounds take place in Summer, but fair weather does little to lull the fury of the Countess. And when Winter comes, she really loses her temper... \nAs an optional extra we are offering a fabulous Coin Box - a set of 110 coloured & printed wooden coins to replace the cardboard coins that come with Villagers as standard, all packaged in a magnetically fastened cardboard treasure chest that fits inside the Villagers game box. \nDesign subject to change.\nWhat's more, you can use them in almost any other game that would benefit from the addition of some classy wooden coinage! Quantities and dimensions (correct at time of writing, but subject to change) are: \n30 Ones - 16 x 4mm\n30 Twos - 18 x 4mm\n10 Fives - 20 x 4mm\n10 Tens - 22 x 4mm\n15 Twenties - 24 x 4mm\n15 Fifties - 26 x 4mm\nIf you'd like extra sets of coins, click on \"Manage Your Pledge\" at the top of the page, and add the appropriate multiple of \u00a38 / \u20ac9 / US$11 / CA$14 / A$14 to your pledge amount.\nClick to go to Villagers on Tabletop Simulator (via Steam)\n                             We are shipping Villagers to backers ourselves. Armed only with a spare bedroom, a Royal Mail Business account and a can-do attitude, we will aim to get every pledge out of the door and into the postal system no more than one week after taking delivery of the games.* We're based in the UK, and Brexit hasn't happened yet, so shipping will be EU friendly.\nTo keep shipping costs low, parcels will not be tracked. Items sent within the United Kingdom will be sent by 2nd Class mail, and will take 2-3 days to arrive from the date of posting. Items for Europe will take 3-5 days, and Rest of World 5-7 days. Obviously, these are estimates, and actual delivery times can and will vary.\n\nShipping for all pledge levels is free for UK backers, and subsidised for backers anywhere else on the planet. Please make sure you enter your shipping address correctly - we cannot be held responsible for missing packages sent to incorrect addresses. You'll have a chance to double check your details and correct any errors before shipping begins.\nCurrency conversions estimated at the time of writing.\n *When this was written, before the campaign, we expected no more than 1000 backers. We have obviously surpassed that by some margin. We will still mostly fufil Villagers ourselves (besides the spare bedroom, we have a very large quadruple garage, and failing that, we'll rent some warehouse space), but it might take longer than a week. If we need to draft in extra help to get your game sent out in a reasonable timeframe, we will.\nOur current plan is to get our factory to pre-package the vast majority of games before they ship to us. The factory confirms this is something they can do. This means all we'll have to do for about 95% of pledges is print a shipping label and have Royal Mail collect from us every couple of days until we're finished. It will still be an intensive and very involved process, but nowhere near as insane as if we had to physically package every single pledge ourselves. Whatever happens, we have plenty of extra hands to call on, should we need them.\nWe will work with Snakes & Lattes to fulfil pledges to backers in Canada, and VFI for backers in China. It is also possible that we will use an Australian fulfilment company for Australia and New Zealand, and we'll do our best to prevent anyone from having to pay import fees & customs charges.\nWe'll communicate the entire process via project updates, photos, videos, psychic waves etc.\nWe are pleased to have BackerKit as our pledge management partner.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not the first rodeo for Sinister Fish Games. It's our second, go us! Maybe second-and-a-half, if you count the Removable Sticker Set for Gloomhaven, which is a large and ongoing project, but wasn't on Kickstarter.\n\nWe have a good working relationship with our Chinese manufacturer, Whatz Games, who we worked with on Great Scott! and the Removable Sticker Set for Gloomhaven. They'll be taking care of the international freight shipping. We literally give them an address, pay them some money, and games appear a few weeks later. It's a pretty sweet deal.\n\nAs with any Kickstarter project, the usual risks apply. Things can and do get delayed for a multitude of possible reasons. The estimated fulfilment date of February 2019 allows some buffer time for mishaps to happen in, so you might get your stuff before then. Whatever happens, we will keep you in the loop via project updates.\n\nI should probably mention that my partner is expecting our first child at the end of July. At that point I will mainly just be coordinating with Haakon (designer & artist of Villagers) and the factory, which won't be a 24/7 job, so things should still run fairly smoothly.

You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!\nFantastic Factories is a dice placement, engine building tabletop game for 1 to 5 players and takes 45 to 60 minutes to play. Players build a set of factories into their compound and then roll dice to use as workers. With over 35 different blueprints, you can discover endless inventive and creative ways your factories can work together. \nDifferent factories have different worker requirements. Some require a pair of matching dice. Some require a specific value. You aren't stuck with what you roll, though. With training facilities you can manipulate the values of your dice in order to figure out the optimal placement of all your workers! Each turn is a satisfying puzzle to solve. \nThere are over 35 unique buildings!\n                                                                             28 dice (16mm) (4 red, 4 blue, 4 green, 4 yellow, 4 purple, and 8 white)\n50 energy resource tokens\n30 metal* resource tokens (*clarification: represents metal resources in the game but made out of chipboard)\n85 goods tokens\n4 tool label tokens\n78 blueprint cards\n18 contractor cards\n1 first player token\n5 player boards and player aids\n Fantastic Factories comes with over 40 unique blueprint and contractor cards, ensuring each game is a fresh and new experience with lots of replayability.\nPromo Cards\nPledge now to receive 4 bonus blueprints and 1 bonus contractor!\nKickstarter backers will also receive 5 promotional cards FREE! After the Kickstarter campaign these cards will only be available at conventions or through other exceptional means. \nPlease note that the art and components are not completely finalized and may change slightly.\nIn Fantastic Factories, your goal is to build the most prestigious buildings and manufacture the most goods. Players start with 4 blueprints and some resources (1 metal, 2 energy). Players also have 4 colored dice that act as their workers.\nMarket Phase\nEach round begins with the market phase. On your turn you either select a face-up blueprint to add into your hand for free or discard a card to hire the corresponding contractor. Contractors have unique effects that allow you do things such as roll additional dice or gain resources. \nTake a blueprint or hire a contractor.\nOnce all players have taken a turn, the work phase begins. \nExample of some contractors you can hire.\nWork Phase\nDuring the work phase players take their turns simultaneously. You start by rolling your dice. Then you can take various actions in any order. \nYou can place your workers on a set of basic actions to gain more resources or draw cards:\nBasic actions let you draw cards and gain resources.\nYou can build cards by discarding another card with the same tool symbol and paying the resource cost: \nBuilding a Nuclear Plant.\nAnd finally you can activate your cards (yes, even on the same turn you built it!). Training facilities help you get the correct value workers to run your factories. \nSequencing your actions correctly can allow you to maximize your turn!\nOnce all players are finished with their turns, the round is complete, and another one begins with the market phase again. If any players have manufactured 12 or more goods or have built 10 or more cards, the following round is the final round.\nSolo Game\nFantastic Factories supports playing solo. You still get to build awesome combinations of factories and strategize where best to place your workers. The only difference is you will be competing against a simple but efficient opponent known as \"The Machine\". The Machine is easily managed and guided by dice rolls and can be adjusted for varying levels of challenge. More details can be found in the rulebook. \nFantastic Factories is that perfect mix of approachability and strategic depth. The mechanics and rules are simple but the creative combinations of factories and numerous ways you can manipulate your dice make each game feel new and fresh. We've played the game more than 300 times, and we still enjoy playing it. \nWith simultaneous play, each game takes an hour or less so you know you'll be able to get it to the table time and time again and even play games back to back. With so many viable strategies to pursue, you'll be exploring the depths of Fantastic Factories for many games.\nSome of you may be waiting for the game to hit retail stores instead of pledging now. We would love to be in retail but getting the attention of distributors largely depends on the success of the Kickstarter campaign. There is a very real possibility that Fantastic Factories may never be available at retail outside of retailers who choose to back the Kickstarter. We know there's always risk in backing a Kickstarter so as a thanks for joining us on this journey, we've priced the pledge levels below our anticipated MSRP and are also including promo cards that will not be widely available through retailers that receive the game through distribution.\nRetailers\nInterested retailers should back at the retailer pledge level. We plan on charging standard retailer pricing and delivering the games well before normal distribution (if we even end up with a distributor). After you pledge, we will reach out with details about pricing. If you choose not to purchase for any reason we can refund your deposit pledge. Beyond the initial pledge there is no money due until just before fulfillment at which time you can specify your desired quantity and we will invoice you. The MSRP of the game will be $40. If you are a retailer and have any questions you can send us an email at retail@fantasticfactories.com.\nCheck out this 3 player full playthrough by JonGetsGames: \nYou can also see Jambalaya go through the first few rounds of a SOLO game:\nFantastic Factories is available on both Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia.

You can find the latest rulebook here. \nWhat are stretch goals? Meeting our funding goal allows us to place an order with our manufacturer for the minimum order quantity. However, the more quantity we order, the cheaper it is to manufacture each individual copy. We reinvest these savings into upgrading the components of the game. That means the more funding we receive, the better the game will be for you! Sharing this project with people you know helps us improve the game.\nPlease note that our stretch goals for the game itself are component upgrades ONLY. We do not believe in additional content or gameplay as stretch goals because we have thoroughly play tested the game with all the content that we believe is necessary for a balanced game and the best possible gameplay experience. No more. No less.\nDigital Puzzle Book Stretch Goal\nWe'd like to release a printable PDF that includes a curated selection of One Turn Puzzles and solutions.\nOn July 6, if there are 50 or more puzzles on the BGG forum AND 200 or more thumbs up collectively on the puzzles, we will release a PDF puzzle book complete with final art and layout. We will also credit each puzzle creator in this book. There are already 10+ puzzles and 20+ thumbs up in the forum right now.\nBut there are only a few short days before the campaign ends! That's why we are extending the deadline of this stretch goal to July 6th. That's still only a short week and a half away so don't wait too long to get involved.\nWhen we were selected for the PAX South Indie Showcase in January 2017, we were faced with a conundrum. How could we possibly demo our 1 hour game to the masses on the show floor of PAX?\nAnd that's how we came up with the Puzzles. They are literally snapshots of a single turn in Fantastic Factories, taken at the moment right after you've rolled your dice. The challenge is the same as your final turn in the full game: make as many points as possible, given these dice, resources, and buildings in your compound.\nHere are a couple of them, see if you can figure them out!\nInstructions: Manufacture as many Goods as possible by assigning the dice (with values as shown). Each building card has an ability on its bottom half that you may use, but you may not use the same building twice.\n(Note: you can ignore the build costs in the top left corner of the cards. These cards have been pre-built for you)\nAn Introductory Puzzle\nDojo flips a die to its opposite side. Warehouse requires 3 dice, and those dice must sum to 14 or more.\nSee solution.\nAnother Puzzle!\nManufacture as many goods as possible!\n See solution.\nSolve More Puzzles, and Create Your Own!\nDiscover (and try to solve) more puzzles on our forum on Board Game Geek (some of them are challenging).\nAlso, check out this post to find out how you can create and share your own Fantastic Factories One Turn Puzzle for others to try to solve!\nIf enough people submit puzzles by July 6, then Joseph and I will put together a printable PDF of the best puzzles (with solutions) so you can bring them to game night!

They have a great reputation as experts in shipping and will be assisting us with coordinating shipping games across the world. As a result, shipping will be EU, AUS, and CAN friendly with no additional VAT being charged separately to backers. \nShipping is one of the most expensive parts of bringing a Kickstarter game to life. We estimate that shipping within the US will cost $12 per game, but we wanted to subsidize the shipping and split the cost with our backers. That means US backers will only be charged $6 for shipping for a single copy and we will cover the other $6. For non-US backers, we will still subsidize the shipping costs for $6 but the shipping cost to backers will vary by region. To see the shipping cost to your region, select the pledge level and then select your region.\nTwo Pack Bundle\nWe know that even with the subsidy that shipping can still be a lot. That's why we are also offering a pledge level for 2-game bundles at a significantly lower shipping price per game. For example a 2-game bundle being shipped to the EU would save you $11.\n3+ Copies\nIf you want to order more than 2 copies of Fantastic Factories, you can select the Two-Pack Bundle pledge and pledge an additional amount:\nFor Continental US/EU/Norway/Canada/AUS/China you should pledge for the Two-Pack Bundle and then add an additional $31 for each extra copy you want (this amount includes the additional shipping). \nFor Alaska/Hawaii, add $37 per extra copy.\nFor Puerto Rico, add $36 per extra copy.\nFor New Zealand, add $36 per extra copy. \nFor Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan, add $33 per extra copy. \nAnd for the rest of the world, add $40 per extra copy. \nWe are not offering any group buy discounts outside of the shipping savings.\nFor example, if you live in Belgium, the Two-Pack Bundle is $56 plus $15 shipping (total of $71). If you would like 4 copies of the game, you would add $31 for each additional copy so your pledge should be for a total of $133.\nIf you are currently pledged at the Retailer pledge level but are not a retailer, please switch your pledge to the Two-Pack Bundle and adjust your pledge amount for the quantity you want.\nWho are we?

Sprawlopolis is growing and YOU are in charge of it all. The last team of planners couldn\u2019t cut it, so the city turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this tiny town into a thriving civic center, it\u2019s you.  \nIn Sprawlopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new city from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice.\n\nFirst, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game.  \nIn this game, you will try to keep Parks away from the edges, line up lots of  Commercial blocks in a row or column, and create roads that connect your Parks.   \nBut not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the score that you need to reach in order to win.\nThe example above is just one of many, many combinations (816 to be exact!). Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.  \nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing city, trying to score as many points as possible.   \nPlayers will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.   \nWatch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap, so each road will cost you points in the end.   \nWhen all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.   \nCan you meet the demands of the officials, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate urban wonder? It\u2019s time to find out!\nSprawlopolis is the next game in our ongoing Wallet Line. Simply 18 cards and rules, packed into a small wallet for maximum portability.\nWe sent out a handful of review copies and the reviews are glowing. Here's a selection, but there are also podcasters, instagram(ers?), and others praising the game.  \nFULL REVIEW: https://thethoughtfulgamer.com/2018/05/11/sprawlopolis-review/ \nFULL REVIEW: http://www.everythingboardgames.com/2018/05/sprawlopolis-kickstarter-preview.html \nFULL REVIEW: https://whatsericplaying.com/2018/05/14/sprawlopolis/ \nFULL REVIEW: https://openseatgaming.com/2018/05/11/kickstarter-preview-sprawlopolis/ \n FULL REVIEW: https://www.punchboardmedia.com/home/2018/5/17/the-cardboard-hoard-review-of-sprawlopolis\nFULL REVIEW: https://gameosity.com/2018/05/16/sprawlopolis-kickstarter-preview/\nFULL REVIEW: https://singlehandedlydotblog.wordpress.com/2018/05/14/build-a-city/\nWe are offering a few things. Sprawlopolis in both PNP and physical game, as well as Circle The Wagons (a competitive 2 player game by the same designers that shares a similar variable scoring method with Sprawlopolis), an Instant Collection of Button Shy games, an Instant Collection with a collector's box, a retail level for stores that want to be one of the very few that carries our wallet games, and a standard and deluxe subscription to our Board Game of the Month Club (scroll down for full details on the club).\n\nCheck out the list below and contact us with any questions. \nIf you don't have Circle The Wagons, it is a MUST HAVE two player game. It's our highest rated game on Board Game Geek and our best selling game of 2017 and 2018. We're also offering Lone Cowboy, a 6 card set of solo scenarios for all of our solo friends.\nReview: https://whatsericplaying.com/2018/04/02/circle-the-wagons/\n The first stretch goal is up!\nNext up is Construction Zones, a 4 card expansion that adds a little wrinkle to your city planning.\nIf you want to add more games to your order, you can do one of three things.\nUse the INSTANT COLLECTION reward levels to get 3 extra games.

We've highlighted some prominent games, but there is a lot more than we could even note here.\nYou may know the designers (Steven Aramini, Danny Devine and Paul Kluka) from their previous Button Shy game, Circle The Wagons and it's IDW reimplementation X-Files: Circle of Truth, but they have a handful of other games that you may have in your collection right now!  \nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE. Here's a look at what we're doing right now:\nAnd here's a peek at what's coming next month.\nOur $5 June package includes the next episode of Timestamp, a time-travel game that takes place on a single postcard. Each episode is fully playable on its own, and supporters receive PNP links to previous episodes. It also includes Banned Books: Jerry, the next character in our expanding series Banned Books. All supporters receive the Banned Books base game in their first package. It's a solo game of literary characters trying to get their books un-banned. And finally it includes a copy (and a link to print more) of the next Legends of Dsyx Roll and Write Game: Seascrapers. Legends of Dsyx is an ongoing roll & write series where each game is set in the same kingdom, but the games play very differently.\n\nOur $10 June package includes all of those and Tornado Chase, a 9-card dice-drafting game of tornado-chasing tactics. Two players jockey for position while avoiding being swept away in the storm.\n\nAnd our $20 June package includes all of the above and a copy of  Sprawlopolis and all stretch goals (or the wallet game of your choice).\n Come join us at either Patreon or buttonshygames.com:\nhttp://patreon.com/buttonshy\nhttps://buttonshygames.com/products/board-game-of-the-month-club-basic-subscription", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nReleasing games each month has established a groove with the manufacturer.

Do you like them? Do you even know them? What are they doing right now? Wouldn't it be nice not to have any? Or, are they there when you need to borrow something?\nWell, you might like them, or you might not. But one thing is certain. You probably would not appreciate it if they stepped into your garden when you're away on holiday and try to mess with it, right?\nThis, and managing his bee population is what Mr. Cabbagehead has to deal with in between holidays, when he is planting his garden in anticipation of the Garden Committee's visit.\nJoin us in creating this beautiful game full of victorian-era illustrations, some of which are not pleasantly disturbing. Join us in Mr. Cabbahead's Garden!\nMr. Cabbagehead's garden is a simple, yet sometimes frustratingly challenging game. It is designed by Todd Sanders, who was inspired by a day spent in the library looking at books of victorian seed catalogs that featured some very quirky anthropomorphic vegetables\nCombining his love of gardening and his passion for unconventional game design, he created a game to match the style of these lovable curmudgeons that beckoned Victorians to garden.\nMr. Cabbagehead's Garden was first released as a solo-play-only Print & Play that quickly intrigued gamers on BoardGameGeek, and has been played and enjoyed as such since 2016.\nSince then Todd has continuously refined the game, and after a period of development within LudiCreations, we are pleased to be able to present it for a high-quality print run, as befits a game as iconic as this.\nImprovements include rules for 2 players, a rebalancing of point values, a clarification of the flow of the game and an update of the graphic design. Combined with endowing it with high quality materials such as linen-finished cards and cardboard, the boxed commercial release of Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden is something we are very proud to bring to you.  \nIn doing so, we would like to complete Todd's vision and offer game new content. This includes The New Neighbours, 6 new tiresome busybodies who can't wait to mess with Mr. C's beautiful garden. It also includes the Grasshopper expansion, and the Romancing Eudora expansion.\nAll cardboard is 2 mm thick, and all cards are 320 gsm. All surfaces are linen-finished.\n We have partnered with Dogmight, your friendly local viking berserker woodworkers to bring you something they are clearly crazy enough and talented enough to even dare to make:\nThe ultra-deluxe custom-made wooden Prestige Box\n For more details, please check out this backer update!\nIn Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden you will be planting your garden in a 3 x 6 grid of Vegetable cards. In each of the game's 3 rounds there is a Planting phase and a Neighbour phase.\nIn the Planting phase, you draw 3 cards from the deck of Vegetables. You plant one in the garden grid, and then draw Neighbour tokens according to the values of the other two cards.\nIn the Neighbour phase, the Neighbour with the most matching tokens is the one who visits and interferes with the garden, removing or moving Vegetable cards.\nAt the end of the game, the garden is ready for evaluation. The more vegetables of the same kind you have, the better! And if you really want the coveted Blue Ribbon, you better arrange them in aestheticallly pleasing patterns!\nFor more detail, here's Bebo with a rules overview:\nEach of the included expansions also adds something, ranging from a huge jump in variability with the 6 New Neighbours, to an increase in difficulty with the Grasshoppers and a modular bonus possibilities with Romancing Eudora. All that and more are explained in the rules linked below.\nAs usual, we offer you the chance to try the game before you back the campaign. The game has been implemented on Tabletopia, and you can play for free here:\nYou can download the rules of the game here (5 MB, right click and Save as\u2026).

If you find any mistakes, please use this form to submit them: https://goo.gl/forms/jTFX4bDRvO7cuejD2\nPlease note that the following videos depict prototype components, some of which may be fairly old. The game has been developed over a period of years, both in its graphic design and in the values of various cards and scoring bonuses.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnApjD6C8zw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYYm7vxogc\nRunthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K24hexXxlaY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICW4QfIRUy0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKOWvolaC60\nTodd Sanders lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he works as a graphic designer, publisher and furniture maker. Todd is well known as a designer of solo board games. Many of his games have already been published, including IUNU and They Who Were 8, the first two in the Sanders Select Series of games by Ludicreations.\nEven though Todd has been designing games for several years, he has never been at Spiel. This, even after 2 of his games have debuted there. Travel & accommodation there are not cheap, as we have certainly experienced in the past few years.\nGiven that this year Todd expects to see at least 2 more games being published and shown there, we wanted to do what we can so he can get to Essen, and with your help we hope to cover some of his expenses.\nIf you would like to contribute and get some really special rewards prepared by Todd, simply pledge at the $34 level. Todd and we would be very, very grateful for your support!\nThe special rewards include:\nA postcard from by Todd, signed & sent to you!\nA special promo Neighbour for Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden. This will be designed in full view of backers of that level. We do not like exclusives, but if we sell it later, we will give profits to Todd.\n5 Daily vlogs from Essen, right from the exhibitor floor, and possibly some other places too! Probably not live, since the connection there is terrible.\nPlaying a game with Todd! Quite a few of Todd's games are on Tabletopia, and they are free to play. At some point or another, Todd will play a game with you, either one-on-one or as part of a group. This would have to be up to Todd's availability and time zone issues. LudiCreations games on Tabletopia are free to play!\nPlease note that there is always the possibility that due to any unforeseen circumstances, Todd does not make it to Essen. If that happens, we will still be able to fulfill the above in the best way we can. Postcards can still be sent, promos made, vlogging from Todd might be from his design space, and Tabletopia is still happening as it normally would.\nWe expect to fulfill the rewards bound for the USA from within the USA, and the rewards bound for EU and other countries from Germany. EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nShipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have 16 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 19 USD / 25 CAD / 25 AUD / 19 CHF / 2101 JPY. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees.\nWe will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which additional copies may be obtained.\nUnfortunately, we are not able to make bulk shipments.\nWe are not able to ship to some countries during the campaign. If your country does not appear on the list after you click the reward in which you are interested, please send us a message via KS.\nThe Prestige Box will be shipped separately from the game material, from the USA. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees related to it.\nThe shipping cost for the game is 5 USD worldwide.\nThe shipping costs for the Prestige Box are:\nUSA: 12 USD\nCanada: 25 USD\nOther countries: 35 USD\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these costs to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nRegrettably, we can not offer pickup at Spiel in Essen or any other convention.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - this is our doctrine, and we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We already go to print with the highest quality materials.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for \"free\". Therefore, raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nFurthermore, because the games are made in Europe in a small print run, we do not benefit from economies of scale by producing a few more copies of the game.\nRetail availability: We have no idea. This is a weird game. Past experience shows that this type of game rarely finds its way to stores, but we can not make any guarantees either way.\nSPIEL availability: We intend to sell the game at the SPIEL trade fair in Essen. We do not yet know the price, but we are confident we will have very few copies there.\nFinally, we do not pay anyone to give an opinion on our games.\n Game design, graphic design, visual identity: Todd Sanders\nTabletopia implementation: Viktor Csete\nAudiovisual support: Sonja Hatanp\u00e4\u00e4, Toni Heinonen\nSpecial Thanks: Dimitris \"JamesH\" Chatzidimitriou, Brittanie \"Bebo\" Boe, Paul \"GamingRules\" Grogan, those Victorian illustrators, and many, many more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll 2017 campaigns have been fulfilled. The CRISIS: The New Economy campaign is in the production phase. We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the final colors, graphics and components that you see presented here are subject to (however improbable) change. We will be exhibiting at Essen, and it is very likely that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game, the shipping company does. Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal services \u2013 once we ship, the shipment is the responsibility of the shipping company. If tracking is important to you, please let us know. Informal currency conversions made on this campaign may not be accurate by the time you read this, and therefore result in seemingly cheaper prices further in the future. Warning: Please practice safe gardening. Avoid sticking sharp tools into any squishy things, even if they deserved it those bastards who keep stealing m- your vegetables. The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this game are fictitious, maybe.

A land with a glorious past, a most uncertain present, and an even more unpredictable future. \nNow a member of an Economic Union, it has fallen on hard times, and its people are suffering. Corruption, inefficiency, and incompetence have a real human cost, as political tensions continue to increase.\nHowever, all is not lost. A group of investors (that some would call opportunistic) have seen this as an opening, a chance to build their own future. \nThe players take on the role of these investors, who seek to bail out struggling businesses, recruit employees, raise capital, and produce goods for export.\nShady business deals can win influence or grease the right palms, but players must be careful - cutting too many corners is inefficient and hurts the overall economy. In fact, it may even lead to bankruptcy for Axia and an early end for the game. \nBut, with hard work and a focus on the future, the winner must seize opportunities where others see only crisis! \nThe reprint of CRISIS is only for the Deluxe edition. It contains the same components as the first print run. Minor changes have been made to the rulebook (capitalization, FAQ) and to some cards (wording, clarifications). The rules of the game remain the same. \nCrisis is a game for 1-5 players that takes 45-120 minutes.\nFor more details on the components and rules of Crisis, download the rules here (5 MB, right click and Save as\u2026). Please download this file, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not display properly. This file is the low-resolution version of the final rules document. \nIf you find any mistakes, please send us a message via the KS messaging system (we can't track responses in the comments section).\nThe first expansion for Crisis is here! \nIt contains 15 new Company cards, each meant to replace one Company in the base game. However, not all are used in each game, dramatically increasing replayability.\nThe fantastic illustrations for the new Company cards have been beautifully crafted by Anthony Cournoyer, the talented illustrator of the base game (and of Diesel Demolition Derby, and of Long Live the Queen's dieselpunk edition, and many more).\nYou can download the rules card for the expansion here. \nThis small new expansion forms the basis for much more content in the future, and we plan to put out more substantial, boxed expansions once we have fully developed and playtested them.\nLa version Deluxe de CRISIS et l\u2019extension La Nouvelle \u00c9conomie sont maintenant disponibles en version fran\u00e7aise, \u00e9dit\u00e9es par Geek Attitude Games.\nL\u2019extension ne sera pas disponible en boutique.\nUne pr\u00e9sentation fran\u00e7aise du Kickstarter est disponible sur le site de Geek Attitude Games.\nT\u00e9l\u00e9chargez les r\u00e8gles (non d\u00e9finitives) de CRISIS et La Nouvelle \u00c9conomie.\nVous pouvez \u00e9galement d\u00e9couvrir les r\u00e8gles de CRISIS en vid\u00e9o :\n Pour toute question, une seule adresse : info@geekattitudegames.com\nWe have been able to, for the first time, develop our own German edition for a game! We are currently proofreading the language-dependent components: the rulebook, the events cards and the influence cards. \nIn the post-campaign survey, you will be able to choose to receive the German edition of the base game and of the expansion.\nCheck out a review in german here:\nWe are also working on a german-language conversion kit for the backers of the first print run.\nWould you like to try the game? We have both a Vassal module and Tabletopia implementations! \nYou can find the Vassal module, handcrafted with love, here. You can get the latest version of Vassal here. Apologies, this does not contain the expansion.\nYou can find he Tabletopia implementation here.\nNote that some videos below show prototype components which were created before the first campaign for the game. \nThe game may look really good in these videos, but know that the final product is even better (rigid cards, appropriately-sized wooden tokens, etc.).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDT8nD088ro\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQbjCJKCPBk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKDkoa3HJYo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCOibZkgOWc \nFor the main runthrough video, click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n88T4s77MNA\nFor the extended game play video, click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aCYjMe-PWE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4aZHVV3JnI \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQhMEwBihko \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9iwXIooQHY \nBesides his final thoughts, the Vitruvian Gamer filmed his entire playthrough: \nIntro + round 1: https://youtu.be/KfFQvIJ53sw \nRounds 2 & 3: https://youtu.be/np9dR3UGNro\nRounds 4 & 5: https://youtu.be/ZUmROgpHawA\nRounds 6 & 7, final thoughts: https://youtu.be/86wcuK7OTDw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__5n5ZJhyOE \nYou can also see ConnectMore's \"Avoid The Rules\" video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0kscIKj94s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtNeBiKXPkc \nhttps://vimeo.com/173257588 \nMore rounds & opinion: https://vimeo.com/173271788\n(21:25 onwards) https://thefiveby.fireside.fm/32\n(01:14:57 onwards) http://punchingcardboard.com/?p=863\nhttps://brokenmeeple.blogspot.com/2016/07/crisis-preview-kickstarter-its-12.html \nhttp://www.cardboardrepublic.com/preview/on-crisis \nhttp://www.creakingshelves.com/crisis-review\nhttp://www.devondice.co.uk/crisis_preview/ \nhttp://goplaylisten.com/games/one-play-crisis/ \n(16:00 onwards) https://www.heavycardboard.com/episodelist/2016/08/24/heavy-cardboard-episode-52-amandas-top-50-edwards-top-50 \nhttp://www.polyhedroncollider.com/2016/07/crisis-kickstarter-review.html  \n                                (click here or on the image above for a high resolution photo)\nWe expect to fulfill the rewards bound for the USA from within the USA, and the rewards bound for EU and other countries from Germany. EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT. \nShipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have 45 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 59 USD / 75 CAD / 76 AUD / 55 CHF / 6224 JPY. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees.\nWe will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which additional copies may be obtained. \nThe real cost of shipping is subsidized and is offered for the period of the campaign. We reserve the right to charge higher shipping costs during the pre-order period and beyond. We are not able to make bulk shipments. Other costs that we bear may also include packing materials, labor, freight, replacements shipping; and the risk of shipping cost increases.\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these amounts to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nCRISIS: The New Economy expansion\nWorldwide: 2 USD. Real cost: 4.59 USD (3,70 EUR)\nCRISIS deluxe edition\nEU: 9 USD. Real cost: 11.04 USD (8,89 EUR)\nUSA: 9 USD. Real cost: 11.70 (estimate based on offers)\nWorldwide: 14 USD. Real cost: 19.73 USD (15,89 EUR)\nExamples:\nCrisis deluxe to the UK: 9 USD\nCrisis deluxe + expansion to the UK: 11 USD\nCrisis deluxe to the USA: 9 USD \nCrisis deluxe + expansion to the USA: 11 USD\nCrisis deluxe to Canada: 14 USD\nCrisis deluxe + expansion to Canada: 16 USD\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these amounts to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\n(Yes, we subsidize worldwide rewards by 3 USD more. We are nice like that. EU/USA backers, you will probably be getting yours much more quickly. Hopefully that is enough consolation.)\nWe also have to pay 3-5 USD for materials, packing and handling - also something that you do not have to pay, resulting in discounts of 30-60%, depending on location and number of shipments. Individually it may not seem like a lot, but multiplied by thousands of packages, it represents a significant cost.\nCertain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list.\nWe expect to have tracking for the USA, but not for anywhere else. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over. We do not expect to be sending tracking codes when the games are shipped.\nPlease note that we can not take any responsibility for any lost or damaged copies to Brazil, Hungary, Russia, or South Africa.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - this is our doctrine, and we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that add-ons and/or stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We intend to print with the highest quality materials, and we let you, our fans, decide which version you want. \nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for \"free\". Therefore, raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nFurthermore, because the games are made in Europe in a small print run, we do not benefit from economies of scale by producing a few more copies of the game.\nWe do not offer add-ons (not even our other games) during the campaign, because we want to keep our operations simple and deliver efficiently. We will however be able to offer a post-campaign chance to obtain other games, if stock levels and our operations allow. We are in this for the long run, so it does not help us to squeeze a few more dollars from a few backers, if we would disappoint *all* backers. We have a reputation for shipping on time or early, and this is how we minimize the risk of missing our deadlines.\nRetail availability: We hope to put the game in shops, with the intended MSRP of 70 USD. However, we do not guarantee that you will be able to find it in retail, just like the game's first print run.\nSPIEL availability: We intend to sell the game at the SPIEL trade fair in Essen. We do not yet know the price, but we are confident we will have very few copies there.\nFinally, we do not pay anyone to give an opinion on our games.\nGame Design: Pantelis Bouboulis & Sotirios Tsantilas  \nIllustration: Anthony Cournoyer \nGraphic Design: Sami Laakso, Viktor Csete & Heiko G\u00fcnther \nVassal Module: Mindy Getch & Sotirios Tsantilas \nTabletopia Implementation: Alvin Chen & Viktor Csete\nSpecial Thanks: Alvin Chen, Paul \"GamingRules\" Grogan, Dimitris \"JamesH\" Chatzidimitriou, Brittanie \"Bebo\" Boe, and many, many more.\nLudiCreations is a publisher of such novel games as \u2026and then, we held hands, ESSEN, Kune v Lakia, Pocket Imperium, [redacted], and Town Center.

We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the final graphics and components that you see presented here are subject to (however improbable) change. We will be exhibiting at Essen, and it is very likely that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game, the shipping company does. Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal services \u2013 once we ship, the shipment is the responsibility of the shipping company. If tracking is important to you, please let us know.

In this game, players colonize the galaxy using their ships, which they will move on a modular board, allowing for a different map and different experience each time you play the game.\nThe rules are simple: Each turn a player has to move one of his ships in a straight line, as many spaces (star systems) as he wants but he cannot go over systems controlled by other players. After his move, he has to place a Colony or Trade Station on that system, thus gaining control over that system for until the end of the game, for which he will get an amount of points. When all of the players placed their Colonies and Trade Stations, the game ends and points are calculated. The player with the most points is the winner!\nWith these extremely simple rules, players will get into the game from the very start and they will immediately immerse in the depths of the tactical and strategic choices they will need to make, in order to score more efficiently at the end of the game.\n Social Stretch Goal is still active!\nHelp us spread the word around for the campaign by sharing the posts below and for each 20 shares + retweets we will include another Technology card!\nSharing this Facebook post on your timeline: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/smallstarempires/posts/1857701910957675\nRetweeting this post: https://twitter.com/ArchonaGames/status/994663787151192067\nAdditionally, we will be including another Technology card for each AUD $1000 that will be above the AUD $93.000 mark, or more precisely above the final stretch goal! \n To see more details on what the Fate of the Galaxy is all about, check out this Kickstarter Update!\nNew Add-on: TILES and 2 NEW CIVILIZATIONS!\nMake your epic Small Star Empires gaming nights even more epic by including this 5th and 6th player expansion! \n\nAlso, if you buy both the Deluxe 5-6 player expansion AND the wooden component set, you will get the 5-6 player wooden expansion set FOR FREE!\nCivilizations overview\n                                                             Get to know the Civilizations and their Unique Abilities on our blog post here:\nhttp://www.archonagames.com/2018/04/18/the-civilizations-of-the-galactic-divide/\nFor more information on Galactic Warlords visit our BGG Page\n                                       Download the RULES of the Base game HERE.Download the DRAFT RULES of the Expansions HERE.Download the Supermassive Black Hole mini-expansion rules HERE.\nDownload the EPIC GAME MODE rules HERE.\nDownload a Print and Play of a single scenario of the Solo Campaign HERE.\nCheck out Milan's overview of Small Star Empires at Essen Spiel 2016 by BoardGameGeekTV:\n And check out this overview of the expansions:\n Check out the companion Score Keeper app that is available for both Android and iOS!\nDownload the app for Android, or iOS.\n Watch The Dice Tower's review here:\n Watch Undead Viking's review here:\n Read I'm a Social Gamer's review HERE.\nWatch Epitrapaizoume's video review here:\n  Watch Life of a Board Gamer's review for Small Star Empires here:\nRetailers and Group Pledges  \nFor retail and group pledge orders, please write to us at contact@archonagames.com.

The overview video shown below is from Rahdo Runs Through and covers the original Villages of Valeria game. It does not include any of the Landmarks content, but it's a great way to get to know the original game if it's new to you.\nSo, what does Landmarks bring to Villages of Valeria? The primary new mechanic is a new follow opportunity called \"Build A Landmark\". \nWe heard from a lot of players, and the mechanic they like the most is being able to follow the active player's lead action. Rick and Isaias decided to amp up this mechanic by giving you another option besides just following the lead action. \nWith Landmarks, if you cannot or choose not to follow the lead action, you can build a landmark as your follow action.You simply discard a specific card from your hand and, based on the resource icon at the bottom of the Building card, you take a certain landmark token and place it on your castle card. For example, discard a Building card with a Food resource at the bottom to establish a Silo as a Landmark in your village.\nLandmark tokens do not count as Buildings, but at the end of the game, the player with the most of each type of Landmark will earn victory points! For each set of all five different Landmarks you've collected, you'll gain even more victory points. \nThe Landmarks expansion also comes with new Adventurer cards that trigger on the Landmarks you've collected, new Building cards to grow your village with cool new powers, and all-new Architect cards to award hidden end-game bonus points!\nIncrease your Landmark holdings, leverage the new Buildings, attract the new Adventurers, and show your rivals what a proper village looks like!\nDownload the PNP files linked farther down this page to read the rules for all of the details.\nA Note About Solo Play: The Villages of Valeria base game supports solo play and the new Landmarks expansion contains 49 cards that will meld with the base game and support solo play (assuming all the stretch goals are unlocked). However, the new \"Landmarks\" mechanic itself does not support solo play. It requires at least two players because much of the mechanic depends upon the brinksmanship of players trying to outmaneuver each other in the acquisition and mix of landmark tokens.\nThe Deluxe custom tokens you receive with your pledged rewards will not be included in the retail version of the Landmarks expansion. That version will have wood block tokens. We may make the custom tokens available as a separate purchase via the BoardGameGeek Store after Landmarks has been released in 2019.\nIn 2016, we offered Villages of Valeria in a Deluxe Box that could hold everything made at that time, even with sleeved cards. In 2018, our expansion ideas outgrew the Deluxe Box, so we're now offering the Landmarks expansion with a VOV Big Box, especially for card sleevers.\nThe VOV Big Box has 206mm of card storage, that's 1.75x the capacity of the Deluxe Box, and it features 8 token wells that should accommodate event the fussiest organizers.\nThe playmat shown above can be added to any pledge level of $19 or above by increasing your total pledge by $25.\nThe Deluxe Pack above can be added to any pledge level of $19 or above by increasing your total pledge by $16. If you already have the Villages of Valeria Deluxe or are pledging here for the Deluxe Catch Up, you do not have to add this on as it's already in your box.\nCongrats on Unlocking ALL of our Stretch Goals!\nThe reviews and videos shown below are for the original Villages of Valeria game. They do not include any of the Landmarks expansion components.\n                                                                                                   The PDF file linked in the graphic below is FREE to download and requires the base Villages of Valeria game to play. The file contains the cards we used while developing the Landmarks expansion and do not include final art. In this PNP file, the 35 landmark tokens are replaced with 35 landmark cards for your convenience.\nBefore you pledge, please take a look at this flowchart to help you determine which pledge level is best for you.\nBacker rewards will ship from hubs in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia to reduce the likelihood of backers having to pay VAT and import duties to receive their packages.\nEarly-ship copies of VOV Standard and VOV Deluxe from the Catch Up pledge levels WILL be shipped from the USA warehouse. It is possible that international backers could incur additional charges to receive these packages. To avoid this risk, we recommend that you buy the Villages of Valeria base game at your local game store wherever possible. It is widely available and you can get the Bonus Pack from the BGG store.\nPlease see Update #2 for details on how and when the Deluxe Pack Add On will be shipped.\n                                                                                                                                                     Daily Magic Games has spent the last three years building a community of gamers here on Kickstarter and we want to give those loyal backers an opportunity to get a special copy of Landmarks with custom Landmarks tokens that won't be in the retail version.\nIf you've missed out on any of our recent Game projects, you can pre-order Kickstarter versions from our Pre-Orders Page.  \nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth.\nIsaias Vallejo, Wizard-in-Chief, Game Designer, and Developer \nDavid MacKenzie, Conjurer and Game Developer \nLevi Mote, Alchemist, Game Designer, and Developer \nSarah Sharp, Enchantress and Convention Event Planner \nDylan Pharaoh-Whitney, Sorcerer and Graphic Designer \nWe're based in Seattle, Washington and like to promote the growth of game design in the Pacific Northwest.

We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design files for Villages of Valeria: Landmarks are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the the files are delivered.

When an enemy attacks, you have your entire turn to dodge out of the way, mount your defenses, and launch a counterattack before the attack connects!  \nA Challenging Single Player Game- In Stuff of Nightmares you will be able to battle solo against the trolls that we unlock as stretch-goals in the campaign. Each troll is a distinct challenge ranging from fairly simple to extremely challenging! \nAn Awesome Co-Op Game- Players can collaborate with each other to take down the trolls that we unlock during the campaign!  Play cards to support your teammate on their turn so that you both can taste the sweetness of victory together!\nA Fantastic Multiplayer Game- Stuff of Nightmares can support a four-player tournament out of a single box!

Players must decide if they should save tools for an epic late game point swing or grab points now to take an early lead. \nAI Variants: Experience the excitement of Fire in the Library on your own with the solo game or spice up a multi-player match by adding new challengers.\nHistory is burning\u2014take chances, be brave, SAVE BOOKS!\n See the rest of Gameosity's review here. \nYou can see Jeremy's full review here. \n Below is the How to Play video: \n Below is a full playthrough video: \n Below is the How to Play for the solo version: \nEach round of Fire in the Library begins with each player obtaining a turn order card. Turn order cards contain safe and risky spaces for different strategies.\nPlay then moves to the Saving Books phase where each player, in turn order, draws tokens from a bag to see what they save. If you stop, you\u2019ll score points for any books you save and earn points for bravery if you stopped on a risky space. Books will increase in value as Sections of the Library burn down. \nWatch out! Pressing your luck while Saving Books may pull out fire tokens. Pull two fire tokens out\u2014or just one in a risky space\u2014and things will all go up in flames as the fire spreads! Sections of the Library will collapse based on the tokens you pulled during the Saving Books phase if you've pressed your luck too far. This can cause more Fire tokens to be added to the bag, as well as increasing the value of the burned Sections. \nFortunately, not everything is left up to luck. As a resourceful librarian, you have tools at your disposal. You start with two and may gain more during the course of the game. All of the tools provide new options for saving  books, changing the odds, or giving more opportunities to press your luck.\n Once each player has taken a turn, the Round is over and the fire continues to grow. Burn a Section of the Library by setting aside the Library card that has the lowest Burn Index Number (smaller number on the Library card).   \nThe game ends IMMEDIATELY when the last Library card for any one Section of the Library is removed. The player with the highest score, wins!\nRules, Print and Play, and TableTop Simulator\nYou can learn from the full rules here: http://fitl.sale/rules (The rules are not final and will be formatted professionally in the final game).

We'd love to get the games to the libraries and other locations that could use them. \nThe Gift backing levels will also come with an additional laser cut Fire in the Library gift token as a thank you for thinking about others!  There will be two tokens made, the Library Hero token for anyone who gifts at least one game and the Super Library Hero for those who gift at least three. \nAdd-Ons\nTo add an add-on to your pledge, click the Manage Your Pledge button, click the Change Your Pledge button, then update the pledge amount. \nThe Jumbo Laser Cut Token Add-On will come with a set of Tarot sized Turn Order cards to fit the tokens.  Shipping is included for US backers, but if you're outside the US, you should add an additional $2 for shipping for each token or bag add-on.\nUltra Edition of Fire in the Library\nThis Ultra Edition is very special and unique; we'll make a few more than are backed here, but we'll never make a large number of them. Each one will have a unique token that only you will get. These are going to be handcrafted and put together in the US. This will complement the base Fire in the Library game and if you back for the Ultra Version, you will receive both the Ultra and base game. This means you can mix and match the components as you wish to create the game experience that you want. \nSocial Goals\nHelp us reach four out of the five social goals and we'll add a Bravest Librarian card to the game! If we meet all five goals, we'll include a special promo card in the game, as well! \nHere's the links: BGG Page (Sign in to your account, then click the heart button), Facebook, Facebook post,Twitter, Twitter tweet. \nPeople sometimes wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of waiting to get the game later in retail. The most important reason not to wait with Fire in the Library is that we currently have no plans to put this game into distribution. If you wait, you may end up missing out as we won\u2019t have many extra copies to sell and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.  \nKickstarter Limited \u2013 Fire in the Library might be very hard to find after the campaign, outside of select conventions.\nHelp Us Improve Fire in the Library \u2013 We have a ton of stretch goals planned to help improve the quality of the components and add more content to the game for everyone! \nSubsidized Shipping \u2013  $5 shipping to the USA,  $10 to the EU and Canada and $15 to everyone else. We\u2019re going to pay for the rest of the shipping costs. \nDiscounted \u2013 After the campaign, we will sell the extra copies at a higher cost. \nEU Friendly \u2013 copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT fees for backers. \nMost importantly, without you, Fire in the Library would not get created. We definitely appreciate every backer\u2019s support in making our dream a reality.\nWe would love to support game stores by offering the Kickstarter versions of Fire in the Library to retailers during the campaign. Back the project for $1, send us a message, and we'll get back to you! An invoice will be sent to you before we ship your rewards.\nShipping costs differ based on your location:  \n$5 for the United States \n$10 for the EU, Canada, and Australia \n$15 for the rest of the world \nWe are still working on the fulfillment strategy with several potential fulfillment partners to get Fire in the Library to you the proper way, with fulfillment partners in different parts of the world which will be chosen closer to shipping, as things tend to change over time. We intend to personally be shipping out the copies that have destinations within the United States. \n To order a second copy of Fire in the Library, add an additional $24 to your pledge with no additional shipping cost. \nI am happy to discuss group orders larger than two copies, but these need to be handled on a country by country basis. Please send me a direct message including country and number of copies to discuss.\nFire in the Library is the third project of Weird Giraffe Games. Super Hack Override was our first project and it was delivered a month early to backers in March 2017. Stellar Leap is our second project and is currently scheduled to be delivered early to backers in June. \nWeird Giraffe Games was founded to create games that are easy to learn and play, but layered with strategy.  \nThe Fire in the Library team is made of the following people:    \n We're looking forward to talking to you throughout this Kickstarter and after!

We're debuting our company and partnership on Kickstarter with the brand new, North American versions of Herbalism and three other excellent ES4 titles.\n  Every game of Herbalism is played with a deck of 14 cards that contains 4 ingredients of varying frequency. Every round, two of those 14 cards will be set aside randomly. Those are the ingredients that will cure the epidemic.\nPlayers take turns choosing combinations and taking actions to exchange hidden information until they can solve what two ingredients are missing from the deck. Each action consists of two parts: what a player gives to another player and what that player gives in return.\nPlayers will exchange information this way until a player thinks they know which two ingredients are missing. Then they can take the Cure Action and choose the formula they think is the correct one. Other players have the chance to make their own guesses or follow this player!\nIf the player making the guess is correct, they score 3 points and anyone who followed them scores 1 point.

If you discover this project after it has ended, you can find more information about the game on our website:\n   Spy Club is a new cooperative board game from publisher Foxtrot Games. Acting as young detectives, players work together to solve neighborhood mysteries. Spy Club includes unlockable content that changes the game every time you play, along with a way to play a series of 5 games connected together to tell a larger story.\nSimple but interconnected actions provide meaningful and clever decisions.\nBonus teamwork actions bring out communication and interaction between players.\nBeautiful artwork by Bart\u0142omiej Kordowski (Dream Home) and a storytelling element add laughter and draw players into the emerging narrative.\nUnlockable campaign content adds the thrill of discovery and novelty as the game evolves over multiple plays.\nSpy Club will be the sixth game from Foxtrot Games. Our previous games include award-winning titles like Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, World's Fair 1893, and more.\nEach player has double-sided clue cards in front of them. On your turn, you'll use 3 actions from the following options:\nInvestigate to reveal the other side of your clue card(s)\nShift Focus to gain ideas and set up teamwork\nConfirm Evidence to make progress on one aspect of the case\nScout to draw a new clue card\nTrade Clues and Share Ideas \u2014 only when you've set up teamwork\nHere's an example turn:\nOn this turn, the players have identified the Crime (blue).\nWhen you collectively confirm 5 clue cards of one type, you will solve that 1 part of the case.\nEach case has 5 parts to solve: the Crime (blue), the Suspect (purple), the Location (green), the Motive (red), and a related Object (yellow).\nBut beware! The suspect is on the move, triggering events that will sabotage your investigation:\nRemove ideas\nRemove clue cards\nAdvance the escape marker\nFlip all players' clue cards\nIf you solve all 5 parts before these events end the game, you successfully crack the case!\n  To get a look at Spy Club in action, watch two different groups each play a full game in these full playthrough videos:\nA gaming family learns Spy Club  |  Gamers teach Spy Club to their game group\nSpy Club includes a large deck of unlockable content that changes and evolves the game every time you play. This deck contains 152 cards comprising 40+ unique, replayable modules with new rules and story elements: characters, equipment, challenges, objectives, and more!\nThis unlockable content also provides a way to play a campaign, a series of 5 games connected together to tell a larger story:\nEach game plays in 30-45 minutes, and each campaign consists of 5 games.\nNew rules and story elements are unlocked in every game.\nEverything can be fully reset and replayed.\nYou only unlock a small portion of the total content in one series (just 5 of the 40+ modules). When you start again, you will continue to unlock new content each time!\nThe modules you unlock are determined by your decisions each game, which gives the campaign the sense of choosing your own mystery adventure!\nWhat is the structure of a campaign?\nIn each individual game of Spy Club, you work together to solve 5 aspects of a case. But a bigger picture is forming during a campaign: a master crime is also taking shape, and you'll need to discover one new aspect of that master crime in each of the 5 games. You'll unlock new content related to the particular aspects as you discover them.\nFor more details on the campaign structure, check out our How To Play > Campaign video.\nHow is Spy Club different from legacy and other games that change as you play?\nWe\u2019re excited about games that change over multiple plays, but the differences between various formats can be confusing. For example, legacy games, are intended to be played one time in a linear fashion, with players unlocking all of the content in one campaign. Spy Club, on the other hand, is intended to be reset and replayed. The sequence of content isn\u2019t scripted, so each campaign will unfold differently. With 40+ modules in the campaign deck, a unique story and gameplay experience will emerge in every campaign.

We are incredibly fortunate that our previous projects Lanterns: The Harvest Festival and World's Fair 1893 did well on Kickstarter and have continued to sell through multiple print runs in retail. We know that Foxtrot Games would not exist if it weren't for the pledges and support of each and every backer!\nThe success of those projects has given us the opportunity to keep our funding goal low and also include right from the start a number of additions that might normally only be added after certain funding levels have been reached:\nLarger, thicker cards (310 gsm black core, 70 x 110 mm)\n44 unique clue card illustrations (instead of 6 category illustrations)\nCustom suspect meeple\nCard tray (for double-sided cards)\nPlastic insert\nCampaign system: 40+ expansion modules (152 cards), 55 tokens, scorepad, and envelope\nWe included all of these right from the start to reduce the risk of new artwork delays, to provide you a high quality product at a great value, to thank you for backing early, and to show you how much we believe in this project.\nFoxtrot Games is a small publisher committed to beautiful, engaging, and approachable board games. We have successfully fulfilled three Kickstarter projects previously, including Lanterns: The Harvest Festival in 2015 and World's Fair 1893 in 2016.\nThe team for Spy Club includes some familiar names from our other projects: Jason D. Kingsley (graphic design work for Lanterns and World's Fair 1893), Randy Hoyt (owner and game producer at Foxtrot Games), Keith Pishnery (graphic design work for The Fox in the Forest and Sundae Split), Charles Wright (game developer for The Fox in the Forest and Sundae Split), and Dustin Schwartz (rules editor for all our recent games). We've also partnered with some new collaborators for this project: illustrator Bart\u0142omiej Kordowski (Dream Home), and game developers Sarah Graybill and John Shulters (of Black Straw Games).\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing thousands of board games is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor. There are a lot of steps in the process, and delays or setbacks could happen at any one of them. We have successfully navigated this process three times before. We even delivered rewards for our last two projects early!\n\nHere is some feedback we received on our last project:\n\n\u2014 Leah Webber: \"Thank you guys for consistently making excellent, replayable games on a timely schedule. I will always give your projects my time and money!\"\n\n\u2014 John Carl Brown: \"Thank you guys for a great product, and for a great campaign, you ran a model effort on kickstarter from the communication throughout the funding period and beyond.\"\n\n\u2014 Ryan McManus: \"Wow. What fantastic customer service. Thanks Randy!

It is a time of adventure, progress, and opportunity. The transcontinental junction was a great milestone in American history, a first step that reshaped a whole continent.\nIn SteamRollers you are a railroad entrepreneur building a network of tracks and a fleet of train engines to secure freight delivery contracts before your opponents.\nThere will be only one version of SteamRollers: All unlocked Stretch Goals will be included in all copies of the game. All unlocked expansions will be integrated in the final rules book.\nWHAT YOU GET IN THE BOX:\n1 Game box 25x25x5 Cm\n1 Fr+En+De+Nl Rules Book 24x24 Cm\n1 Main board, 24x24 Cm thick cardboard\n1 Play Aid Medium/Hard, 24x24Cm, cardstock\n1 Cloth bag\n1 First player 'train engine' wooden token\n1 Special black dice 20x20 mm (stretch goal 25k)\n6 Normal white dice 16x16mm\n6 Black 'Coal' wooden cubes 8mm (stretch goal 20k)\n50 'Goods' wooden cubes 8mm (5x10)\n1 'Solo play' action tile, thick cardboard\n6 'Action' tiles, thick cardboard\n6 'Order' tiles, thick cardboard (stretch goal 30k)\n1 player sheets pad, 100 sheets A5 recto-verso.\n FUNDED in less than 32 Hours!\nThis funds the base game, with the same gameplay as the Essen 2015 limited preview, PLUS a solo mode. Contains a central board, a difficulty player aid, 6 special action tiles, 1 solo player tile, 1 cloth bag, 5x10 wooden cubes, one wooden first player train engine token, one rulebook, and one pad of 100 dual sided player sheets.\n Gameplay upgrade : Coal mini-expansion\nThis mini expansion adds 6 'Coal' black wooden cubes. Coal can replace any resource during the game so it can be delivered to any city. it will also interact with another future expansion: the Orders\n Components upgrade : Bigger special dice\nThis level allows us to make the black special dice larger, and thus more legible. (from 16mm to 20mm)\n Gameplay upgrade : Orders mini-expansion\nThis mini expansion adds 6 tiles to the game. With this expansion, players can get extra points for their deliveries by fulfilling orders with a specific set of resources.\n Gameplay upgrade : Starting Powers\nThe starting powers mini expansion adds 5 tiles to the game. With this expansion, players get an asymetric start each game. Each player has a small starting bonus that differentiates him from other players.\n Component upgrade : 1st player token\nWith this stretch goal, we upgrade the first player token to a larger wooden engine meeple (44x25x15mm instead of 30x17x8mm), in golden color instead of Yellow.\nMore stretch goals will be revealed progressively during the campaign.\nWe have some nice things in store for you!\nThe central board has a map with the goods available for delivery. You have a personal play sheet with the same map, on which you draw your rail network and keep track of your engine fleet. When you make a delivery, the goods are removed from the central board and you earn points for cities and towns crossed. Once three cities on the central board have been emptied from available goods, the game ends. You then collect points for your deliveries, your engines, your network, and a few bonuses.\nSteamRollers is a fast and fun roll and write game. The active player rolls all the dice, then in turn each player picks a dice and uses it to either draw rail, improve his engine, do research, or make a delivery. Once each player has picked and used a dice, the next players rolls the all dice and so on.\nThe central board has the goods goods available for delivery, and each player has a play sheet.\nThe dice are rolled, and in turn each player uses one of the dice\nYou can use a dice to draw rails on your play sheet. The white dice determines the region, the black dice the kind of rails you can draw.\nYou can use a dice to improve your engine. The number indicates the box you can check. The number of checked boxes is your engine power. In this example, the white dice is a 2, and that checkbox is free. The engine now has a power of 3.\nYou can use a dice to make a delivery. The number indicates the source of the delivery, and the cube colour indicates the destination city. \nIn the example, we deliver a cube from region 1 (yellow). It's a blue cube so it must be delivered to city 5 (blue). There are three steps to cross (city 4, town and city 1), so we need an engine power of at least 3 to make this delivery. Each step earns the player one point, so this delivery is worth 3 points.\nThen a second delivery, a yellow cube from region 2 to region 1, also for 3 points.\nHere are some video reviews of SteamRollers. Reviewers have received a hand-assembled preproduction copy for review purposes.\nReviewers also received the mini-expansions that may be unlocked as stretch goals, so you have a sneak preview of what's coming here :-)\n(mention starts at 09:44)\nFRENCH VIDEO REVIEWS:\nThe team behind SteamRollers :\nCurrently I'm working as a programmer in Brussels. One of the great thing about Brussels is its vibrant board gaming community. Several times a week, I get to play great games with great people. One of my favorite genres are train games like for example Age of Steam, which was a big inspiration for SteamRollers. This is my first game design to find a publisher but hopefully it\u2019ll be the first of many.\nBenjamin started for publisher Editions Dupuis on the Alter Ego series, for six albums between 2011 and 2014. These were very well received and Benjamin was offered to work on the new season of Michel Vaillant, where he specializes on the cars and backgrounds. Benjamin is now considered a reference artist in realistic European comic strips, and gladly accepted the opportunity to explore a different setting and medium for SteamRollers.\nRetailers: please click here to register as a participating store and pre-order SteamRollers at retailer discounted price. We don't tie up your cashflow: Order now, pay when shipped to your store!\nSteamRollers will be a Kickstarter Exclusive* game for one full year after the campaign ends! \nThis game will not be available in distribution or at your local retailer.\nOnly Kickstarter backers will be sure to get a copy of SteamRollers!\n*What do you exactly mean by 'Exclusive' ?\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign ends and for a whole year, The Flatlined Games edition of SteamRollers will only be available through limited channels:\n- Directly from Flatlined Games.\nThis includes our website, our Facebook shop, our booth at conventions and fairs, and maybe we will set up an Amazon Flatlined Games shop.\n- From retailers who registered during the Kickstarter campaign. Other retailers will not be supplied!\nParticipating retailers will be allowed to re-order as many time as they want during the exclusivity period - while stocks last. The list of participating retailers will be published on our website, in the retailer locator.\n- It is possible that foreign partners contact me after the game is released to make localized versions of SteamRollers in languages not included in the Flatlined Games edition (Fr/En/De/Nl). Such localized versions may become available in the localized retail and distribution channels before the end of the exclusivity period. However I know from experience this takes time, usually more than one year. I will make sure to post updates if this happens.\nAt the end of the one year exclusivity period, I will assess whether it makes most sense to open to distributors and other retailers, to keep this channel restriction in effect, or to start a new campaign for a reprint.\nShipping will be added to your pledge automatically.\nThis project is EU and USA/Canada friendly: Shipping will be domestic for EU and US/CAD locations! \nWe will partner with local web-retailers Funagain.com (US), Levalet (CA) and Philibertnet.com (Fr) for shipping this project. They have expertise about sending individual parcels and volume to get cost-effective deals from carriers, and did a terrific job for our previous campaign, Argo.\nDon't change a winning team!\nMultiple pledges\nIf you want to pledge for several copies of the game, multiply your total (pledge+shipping) by the number of copies you want. We do subsidize a portion of the shipping costs for each pledge, so we cannot offer a lower total for grouped orders, sorry.\n There has been a lot of preparation before I brought SteamRollers on Kickstarter. Here is the full timeline :\nOnce the game is funded, lots of things still need to happen. First it takes a couple weeks for the project to be closed, money transferred, polls answered, etc. After that, the production process starts, and will last for about three months. Then the goods need be shipped from the factory to the shipping and handling facility, which takes another month and a half. So it will take at least 5 months between the project end and the time you get your game box. If there are issues to be solved along the way, it will be a bit longer. And we may get delayed on production and/or shipping from factory because of Chinese new year. (It could also be shorter, but I want to keep expectations realistic. Too many projects over promise and under deliver in that regard.)\nI positively impressed backers with Twin Tin Bots and Argo by delivering a bit early ahead of time, and intend to do so here as well. I have set a target date of May 2018, which is a worst-case scenario.\nNow that everything is ready to go to press, I do not want to delay SteamRollers further for lack of money to produce it. Without Kickstarter I simply cannot publish SteamRollers : I need your support to bring this game to the market!\nWithout you, SteamRollers will not be printed!\nI have a track record of high quality games, previous Kickstarter experience with Twin Tin Bots and Argo (both projects delivered on time and as advertised), and I can manage the complexity of this project. I have ran quotes with several manufacturers with a track record of quality games produced, to validate our design decisions and price them. I have the channels for logistics and fulfillment, everything is ready to bring SteamRollers to your door. All I need now is your pledge!\nThe key part of crowdfunding success is to be able to reach a crowd. Flatlined games is a small indie publisher, a one-man shop, and currently I have little 'reach' in the US. To make this campaign succeed, it is critical that this can become visible to as many US gamers as possible.\nAs backers, you play a key role in that visibility : \nPlease tell your friends about SteamRollers! \nShare the project page on Facebook and Twitter, on your website, everywhere! Each share reaches new backers!\nYou are our best ambassadors to make this project a success: people pay much more attention to your recommendation than they ever would to any banner ad or promotional video. Your network of friends and contacts is full or gamers we have no other way to reach. Your support makes a huge difference between a failed and a successful campaign!\nShare this link : https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flatlinedgames/262599968\nNB: All pictures are from a prototype version or 3D renderings, not actual game components. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main issue to produce SteamRollers is raising the funds to go to the factory.\n\nSteamRollers has received extended testing and development, and has been played on several events over the last three years.\n\nAll artwork for the game has already been produced, as the layout for the game components and design of the playing pieces: This project is complete and ready to be produced, it is not a work in progress.\n\nFlatlined Games already successfully produced six titles (Dragon Rage, Rumble in the House, Rumble in the Dungeon, Twin Tin Bots, Robin, Argo), and sold more than 80.000 copies of Rumble in the House/Dungeon over 7 years. I do have experience in this business, a proven track record, and a reputation to hold. I got funding for Twin Tin Bots and Argo through Kickstarter, and delivered both to backers as promised and ahead of schedule.\n\nPublishing a board game is however always a risky endeavor. Many things can happen, errors can be made, as board games are such individual projects that there is no 'standard procedure' that can be followed. I am confident I can deliver, just as I did before with previous projects.\n\nFlatlined Games is a one man business. The main risk is delays, in production or in shipment, as I will not compromise on product quality. Of course I will provide regular updates on production and shipping status and issues along the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac27 or more", "title": "SteamRollers - Kickstarter exclusive*", "descp": "One copy of SteamRollers, with all unlocked stretch goals, shipped to your home.\nThis is a one year Kickstarter Exclusive*.\nIf your country is not listed, please contact us.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["933 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Shipping update - all parcels have been sent (some still underway)", "update_content": "Hi all.\nI'm glad to report that all parcels have been sent from our fulfillment partners in Canada, USA and Europe.\nSome EU parcels are still underway and should reach backers this week.\nWe asked for an address confirmation to Eu backers to reduce shipping issues.

This is a Kickstarter project for an expansion to my hit board game The Networks. \nNot familiar with it? That's okay! Here's a website where you can learn more about the base game, and here's the Kickstarter project from 2015 where over 2,700 generous backers pledged over $100,000 to make it a reality.\nThe Networks is now in its third printing. It's been printed in Chinese, there's a German version in the works, and more languages are on their way. \nLike what you see? If your friendly local or online game store is sold out of The Networks, the base game is available from this campaign.\nYou'll need a copy of the base game to play The Networks: Executives.\nAnd now you're all caught up!\nSo you\u2019ve proven your worth in the past. We know you can run an ordinary TV network. Big deal.\nWe have a bigger challenge for you. Here are 12 unique Network Executives, each with their own weird characteristics. Every Executive has powers, but they also have significant liabilities. Can you master each Executive\u2019s idiosyncrasies, draft the best Season 0 cards, claim your true status as a Mogul, and come out on top?\n           The Networks: Executives adds three major components to The Networks: Executives, Season 0 Cards, and Mogul Cards.\nThe Executives are the biggest addition to the game. The expansion comes with 12 Executives in the box. Each one will significantly change the way you play the game by giving you a set of distinct powers and liabilities.\nYou can play as Flix, which turns your network into a streaming service that lets you consider all your Shows as being in their proper time slots... but every time you switch genres within a time slot, you lose Viewers.\nYou can play as Beeb, which turns your network into a state-run enterprise that tends to generate revenue. But because you now have a lot of bureaucracy to deal with, you must use a rondel to choose your actions.\nYou can play as Telethon, which turns your network into a public broadcasting network. You may not hold Ads in your Green Room. But you may hold a telethon once per season to ask other players for money, in exchange for powerful Sponsorship Tokens. If they don't give you money, you get to keep the Sponsorship Token to use yourself.\nAnd so on. With all the Executives in the game, the amount of challenge and replayability grows enormously. \nThe Season 0 Cards are a new way to begin the game. Instead of everyone starting with similar Shows, Stars, and Ads, you will now begin the game with a draft. Everyone starts with a hand of 4 Season 0 Shows, and chooses one as their 8 pm Show. Most Season 0 Shows get you Stars, Ads, and/or Money, but have no genre and give you no Viewers. Others have a genre and Viewers, but get you nothing else.\nOnce you've selected your 8 pm Show and received anything it gives you, you'll pass the remaining 3 Season 0 Cards to the player on your left and receive 3 cards from the player on your right. Everyone will now choose their 9 pm Show, and so on.\nThis starting draft ensures that players begin the game with completely different setups. Some players may begin with a stocked green room, but no Shows with Genres. Other players may get shows with Genres to get a head-start on their Genre Bonus, but with little in their green room.\nWhy is the race to a Genre Bonus important? Because of the third addition to the game: Mogul Cards. These are effectively supercharged Network Cards. At the start of the game, you'll deal out a number of them to the table equal to the number of players plus one. These will be the only Mogul Cards available in the game; you will not replenish these between Seasons.\nYou get a Mogul Card by either getting your first 5-Show Genre Bonus, or your second 3-Show Genre Bonus. You can no longer draw Network Cards or trade in money for Viewers after a 5-Show Genre Bonus, but some Mogul Cards still let you do that. \nMogul Cards even out some lategame swinginess present in the base game and give players a long-term goal to shoot for.\nWith these three huge additions to the base game, The Networks becomes a much deeper and more replayable game!\nWant to know more? Here's a draft of the rulebook for the expansion!\nWant to try it? If you have a copy of the base game, here's a free PNP of the expansion! \n    \"If you ever thought what your damp, shoddy, and structurally unsound public access TV station experience needed was to give more attention to the equally shoddy and unsound eccentricity of its management, then you're in luck! Because that's what Executives is all about.\" - Cardboard Republic\n\"The Executives adds a ton of variability and exciting new strategies to the base game! The wide array of player powers and Season Zero starting options makes every player's game feel unique with interesting and challenging decisions. The addition of Mogul cards give players powerful rewards to work towards, and the new shows inject welcome new content for regular players. More than an essential expansion, The Executives is a reward for Networks fans!\" - Danielle and Jake Bock, Draft Mechanic\n\"When we played it was obvious that this expansion gives The Networks a ton of replayability. This is totally an expansion you need if you like the original game.\" - Gameosity\n             \"...The Networks is a well crafted card-drafting game. The game remains engaging throughout the entire playing time, and the escalating strength of the three Show decks gives a nice trajectory to the strategy/scoring.\" - The Opinionated Gamers\n\"This is the perfect medium-weight game... I\u2019m impressed with what Gil Hova has done in The Networks and look forward to seeing how it will do on Kickstarter. He\u2019s made a solid game with a great sense of humor. And yes, it was difficult to cancel \u201cAn Hour of Shouting\u201d, but it didn\u2019t bring in the viewers I needed. There\u2019s no room for sentimentality on the Networks.\" - Indie Cardboard\n\"The Networks is, quite literally, my favorite Euro-style game. Gil Hova has done what many have found unthinkable, combining a deep economic game of resource management with sharp humor and an incredibly engaging narrative. It's a perfect blend of mechanism and theme. It is, in short, UHF: The Euro Game. And you need it in your collection.\" - Your Moderator Chris, Flip the Table podcast\n\"If you're looking for some lighter fun with a backbone, and fantastic dad puns, you can feel good spending an hour of your table time with it... I think Gil's game is smart, well-designed, and it sneaks in a challenging game under the cover of humor.\" - Heavy Cardboard\n\"With screwball humor and well-developed mechanics, this game offers both charming flavor and solid design. The Networks is basically UHF: The Board Game. It encourages you to excel at the inanity of television programming on the one hand while lambasting it on the other, and yet this charming mix of motives adds up to a game that\u2019s amusing and strategic all at once.\" - The Cardboard Republic review (Awarded the Seal of the Republic!)\n\"The Networks is a thoroughly enjoyable card game. Deciding when to develop new shows and drop existing shows, as well as what time slots, who will star in them and what advertising to use is surprisingly fun. The game plays fast, is easy to teach but has many tough decisions. I cannot wait to see what potential additions come about from stretch goals for this game\u2019s Kickstarter campaign.\" - Board Game Quest\n\"All-in-all, I really enjoyed The Networks. It is approachable, funny, and smart all at the same time. I know that this is a game that I can bring out with newer gamers because they will have a blast with the theme, yet I can also bring it out with more hardcore gamers due to its subtle depth. Gil Hova of Formal Ferret Games has created an impressive gem; One which points to a bright and successful future for this indie publisher. I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of cards and new ideas will make their way into future expansions. Any game that can make me want more while still feeling like a complete and final product has something special going for it.\"- Meeple Mountain\n\"This is a winner. I want one. We're actually going to fight over this copy.\" - Punching Cardboard\n\"Overall, The Networks was done beautifully and kept me wanting more... kinda like my yearn for reality television, but much less guilty this time around.\" - Indie Tabletop\n\"The Networks is simply an extremely well-designed game... and the gameplay is just so solid. Maybe it\u2019s true that there\u2019s nothing good on TV, but, quite frankly, with The Networks, I\u2019ve already got plenty of entertainment at my fingertips.\" - Gameosity\n\"Like an episode of Game of Thrones, this game is addicting and leaves you wondering how the last 60 minutes flew by so quickly. The Networks is must-see-TV and I highly recommend you check it out.\" - League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"...it\u2019s strong in all its elements \u2013 theme, gameplay, strategic challenge, accessibility, length, graphics, humor \u2013 across the board, making for a fantastic game that\u2019s greater than the sum of its already solid parts. A game of The Networks is more fun than drinking from the fire hose, and in the end, fun is what it\u2019s all about.\" - Up With Meeple\n  At this pledge level, you can stay subscribed to updates about the game. Every little bit helps!\nThis pledge level is for retailers only. It will allow retailers to buy The Networks and The Networks: Executives by the case. If you pledge at this level, you will buy the games as an add-on, so you will not be charged until just before the games get shipped to you. \nThis pledge level will allow you to get digital Print-and-Play files (PNPs) for The Networks, The Networks: Executives, and The Networks: On the Air. You will need to print these files out and cut them into cards in order to play the game. \nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks: Executives and all PNPs. This pledge level does not include a copy of the base game.\nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the International Executive level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks: Executives, one physical copy of The Networks: On the Air, and all PNPs. This pledge level does not include a copy of the base game.\nOn the Air is a mini-expansion containing the stretch goals achieved from the previous Kickstarter campaign, with extra Shows, Stars, and Ads, as well as stickers to put on your turn order and scoring markers and some blank cards to come up with your own Shows and Stars.\nThis will be a new printing of On the Air, so the quality here should be more consistent than the first printing.\nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the International Executive with bonuses level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks base game, one physical copy of The Networks: Executives, and all PNPs.\nThere are still quite a few copies of the base game floating around local and online game stores. I heartily encourage you to consider buying the base game from your favorite game store. You'll support their business, and you'll be familiar with the base game by the time The Executives arrives at your door!\nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the Executive Int'l Vice President level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level gets you one physical copy of The Networks base game, one physical copy of The Networks: Executives, one physical copy of The Networks: On the Air, and all PNPs. \nIf you're in Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, or Iceland, please back the game at the Executive Int'l Vice President with bonuses level, which will offer a reduced shipping rate!\nThis pledge level contains everything that the Executive Vice President+ pledge level gets you, PLUS you get to name an Executive!\nHere's how it works. Each Executive is double-sided, with a female figure on one side and a male figure on the other. Each Executive has a stock name for their power, e.g. Mr./Ms. Rich, Mr./Ms Cheapo, Mr./Ms. Telethon, and so on. But at this level, you'll supply us with the Executive's real name, like \"Martha Higgenbottom III, Esq.\" \nYou're welcome to choose your own name, the name or nickname of a friend or loved one, or a fictional name you just think sounds cool. I will have veto power over all names, though, so please don't submit anything off-color or unpleasant!\nThis pledge level contains everything that the Executive Vice President+ pledge level gets you, PLUS you get to name a Network!\nHere's how it'll work. There are 5 player boards, just as in the base game. These player boards will be divided into a Network Name board, showing the name of your network and your player color, and an Executive board, reminding you of what powers you have.\nThe Network Name boards will be double-sided. The existing network names from the base game (U62, VCK, PKW, ICS, and MOO) will still be on one side of the board, but the name you select will be on the other, along with a brand-new design.\nI will have veto power over all names, though, so please don't submit anything off-color or unpleasant!\nWant more copies of the game? You can add them on here!\nI will be using a pledge manager called BackerKit to help manage add-ons. So while you can pay for these add-ons by increasing your pledge, you can also wait until the campaign ends. Either way, you'll submit the add-ons when you give me your mailing address. Then, if your pledge isn't enough to cover the add-ons, BackerKit will prompt you to cover the difference. \nI used BackerKit in my previous campaign for Wordsy, and I found it made my job exponentially easier. Hopefully it will help you out as well! \nNote that all these prices are without shipping. I will calculate add-on shipping costs closer to the end of the campaign.\nYou can order an extra copy of The Networks base game for $50 extra, plus shipping.\nYou can make it a 3-pack (add 2 copies of The Networks base game to your pledge) by adding $90 to your pledge. This 3-pack offer is only available if you have pledged at a level that includes the base game as a reward level ($79 and up).\nYou can order an extra copy of The Networks: Executives for $29 extra, plus shipping.\nYou can make it a 3-pack (add 2 copies of The Networks: Executives to your pledge) by adding $50 to your pledge. This 3-pack offer is only available if you have pledged at a level that includes The Executives as a reward level ($29 and up).\nYou can order an extra copy of The Networks: On the Air for $6. \nThere are no quantity deals available for The Networks: On the Air.\nThe Networks: On the Air contains stretch goals from the first Networks campaign; see the $35 pledge level above for more details. \nThese stretch goals will not come in the retail box for the expansion! Instead, they'll be packaged in external expansions that will be available once the expansion is out in stores.\nThis means the stretch goals below are not exclusives. However, they will be tougher to get ahold of than the base game or expansion, so this is your best opportunity to pick them up! \nCOMPLETE! At $30,000, the project has been officially funded. Hooray!\nCLEAR! At $40,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will now receive 20 clear plastic cubes to replace the black timing cubes from the base game. A lot of people who play The Networks like to place their timing cubes directly over the number of viewers they're getting that season, in case they have a show on at the wrong time slot. Transparent cubes will make that a lot easier!\nCOMPLETE! Meet the Gorilla! At $50,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will receive a 13th Network Executive.\nThis character is the 800-pound gorilla. When playing, you will get extra money at the start of each Season ($2M per player in the game), and extra Viewers at the end of the game (1 Viewer per player in the game). The downside? You go last every Season, regardless of your score. Quite a challenge!\nCOMPLETE! Meet Continuum! At $60,000, all backers pledging $29 and up will receive a 14th Network Executive.\nThis character is a time traveler! Once per Season, you may spend money to run your time machine to take two actions on your turn. If you don't do that during the Season, you may run it at the end of the Season to consider one of your Shows as being in its proper time slot.\nWhen you run your time machine, you'll take an Anomaly card and put it on top of the Star Deck. Any player who gets that card, either through drawing from the top of the Star Deck, or in the following Season, when the card becomes one of the Stars available to Sign, puts it in their Green Room. You can spend an Anomaly to get two actions on your turn.\nCOMPLETE! At $70,000, we will give each Network Executive its own logo! This will make them easier to distinguish from one another.\nI have a signature up there, but they won't necessarily look like signatures. Rich may have their name written in diamonds, Butcher will be sharp and maybe drip something red, and so on. It's going to look cool!\nCOMPLETE! OK, this one is exciting. At $80K, I'll provide replacement scoring markers in all colors that will replace the squares that came in the base game. These scoring markers will look like cute little TVs! And they'll still stack nicely like the original discs.\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nCOMPLETE! ...and here's the companion to the $80K stretch goal! At $90K, I'll provide replacement turn order marker in all colors that will replace the discs that came in the base game. They'll look like little remote controls!\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nAt $100K, you'll get a new Season Marker that will replace the current one. It's going to look like a TV tower!\nNote that the image above is just a mockup; they will not necessarily look exactly like that, but it's the spirit of what we want!\nWhen I launched this Kickstarter, I was going to ship out the base game along with Executives, in the same package. But at $125K, I will be able to manufacture the base game first, get that on a cargo ship ASAP, and deliver it to you in a separate package a few months before Executives!\nIn a week or two, I will have a better estimate of when I can fulfill the base game if we reach this stretch goal. Right now, it's looking like we can deliver it no later than April 2018, possibly sooner.\nThis stretch goal will only affect folks who pledge at $75 and up. \nAt $150K, all backers who pledge $29 and up will get all starter Shows, Stars, and Ads from the base game, with special rules on how to incorporate them in Networks: Executives!\nThis stretch goal has been requested by a few backers. I had to figure out a way to smoothly incorporate them into the experience, but after some testing, I think I have it.\nAll Starter Shows will now all be gray \"no-genre\" cards, but will have the same names and art as from the base game.\nIMPORTANT - If you are in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, or Switzerland, and you want to back at the $29 or $35 levels, make sure you pledge at the International Executive or International Executive with Bonuses levels. Those will give you better shipping rates!\nNote that there's a slight omission in the pledge level bullet points for the International Executive pledge level. There should be a bullet point for a physical copy of the On the Air expansion.\nFor this campaign, I am providing a $7 discount on shipping for all backers. This won't reduce your shipping cost to $0, but I hope it will take most of the sting out of the shipping bill.\nIf you're backing in Canada, you will not have to pay any extra charges beyond shipping. All rewards will ship from Starlit Citadel, based in Vancouver.\nIf you're a customer within the EU, your rewards will ship from within the EU. This means people who live in EU-member countries will not have to pay VAT. Hooray!\nKeep in mind that some countries like Switzerland are physically within the continent of Europe but are not EU members. If you're in a non-EU-member nation, you may still have to pay customs, taxes, or import fees on your package.\nIf you are in the EU and choose either the $29 or $35 pledges, your package will not be tracked by default, as that increases shipping costs significantly. If you fall into this category and prefer your package to be tracked, message me and we can work something out.\nOne more note on current events: At the time of this campaign, the UK is still part of the EU. The current plan is to ship all EU rewards (including UK rewards) from the UK. \nIt's unlikely that will change by the time of fulfillment, but if it does, I will send UK rewards from within the UK and EU rewards from a different fulfillment center within the EU. \nEither way, if you are in the EU right now, you will not have to pay VAT!\n   Gil Hova - Game Designer\n Travis Kinchy - Illustrator\nHeiko G\u00fcnther - Graphic Designer\nKickstarter Page Graphic Design\nDaniel Newman\nMain video voices:\nEthan Hova\nGil Hova\nBrodrick Jones\nCarrie Margulies\nJosephine Stewart\nMain video animation:\nBen Shulman, Jellybean Soup\nMain video music:\n\"Magic Forest,\" \"Enter the Party,\" \"Eighties Action,\" \"Surf Shimmy,\" \"Egmont Overture (Beethoven),\" \"Malt Shop Bop,\" \"DarxieLand,\" \"EDM Detection Mode,\" \"Teddy Bear Waltz,\" and \"Lost Time,\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoard games are hard to make! Anyone who's used Kickstarter to back a tabletop game can tell you about projects that funded but delivered late... if at all.\n\nI've been designing games for a long time, and I now have three successful Kickstarter projects under my belt: The Networks' base game, Wordsy, and Bad Medicine. And by \"successful,\" I don't just mean that they funded. All of my projects have shipped to backers around the world within a month of the estimated ship date.\n\nI've backed enough projects to know what tends to go wrong with a tabletop campaign. Here is what I'm doing to make sure The Networks: Executives will not be delayed.\n\nFirst: Game design and graphic design are mostly done. This game is less than a month away from being ready to be sent to the manufacturer. In fact, I will begin the pre-production process with my manufacturer during the Kickstarter campaign, which should save us some time.\n\nSecond: One lesson I learned since the original Kickstarter campaign for The Networks was a better understanding of manufacturing and quality. Since then, I've switched manufacturers. Ever since the second printing of The Networks, I've used Panda Games, one of the biggest and best-known hobby game printers in the world. I've also used them for my game Wordsy. They deliver incredibly high-quality products on time.\n\nThird: I will be using several board game fulfillers to deliver The Networks: Executives to the US and most of the world. That leaves shipping in the hands of people who can send packages safely and quickly, and who understand that tabletop games require more packaging than other products. \n\nFourth: I am using a company called OTX to handle the logistics of transporting the manufactured games from the plant in China to the warehouse in the US. This is an intricate process, but OTX is quite used to it, and they specialize in board game logistics. I've used OTX to deliver two printings of The Networks and the first printing of Wordsy, so I know they're reliable.\n\nFifth: I've backed plenty of Kickstarter projects, some which delivered on time, some which delivered late, and some that never delivered at all. I learned a lot from each of them.\n\nAt this point, I'm familiar with just about everything that can go wrong in a Kickstarter. Believe me, failing to fund is not even close to the worst-case scenario! I've heard many stories, from artists never delivering their art, to pallets stolen at the port, to mold in the game boxes and snails in the shipping container.\n\nBut I've built a great team around me. I feel that I am prepared to deliver this product to you close to my estimate of July 2018.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Viewer", "descp": "Thank you for keeping an eye on the campaign!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["84 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Business Partner", "descp": "This level is only for retailers!

Coupling that with its approachable ruleset, Mint Delivery is a great tool for introducing new players to the genre of pick up and deliver.\nCheck out the Mint Delivery rules to see more detail about what makes Mint Delivery tick.\nAll Cards contained within a copy of Mint Delivery are printed upon Premium 305GSM blue core card stock. Mint and Truck Tokens are made of Wood and all other tokens are made from 2mm thick chipboard. All printed components will have a linen finish.   \nJames Hudson - Druid City Games  \nMarried with Board Games \nLindsay - Shiny Happy Meeples\nWhat's Eric Playing\nWhat's Eric Playing - #125 - Mint Delivery [Preview]\n Board Game Geek Comments \n\"...Even if pick up and deliver games are not your cup of tea try this one out and you might find a renewed interest in the genre.\" - MHGreenleaf\n\"Played a prototype yesterday and really enjoyed it. Similar to Mint Works, even though it's small there's a lot going on.\" - MichaelDyrud\nYou can download the rules here\nIn Mint Delivery, players take the role of a mint delivery truck driver, driving around the area taking orders for mints, then delivering them. Each player has two actions on their turn, such as moving, loading their truck, and upgrading the mints they are carrying. Once enough orders have been taken, the game ends.\nWhoever has fulfilled the highest value of orders will be deemed the employee of the month and win. \nFive24 Labs on Social Media:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nNewsletter\nDiscord\nMint Delivery was created after the success of Mint Works, with the idea to introduce another mechanism to non-gamers while still being interesting enough for gamers to want to bring it to the table.\nI wanted to come up with another quick easy to teach game for a mechanism that I felt didn't have a lot of options that didn't take a long time to play, while also straying away from games with direct conflict between players.\nPick up and deliver seemed like a really good place to start. Since the vast majority of these types of games tend to be quite long, and have a lot of gotcha kinds of rules.\nThat gave me this set of constraints that I utilized for making Mint Delivery:\nHas to fit in a mint tin \nHas to be taught as easy or easier than Mint Works \nHas to play quickly \nWith those constraints in mind, I started the task. \nSince it was to fit in a mint tin, I decided to continue the same visual style that we used with Mint Works, and also to continue the overarching narrative of Mort from the first game. It seemed logical to me that Mort has had a lot of success with his mint making company and has started to branch out and provide mints to more than just the local neighborhoods.\nThat gave a great foundation for the supply/demand chain that would be the foundation of the pick up and deliver mechanism. I didn't want the mint requests to be too flat, so i added some \"improved\" type mints to the mix at that point. Which essentially gives us 3 forms of currency instead of just one.\nFrom that point, it was all about creating orders for mints, a few locations to pick mints up from, and a map to lay it all out. And that's where we are now.\nIf you are excited enough for Mint Delivery that you just can't wait for the fully produced copies to get here from the factory, I have provided a limited pledge level.\nThis level will entitle you to a copy of the fully factory produced version of Mint Delivery as all other backers, but it will also include a hand made advance copy delivered shortly after the campaign ends.\nThe advance copies will be entirely hand made by me in my workshop and numbered. (e.g. 03/50.)\nThe advance copies will be of similar quality to the prototypes that you see in the review videos. See below for examples.\nPhoto Credit Eric from whatsericplaying.com\nBecause Mint Delivery is a small game in terms of physical size and weight, shipping costs are very reasonable. The manufacturing costs are low enough that VAT shouldn't be a concern.\nI wish that I could provide free shipping to the majority of places, however the low price point of the game means I have very little wiggle room for costs.\nThat said, I will be providing free shipping within the US, and applying a discount to shipping elsewhere equal to the cost of shipping within the US. Here is a brief chart explaining the shipping costs:\n* The vast majority of countries falls in this region, including: Argentina (AR), Australia (AU), Austria (AT), Bahrain (BH), Belarus (BY), Belgium (BE), Belize (BZ), Bulgaria (BG), Brunei Darussalam (BN), Canada (CA), Cayman Islands (KY), Chile (CL), China (CN), Colombia (CO), Costa Rica (CR), Croatia (HR), Cyprus (CY), Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Estonia (EE), Finland (FI), France (FR), Germany (DE), Greece (GR), Hong Kong (HK), Hungary (HU), Iceland (IS), India (IN), Indonesia (ID), Ireland (IE), Israel (IL), Italy (IT), Japan (JP), Korea, Republic of (KR), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Luxembourg (LU), Malaysia (MY), Malta (MT), Montenegro (ME), Netherlands (NL), New Zealand (NZ), Norway (NO), Peru (PE), Philippines (PH), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Qatar (QA), Romania (RO), Saudi Arabia (SA), Serbia (RS), Singapore (SG), Slovakia (SK), Slovenia (SI), South Africa (ZA), Spain (ES), Sweden (SE), Switzerland (CH), Taiwan (TW), Thailand (TH), Turkey (TR), Ukraine (UA), United Arab Emirates (AE), United Kingdom (GB)\n** Brazil, Mexico, Russia and any countries not previously listed fall into this category.\nWe have partnered up with Mr. B Games to assist in the fulfillment process to ensure that everyone gets their rewards quickly, correctly and in great condition.\nI would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Delivery before the game makes its way into distribution. If you're a retailer, please send me a message here on Kickstarter, or email md.retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nWe will also be funding a re-print of Mint Works with this campaign, you can add extra copies of Mint Works at $10 each during the campaign, or later on during the pledge manager.\n\nNote: Any add-ons that you select will be delivered at the same time as the rest of your rewards from this campaign.\nSince the map doesn't change from game to game, we came up with the idea of using a mat for the game to play on during demos, it worked out so well that we have decided to add custom mint delivery mats on as add-ons to any pledge level as well.\nCurrently we are a small but potent team that consists of two Mad Scientists myself and Mel (you might recognize him as Mort) and our awesome testing group. \nI'd like to use this space to acknowledge and thank them. I have an amazing, excellent and dedicated group of players that tolerate my crazy ideas and endless iterations.\nThey are up to the task of attempting to break things, and giving real feedback as we develop projects.

My name is Derik and I'm looking for a few archaeologists excited to get their hands dirty with field work. We have three locations already scouted and ready for someone to dig, dive, and explore. All we need is you!\n*FIRST STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!*\nAncient Artifacts is a challenging dice game for 1-4 players and takes 20-45 minutes. Players take on the roles of archaeologists working and researching at three different sites, managing limited budgets, and trying to avoid nefarious tomb raiders. Finish the game with the most renown and money to win.  \nThis is a \"roll and write\" game plus a little extra (action selection, pattern building, and push-your-luck). Players draw and roll dice from a bag to select their action and location on the Atlas board. Then, roll custom dice to mark off various sets, runs, or combinations on their career tracking sheet. Complete every career milestone at a location to find its ancient artifact!\n\nSkip the rules and watch this great video:  \nWant to know more? You can check out the full rulebook, a low-ink print and play with printer-friendly rules!\n                                    I'm not taking any chances here. I've teamed up with an experienced shipping partner who has depots around the world. They have promised me \"friendly\" shipping for all backers. Which means reasonable prices and no import fees! And yes, shipping to the rest of the world really is only $6 more than to the USA!\n Working on Ancient Artifacts has been an absolute joy. I've been blessed with the opportunity to share the game files with players and other designers all across the country for months now and to improve the game based on their feedback. Ancient Artifacts and I even made the trip to Unpub Prime in Baltimore, MD - where it was well received. Through precious time spent on critical feedback from generous volunteers, designers, and even a fan who taught it to his friend, we were able to streamline the game's conclusion and tighten up the time-frame. After months of testing, lucking into a working relationship with an incredible artist, and trusting in a very skilled editor, Ancient Artifacts is now ready for full scale production - which is where you come in!  \nBetween giant print runs, shipping prices that rise every year, taxes and fees, and even freight costs to get the game from the printer to a distribution annex for shipping, printing a game takes a LOT of money. I have already paid out-of-pocket for every pre-production aspect of Ancient Artifacts (illustrations, rulebook layout, editing, and even some of the helpful videos). However, I need your help to pay for the actual printing. \n\nWithout YOU (yes, you), I won't be able to share this game with the world. More importantly, without help, you won't have the chance to gaze longingly at Mr. Sosnin's beautiful illustrations on your table, laugh at your friends' terrible rolls, and feel the swell of pride as you demonstrate that you are the most prestigious archaeologist with excellent penmanship.\n  Derik Duley - Designer and Publisher\n Lover of God, Nicole, and games!

Thanks to lessons learned from other indie publishers, I have saved up a financial buffer to cover unexpected costs and budgeted a time buffer to allow for unexpected delays, like Chinese New Year (which shuts down production in February) and the dock strikes two years ago (which prevented MANY products from being properly imported through California's docks).\n\nAncient Artifacts will be manufactured in China. So, we'll need to wait for shipping and customs, but I am confident it will allow me to deliver a quality, affordable game. To reduce delays, the artwork is all already completed and, during the campaign, I will be working with a copy editor and graphic designer to finalize the rule book.\n\nIf any unforeseen delays do arise, I promise to be transparent and open. I believe that honesty in communication is critical for any successful relationship.

Think of it as a sneak peek into the next version of Wits & Wagers, which we plan to release nationwide in Fall 2018 as a replacement for both Wits & Wagers Party and the original Wits & Wagers.\nHow can one game replace two games, you ask? By combining the best of both into one game that does it better than either. To get the word out, we're offering a limited-edition, over-sized playmat at a highly subsidized cost (we won\u2019t make a profit on this campaign). You can get everything you need to play Vegas Wits & Wagers through this Kickstarter. \n  Before we introduce Vegas Wits & Wagers, you should know what Wits & Wagers is. \nWits & Wagers is a party game we published in 2005. It was a hit, sold millions of copies, and became the most award-winning party game in history:  \n  Wits & Wagers is a betting game masquerading as a trivia game. You don't need to know the answers to win, because you can win by betting (fake) money on other players' answers. This transforms the game into a high-rolling, push-your-luck nail-biter. Gameplay is simple as pie:\nRead a fun question...everyone writes down a guess.\nPlace your bets...which guess is closest?\nFeeling confident? Bet on yourself.\nThink others know better? Bet on them.\nNo idea? Bet on any guess and hope you get lucky.\nAfter 12 years and thousands of plays, we've figured out how to make it better. A lot better: \n  Vegas Wits & Wagers improves what everyone loves about Wits & Wagers: the betting. The centerpiece is a stupid-big play mat:\n  Its size makes it a show-stopper. It will turn any gathering into a Vegas casino, everyone standing excitedly over the mat, praying for their bets to pay out. It has a powerful table presence and you'll see from the reviews below we're not the only ones who think so.\nCompare it to the play mat for regular Wits & Wagers:\nIt's made of a luxurious, thick neoprene that's hard to damage. You can swaddle a medium sized dog in it when the need arises:\nPLAY\n\nThe size of the mat isn't the only cool thing about Vegas Wits & Wagers:\n  Cool Thing #1 - Wonderful Ways to Wager\nThe mat gives players options for betting that make the game feel particularly casino-ey. \nCool Thing #2 - Two Games for the Price of One\nThe mat's reverse side is the mat for Wits & Wagers Deluxe: you get two games for the price of one (Vegas and Deluxe). \nCool Thing #3 - New Questions\nEvery stretch goal in this campaign is a pack of specially-themed new questions. See the Stretch Goals for details.  \nCool Thing #4 - Covers for Unused Betting Areas\nThe covers to make it super-clear where you can't bet (which varies with player count). The game is now drunk-proof.\n    We have a bunch stretch goals to unlock. Our lucky number. Every stretch goal is a specially-themed pack of new questions for the game. Here are the first 4:   \n          Our own Bruce Voge III takes us on the Vegas grand tour:\n       You might be able to tell this next guy really likes the game. \n  If videos aren't your thing, check out this written 5-star preview from MeepleGamers or this review from The Gaming Gang.\n  Shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge at checkout\nThe prices listed above are for single copies. We've also added pledge levels that allow you to get two copies of Vegas Wits & Wagers ($50 pledge level), or two copies of Vegas with two copies of Wits & Wagers Party ($80 pledge level). For these levels, the shipping is doubled. \nThere's a way to save on shipping if you're in the US and you don't already own Wits & Wagers Party: pledge the $25 level, and then buy Wits & Wagers Party at your local Target (Target also offers the game online).\nThe estimated delivery date is November 2017, but bear in mind this is an estimate. And If you back the $40 level, your copies of Vegas Wits & Wagers and Wits & Wagers Party may arrive at separate times.\nWhy no international shipping?\nVegas Wits & Wagers is physically heavy, and ships in a large tube to keep the huge mat crease-free. The tube also requires that Vegas and Wits & Wagers Party must be shipped in separate packages and from separate locations. These factors make international shipping prohibitively expensive (as you can see from the table above, even getting these games to Canada costs more the games themselves). In addition, Wits & Wagers is a North American-centric game with many questions that only people in North America would have any idea about. These factors have lead us to decide to offer this game only to North American backers.\n   Vegas Wits & Wagers\nEnormous Honking Play Mat\n30 poker chips, in $500 and $1000 denominations\n7 Dry Erase Answer Boards\n2 Elvis Betting Tokens\n1 Dry Erase Pen\n2 Betting Space Covers\n1 Full-color Rules\nAs many new trivia questions as we can unlock in the stretch goals\nIf you choose the pledge level that includes Wits & Wagers Party (you'll need it to play Vegas Wits & Wagers), you will also get:\nWits & Wagers Party \n210 Questions \n50 Poker Chips \n6 Dry Erase Answer Boards \n6 Dry Erase Pens 1 Permanent Answer Board (with a \"1\") \n12 Betting Tokens (6 in $100 denominations, 6 in $200 denominations)\n1 Full-color Rules\n    This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNorth Star Games has been publishing board games for almost 15 years.

To do that, you'll be crafting items to send heroes on quests, earning treasure, and upgrading your guild with new specialists and rooms.\nEach turn you get to take one action \u2013 gathering resources, crafting items for heroes, or purchasing upgrades for your guild.\nGathering Resources\nThere are four main resources \u2013 cloth, leather, metal, and wood. On your turn, you can gather three resources of the same type, or two resources of any kind. Resources are limited and so is your storage space, so you'll need to plan ahead to use them wisely.\nWith the proper upgrades, you can also access gems and magic \u2013 special, higher quality resources that allow you to craft jeweled or enchanted items.\nCrafting Items\nTo craft an item for a hero, you spend the resources indicated on a quest card, and then gain coins for the item you crafted. Once a hero is equipped, they go on a quest, bringing back treasure and joining your guild.\nSome heroes need two items to go on their quest. If you're the first to craft an item, you earn coins right away, but don't get treasure until the second item is crafted. You get to place your guild mini on the quest, which means the hero will join your guild when the quest is completed.\nUpgrading Your Guild\nWhen you upgrade your guild, you pay coins to hire a specialist, build a new room, or both. Specialists are each unique, but only a few are available at a time, while the rooms are all available from the start of the game.\nYou have limited room for specialists above your guild, and rooms must be placed adjacent to your existing guild structure. You can earn bonus resources or coins when you cover up certain areas of your player board with a room.\nEnding the Game\nWhen the Council of the Wise arrives in Greycastle, each player gets a final turn and may make an offering to the council. Players reveal their treasures and score prestige for everything they've accomplished.\nThe guild with the most prestige earns the title of The King's Guild and their leader takes the throne!\nRulebook\n     Retailers \u2013 Message us on Kickstarter or email us at mirrorboxgames@gmail.com for special retail packages at wholesale prices.\n    (Some reviews refer to the game as Guild Masters, the title we used while in development.

They feature decision driven games embellished with interactive fiction, meaning that the outcome of your current game can affect future games. Each book features game rules, double-sided game sheets, and thematic fiction. The game sheets are perforated for easy removal and designed with writing (and possibly erasing) in mind.\n    We dedicate at least 100 pages to game sheets, meaning that depending on the number of players, you could potentially play the game 100 times. This varies depending on the game. Blood Royals features 50 2 player plays. Star Maps has 100-25 plays for 1-4 players. In addition, if you back for a physical copy, you also get the PDF with full color and printer-friendly printing options for unlimited extra game sheets!\n     Rules included. Plays 1-4 players.\n  These game books change as you play them. Depending on the game, this happens in different ways.\nBlood Royals\nIn Blood Royals, players take on the role of would-be monarchs competing for the throne. When you take a game sheet, it marks who you are. You and your opponent will always be political rivals (ex: Ulthar and Theonid). After you play, the winner is significant. In your next game, you'll circle the name of the character who won the last game. In this way, it creates a \"lineage\" of kings during your campaign. In addition, you'll read the fiction specific to the new King. That fiction will set up the next game, often asking the players to adjust their sheets in some way.\nExample: \"If Ulthar Won Age I: King Ulthar secured his throne, the power quickly affecting his mind. He ordered the construction of a massive castle situated in the center of Blackwallen and has forbidden the lower class from his capitol, denouncing them as would-be assassins. He sees attempts on his life around every corner as his paranoia grows. As the castle is built, so ages Mad King Ulthar. His ambitious distant cousins, Keltor and Diomel have set plans in motion; the kinds of plans that steal thrones from madmen. Help destroy the castle walls to claim the throne, end the madness and reclaim your family name.\"\nStar Maps\nIn Star Maps, the book changes in two ways as you play. First, the winner of a game will be able to name a star on a special star map in the book. Eventually, winners will be able to build a constellation using those stars. At the end of the book, this will be your great discovery, the cooperate hard work of all games played and won.\nThe second way is through technology. Players who don't win can unlock new technology. Unlocked technologies gives Bonuses players can use during the game. In future games, any player can use any available technology. In this way, both the winners and the not-so-winners get to affect the story elements.\nSolo players will have a score guide they'll utilize. Depending on how you score, naming stars (making constellations) and unlocking technology will occur. You can absolutely play through the entire book on your own and have quite the achievement-filled game book at the end!\nFor more information about progression, we're making campaign updates about them.

Two years ago I presented you a 'Cosmic Journey' which was so successful thanks to you. Now I'm now asking you to join me again in this Astral Adventure. Recently I announced I was giving up freelancing completely in order to pursue my own artistic endeavors! This Kickstarter is to help fund those dreams!\nWhat exactly is this Project Funding?\nAs I transition to my own independent work, I'll need all the support and help I can get along the way. I'm beginning to develop worlds and art projects involving those worlds. I've already started collaborating with wonderful game designers and writers on exciting new ideas so all of the proceeds from this Kickstarter are, in some way, going to help fuel that work while those projects evolve.\nI'm also continuing to expand my personal work and reach. As I do the demand for new products increases. Another goal of this Kickstarter is to help me cover the costs of a new print run of my standard products like playmats and mousepads. Everything beyond that funding goal will go directly into ordering and trying new types of products, including little extras to give to all of you wonderful supporters! \nYour help will not only allow me to provide an entirely new line of products but also fuel creating new and unique art!\n Below is the collection of Artwork that I'm presenting on as \"The Astral Adventure\"\nThe 6th piece I'm working on as the Kickstarter is running! Its a very important piece to me and also inspired by the community/fanbase! I'll be making consistent updates with it's progress! It's already underway so I have no doubt it'll be done before the end of the Kickstarter. \n                         Add-Ons\nAdd on any value below to your pledge to receive that item at a special quantity discount price and save on shipping! I'll ask you after the campaign what add-on you wanted.\nMousepad - $10\nMousemat - $15\nPrint - $20\nPlaymat - $30\nPoster - $45\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/NolanNasser\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nolannasser/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nolannasser/\nDeviant Art: https://nolannasser.deviantart.com/\nWhere is the money going?\nIt's expensive stocking all of my products and materials for conventions. The last order I made was close to $3000 and the new print run I need to do will be roughly $1500. Then there's the 8%-ish KS fee which will be $160. That leaves about $340 that I'm allocating to marketing expenses. Beyond that everything is going into funding new products! None of this is going into my pocket, it's all being funneled right back into N3 Art (LLC Pending) and in turn that business is how I stay afloat! I'm very transparent about my operations and finances so if you have any more questions, just ask! Thanks again for all of your support.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few risks associated with this project!

Overpopulation is destroying the planet. Time is running out. Elite factions are exploring the cosmos for a new home, new technology, new allies, or the resources needed to repair the plight of their damaged home world. With nothing left to lose and on the brink of madness, these warring Earthlings, equipped with deep-space warships with expansive cargo holds, will do whatever it takes to claim the glory for saving humanity...Before The Earth Explodes!   \nBefore The Earth Explodes uses clever tactics and intuition to secure victory in 1 of 4 ways:  \n*Advance to the top of the Tech Track  \n*Colonize 7 new planets  \n*Destroy the opposing faction  \n*Meet a variable victory condition revealed during play\nIn the game, players choose actions simultaneously to determine their course of play. Using a Rock-Paper-Scissors-style of action resolution, a scout will attack an invading ship while an invading ship will damage an away party or a mining vessel while a mining vessel will defend itself against a scout. If a player is able to avoid taking damage they will get to carry out special actions based on the card played. These actions allow players to increase their technology level, encounter an ally ship, clone an opponent's ability, take control of a new planet, or mine for resources.\nBefore the Earth Explodes is 2-player space epic in a small package. Each game takes 20-30 minutes to play. The game was created by the prolific design team and members of Game Artisans of Canada, Daryl Andrews and Adrian Adamescu (Sagrada, Mine All Mines, and the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Showdown).\nGame Setup:\nHere's a basic rundown on how the game is played (see video above for more in depth overview!):\n  Players choose and reveal their action cards simultaneously.\n  At the beginning of this phase, players resolve the icons on the portion of the card with the image.\n  In Phase 1, players may gain ship cards, deal damage, and cancel their opponent's action.\n  As long as players haven't been dealt damage they may resolve their actions (on the bottom portion of the card) in alphabetical order.\n    Next, as long as they haven't been damaged, players may spend resources to colonize a planet. Planets provide one-time use abilities as well as move players towards victory.\n  In the final phase, resources, planet cards, and ship cards are refilled to prepare for the next round.\n  There are several paths to victory that require outthinking your opponent and being attentive and flexible to the changing landscape or the game!\n Check out Jason giving an overview at Origins Game Fair:\n    As with every Green Couch Games title, we try to pack a big experience into a small box so you can easily get our games to the table with casual and hardcore gamer's alike!\nWe think Before The Earth Explodes is GREAT but don't just take our word for it!

Hurry, before we run out of time!\n         At the Captain Level and beyond, your pledge includes a killer custom playmat for organizing your play area! These playmats are cloth with rubber backing and measure 12\" by 18\" and 1/16\" in thickness. These will not be available in stores!\nYou can add-on one of our previous games by adjusting the amount of your pledge! The prices below include shipping. You can add this amount to your pledged amount and we'll collect information about the games you added at the end of the campaign. We'll also ship the add-on games out before Before The Earth Explodes, right after we receive the funds (about two-three weeks after the Kickstarter closes).  \nHere's the prices including shipping (which are cheaper than buying them from our webstore): \n                        Before The Earth Explodes is available world-wide and all copies will ship from within the US! International Shipping fees will be added to your pledge level when you select your home location.  \nAdded Shipping as follows:\nExplorer Pledge Level: US-Included!, Canada-$5, Everywhere Else-$8 \nCaptain and General Pledge Level: US-Included!, Canada-$10, Everywhere Else-$17 \nNote: International Backers will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package. However, this campaign is CUSTOMS FRIENDLY. The low price point and small box for this game should not cause any customs fees for backers pledging for 1-2 copies. We have learned that shipping is a costly endeavor, especially with the recent rate increase in the US Postal Service, and we must try to keep our costs as low as possible to keep our games at an appropriate price point for when they hit retail.  \nWe are saying THANK YOU to our early adopters on Kickstarter by offering the game below MSRP while covering the first $5 of shipping costs for all backers. We'll also be adding some extra content at no extra charge (when we reach STRETCH GOALS, of course).\nWe have plans to add value (STRETCH GOALS!) to Before The Earth Explodes that we think you will really appreciate. We plan to add value by upgrading components to make this cool game even cooler! We have several stretch goals in mind and we hope to hit them all! But know that just as with our previous campaigns, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery.  \nThat being said, we'll be listening closely to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the ideas that comes our way.  \nHere's a peek at the first couple stretch goals! We'll announce more and funding thresholds as we get closer to funding!\nThe cloth resource bag is unlocked! Onward and upward!\nCustom wooden tie breaker token is unlocked! To the cosmos!\nAt $9000, we upgraded to a box cover with Spot UV to help the awesome artwork standout even more! \nSpot UV is a process that involves adding a varnish to specific spots of the printed material to draw the eye's attention and give it a super fantastic visual pop and added texture.\nAt $10,000 we'll have the game logo added to the cloth resource bag!\nAt $11,000, we'll increase the size of the player boards from standard sized cards to tarot sized cards!\nIf you've checked out the videos and read the reviews and still want more info, you can check out the Work-in-Progress Rules PDF RIGHT HERE! The rules are currently being edited and reformatted for clarity and to match the feel of the art and graphic design.  \nThe rules are hosted on BoardGameGeek and will require a free account to download.

By rolling and manipulating dice for special abilities and combos, you can be the one that guides them to victory.\nOver the course of the last year, we've released over 3000 copies of tiny Twin Stars sets (a full game is 1 scenario & 2 characters) via Kickstarter stretch goals and Patreon monthly rewards. Some were sent out in huge numbers (Rule The World) and some were in very limited numbers (Stop The Virus). \nNow we have gathered everything together, packaged it all up and added some new cards for Twin Stars: Adventure Series I. This group of 6 scenarios and 12 characters, makes for 396 unique combinations and tons of solo replayability. \n The game comes in a few versions. \nWallet Game (above) - Including 12 Characters, 6 Scenarios, provide your own dice and tokens. (4 dice and 10-12 coins/tokens)\nDeluxe Game (below) - Including 12 Characters, 6 Scenarios, 4 dice and 30 custom printed punch out tokens.\nCatch Up Packs - Custom orders to pick up anything missing from your existing collection.\nHere's a quick run through the actions of a turn. \nYou will continue until you fulfill or fail the scenario requirements.\nFor a full game walkthrough, check out the video below.\nCheck out the complete rules here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mujbdswca30lq7l/TS-Rules.pdf?dl=0\nAnd try the print and play of Escape the Brig here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bvp7c2gwigayu8j/TWINSTARS-PNP.pdf?dl=0\n\"The game is incredibly well balanced, providing that you remember to do the skill checks when called for and actually play by the rules (I may have messed up a couple of times). The game forces you to make tough choices.\" -Jeremy Davis, Everything Board Games\nhttp://www.everythingboardgames.com/2017/07/twin-stars-collection-kickstarter.html\n\"I enjoy the system a lot. It\u2019s got a good challenge to it, and can be played very quickly in a small space. I think it\u2019s great that there are a number of scenarios and characters out there \u2013 this system lends itself to expansion. My favorite of the scenarios right now is probably Stop the Virus because I think it\u2019s the most different, but they\u2019re all good (at least the four that I\u2019ve tried). If you\u2019re interested in solo microgames, this is definitely one to check out when the Kickstarter goes live on July 19.\" -Jesse Hickle, Boards and Bees\nhttps://boardsandbees.wordpress.com/2017/07/14/0676/\n\"For anyone that regularly plays board and card games solo, Twin Stars is a no-brainer, especially at its price point.

Don't panic! Click the image to be automatically directed to where you can order Overworld!\n  Overworld is a competitive tile-placement, territory control, and exploration board game for 2-4 Players with a 1-player Solo Quest Variant! It was designed by Nemo Rathwald for ages 14+ and plays in about 30 minutes. The most beautiful thing about Overworld is its elegance in simplicity; it takes only 5 minutes to teach but mastery will only develop after many, many plays.\nIf you enjoy games like...\nCarcassonne\nAlhambra\nTakenoko\nTsuro\nThen Overworld should especially resonate with you!\nIn Overworld, players act as explorers piecing together bit by bit the map of the Overworld by placing specially designed interlocking tiles drawn from a bag onto an expanding world map and adding your explorer tokens onto any new tile you explore. The interlocking teeth will only allow you to place your tiles in legal locations, making gameplay very smooth and easy to learn. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\" \nEnclosed gaps will eventually form in the landscape, and in these gaps are where elusive Dungeons are discovered. Discover the Dungeons furthest apart from one another and control the most territory with your explorers riding Umbirds and Ships to win!\nOverworld is the second installment of our Super Nano Enhanced Series, which began with Fire of Eidolon (shipping now worldwide!) This project will undergo several ENHANCEMENTS during the campaign which will upgrade the components and content of Overworld, and can be unlocked via Backer total Stretch Goals, Funding Stretch Goals, and Social Media goals, which will all be explained in detail below.\nEVERY BACKER MAKES A DIFFERENCE! Overworld is mechanically like a Euro-game but is also highly thematic and heavily inspired by the 16-bit era of Role Playing and Adventure video games of the 1990's. It is visually stimulating and loaded with stylistic parody and in-jokes that fans of retro videogames will appreciate while still being accessible and wholly enjoyable by everyone all within a unique, original, and compelling game that stands entirely on its own. We started the Super Nano Enhanced Series with Fire of Eidolon and we continue the tradition as you explore that world in ages past...in Overworld!\nOverworld came to Magic Meeple Games as a fully complete publish-ready game called Mirage which had been nearly published by another company before coming to us at Origins a couple years ago. We absolutely loved Mirage and saw an opportunity to re-theme the game to fit into our Super Nano Enhanced Series. With a new title and theme, Overworld has been under iteration and development for years and we feel it is finally ready for everyone to enjoy!\nEasy to learn and teach, difficult to master, immersive theme, and a new board every time you play!\nHere are some of the features you'll find in this game and in our Kickstarter campaign:\nGreat Gameplay! - High praise from reviewers, gamers, convention-goers of all ages for Overworld! \nHigh Replayability! - Overworld uses a brand new PUZZELOCK TILE SYSTEM and is never the same game twice! Procedurally generate the world as you play to make every game a brand new story!\nHigh Accessibility! - Overworld uses a very simple set of rules has an extremely gentle learning curve and is extremely easy to pick up and play! The game can be taught in about FIVE MINUTES and after playing a few times will players begin to understand the depth that Overworld offers!\nBacker-only Discounts! - After all Enhancements from this campaign, Overworld will have an MSRP of at least $35.99. Our Backers can get it right now for just $25 no matter how much content is added on through Enhancements and Stretch Goals! That's a savings of nearly $11 per copy!\nENHANCEMENTS! Stretch Goals! Achievements! - Your pledge WILL make the game better! Together we will make it awesome! Every backer matters!\nInteractive Kickstarter campaign - Throughout the campaign we will make decisions about Enhancements and features based on the feedback YOU provide in our update polls! Leave your mark on tabletop gaming history!\nSimplest Bundle Pricing on KickStarter! - Order as many copies of Overworld as you want at $25 each and pay shipping only for the first one! Just add $25 per extra copy and enter the total at the pledge confirmation screen. Boom. Done. No spreadsheets. No tricks.\nCustomer Support - It is our duty and honor to put your concerns at ease throughout the ENTIRE production process. Frequent updates during the campaign and no less than one update a month post-campaign until delivery. If you have a question or just want to say hello, reach out to us!\nand now for something NEW:\nMONEY-BACK SATISFACTION GUARANTEE - We're borrowing a page from Stonemaier Games and offering a Money-back guarantee with the Overworld project! Within one month of receiving Overworld, if you're unhappy with the product and customer service you've received, just send the game back to us and we'll issue a full refund of your original pledge!\nNemo Rathwald's Puzzelock Interlocking Tile Design solves the #1 problem with tile-placement games!\n  Did you run out of play space? You can actually move this board and everything stays IN PLACE!\n  Questions? We're here to help! We aim to have 24-hour or less response time to all inquiries during the campaign!\n \nSuper Nano Enhanced Series games undergo many ENHANCEMENTS throughout the campaign, many are achieved like normal Stretch Goals, but some are special and will require involvement in the comments or on social media!\nHave a look at what we'e accomplished so far!\n      Click the image to visit our Twitter page!\n  And click HERE to visit our Facebook Page! \n  Measure the X/Y limits of your map and calculate your score much faster with this handy tool!\n  Towns and Sidequests now part of the Overworld package!\n  LINEN FINISH NOW INCLUDED!\n  You asked for it, and we've been saving it for the epic finish! Can we reach this high?\n    Your turn in Overworld is 4 simple steps: \n                                           Draw a Land Tile (from the bag) \nAttach it to another tile on the board (IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!) \nAdd Explorers to the Tile you added (one per segment, Umbirds for land, Ships for Sea) \nResolve Gaps! (Check for Dungeon discoveries!)\nJust how easy is it to play Overworld? Have a look!\nThe game will begin with a single Coastline Tile on the board. Begin your turn by drawing a Land Tile from the bag.\n  You may choose to place the tile LAND side up or SEA side up, as long as there is a place to connect it where the teeth fit without obstruction. IF THE TEETH FIT, IT'S LEGIT!\n  After placing a Land Tile, place three of your Explorer tokens on it, Umbird tokens explore LAND, and Ship tokens explore SEA. Each player gets seven of both to Explore the Overworld!\n  Yellow's turn is over, play continues in this way as Red and White each get a turn...until a gap is created into which no other tile can fit, then a Dungeon is discovered!\n  Dungeons are Discovered by counting up all of the Explorer tokens belonging to each player in all regions connected ORTHOGONALLY to the gap. Yellow has the most Explorers connected to this gap and gets to claim the Dungeon discovery.\nExplorer tokens (Umbirds or Ships) that are used to Discover a Dungeon (i.e. those belonging to the player that had the most and placed their dungeon door in the gap) are returned to that player to be used again, the others stay on the board!\nTake note that player White placed the tile that gave player Yellow that Dungeon! This is a very important tactic that you will need to deprive your opponents of territory!\nIf there is a tie, the player who placed the tile gets to decide who breaks the tie and gets the Dungeon Discovery. \nPlay continues until no more tiles remain in the bag, then scoring begins.\nEND OF GAME\nYou collect points for the Explorer tokens you still have in play, and the total distance of the shortest path (in Orthogonal spaces) around all of your Dungeon doors in play, door-to-door-to-door. Like this:\n  Click here to see the complete End Game scoring ruleset!\n    CURRENT GAME CONTENTS:\nThis list will change and evolve as we unlock Stretch Goals and add Enhancements! \nBox & Rulebook - Similar size and style as a 16-bit video game's box and manual!\n32x PUZZELOCK Land Tiles - Double-sided and Die-cut with our special Puzzelock design that physically prevents invalid tile placement. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\"\n28x Umbird Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n28x Ship Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n12x Dungeon Door Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n4x Quick-Reference/Faction Cards - Poker-Sized Cards - Never forget a rule or which color belongs to which player with these handy Quick-Reference/Faction cards! THANK YOU TO OUR DAY-1 BACKERS!\n1x Tile Bag - For randomization of tiles, through Enhancement goals, this could become a luxurious drawstring cloth bag with an embroidered design!\nExtra Zip-Lock Baggies - To carry everything and keep it organized!\nEXPANSION CONTENT PLANNED - To be revealed via Stretch Goal Enhancements. Planned content includes: Solo play and more than one Mini-Expansion!\nBONUS! Every copy of Overworld sold here will include an exclusive promo for our previous project, Fire of Eidolon! Thank you to all of the backers that helped us get here today!!\n  Throughout the campaign we will add additional goals to meet beyond our base funding goal. Each of those goals we achieve will add another ENHANCEMENT to Overworld. Some of these Enhancements will behave like traditional Stretch Goals which most are familiar with, but some will be different and put more focus on Backer Participation.                       \nThere are several ways to help support the Overworld project, here is more information about each available Pledge level to help you decide how you can support our project!\n                                                                                                                                                                                              Not enough Reviews for you?

Optimized sheets now consume 15% less ink!\n  WE NEED YOUR HELP!\nThe best thing you can do to help improve Overworld is to back our project. The SECOND best thing you can do to help Overworld is to spread the word and share our campaign on all of your favorite Social Media sites! Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help express your fandom! Collect them all!\n      Or, use this to make your own and we'll post it here!\n  Increase our total reach by FOLLOWING Magic Meeple Games on Twitter!\n  Visit us on Facebook and LIKE our page to help us unlock additional ENHANCEMENTS!\n       Adding additional copies of Overworld to your Pledge will not incur additional shipping charges in this campaign. Add $25 to your Pledge for each extra copy if our built-in Pledge levels do not suit your needs. We will discount every pledge down to charging shipping on only the first copy of Overworld in each order!*\nRewards for this project will be shipped primarily from the USA. Distributor/Manufacturer may collaboratively ship some rewards from other countries to save on shipping and customs costs. For the Fire of Eidolon project, we ultimately opted for a combination effort using Amazon and SFC (Ship from China) as many highly successful Kickstarter projects have done and the results have been favorable!\nRather than lock ourselves in to a specific method of shipping, we analyze the order distribution at the time of manufacturing to find the most cost-effective and time-effective distribution options available to us. This is our commitment to you in our goal for constant process-improvement and to provide the best possible products that we can!\n*Shipping price is for delivery of one entire order to a single address. \nResidents of Brazil, Russia, and South America take note: to ensure your package is delivered, additional charges may be required to ensure delivery verification in certain regions of these countries. If these additional charges are not paid, the chances of lost packages in those regions increases sharply and our distributor is attempting to implement solutions to this problem. If you reside in any of these countries please inquire about your pledge before the end of the campaign as the $20 basic shipping charge cannot guarantee delivery in these countries. \nRegarding Customs: Our shipping partners offers what they call \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping\" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. If any VAT taxes or customs fees would apply to your order, we make sure those are pre-paid to make it easier for YOU! \nWhile we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in our ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. We have had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. If all of our efforts still do not meet your expectations, you are still protected by our Money-Back guarantee! Pledge with Confidence!\nDelivering your reward responsibly\nOur primary goal and responsibility as Magic Meeple Games is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for, at the level of quality they expect, and as quickly as possible. Magic Meeple Games and its partners have years of collective experience overseeing planning and production to ensure Overworld well be delivered to all backers in a timely manner. \nSo far, Magic Meeple Games has produced and shipped two feature projects. Darkrock Ventures, which has fully fulfilled; and Fire of Eidolon which has been partially fulfilled already and will complete fulfillment before this Kickstarter campaign is complete.\nWe have run into slight speedbumps with each of these projects which hinged on the final completion of graphics. We can be proud of the fact the amount of delay was reduced dramatically with the fulfillment of FoE as compared to DRV, but we can do better. This time, we have a fully graphic-designed rulebook completed IN ADVANCE for everyone to enjoy which means we won't be waiting on it before manufacturing. This project focuses on the physical components of the game and less on artwork, this will also help us accelerate our manufacturing process and get the game made that much faster.\nIn fact, it is our goal to enter manufacturing on this project by October, and ALREADY have prepared art, graphics, and rules all in advance to make this a realistic goal. We are challenging ourselves to make Overworld our best-record for delivery, we have laid out even more groundwork ahead of time and together we can make this possible! Thank you for your support!\nWe do not plan to use use the built-in survey system for the Overworld Campaign, after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will use PledgeManager to manage your orders and give everyone one last opportunity to add on to their pledge. There are no separate or hidden Add-Ons during the Kickstarter campaign, only the pledge levels. \nIf you'd like to add additional copies of the game to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, or if you would like access to the special FoE Backer price on our previous projects, Fire of Eidolon and Darkrock Ventures, you will be able to do so within PledgeManager after this Kickstarter campaign ends. (PledgeManager will charge backers separately for any additional products added beyond what was pledged for in the Kickstarter.)\n    Seven hundred playtests. Two laser cutters. Twelve BoardGameGeekGold. Six Pez dispensers. The heat of a thousand suns. Boardgame designer Nemo Rathwald has most of these things. \nNemo's game design goals are:  \nInteresting choices\nLittle downtime\nLots of gameplay from as few rules as possible \nMultiple viable paths to victory \nComponents that physically don't let you break rules, so you don't have to remember them.\nNemo started searching the shelves for boardgames which turned out to only exist in his imagination. So he started making them so he could play them. He got into game design in 2003, at the first Penguicon (a convention of all geeky interests) and has been helping to run the convention ever since, where he playtests new board games of his own design every year.\nIn 2010, Nemo discovered i3Detroit hackerspace, a nonprofit community workshop with an educational mission in art and technology, where he volunteers as a Board Director, an Officer, and an Instructor. There, he upgraded his ability to make lavish show-stopping board game prototypes. Due to his experience in publishing, he fully illustrates and preps his games and rulebooks for pre-press in advance. In 2013 he changed careers from graphic design to web development. In 2014 he signed his first board game publishing contract at Protospiel, a convention for board game designers. \nNemo Rathwald carries a wheeled suitcase of board games in the trunk of his car at all times.\nHere is an unboxing video of our last production, Fire of Eidolon, so you can see the standard of quality we aim for with our projects!\nMagic Meeple Games, LLC. is a tabletop publishing company based in Phoenix, Arizona. By gamers, for gamers, we are Magic Meeple the Boardgame People! \nFounded, co-owned, and operated by a husband/wife team; We are passionate, lifelong tabletop gamers and we want to show that passion through the games we choose to design, develop, and publish. In our first campaign, Gamelyn Games partnered with us to elevate Magic Meeple Games to their level of quality and customer satisfaction straight out of the gate and we upheld that standard as we moved forward with our first solo campaign, Fire of Eidolon! Now we return for our THIRD Kickstarter project with hopefully many more to come.\nMagic Meeple Games origins began in the industry in 2007 through independent game design, company co-owner Ian Stedman is a published designer himself and has worked on several projects for several other publishing companies as a consultant and designed Magnum Opus for Clever Mojo Games. \nThis is the third core entry into our publishing catalog, and we drawn from the experience of designers, developers, publishers, distributors, manufacturers, and retailers all over the world.

It is prone to many surprises and problems, even for experienced publishers. \n\nFortunately our team is comprised of exceptionally experienced and talented individuals, with years of expertise in Game Design, Game Development, Print Publishing, Product Manufacturing, Project Fulfillment, Art, Technical Documentation, Retailer Support, Retail & Online Sales, Technology Support, Retail sales, and Graphics Design.\n\nWe co-published our first project, Darkrock Ventures, with the collaboration of the exceptionally experienced Gamelyn Games, and that project was a SUCCESS. Our first solo project, Fire of Eidolon was also a SUCCESS. We at Magic Meeple Games are proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have even more experience and knowledge in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nOur previous project fell a couple months short of our target Shipping date, and we have identified several contributing factors to that delay and have actively made improvements in our process to prevent the likelihood of such delays happening again.\n\nFor this project, we are focusing on a game which came to us very much complete. Additional features have been added and small tweaks have been made here and there, but suffice to say, the game is already finished and manufacturing-ready. All that is left is to put in the add-on content that is unlocked in the campaign, update the already designed fully-graphical rulebook (something that has been a challenge in the past) and send off the files. We have never been in a better position to go straight-to-print.\n\nWe are also expanding our horizons as we seek manufacturing and distribution, we are adapting to find better solutions to save time and money, this began by working with Discover Gaming Fulfillment with the distribution of Fire of Eidolon. Thanks to them, most of our backers have already gotten their rewards!\n\nDuring the manufacturing of Darkrock Ventures there was a technology failure that caused a delay that we could not control. This is just an example as things such as this cannot be helped no matter how prepared you may be. No project is immune to the possible mishap, but this road is familiar to us, our distributors, and our manufacturers and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. \n\nThank you for your confidence and support!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to customer service and backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nWe will be present DAILY during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

Earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation\u2019s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially on profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation\u2019s trade and other interests.\nThe Trade Federation specializes in generating large amounts of Trade and in gaining Authority (increasing your score).\nThese mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, \u201cThe Blobs.\u201d While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more-daring human traders.\nThe Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.\nThe Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. \nThe Star Empire is a combat-oriented faction that draws many cards and makes the opponent discard cards.\nA cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion.\nThe Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.\nA New Frontier\nIn the early days of space travel, the need for fast and efficient colonization drove the corporations of Earth to invest heavily in warp gate research, headed by Nathan Martin, a brilliant scientist ahead of his time. Martin's team executed many successful tests of this new technology, and the decision was made to create a massive deep-colonization fleet to send through the gate.\nDespite Martin's protests that more testing was needed, the fleet was assembled and colonists chosen. After the colony fleet were sent through, people of all nations watched in growing horror as the automated probes on the other side of the gate never recorded the fleet's arrival. The entire fleet had been lost!\nWith thousands presumed dead and staggering financial losses, a painstaking investigation was initiated. A fatal flaw in the warp gate generator was discovered. Each use of it had made tiny fractures in space time, and that had made each future use more likely to fail. The technology was abandoned.    \nHundreds of years later, after humanity was split by the arrival of the Blobs, the Trade Federation quietly started up Martin's research again. Unsatisfied with their share of plunder from the Colony Wars, the Trade Federation had grown desperate for new, uncontested worlds to exploit. Research funding again poured into the ancient warp gate technology and a breakthrough was achieved.  \nThe Trade Federation began to explore and colonize distant planets, far from previously explored space. Their exclusive access to this remote region of space was short lived, however. Hackers stole the warp gate research and sold it to the highest bidders amongst the Star Empire, Machine Cult and the Blobs.\nNow, all the factions race for a foothold in this new frontier!\nVideos and Reviews\nThere are many videos and reviews of various Star Realms sets online. Here are a few:\n    Project Notes\n\nOur goal is to get product to our backers as soon as possible. When product arrives at one of our shipping hubs in the United States, the EU, or elsewhere, we will begin the process of shipping to backers in that region without waiting for product to arrive at other hubs. This means that backers in the EU may receive product before backers in the USA, or vice versa. \n*Kickstarter Exclusives\nThese are exclusive items for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nKickstarter exclusive cards and sets will eventually (in a year or two) be remade with new art for general sale. The Kickstarter Exclusive version will be forever identifiable by its original art.\nNothing is final until it is printed.\nWe are still doing playtesting and development of these sets, so cards may change. All art, card text, and packaging pictured is subject to change.

I'll send you a couple of super-high-quality PDFs that mirror the files sent to the manufacturer.  This means full bleed on each card, and handy cut lines to ensure you make a beautiful game that you print out at home.\n$30: Extra Copy of Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture\nYou will only be charged for shipping on your original pledge--any additional copies of Oaxaca you purchase will have free shipping!\n$15: Roll-up Play Mat\nIf you're pledging for an extra copy of the game, consider grabbing an extra play mat as well!\nI am pleased to be able to say that Oaxaca will be my first EU-friendly project--in fact, it's also Mexico, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia friendly too!  If you're unfamiliar with the term, this means that a portion of the games will be sent directly to the those destinations after manufacturing, and then they'll go out to all the respective backers--this means backers in those destinations won't have to worry about import or customs fees.  I pay them!\nThe exception to this is the collector's edition, which will need to be assembled in my home before I mail it out--unfortunately, I cannot offer import-friendly shipping on this pledge level.\nUS shipping for all pledge levels is free.  For backers outside the US, a $15 shipping charge will be added to your pledge to help pay the cost of shipping, except for Mexico which is $5, and Brazil which is $20.  For the collector's edition, which will be sent with one-of-a-kind handicrafts and insured, shipping is $50 for international backers ($75 for Brazil).  \nBecause of how quickly the $100 collector's edition has sold out, we're offing an $80 version that is the same, but includes no Oaxacan woodcarvings--sorry!  The shipping prices outlined above apply to this pledge level as well.\nCurrently, backers from all other territories will have their games shipped from the US, though I am working on Canada-friendly shipping right now.\nYou may pledge for additional copies of the game by adding $30 per copy to your pledge--no additional shipping charges will be imposed. \nWhen I first laid eyes on Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture back in 2015, it was under a different working title: In the Ruins. Designed by Sarah and Will Reed, In the Ruins had an archaeology theme where players would visit dig sites, gain artifacts, and research them for points. It was a really fun game with, well, a competent and well-represented theme.    \nSimilar to Sarah and Will\u2019s Project Dreamscape before it, I knew pretty early in my first play-through that I wanted to publish In the Ruins--it was fun! My favorite thing about the game is how it rewards planning by giving you opportunities to create combos and wipe multiple Craft Tokens from your cards in a single turn. But when it came time to actually publish the game--when we put our heads together to develop it--we had some difficulties coming up with an art direction we liked. While archaeology is the focus in many of my favorite games such as Thebes, Artifacts, Inc., and the aptly named Archaeology: The Card Game, I didn't find it to be compelling subject matter to explore in such a well-represented genre. That\u2019s when I brought up a Oaxacan theme, and I think all three of us were a little surprised at how quickly everything came together.  \nI\u2019ve been fascinated with Oaxaca\u2019s handicrafts for years now, ever since my wife surprised me with my first alebrije while she studied abroad in the beautiful state. I\u2019ve collected little bits of barro negro pottery and tin art here and there, and I\u2019m still spellbound by the incredibly specific processes Oaxaca\u2019s artists employ when crafting their beautiful art--often using raw materials right there in the state! You really won\u2019t find anything quite like it anywhere in the world.\nOver the last two and a half years, Sarah, Will, and I have spent many days and nights honing the game into what you see now. Ideas and mechanics have been suggested, adopted, discarded, tweaked, and boiled down into a beautiful game that we\u2019re all really proud of and eager to share with you. The following play-testers made this possible:  \nGreg Amaral, John Brieger, David Bruglia, Davey Chacon, Angel Elkins, Cassie Elle, Jareth Elkins, Sarah Graybill, Noreen Gwilliam, Owen Gwilliam, Ashley Hershey, Vincent Hirtzel, Jon Knight, Jacob Knoester, Ashley Leaphart, David Leaphart, Marty Lewis, Walter Jay Little V, Johnson Luong, Jason Newman, Connor O\u2019Hare, Cody Parcell, Jenni Parcell, David Reeser, Robert Salls, John Shulters, Roland Strebe, Jason Taylor, and John Vang.\n  I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with Derek Bacon in the past--he illustrated many of the cards in Baldrick\u2019s Tomb (as well as its two expansions), and he illustrated everything in Tower. Knowing the art direction we wanted to take with Oaxaca, Derek Bacon was the obvious person for the job.  \nAnd speaking of art direction, if you\u2019re already familiar with Oaxaca\u2019s many handicrafts (or better yet, if you weren\u2019t familiar with them but this Kickstarter page prompted you to look them up), then you may be a little surprised at the artwork in this game.  \nThere are many table top games out there named after places and events that are really good about producing authentic artwork that perfectly portrays the tone and setting--games like Thebes, for example. One aspect of Oaxaca\u2019s development that was particularly challenging for us was that, to an extent, we actively avoided a certain degree of authenticity.\nSounds a little odd, right? Well, the interesting thing about Oaxaca is that we\u2019re portraying handicraft traditions that are alive and well today. So, out of respect, we opted for a more stylized approach to avoid inadvertently miming actual artwork made by real Oaxacan artisans. In fact, if you look through some of the illustrations (especially the pottery and textiles), you\u2019ll see that Derek specifically avoided using well-known designs and patterns.  \nThe result is a wonderful collection of artwork that is vibrant and colorful--a collection we believe captures the beauty and diversity of Oaxaca\u2019s many handicrafts--but also one that aims to be respectful to the beautiful source material. \n  A lot of people wonder why they should back a Kickstarter campaign instead of just waiting to get it later in retail. The biggest reason not to do wait with Oaxaca is that it is planned to be Kickstarter limited. We currently have no plans to release this in retail settings because we don\u2019t have the right connections to get it into distribution. Thus, if you wait, you may end up missing out as we won\u2019t have that many extra copies to sell through UndineStudios.com and unless your local store backs the campaign, they won\u2019t be carrying it either.\nKickstarter Limited \u2013 the game will be hard to find after the campaign.\nSubsidized Shipping \u2013 we\u2019re making it free shipping to the US, $20 to Brazil and $15 to everyone else. We\u2019re going to pay for the rest of the shipping costs, whatever they may be.\nDiscounted \u2013 after the campaign, we will be selling some copies, but for $35 instead of the $30 you\u2019d pay now. Also, actual shipping will be charged then.\nHelp Us Improve Oaxaca \u2013 we have a lot of stretch goals planned to help improve the quality and add more content to the game for everyone!\nEU Friendly \u2013 copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT.\nAnd most importantly, without backers, this game would not get made. We really appreciate every person\u2019s support in making our dream a reality.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my fourth Kickstarter campaign (the third for a tabletop game--I ran one earlier this year for an audio book). I learn a lot each time. My first campaign, Tower, ran into some issues during fulfillment (it was a few months late), but went smoothly overall. My second campaign, Project Dreamscape, ran very smoothly and delivered on time (though I did go over budget and had to spend out of pocket). \n\nThe majority of the challenges with Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture were faced during development--we tried to be very careful about presentation and routinely sought outside opinion on the art and theme. \n\nFor this campaign, my priorities are a timely delivery, coming in under budget, and real Euro-friendly shipping (In the past, my games have simply been small/inexpensive enough that there were no issues for backers in Europe). I'm in talks right now with several European fulfillment companies to have a portion of the games shipped directly to them. Beyond that, should we be fortunate enough to reach our funding goal, most of the art is ready to go and files can be submitted to the manufacturer shortly after completion of the campaign.\n\nIf things run behind schedule, I've found the best approach is to always be up front and communicative with backers.

We love playing cards, but we couldn\u2019t really find anything that was quite suited for our minimalist way of traveling. When you travel as much as we do, you don\u2019t want to carry anything extra around. Every item makes a difference. We\u2019re big fans of improvement, and decided to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers. The making of the Air Deck has taken us through several countries, and we\u2019ve met many wonderful people along the way. Now we have the prototype ready and we\u2019re proud of the result. Meet our new travel companion, the Air Deck. The world's first truly travel optimized playing cards!\nThe Air Deck team\nKey Features:\n52 Playing Cards + 2 jokers\nWaterproof and washable\nPremium printing with a protective matte varnish\nMade from extra durable premium PVC\nSlightly textured back, smooth front \nSturdy deluxe matte tuck box \nPlaying card size : 3.43 x 1.26 inches (87 x 32mm)\nPerks:\nFree world-wide shipping\nFree PDF \u201cCard games from around the world\u201d\nOption to buy the Air Deck in white color\nHere's a mock-up of how the Air Deck will look in red color.\n  With the Air Deck with you can play everywhere anytime. It fits easily on small surfaces, such as a plane tray table.\n  Regular paper playing cards tear, stain, bend and break easily, but we've designed the Air Deck to be extremely durable.\nQuality\nWhile we wanted a compact and light deck, we didn't want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world\u2019s manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high end plastic materials. The materials were taken through  scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally we ended up with a premium \u2018casino quality\u2019 PVC that has all the properties we want.\nThe cards have a premium feel to them.\n  The Air Deck is designed to be brought anywhere. It takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket.\nThe Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and it\u2019s totally waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of.\nThe cards are 100% waterproof, so you can even use them in the pool or the bathtub.\n  The cards are washable. Liquids and dust rinse off easily.\n  The Air Deck is a surefire convesation starter.\nHandling\nIn the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals, to help us find the optimal material and design. The end result a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do. The cards are slightly textured on the back, while the front is plain. This provides excellent handling and a good grip.\nThe Air Deck shuffles easily\n  Our goal was to make the Air Deck both visually interesting and simple to read.\nDesign\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to create a fitting minimalist design for the Air Deck. For us, it was key that the cards are uncluttered, symmetrical and easy to read. We also wanted to create something fun and \u2018out-of-the- ordinary\u2019. The Air Deck\u2019s unique design will no doubt act as a conversation starter on your travels. The deck consists of 52 playing cards + 2 jokers and measures 87mm X 32mm. Despite the smaller footprint we\u2019ve retained all the features of standard decks. The length ensures that it handles much like a full size deck, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands.\nJack, queen, king and ace of hearts.\n  The Air Deck comes with a solid tuck box. It's laminated for extra protection and features spot UV printing.\n For this campaign we\u2019re offering the cards in two different colors; black and white.\nThe Air Deck in black color\n  The Air Deck in white color.\n  The Air Deck in red color\nWe hope that you are as excited about the Air Deck as we are. Support our project, and give yourself, or someone you care about, the perfect playing cards for traveling.\nAdd a nice view to your game.\n  The Air Deck is incredibly strong and flexible.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe do not anticipate any major challenges to this project, and we promise to stay transparent and update you every step of the way. \n\nMuch of the work is already done. The design phase of the cards is finalized and we\u2019ve made the prototype you see in the video. We\u2019ve had personal meetings with the manufacturer and agreed on all details, and we've gotten several quotes for fulfillment and shipping from reliable partners.

Essentially, Rage of the Trolls has everything from the original Gruff and more.\" -Matt Mitchell, PopWrapped\n\"These mechanics do make for an interesting cooperative experience. Our playtesting team felt challenged and encouraged to really study their shepherds, gruffs, and cards to make sure they were playing with optimal strategies. Its a great feeling to be forced to make adjustments between games like this because the thrill of victory is a great payoff for experimentation.\" -Stephen Duetzmann, Engaged Family Gaming\n\"It\u2019s absolutely one of my favorite card battle games of all time.\" -Rob Kalajian, A Pawn's Perspective\n\"I enjoy a good solo game, and Gruff: Rage of the Trolls did not disappoint. The only difference between solo and cooperative gameplay is the player count. Even though it was just me against the troll, I still felt as if I was playing against a worthy, real-life opponent, having to outthink and outplay it just as I would a friend playing against me.\" -Benjamin Kocher, Everything Board Games\n\"All-in-all I give this game another seal of approval. This game does it wonderfully! If you like cooperative games as well as competitive card games, this game is going to be a nice addition!\" -Michael J Wright, Unfiltered Gamer\nIn Praise of Gruff...\n\"In every sense, Gruff has been a labor of love for the folks working on it, and you can see it in every monstrous detail of the fun but terrifying art style. Gruff\u2018s simple concepts allow for both new gamers to have a competitive card game experience, while still giving seasoned players the depth of a full collectible card game.\"  \n- ROBERT HORNBEK, Geek & Sundry\n\"What I like most about Gruff is how it speed-injects the feeling of other constructed deck games in its own tight format. I was a big Magic player for a long time, and what I loved most about it was playing big creatures and cool spells. Gruff distills the constructed experience, with the creatures providing the mana and lots of synergies between cards, so that you get a lot of that satisfying feel at a fraction of the time investment.\"  \n-Andrew Fisher, Gameosity\n\"A card game stemming from the likes of Magic, but similarities end with the cards.

We are in the final hours and hoping to unlock a few more stretch goals before we close! \nSo far, we've unlocked a system logo button for the core game at $45k, a \"Mutton Ben\" button in the funvelope at $55k, a Fight City Mapple map at $60k, and additional cards for the funvelope at $65k.\nNext up are Button Murderers from Kill Doctor Lucky at $70k, a Skully patch (the \"o\" in Button Men) at $75k, and Button Men Pairs at $80k! We'll also unlock a Button Men coin at $85k and bring Fight City back at $95k. You can read more about these in Update #10.\nButton Men is a quick, clever dice game designed by James Ernest. It's easy to learn, loaded with strategy, and one of the best games we've ever made.\nEach player selects a character card, and uses the dice described on the card. Players start by rolling all of their dice, and then take turns capturing each other's dice.\nYou score points based on the size of the dice you capture (and keep), and the player with the most points wins.\nWith endless variations of character recipes, unusual die types, and some simple new 'campaign' rules, Button Men is a game you can enjoy again and again.\nHere's a how-to-play video that explains the basics:\nWe first released Button Men in 1999. It won two Origins Awards, for Best Abstract Board Game, and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game. (And it doesn't even have a board!) A few years later, the web version, Button Men Online, also won for Best Play by Mail Game.\nButton Men has had dozens of expansions, from Cheapass Games and many other publishers. To date, the game has had more than 300 different official characters.\nAnd now we want to bring it back!\nButton Men started on pin-back buttons. The biggest difference with this new edition is that we are printing the characters on trading cards.\nWe will still make character buttons available, but the trading card format makes the game much less expensive. We can make a starter set with 48 characters and 30 dice for about the same price as a set of 12 buttons (and no dice). If that starter set does well in stores, we can make expansion packs that are just decks of cards.\nThe new starter set of Button Men is set in Fight City, a 1950's gangster town somewhere on the US Gulf Coast (think New Orleans, but not real). A \"Button Man\" is a low-level gangster, so the title still fits, even without the buttons. We've stretched the definition a bit, to include a wide range of criminals, male and female, at many levels of the power structure.\nThe Fight City set is divided into four factions, each with a different style of play. Those from Downtown (\"The Core\") use normal dice only. Characters from The West Side have Shadow dice, which make attacks upside-down. Those from the Delta region use Poison dice, which are worth negative points. And characters from Uptown have Rush Dice, which can capture two dice in a single attack! \nYou can read more about the different factions and their special rules in Updates #2, #4, #6, and #8.\nThe basic Button Men rules haven't changed at all, so every existing Button Men character is compatible with the new set. The set's new rules include Rush Dice, rules for drafting characters and dice from a limited pool, as well as several  \"campaign\" variations that let you play multiple characters on each side.\nThe Button Men starter set will be $35 in retail stores, and you can get it here for the same price, along with our famous \"funvelope,\" which is a bundle of cool stuff that you can only get from us. You can also get your favorite factions on buttons, if you want to pledge a little more. You can even become a Button Man yourself with the Drawn In levels.\nHere's the Breakdown:\nThe Funvelope: In every campaign, we add a few cool freebies as our way of saying thanks. The Button Men funvelope will include the following:\nEight additional character cards\nA souvenir poker chip\nA \"Skully\" logo button (the skull inside the \"O\")\nMore cool stuff  - check out the stretch goals!\nWe have a $15 pledge level that includes only the funvelope, for backers who are on a budget, and for anyone who would rather wait and buy the core game from their favorite game store.\nButton Men: Starter Set. The Button Men core game will include 48 characters on trading cards, 30 polyhedral dice, and the game rules. \nThe pool of 30 dice includes 20 light dice and 10 dark dice (most likely ivory and black), in sizes d4, d6, d8, d12, and d20. This is the minimum functional dice set, which allows you to play any combination of two characters against each other, although sometimes you may have limited choices for your Swing Dice. You can always add your own dice for more flexibility, but we chose this assortment to maximize gameplay and minimize cost.\nThe $35 \"Button Men\" pledge level includes the core game as well as the funvelope.\nThe Cards Alone: A few of our backers asked if they could get just the character cards, because they already have enough dice. We have added two inexpensive levels that include just the pack of 48 cards, and not the full starter set. One level is the card pack alone for $15, and the other also includes the funvelope, for $25.\nThis pack of cards won't have a box. It's just 48 cards in shrink wrap, not packaged for retail. If you would prefer to wait, you'll also be able to get this assortment of cards from our friends at Drive Thru Cards after the campaign has shipped.\nA Note on Production: We will print the game components in the USA, and use genuine Koplow dice (which are made in China). This is not the cheapest way to make this game, but the components will be of the highest quality, and we prefer it that way. You can read more about this decision in Update #7.\nAdding Factions: Do you love buttons? So do we! We're going to make individual pin-back buttons of the Fight City characters available after the campaign, but if you'd like to add a block of buttons to your pledge, we have four pledge levels that include one or more factions of 12 characters. The factions are:\nThe Core (art in Update #2)\nWest Side (art in Update #4)\nThe Delta (art in Update #6)\nUptown (art in Update #8)\nCustom Artwork: Our talented artists Cheyenne Wright and Nate Taylor have agreed to draw ten backers apiece! Backers at the original \"Drawn In\" level will receive everything from the \"Add Four Factions\" level, as well as a character portrait based on themselves (or someone they choose), both as an art print and a digital copy. You will also receive ten pin-back buttons featuring your character and unique Button Men recipe!\nBonus Levels: Two more Button Men artists have signed on to add to the Drawn In levels! Ryan Kinnaird and John Kovalic now each have their own Drawn In level.  You can read more about these artists in Update #5.\nNote: The Drawn In characters will not appear in the core set (the timing isn't right), but we just might be able to include them in a future set. Only if we have permission from the individuals, of course!\nAlso Note: Nate and Cheyenne will each draw ten backers for the original Drawn In level. If you have a preference for one or the other, we can't promise that you will get him, but we will give preference to those with earlier backer numbers.\nWe've crushed our initial funding goal, and now we want to make the game even better! Here are some stretch goals to help us take Button Men to the next level.\nFirst, an Announcement: After reviewing samples from China, we've decided to print Button Men in the US. This is what we usually do, but with all the dice in this game, we thought we would at least give China a shot. You can read more about what went into this decision in Update #7.\nAchieved! System Logo Button. We'll add a button to the core game so that people can show that they play! We talked about making this a simple \"Button Men\" button but there are some thoughts that this should be a playable character. Either way, it's a pin-back button in the game box, unlocked at $45k.\nAchieved! $50k: \"Mutton Ben.\" A few of you had a lively discussion about adding a new character, \"Mutton Ben.\" We'll make him into a trading card for the funvelope, unlocked at $50k.\nAchieved! $55k: Better \"Mutton Ben.\" We have Ben, now let's make him into a button for the funvelope. An upgraded Mutton Ben, unlocked at $55k.\nAchieved! $60k: Fight City Mapple Board. We have a clever little territory control game called Mapple. We'll make a Fight City board for it, unlocked at $60k.\nAchieved! $65k: Four More Cards in the Funvelope: Let's add four more bonus character cards to the funvelope. This stretch goal is more than it seems: at this point we also get to print these cards alongside the core game, so they will match the others in size and paper stock. That's actually a pretty big deal! Unlocked at $65k.\n\nNOT UNLOCKED (YET):\n$70k: Button Murderers: We'll release a set of 12 new Button Men on Drive Thru Cards, based on our favorite murderers from Kill Doctor Lucky and Doctor Lucky himself.\n$75k: Skully Patch: We'll add a  a 2\" embroidered patch of our wee mascot Skully (the \"o\" in Button Men) to the funvelope.\n$80k: Button Men Pairs: We'll create a new Pairs deck at Drive Thru Cards featuring characters from the new edition of Button Men, as well as a new game variant to go with it. This might even turn into multiple decks!\n$85k: Button Men Coin: We will add yet another goodie to the Funvelope: a 39mm metal coin. This coin will be similar to the coins we have made for other projects, with a Cheapass Games logo on one side, and a round version of the new Button Men logo on the other.\n$95k: Fight City Returns! We'll post the two original Fight City decks (with updated full-color borders) on Drive Thru Cards. And we'll post the rules for free at cheapass.com, of course.\nNote that we have expanded our original \"Drawn In\" levels, and we have also added new ones featuring Ryan Kinnaird and John Kovalic. Send us your photo, and you can become a custom Button Men character, drawn by one of these illustrious illustrators!\nOur main goal in this campaign is to get a new Button Men starter set produced for retail stores. If that succeeds, we can start making new sets of characters as 12-card booster packs, for a fraction of the cost of the old pin-back buttons. \nWe're already talking with some big-name game publishers, to license their characters and art for some interesting crossover sets. We'd love to do more characters in Fight City as well, perhaps in different time periods. And we have already announced a partnership with Dyskami Publishing to release the Sailor Moon Crystal Dice Challenge this fall!\nButton Men has been around for a long time, so there is plenty of material out there. Here are some new and not-so-new resources, if you want to learn more about the game:\nHow to Play Video: Created for this campaign, this video shows the basics of Button Men using two characters from The Core.\nCheapass Games: See the new trading cards based on the earliest and best Button Men sets, at our own double-secret website.\nButton Weavers: The original \"Button Men Online\" site is alive again at buttonweavers.com. Sign up to play, and help test the open alpha of this new site!\nBeat People Up: Our original Button Men information page is still online, with a fresh coat of paint. This is a great resource for more in-depth strategic analysis, and lists of the characters from the early days.\nDrive Thru Cards: Our friends at Drive Thru Cards have a unique resource that lets you create custom Button Men. Check them out and print your own playable characters.\nBoard Game Geek: The Internet's premiere resource for hardcore tabletop gamers actually has a few nice things to say about Button Men, where the game still ranks as #109 on the \"customizable\" list (and #2772 overall).

CCXL is a game which contains 240 ways to play the SAME city building game with cards and money.\nCardCity XL is a game for 1-4 players that lasts 10-60 minutes.\nYou are the mayor of a city, and you start the game with only a single building card before you: City Hall, THE Municipal building. \nDuring the game, each player will obtain new cards that will permit them to develop different aspects of their city (Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Leisure, etc.). \nThe game is language independent: \nNo text on the cards, only Icons. Rules in English and French will be in the box. Other languages available in pdf (see Game Rules section)\nIf you plan your city well, and build with efficacy, satisfying the demands of your citizens, your city will attract new citizens, you will earn more money, and your city will grow! 3 niveaux de complexit\u00e9 permettent de moduler le degr\u00e9 de simulation du d\u00e9veloppement d'une ville. \n3 levels of complexity allow you to balance simulation versus ease of play. \n5 different victory conditions enable you to drastically alter the strategy, without having to learn a whole new game. \nBy using any combination of the 4 variants, you can upend your most ingrained construction and play habits\u2026.\nYou want to try the very first version on TABLETOPIA, just click on the image below...\nOnly the simplified rules with the Residence victory and no variants are actually available.\n                   Each round comprises 5 very quick phases:\nPhase 1: Through an \u201cI split / you choose\u201d mechanism, you acquire 2 or 3 cards (depending on which difficulty level you have chosen). \nPhase 2: Simultaneously, all players add their new cards to their cities, respecting the very realistic (and intuitive) rules of construction. \nPhase 3: If you have built well, you can add cards from the reserve to your city, which is always a good thing! =:) \nPhase 4: Your salary and your commercial districts provide you with money that you can use to buy other cards, or maybe sweeten a few deals during the card acquisition phase.\nPhase 5: You can invest a little money in new industry or parks to accelerate the growth of your city. \nAfter 8\u201310 rounds, the game ends, and the player who performed best at the chosen victory condition wins!  \n  Card City XL offers several difficulty levels, instead of just one. In fact, the Simplified level of CCXL corresponds exactly to Card City. Additionally, the illustrations are different, and the coins are illustrated, rather than plastic \u201ctiddlywinks\u201d. \nWhen you use the Normal rules for Card City XL, your city size increases from 5\u00d75 to 6\u00d76 \u2014 44% larger! Instead of just 2 cards per round, you get (and build) 3 cards per round (50% more!), and there are new options and problems to consider (Pollution and Park cards). \nUsing the Advanced rules for Card City XL, you can earn revenue from Parking cards, and you can even sweeten your \u201cI split / you choose\u201d lots with cash! \nBut the biggest advance from Card City to Card City XL: Bicolor cards. \nThese cards are different types, \u201csplit\u201d along the orthogonal or diagonal:  \nBuilding these offers hitherto unseen choices, because in a single position in your city, the orientation of the card matters! Will you rotate the card 90\u00b0? Which color do you want where?\nAcquiring cards each round is simple enough: You form 2 lots of cards that you offer to your opponents, but you get the leftovers! Dilemma! You could also add a little from your pocket to make one lot more attractive than it might otherwise be\u2026.\nThe rules of construction are very realistic. Who would want to live next to an industry?\nParking facilitates profitability of Commercial districts. Residents like to live near Leisure amenities, and the Commercial districts grow larger from having more population nearby, and so forth\u2026.\nExample with not illustrated cards: one residence is going to evolve...\n  The city will grow before your very eyes, if you play well. Again, simple and realistic rules simulate urban development. The more leisure options there are near the inhabitants, the more people will populate your city. The more residential districts there are near your commercial districts, the more they will develop.\nCommerce development and Residence development\nInteraction is sometimes indirect as you make lots more or less interesting for your opponents, based on what you think they need, but it is also can be direct if you choose to play with the Unity City variant, in which your construction affects adjacent construction by your opponents. If you want to inhibit the growth of large residential zones in your opponents\u2019 boroughs, build a bunch of polluting industries!\n Example with not illustrated cards:\na 2p game with the Unity City Variant\nThe tactical aspect of the game develops through how you choose the cards to form the lots.\nThe strategic aspect is present in how the construction and long-term planning of the form your city ultimately will take\u2026 Should I build profitable commerces right out of the gate, not earning many VP? Should I launch right into a residence-heavy strategy? \u2026but then how do I afford to acquire those leisure buildings I\u2019ll need?\nThe game is intensely varied with the choice of 5 different victory conditions. These alone guarantee hundreds of completely different games.\n       Here you can UPLOAD THE ENGLISH RULES.\nICI vous pouvez TELECHARGER LA REGLE FRANCAISE !\nand THE SPANISH RULES.  \nThere are 50 Residence cards in Card City XL. These linen cards represent houses of different architectural styles. Perhaps one will have your name on it? By getting your name on a house in the game, you help me fund the illustrations for this game, and you can claim ONE card of the game! \nCapitalist reward:\nIf you back the CAPITALIST reward, we will add your name on the mailing box of one of the Residence Card.\nThis card will be YOURS for eternity. =:)\nMayor reward: \nIf you back this reward, the graphic designer will make YOUR home on one of the card of Card City XL. You must provide one photo before the end of the campaign.\nHere a sample of what can be done from a real photo...\nIf possible from your photo, the graphic designer will add your name on the mailing box as well...\n  $12,000: The game is FUNDED, YEAH!!!!\n$24,000: Alternate City Halls Art: Sarah will make a slight variation for the city hall on the back side===> New Possibilities UNLOCKED\nPlease note that all the flags will be different in the final version !\n$28,000: Alternate Pollution Art: Sarah will make a slight variation for the Pollution card on the back side===> New Possibilities UNLOCKED\n$36,000: LINEN cards: The Rolls Royce of the cards for a card city building game...

UNLOCKED\n$42,000: MAJOR SG: 96 Tiles with numbers to book the revenue from the Commerce Districts... UNLOCKED\n      As you know, my games are hard to find at your friendly neighborhood shops. I do not intend to put Card City XL into the distribution network (*), and I will produce the minimum quantity necessary to cover the orders here and for my site. As an independent creator, I cannot take the risk of stocking too many game boxes, and besides, I don\u2019t have the space to keep them at my house! =:) \nSo, to be sure you get to have a copy of Card City XL, you must get it through this campaign.\n(*) Edit: PixieGames distribuera le jeu en France ! (Q4_17 ou Q1_18)\n     Card City XL is my 6th game, after CARDCITY, TOWNCENTER, CLINIC, SMALLCITY, TRAMWAYS and several dozen expansions for all these games. I like to improve my games, and develop them to the max by being as creative as possible.\nHere the first buildings I drew when I start working on Card City XL:\n First attempt for the Suburb in the solitaire games...\n  For Card City XL, I chose a new illustrator and graphic designer, named Sarah Ponceblanc. We took our time choosing an aesthetic identity for the game, but I am super enthusiastic about the result! The cards and illustrations presented during the campaign may be modified slightly, according to guidance by the factory manufaturing the game. \nI invite you to visit Sarah Ponceblanc \u2019s website.\nI am very satisfied with the fulfillment achieved for the Tramways campaign, so we will do the same for Card City XL. If the game is made in Europe, all the copies bound for the US will be sent from the United States, the European copies will be sent from France, and the Canadian copies will be sent from Canada. This guarantees a EU/US/CA/AU-friendly project!\n  Because you are helping me finance my project, I will help you finance your shipping: I will pay part of the cost, so you only have to pay $6 for shipping a game of this size. It is the least I can do. \nThanks to Ludicreations for their help during the campaign.\nLike my Facebook page : https://www.facebook.com/AVStudioGames-800700710043132/ \nFollow my projects on Twitter : https://twitter.com/AlbanVIARD?lang=en \nBecome a fan on BoardGameGeek : https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/216864/card-city-xl\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAVStudioGames has already put a substantial amount of money into the initial illustration and graphic design. \nWe now need your help to traverse the final route: Producing the game.

In it, players take on the role of a starship captain stranded in hostile space. As captain, you'll be tasked with assigning crew member to various stations in order to deal with external threats like enemy spaceships, as well as internal threats like system malfunctions. \nOriginally starting as a print & play game, Deep Space D-6 released commercially in 2015 through a successful Kickstarter campaign. Beautifully minimalistic and tightly designed, the small print run was quickly consumed by avid gamers of all types and stock has been scarce ever since. \nIt's time to return to the deepest of deep space! Whether you are an accomplished D-6 Captain or have never tried a solitaire board game before, I'm glad to have you aboard! Now is your chance to get a hold of Deep Space D-6 with a revised rulebook. In addition, there is a new mini expansion that brings a new threat to the galaxy. This is a rescue mission and we'll need all the help we can get. \n          What's new in the reissue? \nThis is a straight reprint (not a 2nd edition). The first Kickstarter unlocked a wealth of enhancements and the box is at max capacity. As such, there will be no stretch goals and only minor changes from the first printing. The components are largely identical with the following revisions:\nRevised Rulebook - added some card clarifications\nHull and Shield cubes now have rounded corners\nOuroboros gameplay text has been modified\nRead more about the changes here.\nNew RPG game mode:\nClick the image to learn more.\n  The Long Way Home is an optional roleplaying supplement for DSD-6 that will be made available for free to all backers in the months following delivery of the game. A professionally printed version may happen in the future, but will not be part of this campaign. \nEach turn in Deep Space D-6 you'll roll crew dice and assign them to stations to perform unique ship actions. There are 4 unique ships, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. \nYou can learn more about the game by visiting the original Kickstarter campaign here. \nHere are some videos made from the first printing:\n   Special thanks to all video contributors!\nWant to know more?

This new mini-expansion plays on it's own but requires the base game. However, the upgrades can be used with the original threat deck. Fully compatible with all 4 ships.

There is no extra shipping charge.\nPlease note: There is an error in the Fleet Commander pledge. The estimated delivery is not November 2017. Estimated delivery for Fleet Commander pledge is December 2017, just like the rest of the pledges. \n  Tony is a visual designer and UX specialist currently residing in New York.

Both companies are big fans of each other\u2019s work and have been for many years. Interest and passion for this project grew organically as both companies started working together, culminating in what you see before you.\nRule & Make is a board game publisher with seven successful tabletop game Kickstarter campaigns. Titles include the 2015 Freeplay winner Rise to Power, the Dice Tower Seal of Excellence recipient, Burger Up and most recently, Entropy: Worlds Collide.\nDefiant Development is the video game studio behind the critically acclaimed Hand of Fate, which was successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2013. It combines tabletop storytelling with collectable card-game deck-building and real-time melee combat. The game has over 2.5 million downloads across PC, PS4 and Xbox One.\nCollectively, both teams have decades of experience in both the physical and digital space, and some of the most highly skilled people from both the board and video game industries.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our eighth Kickstarter project, and we've learnt a lot from the first seven. We have the knowledge and experience to see this project through, which we've demonstrated with our previous campaigns. There are always elements of risk to any project and we've identified the following areas that introduce the most risk and pose the biggest challenges for the project:\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nKickstarter campaigns live and die by how well creators communicate with their supporters. We keep all our backers informed through weekly updates covering design, pre-production, mass production, right up to fulfilment and final delivery. We promise to keep you informed.\n\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nDrawing from our years of experience in the board game industry and all our previous campaigns, we know how to produce a high-quality game. We have been working with our manufacturer on Hand of Fate: Ordeals for more than 4 months now. They will be collaborating on the campaign and will be with us all right through to ensure every stretch goal and component change we make is checked and confirmed.\n\n\nESTIMATED DELIVERY DATE \n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nOur estimated delivery date of November 2017 is based on the base game without any stretch goal or add-on unlocks. Should we unlock stretch goals, we will need to produce additional artwork, conduct additional playtesting, and make adjustments to other parts of the game accordingly. These could push our delivery date back depending on how much extra work is required. As part of our promise to you, we will keep everyone informed and let you know in advance of any potential delays.\n\n\nSHIPPING & FULFILMENT\n \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign has ended. This allows us to find the best and most accurate possible combination of shipping rates and services rather than over-inflating shipping prices now \"just in case\". In addition, any savings we are able to find will be passed on directly to you.\n\nFor total peace of mind, we will notify everyone of the final shipping rates well in advance and encourage anyone to take advantage of our \"no questions asked\" refund policy (see below) if you feel the eventual shipping cost is unreasonable.\n\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nTo help avoid over-reaching, we've pre-planned all the stretch goals. They have been carefully considered and budgeted. Once funded, we'll reveal what the stretch goals will be.\n\n\nACTIVE PROJECTS\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nWe\u2019ve run quite a few Kickstarter projects, with this being our eighth. We have Entropy: Worlds Collide and Smiths of Winterforge in active production and Skyward that is in manufacturing.\n\nEach active project has dedicated project leads, with Smiths of Winterforge managed and developed by Table Tyrant Games. Our active projects have funds pre-allocated and are being well taken care of. We don\u2019t anticipate them impacting our ability to delivery Hand of Fate: Ordeals.\n\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nHere at Rule & Make, we stand behind our products. So much so that we are proud to offer a \u201cno questions asked\u201d refund policy\u2014right up until we start fulfilment\u2014in order to give every backer complete peace of mind when pledging. Should you request a refund within 14 days after the campaign has ended, we will refund you the full amount, including fees. After that, it is minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (since we cannot get these back).\n\nAs this campaign is being run in Australian Dollars (AUD), all refunds will be provided in AUD only.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 79 or more", "title": "Fate Pledge ($59 USD)", "descp": "* Shipping is charged after the campaign ends (see shipping section for details).\nINCLUDES:\nHand of Fate: Ordeals\nKS Exclusive Kallas Idol Figure\nHand of Fate Video Game (Steam)\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["715 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 109 or more", "title": "Royalty Pledge ($83 USD)", "descp": "* Shipping is charged after the campaign ends (see shipping section for details).\nINCLUDES:\nHand of Fate: Ordeals\nAll Three King Expansions\nKS Exclusive Kallas Idol Figure\nHand of Fate Video Game (Steam)\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["2,115 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 159 or more", "title": "World's End Pledge ($120 USD)", "descp": "* Shipping is charged after the campaign ends (see shipping section for details).\nINCLUDES:\nHand of Fate: Ordeals\nAll Three King Expansions\nAll Three Add-ons\nKS Exclusive Kallas Idol Figure\nHand of Fate Video Game (Steam)\nAll Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["1,184 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #110", "update_userinfo": "Rule & Make Closure", "update_content": "I'm sad to announce that Rule & Make is no longer financially viable, and will be shutting down.

We call it Saloon Tycoon: The Ranch Expansion. Develop your Ranch and raise livestock on your new Ranch board. The Ranch Expansion adds animals, new characters, new cards, new tiles, and a lot more Wild West fun for your game of Saloon Tycoon!\nClick the image to see 'er bigger 'n better!\n     The following assumes you know how to play Saloon Tycoon. If you don't, it is easy to learn! Scroll on down a bit for an overview of the game.\nIn the Ranch expansion, each player will get a new Ranch Board that fits right along side the Saloon Board. Everyone starts with a Ranch Tile on their board and a large animal pen on the board that can hold 4 animals.\n Each turn during the Income Step, you will earn 1 Ranch Point. You can gain more Ranch Points by playing some of the new Tycoon Cards that will be shuffled into the Tycoon Deck OR by discarding any Tycoon Card for 1 Ranch Point. \nThen during the Action Step you'll be able to spend your Ranch Points to buy Animals, add to your dwelling, build a bunkhouse, build Animal pens, and MORE! \nNew Cow, Horse, and Water Trough meeples come with the Ranch Expansion! (designs subject to change)\nCows/Horses can be bought for 3/4 Ranch points respectively. You can hold on to 'em for points at the end of the game, or sell 'em when you need some gold! And grab a water trough or two at a cost of 5 Ranch points each for a discount on future animal purchases!\nIf you run out of room for animals, you can always buy an Animal Pen for 6 Ranch Points that will let you hold 2 more! \nThe Bunkhouse will cost you 8 Ranch Points, but it scores you a lot of points and lets you take the best available Ranch Hand!\nHaving a Ranch Hand around is great, but watch out for the new Outlaw - Hawkeye Harriett. Getting 2 animals first will bring her to town, and that's going to make your future animal buying and selling less lucrative.\nA new outlaw to make trouble at y'er ranch and some trusty hands to help out with all the work that needs doin'! Click on the image to see it bigger 'n better!\nEach player has access to 3 Ranch Tiles that grant different bonuses if you build them by spending 10 Ranch points. There's the Trophy Room (+10 Gold), the Workshop (+5 supply cubes), and the Planning Room (draw 2 Secret Claims and keep 1). \n  And we can't forget the new Tycoon, Open Claim, and Secret Claim Cards that bring everything together!\n  With simple rules but loads of new content, you'll be playing with and enjoying the new expansion in no time at all! If you are interested in the full rules, click here to read 'em now!\nAnd if you are new to Saloon Tycoon, you can pledge for the base game as well!\nBase Game Overview\nIn Saloon Tycoon players take turns taking one action on their turn. Most turns are fast and there isn't much down time between turns. First, you earn your income in gold based on the number of tiles in your Saloon. Then you will take an action. You may buy and build a tile by placing it on your board. Or maybe you will play a Tycoon Card to get some gold or give you more actions.  \nEach turn you have the opportunity to buy supply cubes to place on your tiles. Once you have fully supplied a tile it is considered to be complete and you get that tile's bonus! Even though you normally only get one action, through card play and tile bonuses, you could accomplish an awful lot in one turn.\nEach player will have some secret objectives, called Secret Claims, they are trying to accomplish. There are also common objectives available to everyone, called Open Claims. These objectives will require completing certain tiles and/or attracting certain characters to your Saloon.  \nThere are some influential Citizens in town as well as some unsavory Outlaws. Build and complete special tiles to attract the Citizens for additional points, but beware the Outlaws... they can make your life as a Saloon owner more difficult.  \nBuild tiles, attract Citizens, and complete Objectives to earn the most Reputation Points and win the game!\nThe Boomtown Expansions\nThese modular expansions were bonuses for KS backers of the base game. You can pledge for it if you don't have them.\nGold and Supply Cube Storage Boards\nThese optional boards were offered when Saloon Tycoon was originally funded. You can pledge for these if you don't have them.\n    Group pledge pricing is available for 4 or more copies. Please contact the creator via KS messaging to inquire about pledging for multiple copies.\nWhen we Kickstarted the base game, backers helped achieve the Boomtown expansions! We have more new modular expansions planned for backers of this campaign if we are fortunate enough to over fund. We will reveal more goals as the campaign progresses.\n *Kickstarter Exclusive in this campaign means the item will never be offered through Retail but we reserve the right to offer the item directly or through promotion outlets such as the BGG store.\n Rahdo Runs Through Saloon Tycoon\n Board to Death quick 4 minutes overview and review\nBoard Games with Niramas runs trough Saloon Tycoon (first video) and The Ranch Expansion (2nd video)\n    We are now able to ship rewards from the USA, Canada, EU, Australia, and Asia!

We are not offering HUBS for this campaign. While HUBS worked just fine and saved backers a lot of money, the amount of work involved to pull it off was quite daunting.

If you would like to reach us after the campaign has concluded, we are at twolanternsgames@gmail.com and twolanternsgames.com. Kaleen and I have taken distribution back into our own hands, so we'd be happy to respond to any inquiries regarding Morels, Morels Foray, or Agility, be it general questions or about bringing Two Lanterns games into your home or friendly local game store. Whether you are a Kickstarter backer or decide to pick up a copy after the official launch in November 2017, we wish you good health and happy foraging!\nThanks for checking out Morels Foray! If you're new to the game, we hope you dig it, and if you're already a fan of Morels, we hope you enjoy the new strategic and social dimensions of Foray (note: Foray does require the Morels base game).\n+ Morels Foray expands Morels with cards featuring new characters, items, events, and weather that vary how you interact with the forest and with your opponent(s). In the graphic below, you can check out how the cards work as well as Vince Dorse's ever enchanting art.  The creative process is ongoing with the aim to finish illustrations around May 10th (the 5th Anniversary of Morels). I always feel like a kid opening a brown paper package tied up with string when Vince sends over something new. It'll be exciting to share these art updates with you as we go.\n+ Morels Foray enables you to play Morels with 2-4 players. Below you'll find turn examples demonstrating how each system is unique. 2 player remains at the 30 minute mark for gameplay, as does 3 player, with 4 players at 30-45 minutes. We design quick games and firmly believe in begging for a rematch rather than praying for an ending.\n+ A limited number of handcrafted pieces are available! They include the original Morels sticks and pans as well as a carved mushroom and wooden tokens tailored to Foray, which are Kickstarter exclusive. There's a process graphic for each showing how I make them.\nThe summaries below should provide a good sense of how the new cards work.  If you'd like to peruse the full (beta) rulebook, it is available on Board Game Geek.\nThe new Foray cards can also be used with 3p and 4p.  We've had a fantastic time with these, both the different tactical approaches and the enhanced social component. Lots of laughter, not originally a design goal but a wonderful bonus.\nAgainst the better judgement of my primary care physician, I'm making more sticks and pans. I was touched with how the game community responded to these back in 2012 and couldn't resist making more for Morels players who have come on board along the way.  There's something compelling to me about craftsmanship in board gaming, both the creation of the pieces and the resulting tactile element of play. \nOf course we had to bring Foray into the handcrafted fun! Given the need for a Priority Marker in 4p and a 1st Player Marker in 3p, the notion of a \"mushroom miniature\" emerged. Enter the tagua nut! Sculpting it is like trying to mold Valyrian Steel that was tempered in Mt Doom then frozen in an icy chasm of the Frostfangs for 500 years, but boy do they turn out beautiful.  4p also uses \"Player Ready\" Markers, and getting some wood into the game was a must: laser engraved wooden nickels featuring the Fairy Ring, Shiitake, Porcini, and Destroying Angel.   Kaleen asked me \"Are you sure someone in any given group of 4 will want to be the Destroying Angel?\" Which in my mind is somewhat akin to asking if people will be into a 1920's alternate history theme featuring heavily armed mechs, farming, and pet tigers. Yes, yes they will :)\nWhich bring us to Stretch Goals!  \n4/18 2:00PM CT: The mushroom meeples (I'm nominating \"fungles\"...suggestions?) WILL be the Compass dials used in 4p, so there will be 4x of those in the box in varying colors, plus one for the Priority Marker. \n4/18 7:30PM CT: Blank designer cards! You can create new actions or mushrooms for your game and even share them with the community. \n4/19 ~The Witching Hour CT: Golden mushroom! The Priority Player Marker will now be golden with a metallic sheen, continuing the pervasive theme of mushrooms as treasure throughout Morels Foray (see Thief and eventually Eureka). When foraging, that is exactly what it feels like, the lure of the hunt and the thrill of discovery.  Sometimes when I find a flush I have to double or triple take...as if wait a minute, are these really here, no one's found these, they're mine, all mine? Sweet Sicilian saffron we're eating well tonight! \n4/19 4:45PM CT Digital Designer Blanks: I'll send the psd (or format of your choice, but psd will be layered for easier use) blanks of the day card back/front and night card back/front to any KS backer who would like to have a go designing their own expansion mushrooms, items, characters, etc digitally (Photoshop being the most common).  The physical cards will work great, but if you want to go all out with unlimited options and a professional look, this option enables it.  Heck, put yourself into the game!\n4/20 2:00PM CT Mushroom Paper Score Sheet: Kaleen and I based this idea on our friends Aubrey and Ryan, who created a \"Brag Board\" to track their 2p gaming.  Turns out one thought they won more, the other thought the same, so they met at High Noon on the Brag Board.  Kaleen will be making these, incorporating mushrooms into the paper somehow (pulp or spore print or mushroom ink; not sure quite yet...she'll start working on these over the summer), 1 sheet per backer.\n4/22 5:00PM CT Morchella descends upon us!!! Vince and I did some juggling. I'm going to take the Map card, which I'm pumped about, and he agreed to do the dragon. Map will be done on ink and parchment in style of LOTR maps, dragon will be a clear homage to Smaug, so it's a double-Tolkien day! These games would likely not exist without his influence, both for hobbit love of mushrooms and for the sense of quest and completion those books instilled to my vision on one side and work ethic on the other.\n4/26 2:00AM CT Travel/Bits Bag!  Kaleen will have her work cut out for her.  They will be simple but useful, likely muslin or cotton cloth, with a drawstring, stamped with a couple of morels.  It's intent is to hold the cards plus any tokens or bits for ease of storage (probably bits only) or travel (cards + bits). \n5/8 5:00PM CT Solo variant upgrade! BGG's GameRulesforOne created a sweet solo variant for the original Morels.  He's graciously picked up the gauntlet to Foray with the solo ruleset.  We've had fun collaborating on playtesting and rule modification over the last month. With the unlocked stretch goal, we will continue working to optimize Morels + Foray soloplay and I will be creating a downloadable rulebook in the same style as the print rulebook, complete with extensive graphic examples.  When complete, it will be available as a downloadable PDF on the Two Lanterns website as well as on the Morels Foray \"files\" page at Board Game Geek.\n5/9 2:00 AM CT A Solo Tournament (Global) will be held in Spring, 2018! This will be a one week tournament where any KS backer can participate and post scores on BGG (or email them to me and I'll post if you don't have a BGG account). Format is similar to some track meet events, with three attempts for a top score across three different game setups (thus, 9 maximum plays).  Rules will be released shortly before the tournament.  A minibadge will be made available to all participants and prizes (small but fun) will be awarded to the victors. \nIf you do decide to support Morels Foray, we wanted to make everything from our catalog available to customize the order to your taste. Agility is here, which I'm delighted to report was nominated for the 2016 Best 2-Player Golden Geek just like its big brother, as well as additional copies of Morels and Morels Foray for friends or family.  \nWe've made a habit of printing up amusing t-shirts to complement our games.  I love wearing these and seeing the reactions from mushroom, dog, or game lovers when their eyes light up.\nThere is a set of 6 pans in the event you have the original Morels Handcrafted Pieces (16 sticks and 2 pans) but would like additional pans to equip all of the 2-4 players in Morels Foray with two HC starting pans rather than using punchboard tokens.\nGiven the early sellout of the Morels Foray Handcrafted Pieces (mushroom mini and 4 wooden tokens), we've made the wooden tokens from that set available also.  Won't be able to make any more mushroom minis than those already promised to the pledges, but happy to offer this piece of that pie should it interest.\nIf picking up any add-ons, simply increase your pledge by that amount (shirts, pan extension, and wooden tokens ship free internationally with package; please add $5 shipping per international game to the add-on amount). On the Kickstarter survey at the end of the campaign, you'll be able to note which item(s) you would like and they will ship free with your package in the US or $5 per game internationally .\nNew to Morels? Check out one of the video reviews that posted following the game's debut at 2012 Origins, Gen-Con, or BGG.con!\nJoel Eddy's thoughts over at Drive-Thru Review:\nVintage Rahdo (only his 19th review) from the glass-table era! Makes for a trippy floating forest. Church bells in background are a nice Easter Egg (Rahdo, aka Richard Ham, lives in Malta, where apparently churches outnumber homes like sheep to people in New Zealand from the sound of this video).  This is a full game run-through:\nRetail options are available!  There are three different bundles to choose from (brick and mortar sales only, please):\n5x Morels + 5x Morels Foray\n10x Morels Foray\n10x Morels + 10x Morels Foray\nCarton size is 20, hence the 5x and 10x case quantities. If interested, please send me a message and I will quote prices. Shipping free in the US for all three options.  We love partnering with FLGSs!\nShipping is free to the US and subsidized to the rest of the world. We would love to have offered zone specific friendly shipping, but with the added complication of handcrafted pieces and differing sources for those vs the game, it just wasn't feasible.  Please note that we are not able to sell the Morels base game to Europe, South America, or China due to licensing agreements.\nQ1: If I'm pledging at a level that includes Morels Handcrafted pieces, do I need the $5 add-on for the extra 6 pans?  \nA1: You don't! All of these Morels HC sets come with 16 sticks and 8 pans, enough to support 2-4p Morels Foray. The add-on would just be for folks who acquired Morels HC bits back in 2012-13, which came with 2 pans. The 6 pans in the add-on would bring their total up to 8.\nQ2: Is Morels Foray compatible with \"Fungi\"?  \nA2: It isn't. We're working with Pegasus Spiele in hopes that the expansion may be ported over to the European cousin of Morels. We'll share any news as it develops.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs long as everyone stays healthy, ships float, and machinery whirrs, we don't anticipate standard challenges beyond those that we have already embraced with Morels and Agility. One unique challenge will be keeping my hands in tact and unkindled while sawing, sanding, and polishing the custom pieces! Many enjoyable hours of work, much of that time with my fingers about 6 mm from a band-saw or rotary-saw blade at several thousand RPM.

The rotary blade was spinning at a humbling 15,000 rpm and the contact was firm.

I can't say the summit is in view, but the air is thinning and the invigorating smell of sun baked pine abounds. This is only part metaphor. I mostly work in the shade of the driveway, enjoying the cool northern breezes that temper even a genuinely warm summer day. When it does top 80 or even 85 (gasp!) in mid-afternoon, those breezes cradle the scent of baking spruce needles from two beds about 10 ft distant, one in ours and one in our neighbor's yard. I'm generally \"reading\" (ie being read to, as profound a joy now as it must have been at 3) fantasy lit or watching an occasional documentary while making the foraging sticks or mushroom minis. The result is a mind-meld of the fantasy landscape in which I'm immersed and olfactory teleportation, compliments of the baking spruce needles, to the inimitable Sierra Nevada. I worked a glorious winter during my rambling twenties at a ski school in Tahoe and some of my happiest backpacking has been in and around Sequoia and Kings Canyon NPs, so in a word, this recipe of woodworking, literature, and subconscious travel through both space and time is sublime.

But don't forget about them three bonus cards in the center of the circle that can score ya even more points \u2014 that is, if ya play yer cards right. With darn near five thousand unique ways to score and millions of draftin' and placin' combos, you'll never build the same town twice!\n       Circle the Wagons is a two player game designed by Steven Aramini (Yardmaster), Danny Devine (Mob Town) and Paul Kluka with art by Beth Sobel (Viticulture, Lanterns: The Harvest Festival). Gameplay lasts about 20 minutes and is recommended for ages 10 and up.\nThe game consists of:\n-18 Cards\n-Fold Out Full Color Rules\n-Wallet Packaging\nThis is part of our Wallet Line and will be packaged in a small vinyl wallet, perfect for taking it on the go. It's pocket-sized, portable and protective... and has proven itself with our growing line of wallet games.\nCircle the Wagons was originally entered into the 2016 Button Shy Wallet Game Design Contest and took the top spot over 72 other games including Mint Julep and That Snow Moon from this campaign, Turbo Drift and Find Your Seats from our last campaign, and many many other great games. \n  Print and Play (original prototype, no art) | Prototype Rules \nYou can print the full game right here. It's only 4 pages long with front and back sides of the cards. The rules are just another few pages, and you can even make it work by just viewing them online.\nPlease note: The rules on all of the games are NOT final. They still need to go through editing and graphic design, but any notes that you have at this point are incredibly appreciated.\nSo we're going to start this off with my review. Yes I'm the publisher and there's an assumed bias there, but as someone who has released 24 of these wallet card games in the past, and has received dozens and dozens of submissions, I have to say that Circle The Wagons is the best microgame I have ever played. The designers used the small size in a way that no other game has done. But size aside, it's one of my favorite games. Why? It's the simple elegance of how the items, the background locations and scoring conditions interact. Each game only uses 3 out of 18 scoring conditions, so every single game is very different from the last. It hits all the right spots. \nNow onto the real reviewers. :)\nEric Buscemi, The Cardboard Hoard - \"It is the best game I have played in Button Shy's line, and this line features other games I think very highly of, such as Ahead in the Clouds and Pentaquark. Highest possible recommendation.\"\nAndrew Fisher, Gamosity - \"Simply put, Circle The Wagons belongs in your collection\u2026If you\u2019ve got someone to play with, a table to use, and 15 minutes to kill, Circle The Wagons is going to be a perfect fit.\" (LINK) \nEric Booth, What Did You Play This Week - \"Final verdict? I give this two rootin' tootin', beer bottle shootin', hollerin' and a hootin', thumbs up.\" (LINK)\nAndy Matthews, Meeple Mountain - \"Equal parts Patchwork, Isle of Skye, and Kingdom Builder, Circle the Wagons is the quintessential big game in a small package. Meaty, beautiful, streamlined, and pure fun to play.\" (LINK)\nSamantha Fisher, GeekDad/GeekMom - \"Circle the Wagons was a rip roarin' success with cowpokes long and short at my house. With rules simple enough to only take one walk through but strategy just complex enough to hold up through multiple playthroughs I definitely see a place for this in my Short but Sweet games list. It is perfect for getting warmed up for a game night, sneaking in a quick game while waiting for your food in a restaurant, or anytime you have 15 minutes to spare.\"\n        Also included in this campaign are TWO MORE BRAND NEW GAMES! Mint Julep by Dan Letzring (Dino Dude Ranch, Gadgeteers) and That Snow Moon by Dave Chalker (Get Bit!, Thief's Market). Both are available here for the first time (and at reduced prices too!)\nMint Julep - A 2-4 player horse racing/betting game.\n\nPrint and Play | Prototype Rules\nIn Mint Julep, players draft cards, place bets and then manipulate the race in order to ensure the horse that they want to win ends up finishing the race in a top spot. Be careful where you place your bet because the odds might be against you!\nEach game is played in 3 Rounds that each consist of three phases: 1.) drafting cards for your hand 2.) betting on which horse you think will win 3.) playing movement cards to adjust the order of the horses in the race.\nFinal scoring is based on where horses start in the race (horses starting in lower positions are worth more points), where horses end in the race (more points earned for higher place finishers), and when a bet was played (with later bets being worth less than earlier bets).\nScore the highest points with your bet and you win!\nThat Snow Moon - A 2-4 player asymmetrical card throwing game.\nPrint and Play (black and white | Prototype Rules\nThat Snow Moon is a space opera inspired by a popular movie involving space and battles, while not actually infringing upon intellectual property.\nIn the game, players divide into two teams: Liberation and Dynasty. Liberation throws their cards facedown onto the field, trying to assemble a particular set of cards. The Dynasty drops their cards onto the table, trying to land on the Liberation cards to reveal them and take out important cards from the Liberation.\nThe Liberation tries to bluff and disguise what they're doing, while the Dynasty tries to outguess and crush them, which each side uses its unique special abilities as best it can.\nNever forget that snow moon: it's a space station.\nWagon Wheels - A 2 player game about building an EVEN SMALLER boomtown.\nWagon Wheels is a nano-sized game by Nat Levan, based on Circle The Wagons. Nat has been making these Nanodaptions (trademark!) of our already small wallet games, where he will distill the essence of the gameplay down to just a few cards and tokens. Wagon Wheels is just 3 cards, which includes 4 different maps and one rules card.\n\nIn the game, two players will place and move their tokens around the map, trying to get the majority of their tokens in a quadrant to score that quadrant's special bonus as well as trying to get the east and west spaces on the map for additional points.\nSee below for each of the reward levels. Note: These prices are discounted for the campaign. \nADD-ONS\nAnd we have a few ADD-ONS this time, including the brand new games from our January campaign that are shipping now.

As with Cosmic Run, its predecessor, Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire takes place in the future, after planet earth has been abandoned and the remaining humans are divided into 2 opposing factions.\nThe game is a \"roll and write\" game in which players roll dice and write on their tracking sheets. Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire is a more aggressive game than Cosmic Run because players not only race each other, but are often directly attacking each other (though there is a \"friendly\" variant that softens the game a little).  Furthermore, a hostile alien race places space mines on the paths to planets, posing further problems for humans.\nDownload the draft rulebook.\nNote: The scoring sheets are double-sided, with one side posing a greater challenge for both players. \nHere's a video tutorial for a quick understanding of the game.  For an in-depth look, watch the review videos down below.\nThe illustrations were done by Lawrence van der Merwe, the artist for the original Cosmic Run. The graphic design and the promotional video were done by Sebas and Rocio, respectively, from OK Art Studio. If you want to know more about them, visit: www.okartstudio.com.\nThe game includes rules for solo play and it has multiple variants to enhance replayability. There's a \"friendly\" variant for those who want less conflict and a \"rapid fire\" variant for those who want an even quicker game. Furthermore, the tracking sheets are double-sided with more challenging planet tracks on the B-side.\nHere's a video play thorough of the solo mode by Dr. Finn.\nWhat about a 3 or 4 player variant? \nEventually, I hope to post a 3-4 player variant for this game, but the reason I did not include this variant  is because a 3 or 4 player game will really slow it down. I do not want to make a game for 1-4 players that shines for 1 or 2 players, but bogs down at 3 or 4. In short, I do not want to compromise the mechanics and quality of a game to force it to accommodate higher player counts. That said, I  hope to be able to come up with something decent, but it may turn a quick filler game into a longer game that might outstay its welcome to many players.  It will take some time for me to develop and I cannot promise a great result.  I can say, however, that the game for 1-2 players is pretty darn good.\nKickstarter backers receive a special TechTools promotional pack that includes 3 \"TechTools\" + 1 instruction card.

Dr. Finn is well known for designing easy to learn games that appeal to all levels of game players.  \nHelp bring this game to existence.  If this campaign does not fund the game will not be made.\nNo post-Kickstarter bargain prices. You will not find Dr. Finn's games on sale at those big online retailers a week (or even a year after) a Kickstarter campaign has ended because I do not sell them my games. I do have my own sales, but I usually wait until the game has been published for a while to do so.\nReceive a Kickstarter exclusive.  Get the TechTools promo pack that will not be available other than through Kickstarter campaigns.\nAccess to promotional items.  This campaign provides an opportunity to pick up other Dr. Finn's promotional items, such as the Institute for Magical Arts promo pack.\nGreat bundle prices. This campaign provides an opportunity to get multiple Dr. Finn's games at a great bundle price. Check out the various levels to see the great deals.\nSupport an independent game designer.  Dr. Finn's Games is not a big company and will only continue with continued successful crowdfunding campaigns.  \nIn this video, Rahdo plays a sample game using the friendly variant.\nAnd he offers his final thoughts about it in this video.\nAnthony and Frances, from Ant Lab, review the game. \nHere's a review from Edo's Game Reviews.\n Here's Board Game Closet's review of Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire.\n Bower's Game Corner reviews the game as well.\n           Many pledge levels include the corresponding promo packs (check details on right). If, however, you want to add a promo pack to your level, please add the funds(s) as specified in the promo pack level. If you have any questions, please message Dr. Finn directly. LIMIT: You may only add 1 promo pack of each type.\nImportant info about Herbaceous:  Herbaceous is not available as an add-on, so it is not part of any other level except the $30 level.  This level is the only way to get a copy of Herbaceous with this project (due to limited quantities that I have).\nYou may add games to any level at or above the $15 level by adding the appropriate amount to your pledge.  Dr. Finn's will find out why you added funds after the campaign is over by use of a survey.  For those outside the U.S., you must also add the shipping costs based on how many additional games are added to your level.  Games will be shipped together with Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire in September, unless otherwise noted.\nPromo packs may be added too.  For prices, see the $5 promo pack level on right and add appropriate amount to your level. If outside the U.S., please remember to add shipping costs, since these packs are shipped separately (from the U.S.) when going to non-U.S. destinations.\nShipping to the United States: All games going to U.S. backers will be shipped from within the U.S. either directly from Dr. Finn's via USPS or through Amazon fulfillment services. \nShipping to European Union: All games going to non-U.S. destinations will ship from the U.K., which means E.U. backers will not be subject to additional taxes or duties. You will receive a notice when games ship from Games Quest. No tracking information is provided. Promo packs will ship from the U.S. and so may be subject to duties.\nShipping to all other destinations (including Canada): Games will ship from the U.K. All items may be subject to duties and taxes imposed by your country's customs office. You will receive a notice when games ship from Games Quest. No tracking information is provided. Promo packs, however, will be shipped from the U.S. and may also be subject to duties.\nCosts: The listed shipping costs for those outside the U.S. are lower than the actual shipping costs because Dr. Finn's Games has reduced your shipping costs by incorporating some of those costs into the prices of the games.\nKickstarter backers have a wide variety of opinions about the purpose of crowdfunding. My own view is that Kickstarter's greatest strength is to help the \"little guy or gal\" bring something fun, creative, and good into existence, something that would otherwise be left aside. Dr. Finn's Games is a very small company that relies heavily on Kickstarter campaigns to stay in business. My goal is to make sure that backers are pleased with the campaign from start to finish. So, I maintain a good level of contact, with an appropriate amount of updates throughout the process, and I invite backers to contact me directly. I do my best to listen and respond.  I've had 10 successful campaigns, almost all of which were completed right on time. The only late project was late by a month. I also try to ensure that my backers are getting the best deal on the game (at least for the first 6 months from release). Since my games are not distributed, you will not find them for sale at on online retailer at 40% off a week after they hit the market (or even months after).  Of course, as a game gets older, I often have to sell the remaining copies I have at a discount, but that's usually far down the road. \nLet me mention my stretch goal philosophy.  I design my games to be whole without needing additional components.  I think it is disingenuous to withhold components that are already designed and part of the game, but only get added when a stretch goal is reached.  I am not going to do this, even though it is probably against my financial interests since it seems to be a popular thing to do.  My primary use of stretch goals is to improve the quality of the components, because I believe backers should be rewarded for helping the project reach higher funding goals.  \nMy promotional pack philosophy is also a part of this.  I want to reward Kickstarter backers with access to something special, so I do offer promotional packs that usually just add a little variant to the game, rather than a full expansion.  I frequently get requests outside of Kickstarter campaigns for access to the packs, but I do not sell them.\n  Boardgamegeek.com is the best place to do research on Dr. Finn's Games.

For this project, the greatest risks follow from the fact that the games will be manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. The most serious threat in this regard concerns quality control over the manufacturing. A more likely threat, though less serious, is the possible delays involved. Dr. Finn's can mitigate both of these concerns. First, I will be using a manufacturer who has produced good results on game projects in the past. Second, I have successfully completed almost all of my Kickstarter campaigns right on time or even early (only 1 project was a few weeks late). If any delays do unexpectedly occur, backers will be notified promptly.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS \nIf you receive any games that are missing items, please contact me at doctorfinns@gmail.com and replacements will be promptly shipped. If the game arrives damaged, you'll receive replacements for whatever is damaged. Please send along a picture, as I may be able to get reimbursed from the shipper. For the past few projects (after switching manufacturers and shipping companies), we've had a very low defect rate (less than 1%).\n\nREFUNDS \nRefunds are not usually given, unless there is a failure to deliver the games you've requested. However, if you are completely unsatisfied with any game, please contact me and we can discuss it.\n\nDELIVERY DATE \nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns, Dr. Finn's Games has a great track record of being on time. Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire is scheduled to be delivered by September 2017. Unless otherwise noted, all other items will ship with Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire at the same time.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS \nIf you provide an incorrect address or fail to update your address and a game is returned, it would be nice of you to pay for the re-shipment. However, I have paid for it in the past, though I think it really should be your responsibility.\n\nSHIPPING \nPlease read the shipping section above.\n\nUPDATES \nThrough this campaign you may receive updates on Dr. Finn's Games' other projects. However, such updates will be infrequent.\n\nBy backing this project, you acknowledge and accept the risks and challenges just stated.\n\nThanks! \nDr. Finn's Games\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Promotional Pack Level", "descp": "PROMOTIONAL PACK LEVEL: Support this project and receive 1 or more promo packs to other Dr. Finn's games.

When I send games to Amazon, I send a lot of games. In this case, over 600 games (including my other games).  When they receive them, they are not immediately available to me to send to you. Instead, they use some algorithms, I believe, to figure out how to distribute them to their different warehouses, so they get split up and moved around by Amazon.  In the meantime, they'll tell me how many of the games are available.  When a large number are ready, that is when I start placing orders with Amazon.

What makes pride different is each numbered card is a different color of the rainbow. Each card is also completely unique. There is a different US state on every card and each card has a die.\n              It is a card deck system. A system can be used to play many different games, like poker cards. I will be revealing and designing games that can be played with this particular deck. You can play a lot of your classic favorites like poker, go fish, rummy, memory, and many more. They will change because of the specifications of this deck but will still be fun.\nThis is not a kid's game. - But you can play kid's games with it.\n            Ninja Bowling Rules!\nSet up: Pick a color. Set up the bowling pin cards in a triangle like shown. Put your strike/spare cards off to the side. Hold your star cards in your hand.\nPlay: Each player throws a card at their pins to see who goes first. Whoever is touching the most cards gets to go first. If there is a tie, keep throwing to someone gets more.\nYou take turns throwing your cards. Your hand can not go past the front pin of the pins in front of you. The winner of the previous round goes first. If you get a spare (win a round), then win another round. That spare becomes a strike, just flip it over.\nScoring: Each round each player throws 3 star cards. Whoever touches the most combined cards wins a spare. If the player touches all the cards over the course of the 3 throws, they will get a strike card. First person to get 3 strike cards wins. All ties void each other out for each round.\nAlternative idea. If you want to add a new challenge use the numbers on the back of the cards (1-6) to score points. You get points for the cards you land on. You can play to a predetermined score. Or you can't win unless you have more points than your opponent.\nM80\n  Risks and challenges\nThe challenge is completing the project on time. The estimated delivery time is an estimate. The project Pride was late because I spent 300 unexpected hours making it perfect. i even had a printing error and demanded to reprint it, even though the mistake was minor. I care about quality. I will do what I can to make the best product I can.\nFor Gamer Deck, I will print immediately so there shouldn't be any time issues.

This is a perfect time to hop aboard. Just take a look at the Tramways section a little further down this page. \nFor everyone else already familiar with Tramways, read on, and I will tell you everything you need to know!\nTramways: Paris / New York City includes one large, 42cm \u00d7 60cm, 2-sided gameboard, folded into 4 sections, with a map of the Paris of the 1920s on one side, and a map of New York on the other side. It also includes a A4 rulesheet that explains the rules differences, and the peculiarities of each map.\nBoth maps have very special characteristics, and feature some traversable waterways. In Paris, you will have to make the best use of the river Seine, because not only can you build bridges across it, your passengers can ride along the Seine in tourist riverboats \u2014 Tramways is no longer only about the trams! In New York, you will need to cross the East River in order to access the most profitable and rentable areas of the city. This is going to require constructing some expensive bridges\u2026.\nBoth maps are illustrated by Todd Sanders, and these new maps will help highlight the depth of the game, while simulating construction in these two legendary cities, each with its own characteristics. I created these maps to recreate the time period and the geographical situation of these two metropolises in the early 1900s. I hope you will enjoy not only revisiting the game Tramways, but also riding the tramways through these two great cities at the turn of the prior century\u2026.\nParis is Paris! This expansion prioritizes leisure buildings, and highlights the role of the river Seine by allowing passengers to be moved via the famous tourist riverboats\u2026.\nTramways Paris Map\nMAP Special rules: (3p-5p)\n- You start the game all of the Leisure building cards and tiles, but only one each of the other types. \n- You draft your four starting parcels from the 25 available, rather than deal them randomly. \n- A new mode of transportation is available: tourist riverboats. They circulate on the Seine, and allow you to move passengers between buildings built on its banks. You must spend 1 magnetic strip per stop along the river, but each such stop also earns you $5 from the bank. \nSo, with a few tickets in hand, you can take a grand journey on the Seine for great profits!\nNEW VARIANT: It is possible to play the Paris map with 2 players. Just play with the East side or the West side of the city !\nNew Yoork, Neeeeew Yooooooork (Frank Sinatra is singing)\u2026. The city of New York is divided into different boroughs, some of which are separated by the East River. You will need to build bridges at the right places in order to reach the most profitable neighborhoods. Rail links with bridges are worth a lot of points at the end of the game, assuming you can finish them in time!\nSpecial rules: (2p-4p)\n- You draft your four starting parcels from the 25 available, rather than deal them randomly. \n- Your Build 2 Rail icon + Rail Worker icon Generic card is replaced with a Build 3 Rail icon + Rail Worker icon Generic card. \n- You can build bridges across the East River (but not the larger bodies of water); however, a Rail tile on water requires 3 Build Rail icons! \n- Each completed link with a bridge is worth an extra 3 happiness points at the end of the game! \nYou will have to manage your stock of Rail tiles (and use your Build Rail icons) very wisely!  \n  These 2 maps contain 25 parcels each, all in need of names. \nAs a Venture Capitalist, you can buy a parcel and see your name on the gameboard every time you play! You will need to provide your parcel name immediately after the end of the campaign, so as not to delay manufacturing. \nOr naming your name near the Eiffel Tower along the Seine ?\nOf course, the names are subject to my approval. You will neither get to choose the exact location of your parcel, nor the city in which your parcel will appear.\nTramways is a train game with a deckbuilding mechanism, some nasty bidding, and very clever management of the ticket cards in your hand. \nLAST NEWS: Tramways has been nominated for the Goblin Magnifico 17 in Italy !\n Want more info, click HERE\n    For a more detailed explanation and a review of the game, you can watch this video by Richard Ham final thoughts (a.k.a.

(12 modular boards printed both side for example...)\n  Download the rulebook here.\nYou should also read the May 2016 crowdfunding campaign for the base game, Tramways.\nThe game Tramways offers great possibilities for expansions for several reasons:  \n- The map system uses parcels with coordinates that allow you to adapt to any type of map, of any size. You can adjust the number of map boards based on the number of players, and the game setup automatically adjusts accordingly. \n- The system for moving the passengers allows for many variations: varied distances, mountainous obstacles, different numbers of each type of building. \n- The rules can be adapted for each city, and can take each city\u2019s peculiarities into account with just a few additional rules.\nI tried to minimize the shipping costs at their best level.\nThe US/Canada, Europe and Australia shipping costs are only $2 for the Builder reward, $4 for all other countries thanks to fulfillment agreements in these different areas.\nIf you want to include Tramways the base game, the shipping costs are $10 for the US/Canada, Europe and Australia, $15 for all other countries.\nThe shipping costs are offered at the Venture Capitalist reward ! But add $54 to your pledge if you also want the base game.\nThe shipments will be made from France in a letter format. Backers of this campaign cannot pick up their expansions and games at SPIEL 2017 in Essen: Managing and organizing this is far too complex, and causes errors.

Any part you wish!   \n    Play as the daring Knight, the chaotic Goblin horde, the greedy Dragon, the cunning Thief, or even the Cave itself \u2014 powerful, brooding, and intent on crushing the living things that dare to disturb its gloomy depths. Each role has its own powers, pieces, and paths to victory \u2026 and there can only be one winner.\n  The Knight must kill the Dragon. The Knight gains power by completing Sidequests and recovering lost Treasures. She can reset her abilities each turn.\nThe Goblins must kill the Knight. The Goblins builds three Tribes by playing a push-your-luck game. Then they move around the board trying to corner the Knight.\nThe Dragon must wake up and escape through the entrance. The Dragon starts out slow but wakes up as he steals Treasures, devours Goblins, and explores the Cave. He does this by playing cards to fuel various powers.\nThe Cave must fully expand and then collapse. The Cave does this by gaining Omens, placing Treasures to lure the other players into its depths, and placing tiles.\nThe Thief must steal treasures to buy his freedom. The Thief uses stealth and actions to take Treasures from the other players and the Cave. As he does this he must get them back to the entrance.\nWith a Cave constructed of tiles, and decks full of monsters, special abilities, and game-changing events, no two playthroughs will ever be the same. Vast is truly unlike any game you\u2019ve ever played. \n            The Ghost\nThe spirit of a long-lost adventurer, cursed to haunt the Cave for eternity.

She travels slowly through the Cave, but has telekinetic powers that allow her to manipulate other objects from a distance, and she can even temporarily possess other players to force them to do her bidding.\nMoving Entrance\nThis stretch goal adds a miniature for the entrance to the set of miniatures. You can place this miniature on top of the Entrance tile to show its location clearly. The miniature will also come with a new rules variant, in which the Entrance tile can be destroyed like any other tile, making it move to a new place. \nThe Ghoul\nCorrupted by the Cave\u2019s power and the last remnants of its humanity long gone, the Ghoul lives only to hunt. It relentlessly stalks and terrorizes the other roles, growing stronger with each battle.\nThe Ghoul is an additional player role that can be used with any combination of player number and roles.\nTreasure Chest Miniatures\nThis stretch goal adds 12 Treasure Chest miniatures to the set of miniatures.\nBonus Cards\nThis stretch goal adds 6 bonus cards to the game for all pledge levels.\nThese cards will not be exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign. They will include the Treasure Trove and Silver Gauntlet promo cards.

The game was nominated for the 2012 Golden Geek for best 2 Player card game, and lauded by fans and reviewers for its simple and dynamic mechanics, myriad of combos, and gorgeous art.  5 years later, Small Box Games is proud to present the next game in the Omen world; Omen: Edge of the Aegean.    \nOmen: Edge of the Aegean is a standalone, two player card game using the familiar mechanics, gameplay, theme, and setting as the original Omen.  New cards, new twists, and new ways to play Units; Omen: Edge of the Aegean offers a fresh take on familiar game play.  Aditya Ikranegara and Jason Benningfield are the illustrators behind the artwork of Omen.  \nWhile Omen: Edge of the Aegean was designed to be a standalone game, veteran Omen fans can add these new cards to their copies of Omen: A Reign of War.\nOmen: Edge of the Aegean contains the following:\nThis is a short, 12 day project. There are 3 different rewards available through this project:   \nReward 1: $5.00 - Print and Play files for Omen: Edge of the Aegean \nReward 2: $10.00* - Just the cards for Omen: Edge of the Aegean (provide your own coins and storage) + The rulebook + The Print and Play Files + a clear vinyl/gold Omen sticker.\nReward 3: $15.00* - 1 copy of Omen: Edge of the Aegean + The Print and Play Files + a clear vinyl/gold Omen sticker.\n*Domestic shipping is included in Rewards 2 and 3. Canadian and International backers will need to pledge extra for international shipping (the amount required is listed on each reward).  If you would like to back for multiple copies, please check the FAQ.\nThe contents for Omen: Edge of the Aegean will be of similar quality as the last printing of Omen: A Reign of War. Omega Edition.\n  As half-god children of Zeus, you and your opponent are bent on ruling all of Greece. With the blessings of the gods, you'll wage war over 3 Cities to prove who is the more powerful warlord and clever tactician.  \nOmen: Edge of the Aegean is played over a series of turns, and ends when all 3 Cities have been destroyed.  Each Citiy is comprised of 2 Reward cards.  Players spend coins to play Unit cards to these Cities, and once the Cities become War-Torn, they are resolved and the player with the most Strength gains 1 of the Reward cards (worth 2 points at the end of the game, or 1 point if the player uses the Reward's ability). \nThe 4 Unit Types in Omen: Edge of the Aegean\nYou can see a full card gallery of all cards included in Omen: Edge of the Aegean here.\nOmen's turn structure is broken into 4 Steps:  \nWEALTH - You receive 3 Wealth Actions.  Each Wealth Action is used to draw a card or gain a coin.  However, if you spend all of your actions on the same resource, you receive a bonus resource!\nSURGE - You spend your coins to play Unit cards to your side of the Cities.  Unit cards boost your Strength in the Cities, but also offer powerful abilities to boost your efforts or thwart your opponent's.\nWAR - Any War-Torn Cities are resolved, and the player with the most Strength in a City gains 1 Reward card. (A City is War-Torn if the opposing player has 3 or more Units in the City and/or there are 5 or more Units in the City).\nOFFERING - You can discard 1 card from your hand as an Offering to gain additional cards and/or coins.\nYou can view the full rules here.\nChad Swee's (imtylerdurden on BGG) How to play video:\n And here is Chad's review of Omen: Edge of the Aegean review:\nOnce the game ends, players score points for the Rewards they've earned, Keres they have Exalted, and Moirai they have in their hand.\nCheck out what Dan Thurot of Space-Biff! has to say about Omen: Edge of the Aegean here.\nHere are Travis Morton's (Knukcles29 of Daytrip Gaming BGG blog) thoughts on Omen: Edge of the Aegean.\nOmen: Edge of the Aegean is a card game of give and take, often times forcing players to give up one thing to earn another.  It is a game of calculated risk, combo driven card plays, and sometimes, a little push your luck.\nFull Playthrough Video:\nPLAY\n\n  Some games will be won by focusing on Exalting Keres while snagging the occasional War victory.  Others will be won by flooding the Cities and burning through Reward cards. And some games will come down to who has the most Moirai in their hand at the end of the game. \nAlready a Fan of Omen and want to know how to use these new cards with your existting copy of Omen?

Kickstarter gives me the tools to keep in contact with backers, so I can keep them abreast of all aspects of production, each step of the way.\n\nEverything is already prepped and ready for Omen: Edge of the Aegean.

Well, maybe a tincy bit. Currently 99% ends up in landfill. And the precious little that makes it to the recycling plants usually gets remade into napkins or newspapers - not cups.\nLike us, you probably already have a selection of reusable cups gathering dust in the kitchen cupboard. We\u2019re just not using them. Why is that? To our way of thinking they are usually too big, too small, too heavy, too unstable, too leaky and too easy to forget.

In the development phase we trialled a variety of materials including silicone but our beta testers questioned its feel, heaviness and slight odour.  We eventually decided on TPE (thermoplastic elastomer) for the soft component and PP (polypropylene) for the hard bands. Both materials are:\nHow much do you want to drink today?  Depends?  No problem. Adjust your pokito to suit. Pop it open to grande size 475ml (or 16oz), medio 350ml (or 12oz) or espresso 230ml (or 8oz). Simple!\nWe don't want you burning your fingers when you grab a coffee first thing.  Or have to wrestle with those pesky slip-on/slip-down sleeves or the dreaded \u2018double cupping\u2019.  So, we sensibly designed pokito with built-in insulation that's always in place to protect you from the hot stuff. And, the middle is firm to grip too - we don't want you \u2018squishing\u2019 your drink skywards either!\nWhat\u2019s in a lid you might ask? Well, quite a lot actually. pokito's raised lip delivers just the right amount of drink minus any drips. It's spill-proof and snaps down with a reassuring click so you know it\u2019s sealed shut. \nSeeing the sights.\nOn the tube.\nIn the gym.\nIn the car.\nAndrew Brooks - inventor of pokito - is passionate about serving up a practical reusable alternative to the terrible waste produced by disposable cups. He had his light bulb moment while fishing off the west coast of Canada in the summer of 2006. He saw a whole mountain stripped of its pine forest destined for the nearby paper mills. Later on he discovered that most of this paper wasn't even recycled and began to wonder if there was a better way. \nIt took a while and more than a little ingenuity before pokito was born. Andrew sketched out his ideas in late 2012 before taking them to a team of industrial designers who gradually evolved the technical drawings. Eureka came a few months later when a paper \u2018proof of concept\u2019 3D model was printed - which lasted 5 minutes before it crumbled to pieces! \nOver the next three years many aspects of the pokito were refined to make it - not only practical - but safe too. British production engineers tested countless prototypes, experimented with numerous types of materials and made many minor adjustments to get it right. Fine tuning the lid stopper, for example, took precision engineering to micron level (10ths of a millimetre). We had to pause a couple of times too to 'revisit' parts of the cup. The centre band needed more insulation and the lid wasn't quite up to scratch. We weren't looking for perfection but we did want pokito to be the best it could be even if that meant delaying it for a while! \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe development of the pokito has taken nearly four years and we\u2019ve been careful to ensure that most eventualities have been considered as we come to launch.

We have first rate manufacturing facilities in the UK that will produce the cup in carefully monitored conditions and in sufficient volumes.

Seventeen newly discovered planets are being colonized and tapped for crucial resources. Shifting alliances and stacks of galactic credits influence battles for control. Can you claim Universal Rule in this 4x wallet game from Button Shy?\n     In Universal Rule, players battle for control of the universe in this pocket sized 4X style game. You can colonize new planets, improve upon those planets, gain credits based off of the resources that the planet produces, or attempt to destroy other planets that threaten your existence. Other players can follow, but at a cost. The first player to show their true dominance through victory points will win the game.\nUniversal Rule is a 3-5 player game designed by Chip Beauvais with art by Sara Beauvais and layout by Jason Washburn (of Talon Strikes Studios). Gameplay lasts 30-45 minutes and is recommended for ages 12 and up.\nThe game consists of:\n-17 Planet Cards\n-1 Rule Card\n-Fold Out Full Color Rules\n-Wallet Packaging\nNOTE: Players will need to provide coins or tokens for tracking (25 cents in coins per player is suggested), or check out our bonus pack for trackers.\nThis is part of our Wallet Line and will be packaged in a small vinyl wallet, perfect for taking it on the go. It's pocket-sized, portable and protective... and has proven itself with our growing line of wallet games.\n  We normally offer a bonus pack with each game, but here we have TWO! Choose one, the other or both. One is straight up game utility, the other is a lot of new content. Check it out. \nBONUS PACK 1: TRACKERS - $3\nInstead of using coins to track your credits, you will receive 5 Tracker Cards (one for each player) each with 2 clips to track your credits and your attack contributions. The Tracker also includes the rule changes that are implemented when using Trackers instead of coins.\nBONUS PACK 2: ALIEN HOMEWORLDS - $3\nYou will receive 6 Alien Homeworld cards. These are placed in the center of the table and represent the aliens that are currently in place on specific planets. If a player tried to inhabit one of those locations, they must either align with the alien and take a special power for the rest of the game -OR- vanquish the alien to gain additional stars.\n(more aliens will be revealed as we go!) \n How to play video coming ASAP!\nYou can print the full game right here. It's only 2 pages long with just black ink. The rules are just another few pages, and you can even make it work by just viewing them online. NOTE: The PnP and rules are early versions.

The first player to complete the puzzle by positioning their heroes accordingly collect the quest card and its benefits. \n  Each round is broken down into two phases, the day phase and the night phase.\n  In the night phase, players will roll adventure dice in a communal press-your-luck fashion to try to accomplish the tasks at the locations they ended at during the day phase. This could be fighting a goblin, learning a spell, or delving into a temple. But be careful, if you take too much damage you may exhaust and lose all that round's progress and more! \nPlayers keep track of their heroes' collective health, power and progress on personal adventure logs.\nAnd when you acquire powerful items, you equip them right to your ITEMeeples\u2122! \nPlayers keep track of their spell progress, and the rounds magic level on a community magic mat. As the round's magic increases, goblins become more threatening and even your own power turns from good to bad!\nAfter five rounds, the game is over.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with our long time partners Panda Game Manufacturing. Who we've worked with on over 10 separate projects and have a great relationship with. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked again for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 4 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

It takes only 20 minutes to play, but when you finish, you'll want to play it again. That's because Wordsy is unlike most other word games.\nIn Wordsy, you get 8 letters dealt out on the table. All players simultaneously try to come up with the best word on the board.\nHere's the thing: you don't need all the letters in your word to be on the board. You can add as many letters as you want! So you're never just one letter away, like in most word games. \nThis means Wordsy rewards longer words. Those 2- and 3-letter words you have to memorize for other word games won't help you here!\nHere's a sample board. What word do you see? Remember that you can use any word you want, other than words with capital letters, hyphens, or apostrophes. You can skip both vowels and consonants; you're just trying to use as many letters on the board as you can.\nTo figure out your word's score, add together the value of the column each letter is in. You only score each letter once, even if the letter is in your word more than once. The Z is worth 2 bonus points, and the K is worth 1 bonus point.\n...\nI'll give you a few seconds...\n...\n...a few more seconds...\n...\nDid you see the word CATS, for 14 points?\nHow about SCRATCHING, for 21 points?\nKudos if you found BACKSCATTERING, for 27 points!\n  Play is simultaneous. All players try to come up with the single best word on the board at the same time. There's a 30-second sand timer within easy reach, but it's not running yet.\nThe first player to write down their word takes the 30-second sand timer and flips it on their scoresheet. They're now the fastest player, and they cannot change their word.\nAll other players have 30 seconds to write down their words. After 30 seconds, it's pencils down and time to score.\nIn addition to scoring your word's bonus, you get bonus points if your word scores more points than the fastest player's word, or if you're the fastest player and your word is better than half the other players' words.\nAfter 7 rounds, each player adds the scores of their best 5 words plus all their bonus points. The player with the most points wins!\nWant to learn more about the game? Read the rulebook draft, or try it yourself with a free, no-art print-and-play version of the game!\nAnd if you're on Twitter, check out @WordsyBot, which tweets out a different board of letters every 30 minutes!\nWordsy is a re-implementation of my first published game Prolix, which Z-Man Games released in 2010. While I'm proud of Prolix and its accomplishments (like making the Games 100), I've learned a lot about game design in the past six years, and I've always wanted to return to my first game to see what lessons I could apply to it.\nWordsy takes half the time to play that Prolix does. Its rules are much easier to learn and follow. It is smoother to play. And it scales to 6 players better than its predecessor.\nI'm really happy with how Wordsy came out. It's become a very important game to me. I feel like it's doing the things that I really wanted to do with Prolix.\nSo many games have optimistic player counts, but when you actually play them, it turns out that the 2-player game was just marketing, or the 6-player game is intolerably long.\nWordsy scales smoothly and effortlessly from 1-6 players. Really. I've played dozens of games at each player count, and I put a lot of work into making sure the 1-player game is just as good as the 6-player game.\nNo. Wordsy is a real-time game, but it's not a twitch game. You're eligible to get bonus points if you're the fastest player and your word is good, but if you come up with a lousy word just to run the timer, everyone will score bonus points off you. 30 seconds is long enough to think of something!\nBut don't take my word for it...\n               \"Wordsy is truly a unique word building game that fosters creativity and clever thought over simple mastery of the English language. With its focus clearly on allowing its players to create words of their choosing over making them use all the letters revealed from round to round, Wordsy become incredibly approachable and enjoyable for a variety of gamers.\" - Man Vs. Meeple\n\"After several plays through the game, this is going to be one I get to the table as often as possible. It\u2019s quick, anyone can play, and the myriad letter recombinations means near-infinite replayability.\" - GeekDad\n\"So here's the final word: if you enjoy speedy games that tax your nerves as well as your creative thinking skills, Wordsy is certainly one game to check out.\" - Cardboard Republic\n\"Wordsy gives me the freedom to dream big. The outlay provided by the cards is only a starting point. It\u2019s an invitation to search my memory banks for words that fit the pattern of the letters on the board. It is definitely a step up in fun and challenge from Boggle and Scrabble and other games that limit your choices, and the addition of the timed bonuses really adds some punch to the experience.\" - Board Game Gumbo\n\"Wordsy is so smart in so many ways. The puzzle it presents is simple \u2013 open your word-hoard and release the most potent salvo you can. And yet, because of the timing element, each round has this really awesome arc of tension; you start slow and before you know it, someone decides that \u2018quell\u2019 is good enough and you\u2019ve got 30 incredibly short seconds to decide between \u2018loquacious\u2019 and \u2018qualifications\u2019 and damn it, why did they have to start with such a short, obvious word?!?\" - Gameosity\n\"Wordsy is a game that takes the standard word game mechanics and flips them into something completely new and interesting. Not only does it shake things up, but it makes you have to think in different and unique ways, which is a blast!\" - Meeple Mountain\nCheck out some more great reviews!\n  Thanks for following along the campaign!

The more people back the game, the lower each copy will cost to print, and the nicer I can make the final product! I'm very excited about some of these stretch goals.\nOne important note: if I ever reprint this game, there's no guarantee the reprint will have these stretch goals. Backing this Kickstarter will be your most likely way to get a premium edition of Wordsy!\nFUNDED! Thank you, backers!\nFUNDED! Each game will ship with 100 double-sided scoresheets, up from 50 double-sided scoresheets. \nI like having my games come with everything they need in the box. And at $16,000, we can do that. If we reach this level, you will get six cute golf pencils in each box.\nThe base game comes in a traditional 2-piece box. But if we reach $18,000, I will ship the game in a lovely magnetic clasp box that opens like a book!\nAt this level, we will put gorgeous foil stamping on the cover!\n  If you're a customer within the EU your rewards will ship from within the EU. Keep in mind that some countries like Switzerland are physically within Europe but are not EU members. If you're in a non-EU-member nation, you may still have to pay customs, taxes, or import fees on your package.\nIf you are outside North America, your shipment will not be tracked unless you specifically request it. In a perfect world, I'd ship with tracking, but it's shockingly expensive!\nIf you're from outside North America and you'd like tracking on your shipment, message me and we can work something out.\nI may offer early backer pickup at conventions like UKGE or Origins (no promises, it depends on the schedule). In these cases, I will not be able to refund shipping for backers who choose to pick up at conventions. My apologies!\nThese notes are all hard-won lessons from previous Kickstarter campaigns I've run. I hope they don't cause you any difficulty; I'd rather you knew about them ahead of time!\nI created Formal Ferret Games as an outlet for my game designs. I wanted to take advantage of the new tools offered to designers, and release my work directly to the public.\nSo far, it seems to be working. I've almost sold out the initial print runs of my first two games,\nI believe that part of the reason for my success is that Formal Ferret Games allows me to demonstrate my passion for my games directly. People can see how much sweat and labor I put into what I do, and how great I try to make them before they hit shelves.\nIndie game design and publishing is a lot of work, but it's incredible work. I'm very grateful to be able to do it!\nI am a board game designer and publisher based in Jersey City, New Jersey, with my girlfriend and two adorable ferrets. In my life, I've recorded indie rock albums, edited sound for film, programmed computers, written and performed comedy, and seen more theater and live music than I can remember.\nWordsy would be my 5th published game and my 3rd self-published game. \nIf you want to know more about me, you can read my blog, follow me on Twitter, or sign up for my mailing list!\nScott Hartman is a freelance graphic designer and art director. He specializes in board games, but has worked on plenty of non-board game marketing projects.\nScott has also worked with other well-known publishers such as Action Phase Games, Tasty Minstrel Games, and Arcane Wonders.

Anyone who's used Kickstarter to back a tabletop game can tell you about projects that funded but delivered late... if at all.\n\nI've been designing games for a long time, and I now have two successful Kickstarter projects under my belt: The Networks and Bad Medicine. And by \"successful,\" I don't just mean that they funded. Both projects shipped to backers all around the world within a month of the estimated ship date.\n\nI've backed enough projects to know what tends to go wrong with a tabletop campaign. Here is what I'm doing to make sure Wordsy will not be delayed.\n\nFirst: Game design and graphic design are done. This game is ready to be sent to the printer. In fact, I am already in pre-production with the printer, so once the game funds, we will be ready to proof a physical copy of the game.\n\nSecond: I got a lot of feedback about production quality in my last Kickstarter project, so I've made a change. Wordsy will be printed by Panda Games, one of the biggest and best-known hobby game printers in the world. \n\nThird: I will be using Funagain Games to deliver Wordsy to the US and most of the world, instead of trying to handle things myself. That leaves shipping in the hands of people who can send packages safely and quickly, and who understand that tabletop games require more packaging than other products. I'm also using a separate fulfillment service based in the EU to handle EU fulfillment, which will relieve a lot of logistical and tax-related headaches.\n\nFourth: I am using a company called OTX to handle the logistics of transporting the manufactured games from the plant in China to the warehouse in the US. This is an intricate process, but OTX is quite used to it, and they specialize in board game logistics.\n\nFifth: I've backed plenty of Kickstarter projects, some which delivered on time, some which delivered late, and some that never delivered at all. I learned a lot from each of them.\n\nAt this point, I'm familiar with just about everything that can go wrong in a Kickstarter. Believe me, failing to fund is not even close to the worst-case scenario! I've heard many stories, from artists never delivering their art, to pallets stolen at the port, to mold in the game boxes and snails in the shipping container.\n\nBut I've built a great team around me. I feel that I am prepared to deliver this product to you close to my estimate of July 2017.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "WATCH WORD", "descp": "Thanks for following along the campaign!

Then, defeat the boss in each area to clear the land and earn rewards based on the amount of monsters you've killed in that area. \nCitizen Card Anatomy\nPlayers start with 1 Peasant and 1 Knight. Throughout the game you and your friends will use Gold to recruit a tableau of loyal citizens like the hard-working Baker... the magical Summoner... or Valeria's own fixer, the Condottiere. In a single game, there are 10 different citizens to choose from, and with the Flames & Frost expansion, you'll have a total of two-dozen alternate citizen types to create nearly endless combinations and challenges. No two games will be alike.\nDomain Card Anatomy\nOnce you've recruited the right combination of citizens, you can buy powerful domains like Sunder Bay - that allows you to banish another player's citizen, or Rime Temple - that allows you to convert Gold into Victory Points.\nDuke Card Anatomy\nEach player drafts a Duke or Duchess card at the start of the game, giving you secret ways to score bonus Victory Points. Follow the wishes of your patron and you may find yourself basking in the glory of victory. \nAgent Card Anatomy - New Mechanic!\nOver the course of your adventures in Valeria, you will make contact with the high and mighty, like the Prefect - who turns your Magic into Victory Points, and the dregs of society, like the Assassin - who you can pay to disable and opponent's citizen for the rest of the game. \n  30 New Monster Cards (5 new monster areas)\n  48 New Citizen Cards (8 stacks of 6 cards each)\n  18 New Domain Cards\n  6 New Duke Cards\n  9 Double-Sided Multiplier Tokens (5x on one side, 10x on the other)\nAll of the content above will be in the retail version of Valeria: Card Kingdoms - Flames & Frost along with all necessary divider cards to merge everything into your original Valeria: Card Kingdoms box.\n14 Agent Cards + 1 Rules Card\nFor backers, The Agents expansion pack will be included inside of your box of Valeria: Card Kingdoms - Flames & Frost. The expansion pack will include a divider card. \nDuke Mico + 10 Alternate Art Starter Cards\nBackers will also receive these Kickstarter Limited Exclusive* cards inside of your box of Valeria: Card Kingdoms - Flames & Frost. \n*Will not be in retail distribution. The Duke Mico card will be available at conventions we attend and through other promotional avenues. \nAdd Wood Tokens in the \"Plus\" Pledge Levels\nFor those that do not want to use the resource multipliers, the two \"PLUS\" pledge levels include a bagged set of wood tokens to supplement the tokens included in the original Valeria: Card Kingdoms game. The original tokens with these new wood tokens combined will fit in the token wells of the plastic insert - yes, we checked! :)    \n                                        Click Here! 1142 of 1,500 Followers as of 9am PDT\n    Click Here! 1,387 of 2,000 Followers as of 9am PDT\n    Click Here! 1,559 of 2,000 Likes as of 9am PDT\n    The reviews below are for the original Valeria: Card Kingdoms game. Flames & Frost is a full expansion that adds new Citizens, Monsters, Domains, and Dukes with new powers and new art for more variety in your gaming experience, but it does not substantially change the game play. These reviews will give you an excellent idea of what to expect.\n     Dice Tower Approved!\n                 Try out the tabletop simulator of Valeria: Card Kingdoms, Flames and Frost here!\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Message Us If You Have Questions!\nPLEASE NOTE: All Valeria: Card Kingdoms base games and Expansion Packs will be shipped along with the Flames & Frost expansion and cannot be shipped earlier. If you would like the base game sooner, we suggest that you contact your local retailer. \nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nWe have a $165.00 pledge level set aside just for retailers that includes 12 copies of Flames & Frost Deluxe, 11 for re-sale and 1 for your store's demo library. We will cover the shipping costs to your store but we will ship only to stores in the US, or to foreign stores with a freight forwarder with a US address. If you would like to order more than 12, please contact David and david@dailymagicgames.com.\nEvery game we create is a discrete project with its own development schedule and it's own budget of production and marketing expenses. We bring each project to Kickstarter when it's ready to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively. \nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion. \n\nRight now, for example:\nVillages of Valeria is leaving China soon.  \nQuests of Valeria is being assembled at the printer.  \nMerchants of Araby pre-press files being checked at the printer.  \nGo Nuts for Donuts is in final file prep.  \nKitten Klash is at the printer.  \n10 Minute Heist pre-press files are being compiled.  \nVCK Flames & Frost is on Kickstarter now!  \nFood Truck Champion is in the art pipeline.  \nHorizons is in the art pipeline.  \nSailing Towards Osiris: Dawn of Araby is in the art pipeline.\nSpaceways is in beta-testing.  \nAlchemists of Araby is in beta-testing.\nThrones of Valeria is in alpha-testing.  \nKnights of Valeria is in alpha-testing.  \nIn order to plan releases for the summer of 2017, we have to run the Kickstarter projects on a specific schedule and be sure all of the final files are to the printer ASAP. To accomplish that, our crowdfunding and release plans for the rest of 2016 looks something like this...\nMerchants of Araby: Funded on Kickstarter, Release June 2017\nGo Nuts for Donuts: Funded on Kickstarter, Release July 2017\n10 Minute Heist: Funded on Kickstarter, Release July 2017\nFlames & Frost: On Kickstarter Now, Release August 2017\nTo some, this looks like a crazy schedule and we know there are backers from previous campaigns that will avoid these new projects because they think it's a risky schedule. We're hoping, however, that our track record for successfully completing and delivering previous projects will give you the confidence to support these new projects we have lined up for the rest of 2016, and that the forthright communications we present when projects do hit snags will assuage any fears that we're going to screw it all up.\nSwinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge delivered one month late in December 2015 and is nearly sold out.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms delivered on time in January 2016. The first print run sold out and the second print run was delivered to our warehouse in June 2016.\nManaSurge delivered one month late in June 2016.\nVillages of Valeria is leaving China soon and is expected to reach the fulfillment hubs by Nov 30th and be delivered to backers by Dec 31st.\nQuests of Valeria is being assembled at the printer and looks to be on-track for delivery as-scheduled in February 2017.\nMerchants of Araby's files are in final prep and will be delivered to the printer by October 31st.\nGo Nuts for Donuts files are in final prep and will be delivered to the printer by October 31st.\n10 Minute Heist: The Wizard's Tower is awaiting 16 pieces of new art unlocked during the campaign. We expect to deliver the final files to the printer by November 15th.\nFor us, our end-of-2016 schedule is a well-planned and necessary path to assure that our games are brought to market as soon as possible so that gamers like you can enjoy them.\nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth.  \nIsaias Vallejo, Wizard-in-Chief, Game Designer, and Developer\nDavid MacKenzie, Conjurer and Game Developer\nLevi Mote, Alchemist, Game Designer, and Developer\nSarah Sharp, Enchantress and Convention Event Planner\nDylan Pharaoh-Whitney, Sorcerer and Graphic Designer\nClaire Donaldson, Illusionist, Illustrator, and Graphic Designer\nWe are focused on listening to what our customers have to say and making sure that we are producing the type of games you want at the high quality you demand. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates post-Kickstarter. We like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players. We're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called playtestNW to help local designers meet each other and engage with playtesters on a regular basis. Our hope is that we're helping designers build better games.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, King's Forge, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge, Villages of Valeria, Quests of Valeria, Merchants of Araby, Go Nuts For Donuts, 10 Minute Heist), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful board games: Sunrise City, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, Villages of Valeria, and Quests of Valeria.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Flames & Frost are completed with the exception of the stretch goals content. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the the files are delived. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Premium PNP Files", "descp": "Full-art, full-res, full-color Premium Print 'N Play PDF files.\nINCLUDES:\nPNP Valeria: Card Kingdoms\nPNP Flames & Frost\nPNP Exp.

What you see here is everything you need to play!\nEach turn presents a new puzzle as you navigate the varying cards in your hand and the ever changing cards secreted away in the dungeon!\nThere are two decks and the Multi-User Dungeon expansion pack available through this Kickstarter. Each dungeon deck offers a unique set of cards to adventure in. Both dungeons are also compatible with the Season 1 Dungeon Builder Sets! More on the multiplayer expansion pack below!\nAdditionally, everyone who backs for a dungeon or more receives the Season 2 Promo Cards! \n  At 600 backers we added new tiers that will allow you to get the first two all-new Dungeon Builder Sets. And at 700 we unlocked the last two!\nThe 100 Swords Dungeon Builder Sets are 15 cards each (items, monsters, an obstacle, and a boss) that you can use to get the most out of 100 Swords. They're only $7 each, $1 off for this campaign, and we designed our Dungeon Builder Sets to be used in two ways:\nThe first is easy: choose your favorite dungeon, slap on the Dungeon Builder Set's cards, choose which boss you want to play with, and get to it! Now your dungeon is longer, and has new cards that change up gameplay. Adding a Dungeon Builder Set to a dungeon will lengthen playtime up to 10 minutes. If you have both decks and both sets, you'll have a lot of variants to play with!\nThe second way you can use a Dungeon Builder Set is to make your own dungeon from scratch! Take cards from the two dungeons and the two sets, construct your own dungeon dive, and compete with friends!\nEach week during the campaign we'll run polls for nouns and adjectives. Backers will be able to suggest and vote for them. At the end, you'll vote for the favorites to determine what the new promo cards will be! Last season they inspired Awkward Narwhalman and Behemoth Atom which were pretty rad cards. We're excited to see what happens this time!\nWhile working on Season 1, we designed a lot of cards and learned a lot about what makes swords and monsters and fun dungeons tick. We've put that experience to work:\n2 New Dungeons - If you've played 100 Swords, you know you can't have too many dungeons. We've designed two all new standalone dungeons with awesome new cards!\nSupport for 3-4 Players - We have official support for more players with the all-new Multi-User-Dungeon Expansion Pack for 3-4 player games! All you need are two decks and the expansion to get delving!\n2 New Backer-Selected Promo Cards - Voted on by you, the backers!\n4 New Dungeon Builder Sets - We've unlocked all four awesome new dungeon builder set expansions!\nNew Solo Rules - A challenging new solo game mode with a special card included in the promo pack!\nNew Multiplayer Castle Playmat - This new playmat is ideal for 3-4 player games!\nBack this campaign and receive an all-new unique Kickstarter promo card per deck and save $1 off the retail price on everything!\nDid you miss the original campaign? We have added tiers with limited quantities that include Season 1 cards for those that are looking for them later in the campaign. We have limited supply of cards from Season 1! We will do our best to make sure cards are available. \nThe current plan is to allow people who want all of the cards to acquire them via Season 1 and Season 2 combination tiers. Because Kickstarter doesn't officially support add-ons, we may have to resort to a post-campaign manager for piecemeal requests for Decks and Dungeon Builder Sets from Season 1.\nLet us know what you'd be interested in getting in the comments!\nSmall Footprint - Ever want to play a deck-builder but not have to lug around a giant box? 100 Swords is the same size as a traditional poker deck, both in terms of card count and box size. Those 54 cards include everything you need to play - 18 starter cards, 3 rentals, and 33 cards in the dungeon (including items, monsters, and its infamous boss).\nEasy to Learn - There are only 3 types of cards in 100 Swords; items, monsters, and obstacles. Learning the game only takes minutes, and once you know it, teaching it takes half as long. The rules of the game are a straightforward take on classic deck-builders with some interesting quirks thrown in that mix the genre up in new and interesting ways.\nTactical Gameplay - Each turn in 100 Swords is a puzzle where you do your best to use every card as optimally as possible. You'll have to use every bit of info you have to not waste any resources and play the best possible turn, every turn.\nHidden Information - When you first step into the dungeon, every card you'll be interacting with will be face-down. As the game progresses, cards will change from hidden to revealed and back again. As the dungeon shifts from players defeating monsters and acquiring items, you'll be wracking your brain to remember if that card you're moving to is that awesome sword, or a powerful monster. \n  \"Having to literally explore the marketplace of cards....gives you a surprising amount to think about!.... Incredibly thematic.\" \nRichard Ham - Rhado Runs Through\n\"The art, humor, and gameplay in 100 Swords comes together to form a delightful dungeon delve. Elements like item rental and using your equipment as energy are clever, and the deck building makes me feel like I'm improving my bag of tricks to tackle the dungeon. I recommend this for anyone looking for a light hearted deck builder that plays quickly.\"\nSuzanne - Dice Tower Contributor\n\"I think this would be an excellent game to teach somebody the ropes of how to play a deck building game.... A whole lot of puzzle solving greatness in one tiny box!.... The possibilities of expansions are literally limitless.\" \nUndead Viking\n\"100 Swords is a great balance between luck and light strategy. I love when a turn comes together and you get more equipment room after room. Of course, finding a big baddie and taking him down or sneaking by him and getting more stuff is fun too, as long as my opponent isn't able to get by the monster!\" \nKen - Geek-craft.com\n\"100 Swords is a satisfying and fun romp through a dungeon without the tediousness of a classic dungeon crawl.\"\nAcross the Board Games \nCurious about the specifics? Check out our video below! You can view the online rules here (1.2 - just updated at launch!), and you can download the rules here (1.0 - release).\nEach turn, you'll be playing cards to move into, and interact with the dungeon. A lot can happen on a given turn, maybe you'll find some cool items? Or maybe you'll run into some tough monsters?\nYou'll also be using the cards in your hand to defeat those monsters, acquire items, and clear obstacles. Acquired items will end up in your deck, which in turn will make you more powerful and more able to defeat stronger monsters! Many items also have effects that are important to consider.\nDeciding when and how to use the cards in your hand and which cards in the dungeon to acquire or defeat is the key to winning 100 Swords!\nWhen the dungeon deck has too few cards to refresh the dungeon, or when you defeat the boss, the game is over! And remember, it's all about the gold! At the end of the game, the player whose cards are worth the most gold wins!\nCheck out this official walkthrough to see the game in action:\nHere's a quick video rundown with BoardGameGeek from Gen Con 2016: \nCheck out the official online rulebook:\n  We learned a lot from our previous 100 Swords campaign. We have streamlined our process to make this project turn around super-fast:\nWe've designed our stretch goal content in advance.\nWe've got a simplified reward tier system.\nOur shipping partner now has better support for post-campaign managers for those who need to make changes once the campaign is over.\nArt work for any stretch goals will begin immediately when and if they are funded.\nYou've asked, and we're delivering: In addition to the two new dungeons, we're also offering the all-new Multi-User Dungeon Expansion Pack which adds support for one or two more players! The expansion features all new items, monsters, and obstacles and a new Mini-Boss. All you need are two dungeons and the the expansion, and you're ready to crawl the dungeons with 3 and 4 players! It's also $1 off during this campaign!\nMore info on Multiplayer in Update #10! \n NEW! At 750 backers, we\u2019ll add a new multiplayer Castle Playmat! This new mat will be designed for multiplayer and will be bigger than the season 1 Dungeon Playmat. We\u2019ll also add a new tiers that include EVERYTHING for Season 2 and Season 1. If we reach this goal, we will also unlock a new promo card for EVERYONE!\nAt 800 backers, we unlocked a whole new set of solo rules. For Season 1, we released \"Gold Greed\" which is a simple way to have a have a way to compete with the dungeon. It's a great clean way to do it! I've been excited about this goal for a while now. These new rules are pretty great! With this version, the opponent is the Weary Warrior, and she actually has her own of cards which you use on her turn. Really happy with how this work, so we're super excited to share these with you! In addition, we're providing a new promo card to support this new solo mode which will be added to the promo pack!\nWe're estimating a April delivery. \nWhy so quick? We've chosen to do our manufacturing in the US for Shift, Province, Shadow of the Elder Gods, and the last season of 100 Swords. We've been very happy with the communication, quick manufacturing timelines, and production quality, and so we're continuing in that tradition. While it can be slightly more expensive, at the end of the day you're getting high-quality, ethically produced games with crazy-fast turnaround times! No waiting on slow trans-pacific cargo ships.\nAll rewards will ship from the US. Other solutions would make our game cost prohibitive. You want 100 Swords, and we're committed to getting you the game! Thanks for your understanding. It's also worth noting that shipping costs are even lower than our previous campaign!\n  Shipping is expensive, but it's a cost we can all share. To respectfully account for this cost, everyone receives a small discount on shipping without offering free shipping.\nCustoms Notice: Because this is very small and inexpensive game with a low declaration value, most international backers looking to get in on this Kickstarter will not have any customs expenses with any of the launch rewards.\n  Laboratory is a game publisher based in Seattle, WA, USA. We made everything you see here!\nIn 2013 we designed, developed, and published our very first microgame with the help of backers like you! Shift is a dueling card game that boils down Japanese-style CCG's into a single card. All you need is a friend, two cards, and some coins to throw-down in an epic anime inspired battle! It was even published in Brazil by our friends at Funbox Jogos!\nIn Spring 2014, we Kickstarted the original Province, which has over 10,000 copies to date. It was also our first game to reach stores. Province tackled the challenge of making a competitive two-player micro eurogame. We think it's pretty swell. Other people seem to agree!\nIn Fall 2015, we brought our micro ameritrash game, Shadow of the Elder Gods, to Kickstarter. In it, 1-4 players work together to stop a deck of eldritch threats from bringing about the end of all things. Shadow of the Elder Gods is a big game in a small box, and it's now in stores thanks to backers like you!\nWe also successfully delivered the first season of 100 Swords! ;)\nWith your help 100 Swords: Season 2 will bring bring a bunch of awesome new cards out into the world!\n  Project Video Music Credit:\nAdventure Meme Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our fifth time working with our manufacturing partners at Delano Service.

It\u2019s a great and profitable scheme, but be careful: When the authorities find out and cancel the program, you might get more than you bargained for... \nThe historical anecdote that inspired this game is known among economists as the \u201cCobra Effect,\" referring to a solution to a problem that backfires spectacularly and actually makes things worse.\nCobras is a trick-taking game for 1-5 players where knowing when to win a trick is key to winning. Players must lose tricks to collect cobras, then win a trick to exchange them for points. Timing things just right is the game's core challenge, and if you push your luck too far, you might get bit!\nEach trick, the losing players divvy up the cobras shown on the cards played that trick and place cobra tokens on their basket. The winning player empties their basket for points, according to a scale that rewards more points for more cobras\u2014then drops off steeply if you've pushed your luck too far!\nCobras also features a King Cobra card that allows players to either share the win or share the loss for one trick each hand. Use it wisely!\nOf special note, Cobras is a rarity among trick-taking games in that it comes with a one-player mode for solo gaming. Check out the rulebook and print-and-play file to find out more.\n  52 cards (4 suits of 13) \n5 King Cobra cards \n5 Basket cards \n42 Cobra tokens\n5 Scoring cards with scoring rings\n1 Solo token\nRules\nCobras will have a suggested retail price of $20, so our Kickstarter backers will receive a 20% discount. \nAlso, every Kickstarter backer will receive $3 off their shipping charge!

By collecting and converting resources, they need to fulfill specific contracts.

If a player claimed the middle scroll he takes it in his spell area (expanding his magic knowledge).  \n The game round continues until only one player is left, who gains the knowledge from all the scrolls of the library.\nTag a friend who likes dice games and spread the word.\n              We also have a quick how-to-play video, brought to you thanks to the great guys from Epitrapaizoume.\n    Click on the image to download the rulebook.

Windows have unique color and shade requirements, and similar dice may never be adjacent so placing each die is more challenging than the last. Fortunately, you\u2019ll have just the right tools to help you through. Gain prestige by adapting to the preferences of your fickle admirers, and of course, by adding your own artistic flair while completing your glass masterpiece in Sagrada.\nSagrada - A Game of Dice Drafting and Window Crafting for 1 to 4 players that plays in about 30 minutes. Carefully designed by Daryl Andrews & Adrian Adamescu with graphic artistry by Peter Wocken.\n  Get a quick overview of how to play from the animations below (they may take a couple seconds to load):\n      Click Here to download a pdf of the rule book.\nGlass Window with Dice - Prototype Components Shown\nCheck out a quick gameplay overview we did with Team Covenant at Gen Con 2016 (prototype components shown):\n  Sagrada will come in a sturdy box with a cardboard insert to help keep everything organized. Besides a full color rule book, each box is packed with high quality components:\nDice (90) - 6-sided, 12mm, 5 colors \nPlayer Boards (4) - diecut grid holds dice in place while you play\nWindow Pattern Cards (8) - Double-sided, two difficulties per card, harder windows give more Favor Tokens\nPublic Objective Cards (8) - Unique goals to strive for, each game is played with three selected at random\nPrivate Objective Cards (5) - Gain bonus points for each pip of your color\nTool Cards (8) - Spend Favor Tokens to break the rules, each game is played with three selected at random\nFavor Tokens (24) \nRound & Scoring Track - Keep track of the ten Rounds on front, flip it over to score at the end of the game\nDice Bag - Draft your dice from here. Material TBD\nRulebook - Learn to play quickly with plenty of visual examples\nSagrada comes with 90 6-sided dice (12mm in 5 colors)\n    \"What a charming, lovely little puzzle of a dice game. Very, very likable\u2026 this game purrs, it is a well oiled machine. A lovely, fun, light, perfect family-friendly dice puzzler that is just a blast\"\nRahdo Sagrada Gameplay Runthrough\n\"It's one of those perfect family games you can teach in 5 minutes\"\n  \u2018Sagrada\u2019 Is Stained-Glass Sudoku\n\"I think Sagrada is a lovely game, even in its prototype form, and I can\u2019t wait to see how it looks totally finished. If you like Sudoku, or stained glass, or lots of dice, you should definitely check out the Kickstarter\"\nThe Score - Little Metal Dog Television\nMeeple Mountain\n\"Sagrada is a beautiful game to look at, even with the preview copy I have. Fans of thinky, puzzly, pattern arranging games will love the challenges. Fan of dice rolling will go nuts over the bag full of dice.\nIf you're looking for a beautiful family friendly game that will make you use your noodle, then make sure you back Sagrada on Kickstarter!\"\nLow Player Count\n\"I love dice drafting and unique themes, so I was very interested in Sagrada. After playing, it didn't disappoint. It was easy to pick up but offered enough decisions to keep thinking through the whole game. I loved it.\"\nThe Inquisitive Meeple\n\"Sagrada is a great game \u2013 it is streamlined; very accessible, and it\u2019s extremely easy to teach. It\u2019s not trying to be like any other game, but is truly itself...  Sagrada is one of those games that stays with you, one where you will find yourself thinking about later on in the day or maybe even later in the week after playing. It plays wonderfully as a 2-player game. Not only that, but Sagrada is also beautiful looking, even in its preview form. The cover alone feels like it should be a framed poster in every board gamers home. I would be surprised if this doesn\u2019t become Floodgate Games biggest hit to date.\"\nStuart's Study\n\"\u201c[The dice] all are beautiful to behold and play off the light, just like a stained glass window. As you are filling in your card, the colors come to life more and more. You forget you are playing a game and really feel like you are working on your own little masterpiece.\u201d\nWe partnered with Dogmight to make something really special for Sagrada -- a beautiful custom-made dice tower you can add on to your pledge! Dice towers are useful for keeping dice rolls random and fair, while making sure your dice don't roll off the table. \nThe spire at the front includes a stained glass window effect in acrylic with hand-cut aluminum \"leading.\" A laser-cut relief of a 6-sided die is featured on the sides and back. The two inside baffles are lined in black felt that leads into the magnetically connected dice tray. The premium black walnut wood has a rich, dark walnut stain and is accented by nickel studs and chains.\nWe're thrilled with how this tower perfectly complements the Sagrada gameplay experience and we're confident you'll love bringing it out for all your dice-rolling games!\nCustom Sagrada Dice Tower Add-on by Dogmight\n  Custom Sagrada Dice Tower Features:\nBlack Walnut wood with Dark Walnut stain\nGlossy laminate window effect\nHand-cut aluminum frame \"leading\"\nBlack Felt-lined Baffles (2) and Dice Tray (with magnetic connectors)\nNickel Studs and Chains\n10 x 4 x 4 inches (25.4 x 10.16 x 10.16 cm)\nSimply back at the Sagrada (KS) & Premium Dice Tower reward tier to get yours.\nDice towers will ship separately from the Sagrada game itself, and will be sent from the US.\n     Interested in multiple copies? Message me and I'll get back to you on this!\nKickstarter Exclusive Player Board  \nAs a special thank you to our Kickstarter backers, we have a Kickstarter version of Sagrada that includes a Kickstarter themed player board! This will not be available after the Kickstarter campaign.\nThis player board does not change gameplay or add a fifth player, it's simply a fun and unique way we would like to show how we appreciate your support on Kickstarter. Thank You!\n  Kickstarter Exclusive Player Board\nTo make the Kickstarter Edition a little more special we decided to add a small cardboard dice tray. This will be a punch board that you assemble to form a small tray to roll your dice in (like the 3D model below)  \nDice Tray Preview - Design is not final\nDetails \nThis is not a stretch goal, it is already going to be included in every Kickstarter Edition copy of the game \nThis will be included with the Kickstarter Edition, but not the Standard Edition \nThis is not exclusive to Kickstarter, but won't be in the Standard Edition. These may be available later as a promo component directly from us (unlike the KS player board which is exclusive to backers) \nThe base is 75mm x 100mm and the inside is 30mm\nIf we hit the plastic insert stretch goal, this will likely not fit in when assembled (although it's very easy to put together and take apart). We'll try to make this happen, but it's not likely given what's in the box already\nSince we met our funding goal (in 10 hours, wow!), we'll be able to add even more to every copy of Sagrada: \n  Wow,  All stretch goals unlocked! Thank you!!\nThe Tabletop gaming community is thriving! It's been an incredible experience as a publisher watching the community grow so much over the past few years. It's an exciting time for us as gamers with so many unique and interesting games, and I'm honored to have you consider Sagrada as one of those options. Here are just a few reasons why we feel this project is worth your support:  \nTight Gameplay - You can learn Sagrada in just moments, finish in minutes and end the game with satisfaction and immense desire to play again.\nHigh Replayability - The vast combinations of window, tool and objective cards keep each game feeling like it's telling a new story. \nUnique Components - The translucent dice capture the theme and the modular player board is a perfect companion for the gameplay. We love the way Sagrada looks on the table, and we're sure you will too.\nSupporting Independent Game Design and Publishing - Everything you see in this project is the product of a massive effort by several passionate, independent creators. The efforts that went into the game design, graphic design and publishing are all crafted by individuals who absolutely love our hobby. Without you, we wouldn't be able to bring these creations to life!\nWe've had a fantastic time working with Daryl Andrews & Adrian Adamescu on Sagrada. They've worked hard to make sure the gameplay flows smoothly and helps you focus on building a beautiful stained glass window. Peter Wocken is a veteran graphic artist who we were thrilled to have craft such a captivating visual experience for this game.\nGreetings Artisans!\nFor those who are new to our games, welcome! For those who have supported us in the past, it's great to have you back! We're thrilled to be back on Kickstarter with our 7th project! Starting with Legacy: Gears of Time in 2012, all the way through Epic Resort: Villain's Vacation earlier this year, running these projects have each been incredible experiences, and I cannot wait to see where this one goes! Sagrada is our 5th game (not counting expansions) and we're really proud to show you all what we put together.\nI'm looking forward to communicating with you throughout the project and after. Please reach out directly in a message or in the comments if you have a question or concern -- I'll do everything I can to make your backer experience on this project the best it can be! Thank you for joining us on this one, I really appreciate it.\n-Ben Harkins\nOwner - Floodgate Games\n  Those of you who were backers for our Vault Wars project last year may remember the Junk Flavor Text contest we had where backers could submit ideas for thematic text to be printed on some of the cards.

Pilots (Variable Powers)! Now players compete to hire the best pilots, with powerful abilities, in addition to competing over the best planets.\nPilots are hired by activating 2, or 3, like dice. You activate 2 like dice if the pilot you're hiring is trained to fly the ship you're assigning them to, or you activate 3 like dice if you need to assign the pilot to a ship they are not trained to fly.\n2. Exploration (Press-Your-Luck)! Now you can send your ships into unexplored space on a hunt for resources or exploration badges! But beware, you may end up in the orbit of a black hole or being forced to lose resources of your own. To explore, you simply move a ship onto the exploration card. Then, if there are any exploration cards face up, you may take one. OR, you can flip over the top card of the deck, if it's red, you must take it and stop exploring. If it's green, you can take it, or go again until 3 exploration cards are face up, at which point you would have to take the next card you flip.\n3. Badges (Set-Collection)! Thought you had a handle on everyone's scores in Tiny Epic Galaxies?? Now you'll have to think again. Players will be collecting exploration badges from pilots they hire and exploration cards they acquire. After the game is over, players are rewarded bonus victory points for each badge type they have the most of. These points can stack up fast and provide opportunities for come-from-behind victories! \n  Since Tiny Epic Galaxies Beyond the Black is an expansion to Tiny Epic Galaxies, we will grandfather the component qualities from TEG into TEGBTB.\nFREE COMPONENT UPGRADES\n2mm Box Thickness\nSpot UV Box Logos\nBox Interior Printing (using the hangar image at the top of the page)\n310 gsm Ivory Core Linen Cardstock\nCards with Rounded Corners\nBelow are additional upgrades the game will come with if we are able to reach the listed goals.

To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nRegarding customs: because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 and 2 copies, will not get hit with customs or import fees. The games will be delivered right to your door. We have shipped thousands and thousands of copies of Tiny Epic games to international backers without any occurrences.\n  Add-ons, such as base and deluxe copies of TEGBTB, Premium Print & Plays (including the TEGBTB premium PnP), previous Tiny Epic games, play mats, and more, will be offered in PledgeManager.

The problem with trying to study quarks is that you can\u2019t find just one quark; you need to find them in groups called hadrons, or some other exotic particles, like the Pentaquark.\n  In Pentaquark, you are trying to give science a helping hand by collecting the 5 quarks that form this particle at the detector of a massive particle collider. Move cards you need to the detector, discard others so they may come back as anti-quarks, and try to minimize the number of quarks scattered and lost. If too many cards are removed from the game, the Pentaquark has slipped through undetected once again!\nPentaquark is a single player game designed by Mike Mullins with art by Fabrice Weiss. Gameplay lasts 15-30 minutes (you will immediately want to play again) and recommended for ages 12 and up.\nThe game consists of:\n-18 Cards\n-Fold Out Full Color Rules-Wallet Packaging\nThis is part of our Wallet Line and will be packaged in a small vinyl wallet, perfect for taking it on the go. It's pocket-sized, portable and protective... and has proven itself with our growing line of wallet games.\n  The $3 Six-Card Bonus Pack is available in the Game and Bonus Pack pledge level or by adding $3 to any pledge. Here's some info:\nGluons come in each of the 3 quark colors. When one comes into play, you must attach it to a free quark, thereby changing it's color. A blue gluon might change a green up quark to blue and win you the game, or it could turn your red down quark blue and upend your careful planning.\nBosons are very interesting particles emitted when quarks change from one flavor to another. In the game, a boson will have two icons on it, such as up and down. If that boson were to come into play, you must attach it to an up or a down, changing it into the other flavor.\nThis 6-card expansion can have a dramatic effect on the game. At first everything feels a bit chaotic, but with some due diligence, new strategies will begin to reveal themselves. \nRules for Gluons, Bosons and Top Cards:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/czf767ctrecfr8t/PQ-QCDPacks.pdf?dl=0\nMike has put together a wonderful video detailing the ins and outs of Pentaquark, from how to play to some strategy for beginners. Check it out below:\n  You can print the full game right here. It's only 4 pages long with just black ink (you can get a feel for it without color since the colors are written on the cards, but it's a game about color so the color will REALLY help later). The rules are just another few pages, and you can even make it work by just viewing them online.\nBlack and white Print and Play with rules included. (but for the most up to date rules only, go to this link):\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bfn8oimbddq9fyv/PQ-PNP-BW-090816.pdf?dl=0\nPlease note: The rules are NOT final. They still need to go through editing and graphic design, but any notes that you have at this point are incredibly appreciated.\n  \"The gameplay for Pentaquark is so easy, but the longer-lasting effects of those choices make this 18 card game something quite a bit more than what you initially think. Mike Mullins has put together a quick, fun, but rather thinky, game about perfect information, hand management, and of course science!

Some players enjoy the freedom to use any letter on the board, allowing their inner word ninja to come out and spell ridiculously long words. Others prefer a more strategic route, carefully selecting which letters to use to control the board and mess with their opponents.\nWill you expand your holdings by spelling long words? Will you strategically block your opponents or steal priceless artifacts, permanently claiming the associated letter for your exclusive use? Will you use the super-mega-evil arsenal letters with their devious powers?\nThe winner of Word Domination is often not the player with the largest vocabulary, but the player who can most strategically use their vocabulary to come out on top.\nTake the role of a 1970s-era criminal mastermind, each with their own, unique character ability\nEvery letter represents a priceless artifact or landmark that you can steal - over 100 different artifacts included, each with its own unique art\nHard-to-use letters are the super-mega-evil arsenal - things like the Vaporshock Rocket, X-Ray Goggles, or the Zeppelin Lift - each with their own devious power\nFeel like a genius - even non-word gamers can spell massive words, thanks to the open playing area\nCompletely interactive - unlike many word games, you'll be messing with your opponents on every turn\nStrategic gameplay - deciding which letters to use can make the all difference\nCo-op gameplay variant included - team up with your friends and pull off the heist of the century\nSolo variant also included - who needs friends? Conquer the world on all your own\nEasy to learn, easy to teach - read the rules or watch an overview\n  Ships from within the international region to avoid VAT and other import taxes.\n    In Word Domination, players spell words using any available letter on the board, canvassing the priceless artifacts they contain. On subsequent turns, players attempt to steal those letters, claiming them for the player\u2019s exclusive use. A cunning player will carefully select which letters to steal, as adjacent letters can be more valuable at the end.\nFor a quick run-down of how to play, check out the video below:\nFor a complete description of game play, see the player manual here.\n  To ensure Word Domination is as attractive as it is fun, we've brought in two of the most talented illustrators in the industry.\nThe character illustrations are being created by Ryan Goldsberry, the same illustrator whose art is featured on Paperback and Burgle Bros. His clever and unique take on the 1970s-era \"bond villain\" perfectly captures the theme of Word Domination.\nFor the letter tiles, we wanted a \"blueprint\" theme - something that would represent the villains scheming over priceless artifacts. We worked with Andrew Colin Beck, whose icons and illustrations have been featured in some of the biggest magazines and websites in the world.\nThere are over 100 tiles in the game. Each tile contains a unique priceless artifact or arsenal to steal, all with completely unique artwork.\n  Here are a couple bonus items you can add to your pledge. Here's how to add these items to your pledge: Click \"Back this Project\" and then select your pledge tier. Add the amount for the desired Add-On to your pledge total. After the campaign, we'll send a survey asking which items you ordered. All items ship in May with Word Domination - the savings are because they will all ship together.\nGive your play area the comfort it deserves. This oversized playmat is the perfect size to play any configuration of Word Domination. It includes preset grids for a 2, 3, or 4-player game, with enough extra tile spots to allow the game to naturally grow. There is a built-in round counter, spot for unused tiles, and a reminder of basic turn mechanics and arsenal tile powers. This mat will not only look great but also help streamline your playing experience. Artwork still in final developed and subject to improve over time.\n  Interested in playing Word Domination in a non-English language? Thanks to the clever ideas of our backers, we've devised a solution: blank tiles. Each set comes with 10 tiles to which you can add the letters you need to play in your language. To make the tiles more accessible to international backers, we are providing flat rate shipping for these tiles. Add up to 5 sets of 10 to your order for $5 each and only pay your associated shipping fee once.\n  Paperback is an innovative mix of word game and deckbuider - but you are writing Romance Novels. You can win by being great at words or great at deckbuilding. It's the perfect companion game to Word Domination. Includes all stretch goals. Check out more about Paperback\n  By popular demand, it's the \"Genius by birth, Evil by choice\" backer pin. Let the world know your stance on morality. Note: there is a limited quantity of these pins, and once they're gone, they're gone.\n  Without your help, we won't be able to print this game and share it with the world.\nHelp guide the development of this game. We listen to our backers and strive to implement their clever ideas.\nOnce funded, our stretch goals will add more content and better components to improve the game for everyone.\nBackers receive the game at a discount compared to after the campaign.\nThis game is not going to distributors. It may not be in your local store.\nWe don't fill up your shelf. It's a big game that we've squeezed into a small box.\nEuropean copies will be sent from inside the EU to avoid VAT.\nNon-English backers can purchase blank tiles, allowing them to customize the game for their language.\n  Jeff Beck is a game designer and host of the gaming podcast, Your Tables On Fire!

You'll add merchants and allies to your entourage, you'll teach virtues to your opponents, and you'll summon djinn for powerful effects. \nYou'll also be doing a lot of negotiating. Simply stated, everything in Merchants of Araby is negotiable for everything. You can trade gold for camel placement, cards for products, actions for promised actions, camel placement for ally tasking, cards from entourage to entourage, cards from hand to hand, something for nothing. The list is nearly endless. If you can strike a deal, then feel free to do so.\nCaravans are the primary source of income and the main reason for negotiations. Each space on the caravan will hold one camel carrying a particular product and each caravan represents a journey to a distant Araby city to sell those valuable products. Player participation, bandits, and market fluctuations will affect each caravan\u2019s payout and you do not want to miss out on getting your share of the profits.\nAdd camels to caravans by tasking merchants, playing a djinn card, or negotiating with other players to generate the products you need or to add their camels to your caravan. An opponent may not add a camel to your caravan without negotiating for your permission, but unless you complete at least one full row or column on the caravan card, you're not going to earn anything! When your turn ends, your caravan becomes locked to you and you may not add more of your camels to it unless the active player grants you permission to do so through some negotiation. \nYour caravans depart at the start of your next turn, but be wary of bandits out to steal your goods as bandits tend to target the camels in the most lucrative caravan positions.\nCard Anatomy\nThere are 6 card types in Merchants of Araby: Merchants, Allies, Virtues, Djinn, Caravans and Backs.\nMerchants are played to your entourage, the collection of merchants and allies that you use throughout the game to get stuff done. When you task a merchant you generate a product that you can use to add a camel to a caravan, reduce the cost to play other cards, or offer up as your end of some negotiated deal.\nVirtues are life lessons that show the benefits of living a life of purpose. Invoking Generosity, Cooperation, Frugality and more will bring you rewards and you may share many of those rewards with the players who have been helpful to you.\nDjinn are powerful magical beings that can be leveraged to generate products, refresh allies, grant cards, and sneak your camels into caravans they're not supposed to be in...if you cross their palms with a bit of silver.\nAllies are the people you surround yourself with to grease the wheels, smooth the bumps and, when they work together in subtle combos you'll be thrilled with what they can accomplish. The more allies you have, the more flexible your strategies can be.\nOn the back of all the cards, you'll find some very important information you'll need to resolve your caravans. Lay a card face down next to your caravan as it departs and you'll see which camel gets ambushed by the bandits and how much each remaining camel will earn depending on its location. Every card back is different and you won't know your results beforehand.\nAnd finally there are the caravan cards, themselves. Each shows the products needed in the nine camel positions. It's your job to get as many of those positions filled as possible before your next turn. Only complete columns and complete rows pay off though, so be careful where you place your camels.\nVictory!\nAfter four complete rounds, all of the players receive a final resolution card for their caravan and all the money is totaled up to see who is the wealthiest merchant in all of Araby.\n                        Game Contents:\n86 Game Cards\n4 Player Merchant Cards\n4 Player Tents\n4 Reference Cards\n60 Coin Tokens (30 1\u2019s, 20 5\u2019s, 10 10\u2019s)\n20 Camel Tokens (5 in each player color)\n1 Rulebook\n1 Beautifully Illustrated Box\n1 Functionally Designed insert\n1 Cunningly Engineered Game Board\nKickstarter Limited Exclusive Card*:\n1 Djinn \"Tribute\" Card\n*This content will not be available through regular distribution.

We bring each project to Kickstarter when it's ready to give you, our fans and supporters, the opportunity to help us put the final touches on the game and to reserve your copies at the time it will do the game the most good, both financially and creatively. \nSome say that a creator should not launch a new project until their previous project is completed and delivered. That system might work for a designer who is self-publishing a game, but for an up-and-coming company like Daily Magic Games, that system is not viable. At any point in time we are working on a dozen projects in various stages of completion. Right now, for example... \nVillages of Valeria is at the printer.\nQuests of Valeria is at the printer.\nMerchants of Araby is on Kickstarter\nGo Nuts for Donuts is out to game reviewers\n10 Minute Heist is having reviewer prototypes created\nVCK Flames & Frost is finishing art and beta-testing\nKitten Klash is getting artwork started\nFood Truck Champions is getting art descriptions written\nHorizons is getting art descriptions written\nSpaceways is in beta-testing\nThrones of Valeria is in alpha-testing\nKnights of Valeria is in alpha-testing\nIn order to plan releases for the summer of 2017, we have to run the Kickstarter projects on a specific schedule and be sure all of the final files are to the printer ASAP. To accomplish that, our crowdfunding and release plans for the rest of 2016 looks something like this...\nMerchants of Araby: Kickstarter Aug 16 to Sep 13, Release June 2017\nGo Nuts for Donuts: Kickstarter Sep 20 to Sep 30, Release July 2017\n10 Minute Heist: Kickstarter Oct 4 to Oct 14, Release July 2017\nVCK Flames & Frost: Kickstarter Oct 18 to Nov 15, Release August 2017\nTo some, this looks like a crazy schedule and we know there are backers from previous campaigns that will avoid these new projects because they think it's a risky schedule. We're hoping, however, that our track records for our previous projects will give you the confidence to support the projects we have lined up for the rest of 2016, and that the forthright communications we present when projects do hit snags will assuage any fears that we're going to screw it all up.\n\nSwinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge delivered one month late in December 2015 and is nearly sold out.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms delivered on time in January 2016. The first print run sold out and the second print run was delivered to our warehouse in June 2016.\nManaSurge delivered one month late in June 2016.\nVillages of Valeria is at the printer and, after a couple of delays that occurred because we changed printers in mid-stream for quality control issues, is scheduled to deliver two months late in November 2016.\nQuests of Valeria is at the printer and looks to be on-track for delivery in February 2017.\nFor us, our end-of-2016 schedule is a well-planned and necessary path to assure that our games are brought to market as soon as possible so that gamers like you can enjoy them.\n\n\nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth.\n  Isaias Vallejo, Wizard-in-Chief, Game Designer, and Developer\nDavid MacKenzie, Conjurer and Game Developer\nLevi Mote, Alchemist, Game Designer, and Developer\nSarah Sharp, Enchantress and Convention Event Planner\nDylan Pharaoh-Whitney, Sorcerer and Graphic Designer\nClaire Donaldson, Illusionist, Illustrator, and Graphic Designer\nWe are focused on listening to what our customers have to say and making sure that we are producing the type of games you want at the high quality you demand. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates post-Kickstarter.\nWe like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players.\nWe're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called playtestNW to help local designers meet each other and engage with playtesters on a regular basis. Our hope is that we're helping designers build better games.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success: \n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge, Villages of Valeria, Quests of Valeria), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games and has designed several successful board games: Sunrise City, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, Villages of Valeria, and Quests of Valeria.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines. \n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Merchants of Araby are completed with the exception of stretch goals content. The art and design for the stretch goals content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved. \n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the campaign ends. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly. \n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "Premium PNP Files", "descp": "All of the PNP files of the printed components for Merchants of Araby, including files for all appropriate unlocked stretch goals.\nPhysical components are not included and will have be sourced on your own.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2016"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "1 x Merchants of Araby", "descp": "One copy of the Merchants of Araby game and all appropriate unlocked stretch goals.\nFree Shipping to USA.\n$5 Shipping to Canada\n$54 Shipping to Brazil & Russia.\n$10 Everywhere Else.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["818 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 180 or more", "title": "6 x Merchants of Araby", "descp": "Group Buy Pledge\nSix copies of the Merchants of Araby game and all appropriate unlocked stretch goals.\nFree Shipping to USA.\n$12 Shipping to Canada\n$120 Shipping to Brazil & Russia.\n$48 Shipping Everywhere Else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Shipping to \"Add-Ons\" Backers + Origins Game Fair", "update_content": "Greetings Merchants...\nI'm happy to let you know that the Merchants of Araby stock has reached the USA and has been delivered to the Ship Naked warehouse, been sorted, and is now ready to send out to the remaining 10% or so of \"Add On\" backers as well as the \"No Add Ons\" backers who did not receive their original shipments via SendFromChina.\nHere's the pre-shipping notice from Ship Naked:\n-------------"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "The Next Project from Daily Magic Games", "update_content": "Greetings Merchants...\nI'm happy to say that more and more Merchants of Araby games are being delivered every day.

How will you get revenge? \nWhatever happens, it's bound to be... \n                Unfair funded on day 1, with 4 core theme packs, and raced through stretch goals that added more content and better components. \nUnfair is now stretched to perfection. The game is as good as it can possibly be right now. See details below. \nContent in detail\nThe core boost to Unfair is the 2 new theme packs backers added:\nNinja theme pack, 56 extra cards enabling a 5-player game that we now include in the box. \nGangster theme pack, 56 cards for even more replayability and Unfair money-making fun. \n6 theme packs in total powers up Unfair with 112 extra cards, that's 50% extra content from where we started, for FREE! Now every version of Unfair will contain these extra theme packs.\nKickstarter backers also get these 12 fully-playable sneak peek cards from future expansions. These won't be released in the core retail edition of Unfair - those guys will need to wait ages till they come out in expansions.\nThere are many more card and component upgrades to Unfair.

Combine one theme pack per player to create a shared pool of cards. Each combination of themes gives a different play experience.\nJungle for more space to fit guests in,\nPirates for taller rides,\nRobots for efficient attraction building,\nVampires for the finest quality attractions and staff.\nNinja for more errr 'interaction' and tricks\nGangsters for brutally refined money making strategies\nThen shuffle up the Park, Event, Blueprint and City Event cards into decks, deal out players' starting cards and coins, and you're ready to go.\n  Build thrill rides, leisure rides, theatres, sideshows, food outlets and nature areas from the market or your hand.

But don't expect to keep them forever - everyone wants the best staff!\n  With each event card, you choose whether to boost your park OR mess with your competitors. You can stockpile a few events to defend yourself, or bluff while you hold out for powerful event combos.\n  You've gotta have your secret plans, right?

Be prepared to defend the parts that matter to your plans!\n  You have 8 rounds - 4 with the City helping you, and 4 with them cracking down on the theme park madness taking over town.

We owe you the best game we can make for you now.\n  We pre-pack Unfair in a robust mailer box at the factory, and use quality fulfillment companies in each region to keep shipping costs as low as possible so you can back more games! USD$15 for shipping is included in the core pledge tier, and backers in some regions will need to pay additional fees as follows:\n  Unfair is the beautiful & lovingly cynical brainchild of talented new designer Joel Finch. It's literally a 5 year labour of love, designed so that he could finally play a game he truly loves with his wife Kate. The result? An accessible, inclusive, flexible, deep, re-playable and fun game we are excited to release as our second game.\nPacked with beautiful art by Mr Cuddington and Phillipe Poirier, Unfair will take you back to theme park days under bright blue skies where everything was awesome. But dig a little deeper and you'll discover that running a competitive theme park requires some tough choices. Every layer of the game is detailed, thematic and constantly surprising, from the name of cards, to their incredible art, card abilities and even flavour text.\nUnfair is a rich gaming experience, as fun or ruthless as you make it. We think you will keep finding more in it, play after play. And with your help, there is more to come.\nView the high quality PnP files & Rules.\nWe have the rules, the design, the art for the four initial themes already done - so why do we need Kickstarter?\nFirst, we want many gamer eyeballs on Unfair, before it's released, while we can still fix any problems. Retail distribution is very one-way, whereas with Kickstarter we can hear from players while your feedback can make a difference.\nSecond, while four themes is enough to play the game exactly as intended, additional themes would add variety. We have two more theme packs tested and ready to reveal as stretch goals. We want to include them in the main game but we need your support to do that.\nWe also use Kickstarter to recoup the cost of deluxe art and component quality for the games we make. So it gives you a richer game experience for your money, helps us gauge interest in our games, provides global marketing for them, and helps them sell better in retail eventually.\n\nIn short, with your help through Kickstarter, we can make games more awesome.\n\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe limit risks by offering a limited number of stretch goals we would otherwise include in later expansions in Unfair. This way we can complete production by October, have games to you in Nov / Dec, and be in stores by Christmas.\n\nWe have run a kickstarter campaign for Monstrous before. People loved the production quality but we delivered later than promised and learned some lessons. This time we will be better. \n\nAs with Monstrous, we printed a 50 copy pre-production print run to check the manufacturing quality of the game. People who played at Gen Con 2016 were delighted with our component quality. However, we have decided to upgrade the reference boards and playing card stock. And to insist on sharpened blades for card cutting.\n\nOur artists have proven very reliable and we have confirmed they can complete the listed stretch goal card illustrations by the end of this campaign, and we won't be pushing them beyond that.\n\nRules are complete and ready to print now. \n\nBackers' games will be pre-boxed in shipping boxes at the point of manufacture for faster and more consistent shipping.

A distinct possibility for delay lies in the painting of the meeples. Although every individual meeple is hand-sorted for quality control, by us personally, there are times that errors in screen printing require that we re-make the entire batch of pieces for that particular Character Meeple. If this occurs, it will take a minimum of 8-10 weeks to replace them, which could delay shipping. For example, if this were to occur only a month before shipping would otherwise commence, some pledges would deliver after the estimated delivery date. Although we believe that we have allotted plenty of time for situations such as this, it should be noted that project delays are still a possibility. \n\nMore than anything, we are committed to quality. Our past customers know that this is true, and our Kickstarter backers know that we offer a money-back guarantee on all pledges.

Most crimes don't require a negotiator. But for the ones that do... you get the call. \nHostage Negotiator: Crime Wave is completely playable without any other content. So if you don't own the original Hostage Negotiator, you are still getting a fully playable game right out of the box. But having the original as well really brings out the most in this expansion! With new Conversation Cards, new Terror Cards, new Pivotal Events, new Abductors, and new Demands that can all be integrated with the original, your Hostage Negotiator experience will be taken to an all new level! Plus, with a larger box that can easily fit all released content -including the entire original game box- with room for more, you won't have to worry about any storage concerns whatsoever. But you'll still have the portability option of the original for taking on trips!\nThe box is designed to hold all of the Hostage Negotiator content released so far (with room for more!).\n  We are very proud to say that Hostage Negotiator has garnered much praise over the last year and has a very good reputation with the Solitaire community.\n2015 Solitaire Game of the Year - 1 Player Guild\nHas over 5,000 members!\n2015 Golden Geek Nominee and Runner Up for best Solitaire Game\nRunner Up\n  If you already know how the original plays, you can skip to the next section to find out what is new. But if you're new to the game, here is how it works.\nObject of the Game: Your goal as a Hostage Negotiator is to save the hostages and have the crisis end with the Abductor\u2019s capture or elimination. To win, at least half of the hostages must escape with their lives AND the Abductor must be captured or eliminated.  \nHere is what the game looks like set up on your table...  \nThe Game plays over multiple turns with each turn being comprised of 3 phases.   \n1. The Conversation Phase - this is where you play and resolve conversation cards from your hand by making a Threat Roll to influence the Abductor's Threat Level, earn Conversation Points, and save hostages. Thematically, this phase represents the back and forth dialogue between you and the abductor. Perhaps a calm conversation... or... a tense and heated exchange depending on the cards played and the results. It could also represent actions such as sending in a field team to extract some hostages while you occupy the abductor.  \nDuring the Conversation Phase you play the \u201cLittle Compromises\u201d card. The Threat level is currently on 4, so you roll two Threat dice. You get 1 success which allows you gain a Conversation Point, reduce the Threat by 1, and save 1 Hostage.\n2. The Spend Phase - this is your chance to spend any Conversation Points you may have earned in the Conversation Phase. Similar to a deck building game you will buy cards from the available area on the table, but in this game all the cards you buy go directly into your hand for use in the next or another future turn. Thematically this represents the conversational equity you've built up with the Abductor by influencing her (or him!) and/or keeping her on the phone longer so you and your command can plan a potential use of force!  \nDuring the Spend Phase you can purchase available Conversation Cards. \"All snipers engage targets!\" is a very powerful card that can end the game with one shot, but it doesn't come cheap. You'll need at least 7 Conversation Points in order to purchase it.\n3. The Terror Phase - this is where you will draw and resolve a Terror Card. In general, bad things will happen putting pressure on the Threat Level or worse... losing one or more hostages. Thematically this represents the Abductor's (or sometimes another individual such as a hostage's) actions between conversations. Maybe the Abductor decides he/she is angry or that you are not listening to his demands. Or maybe a hostage attempts to escape! The number of cards in the Terror Deck are limited to represent the ticking of the clock... after all, the Abductor has only given you a limited amount of time to meet his/her demands! The above is only a general summary of play, but we hope it gives you a good idea of the game. There are other details not discussed here such as Demands, the Pivotal Event Terror Card, the 2nd in Command, and more! \nDuring the Terror Phase you must reveal the top card on the Terror Deck. In this example, you drew \u201cFit of Rage,\u201d which will temporarily raise the Threat level by 2 as your Abductor throws a dangerous \u2013 and costly \u2013 temper tantrum.\nWe strongly suggest you take a look at the FULL RULES for the game by clicking the image below.\n(Hostage Negotiator: Crime Wave rules were not able to be posted during the campaign much to our regret, but we will share them as soon as possible. Core rules are basically the same as the original with some slight tweeks and modifications for Crime Wave.)\nOriginal Hostage Negotiator Rules\n  The Box - Normally not much is said about the box, but the box for the original can barely fit the current content. So the larger Crime Wave box complete with custom insert to keep all of your cards organized is really a big selling point. Additionally, the box will be sized to accommodate sleeved cards. \nCustom Labeled Dividers - The dividers won't simply be generic, but will be labeled by card type so that you can quickly and easily sort all of your Hostage Negotiator content.\nNew Oversized Player Board - The player board has been expanded significantly with a new design. The additional real estate will help you more easily track your hostage negotiating sessions.\nLarger Custom Dice - The custom dice have been enlarged from 16mm to 18mm, because bigger is better (especially when it comes to chucking dice!). \nNew Hostage Meeple Designs - The game now comes with two designs - one male and one female - and 10 of each will be included in the box.\nScreen Printed Alert Tokens - Tokens that remind you of triggered effects in the game. Many effects of cards in this new set trigger well after they are first revealed. \nNew Cards that use the familiar core rules of HN, but will force you to change how you approach the game. \nRules for combining Conversation Cards into one set\nRules for combining Terror Cards into one set\n*Kickstarter Exclusive for this project means not to be sold except by the publisher for promotional purposes which may include Conventions, direct from the publisher's website, or other promotional forums.\nWe are very excited to offer the next 3 Abductor Packs. Each of the new packs is from an acclaimed designer. These packs extend the game each adding new mechanisms and big challenges.  All packs are compatible with both HN and Crime Wave.\n A cult has turned to violence to push its agenda and to garner more attention. Many in the cult are as much victims as they are culprits. How will you handle the situation when the Abductors are also the Hostages? Find out in this thrilling pack.\nClyde Seaver's life is in shambles. His wife left him and in fear of losing his 2 children he's kidnapped them with the help of his loyal sister, Tina. She has the kids hidden in Becker Swamp and you have to negotiate with the suicidal Clyde and buy your team time to find the kids.\nValerie Stone was another negotiator who was constantly competing with you, but never garnered the accolades or had the level of success that you did. Ultimately it became too much for her and she's decided the only way to prove she is better than you is to force you to negotiate with her... and she knows just how to accomplish that.\n  *If you are interested in multiple copies of a pledge level, please contact the project creator via the KickStarter messaging system.\nDue to incredibly popular demand, we're now offering these add-ons to our backers.

We learn more and more with each experience. Our goal is to get the games to you, our supporters, as quickly as possible.\n\nThere are the usual risks of printing, shipping, customs, and other unintended delays, but you can be sure we will do everything we can to deliver the games to you as promised.\n\nA few remarks we want to share with you regarding our approach for our projects, including this one.\n\n1. Communication is of the utmost importance to us. Please ask any and all questions and we will answer as quickly as possible. \n2. We have planned out the goals for this project, but feel strongly about not overextending ourselves for the sake of more $. If we are so fortunate to run through our planned stretch reward offerings prior to the end of the project we will not add more on the fly. This will help us stay within our capabilities, our budget, and the timeline for delivery. You don't have to look far for other projects that overextend; which only ties up more backers' money and delays delivery. \n3. Your comments and feedback are REALLY important to us. If you have an idea, concern, or compliment, please share it with us! We can't promise to implement every idea that comes our way, but we will certainly consider each one! \n4.

Featuring unique components like LED pointers built into each miniature's base to provide instantaneous line of sight as well as physical buildings to provide cover and a rooftop level. \nBetween the 20 minute missions, players spend their hard-earned rewards on upgrading their mechs and equipment. Construct your mech according to your play-style and team role. Over the course of the campaign, teams will strive to accomplish objectives for their faction to reclaim the earth.\n  We are excited to bring the first real time combat board game to the public.  This campaign has been designed to provide substantial benefits to the KS backers primarily through lower costs. Backers will also receive priority delivery and some exclusive rewards. The goal is publicly launch this game August 2017 at GenCon with backers  receiving their rewards a month or two earlier. \n          A destroyed Earth is recovering from a millennia of war. The vast clouds of radiation and deadly contaminants are receding, revealing long abandoned cities and industrial centers. The surviving factions of humanity now race to claim these areas\u2019 resources, valuable salvage and advanced tech. Some to rebuild civilization, some to dominate it.\n A True RTS Board Game - No Dice, No Turns, No Waiting  \nMech Command RTS is the first real time strategy board game of its kind. Move your mech and support units at the same time as your opponents and team-mates. The basic mechanics are simple: call shots on your enemies when you have line of sight, then spend energy to activate weapons to destroy them. But the tactical choices grow deep as you attempt to accomplish a wide range of objectives.\n20 Minute Missions - Week Long Campaigns  \nMech Command RTS is a campaign style game. This means the missions are played separately but are linked together to form an ongoing game that can be played over the course of days or weeks. The core set includes a mission pack with a 12 mission branching campaign with each mission\u2019s parameters changing substantially. Within a mission, players might compete to mine resources with their support units, destroy the opponents' forward base, carry salvage to drop zones, activate up-link points and more.  \nCompletion of objectives brings currency, prestige and access to advanced tech. Thus players evolve and grow stronger over time. The campaign winner is the first team to collect the victory requirements of their faction; a unique combination of successful missions, prestige, resources and tech. But those rewards must often be spent along the way to stay competitive. Do you bank your rewards for campaign victory, or invest them into better equipment now?\nElegant Customization & Action Tracking\nThe player's mech sheet and cards serve as their control panel throughout missions. Energy gems are placed on the mech sheet to move, and onto the cards to activate weapons, boosters and equipment. This auto-tracks every action that is performed and allows players to clarify any questions that might arise.The elegant slot system streamlines the intense customization of the video games; making it accessible to casual and new players while providing depth for hard core strategists.\nOver a Hundred Unique Weapons, Boosters and Equipment Items\nThe equipment and weapon cards have been designed to have their key stats read-able from across the table and each plays differently. The activation costs, ammo type, recharge rate and overheat levels of each piece of equipment adjusts how quickly and how often it can be used. For example. some weapons can burst down an opponent but take a long time to recharge, while others provide steady damage over time. Specialty weapons abound; energy blades are devastating but require melee range, wire-guided missiles can be fired around corners while some ultimate weapons exhaust a mech's ammo supply in one shot.\n Physical Customization\nSwap out your arm and weapon sets between mechs to better represent your load out. Remove arms when they are destroyed to represent damage. Legs in particular have a large impact on gameplay and so are represented physically with interchangeable models. Reverse jointed mechs for example, have bonuses to booster movement (and usually reduced armor) while mechs from the tank category can plow through buildings but cannot boost to the rooftop level.\nThese high quality miniatures have been designed by a team of sculptors led by Sergey Kolesnik and Galen Tingle. \nBattle on the Streets and Rooftops  \nThe buildings of Mech Command block line of sight and create 2 levels of play on the map; ground and rooftop. Only special weapons can target between levels so boosting to the rooftops can provide a temporary respite from fire; at least until an enemy pursues you to the higher level. Light armored scouts often traverse the map by rooftop alone, flanking their opponents and assassinating support units.\nDestructible Environments  \nOn many maps, players can also destroy buildings, so eventually your perch may be shot out from underneath you. As more buildings are destroyed sight lines increase and mechs become increasingly exposed, making missions more dangerous the longer they last.\nSmooth & Steady - One Final Note  \nThis board game condenses into 20 minute missions what takes traditional strategy games hours. Despite this, Mech Command RTS is not a frantic game; it has been designed from the ground up to provide smooth and steady game play. Quick reflexes are not required!\nWe will be updating the KickStarter campaign page with several tutorials, gameplay videos and rules. The initial tutorial covers all the basics you would teach a new player to start playing.\n    www.TheBoardGameFamily.com review\n        Text-Based Core Set Rules\n  Every add-on available during the KickStarter incorporates substantial additions to the core game-play. They do not just represent more miniatures but also advanced mechanics and rules, as well as their requisite components.\nTo reserve an add-on just add the amount to your pledge! Alternatively you can reserve every add-on and expansion in one stroke by pledging for the Ultimate Bundle. We are not adding a lot of add-ons as ensuring our delivery date is the highest priority.

WILL be available eventually at retail but without the unique add-on models. \n Play Solo or with a Team against the A.I. The cooperative expansion adds new rules, missions and components designed to allow players to challenge the game itself. Using a special A.I. card deck enemy units are given behavior patterns and target priorities when they are produced. This rule-set features 3 categories of enemies each with their own unique mechanics; automated turrets, seeker drones and AM's (automated mechs).

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This will allow us to provide specific shipping costs rather than one-size-fits-all rates. We will ship your rewards at our cost to Amazon warehouses in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany and Hong Kong.\nFollowing is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4.5 kg). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.  We will ship to other countries not listed here; the rates will be typical of what you normally pay for a similar weight package from one of our hub countries. \nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. \n$24 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  \nUK: $12-$15  \nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.  \nAUSTRALIA: $14-$22  \nEUROPE: $12 to Germany. $15-$30 to most other countries.\nKS BACKER GUARANTEE: Every backer will receive their rewards before the game enters normal distribution.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this is Bad Crow Games first campaign, key members of the team helped publish Serpent's Tongue, Sakura and have sourced products from over-seas manufacturers before. \n\nWe have applied every hard won lesson from these previous projects while developing Mech Command RTS and feel confident in our delivery date of July 2017. As most experienced board game publishers will tell you there are always some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, especially due to: Production delays, Shipping delays and Customs delays. \n\nThese are our strategies to avoid those: \n\n1. Samples in hand. One of the key lessons we have implemented to help reduce the above risks and ensure delivery is obtaining final samples of as many components as possible prior to launching this campaign, including the miniatures, buildings, cards, LED bases, gems etc... This is why many of the game images above are actual photographs of final or near final samples from the manufacturers. Some stretch rewards may require additional design or sampling, so an extra 4 months after the has been allotted to cover this need. \n\n2. Quality Assurance. We have a full time sourcing liaison in Hong Kong that will be interacting with the factory throughout the process and will be physically present for Quality Assurance checks as the components come off the line. She speaks fluent English, Mandarin and Cantonese. She has already lined up safety & product certification services. \n\n3. Customs brokers and Amazon distribution hubs. We have already obtained broker services for each of our international distribution hubs. We are utilizing Amazon warehouses around the world for shipping all rewards. We have worked with Fulfillment by Amazon extensively before and we love this company's professionalism, speed, tracking and returns service. \n\n4. 60 Day Buffer. Our schedule includes an extra 60 day buffer to help account for any unforeseen delays. \n\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe will refund your pledge, no questions asked, until 30 days AFTER REWARDS SHIP. Backers will be able to return rewards to the closest Amazon warehouse. \n\nThe amount refunded varies depending on the time frame:\n\n0-60 days after the end of the campaign: 100% refunded. \n\n60 days on: 92% refunded (this is because of the approximately 8% and processing fees that are non-refundable past this point).\n\nUp to 30 days after you receive your rewards: 92% refunded plus you may be required to pay for the Amazon return shipping label, this will be decided on a case by case basis. \n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nWe will send a confirmation email survey approximately 90 days after the end of the the campaign . For final distribution we will use a 3rd party pledge manager. \n\nBy pledging to this, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards are subject to change and may differ moderately from what is presented while the project is active. \n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

All signs and portents point to this momentous night, and you and your siblings of shadow stand ready. Your cult has sacrificed much - and many - to prepare the ceremony to awaken the dread god whose name twists your tongue and whose dark purpose twists your mind. But this night is one of great power, and your lodge is not the only one who seeks to harness that power. Other cultists prepare similar yet horribly different ceremonies, and investigators roam the streets and locales of Arkham, seeking to stop the inevitable annihilation. You must strike now, before a cult of a different old one ushers in their own maddening end times. In your hands lies the Fate of the Elder Gods!\nIn Fate of the Elder Gods, 1-4 players take on the ever-maddening role of cults trying to summon ancient evil and herald the fall of mankind! Each cult is competing to be first to summon their god, but they must also repel intrepid investigators working to seal off the gate to beyond with Elder Signs. Gather arcane artifacts, cast powerful spells, embrace the Dark Gift of your Elder God, and be first to awaken your dread master... before it's too late!\nDuring the game, players use a variable hand of spell cards to aid their cult in their mission. Use a spell's Astral Symbol to navigate the areas around Arkham on the unique Fate Clock board, and activate symbols in a location's Astral Column to ready powerful spells. Readied spells can be cast at any time and their Astral Symbols aid in readying future spells while in a cult's Spell Reserve, creating an engine for harnessing even greater power.\nAs cults travel to the six locations on the Fate Clock, they activate specific powerful abilities, such as gaining useful artifacts at The Museum or enabling their Elder God's Dark Gift at The Ceremony. As a cult sends more and more cultists to a location, they can take control of that location, gaining far more powerful abilities. However, cults must be careful when navigating Arkham, as a location with lots of activity will attract pesky investigators. Tempt fate too many times and the investigators may raid your cult's lodge, place Elder Signs, and forestall the summoning of your Elder God. If a cult gains too many Elder Signs, it's game over!\nIf any cult manages to raise their Summon Track to 9 before the investigators save humanity, their Elder God awakens and they win! Of course, \"win\" is a relative term as it will certainly herald the end of the world, or at least destroy Arkham, but that's a small price to pay for eternal servitude to the Ancient Ones.\n  Fate of the Elder Gods comes with a beautiful Fate Clock board, custom screen-printed dice, cards and panels for spells, curses, and more, and over 100 gorgeous miniatures! Here's a complete run-down:\n19 inch by 22 inch (480x550mm) custom-cut, quad-fold playing board\n80 sculpted plastic Cultists (in 4 player colors - purple, green, yellow, and black)\n25 sculpted plastic Investigators\n2 sculpted plastic Cthulhu Fate Piece markers\n65 Euro mini-sized Spell cards with linen finish\n20 square Artifact cards with linen finish\n20 Euro mini-sized Curse cards with linen finish\n16 Euro mini-sized Gate cards with linen finish\n8 player reference cards\n8 Elder God Lodge boards in fine card stock (Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep, Tsatthogua, Bokrug, Ithaqua, Atlach-Nacha, Hastur)\n8 Elder God Selection cards\n10 custom resin dice\n4 wooden Summon Track tokens (in 4 player colors)\n40 thick punchboard Elder Signs\n6 thick punchboard Squall tokens (for Ithaqua's Dark Gift)\n18-page full color glossy rulebook\n  From the very start of this project, we all envisioned a top-notch production that would make the game wholly immersive for every player. Drawing inspiration from older classics like Twilight Imperium 3 and newer games such as Blood Rage, we turned to the talented team of artist Jorge Ramos and veteran sculptor Chad Hoverter to create some truly awesome minis to represent the Cultists, Investigators, and the impressive Fate Piece for Fate of the Elder Gods.\nWe wanted a very distinctive Cultist for the base sculpt. Since we were going to be basing the Fate Piece around Lovecraftian-classic Elder God Cthulhu, Jorge chose to entwine the two designs and craft the cult's tall hood around the kraken-esque crest from his Cthulhu sculpt. The tentacle embellishments on the sleeves and hoods just make this Cultist even more awesome, and Chad executed it all perfectly.\nWe gave Jorge some 20s, 30s, and 40s fashion directives, but this rendition of the plucky Investigator is all his vision. Chad added his distinctive flair to really bring this sculpt of the woman of action and investigation to life.\nOur only direction to Jorge for this Fate Piece statue was to take Cthulhu in a unique direction. His vision of a kraken-like Cthulhu complete with spiky carapace certainly set it apart from the typical bulbous-headed predecessors. Chad added his signature dramatic flair, making this statue even more menacing.\n  There are a lot of cool things about Fate of the Elder Gods, but the heart of it all is the Fate Clock game board. Cults will use spells to move the Fate Piece around the Clock to a location, activating that spot's special action and - if they happen to have control - an extra action that can grant a huge boon. The physical Fate Clock will be a custom-cut quad-fold board that will have an amazing presence on any gaming table.\n    If videos aren't your thing, or you'd like to delve deeper into how to play Fate of the Elder Gods, download and peruse the latest version of the preliminary rules that were provided to our playtesters and reviewers right here!\nYou can also watch a full game of Fate of the Elder Gods played by the designers at Gen Con 2016!\n  \"Fate of the Elder Gods is one of the best games I have ever designed. It is a work far greater than I would have achieved alone because I believe teaming up with Darrell and Chris brought out the best ideas from each of us, making the whole much greater than any of the individual parts, and creating a game experience far beyond my initial vision.\" - Richard Launius, co-designer of Fate of the Elder Gods\nReview of Fate of the Elder Gods by Joel Eddy of Drive Thru Review!\n Review of Fate of the Elder Gods by Kevin and Melissa of Tantrum House!\n\"I had a ton of fun playing Fate of the Elder Gods and was looking forward to more plays during the convention. I was faced with tough decision like whether I wanted to use spell cards for movement or try to ready them for use, to use my readied spells or save them to add to my pool of symbols to ready more spells, should I activate a location with an action I desperately wanted to take or one with symbols that will allow me to ready a spell I really wanted to have on hand. There definitely seemed to be different paths to victory and tons of replayability due to the variety of Elder God\u2019s to choose from. I will definitely be backing the Kickstarter and eagerly await another chance to summon an Elder God and bring about the fall of mankind.\" - Dan Licata, review on BoardGameGeek.com\n\"I played a four player and two player game with the near-final prototype. The unique abilities of each elder god really mixes up the strategies and makes you approach the game differently each time. This variable play, mixed with a solid core of mechanics and an epic end game, makes Fate of the Elder Gods a great game.\" - Bryan Fischer, Nevermore Games\nFate of the Elder Gods is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\n      This 3-foot x 3-foot vinyl playmat can bring even more awesomeness to your gaming sessions of Fate of the Elder Gods! If you'd like to add this playmat to your pledge, simply add an additional $39 to your pledge level and we will clarify your order after the campaign concludes. Please note that any pledges for the ELDER GOD pledge level include the playmat, so you can get all the things for $199!\nAchieving our base funding goal will ensure that Greater Than Games will be able to publish Fate of the Elder Gods at the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of Fate of the Elder Gods is priced according to our initial funding goal; if we are able to exceed that then we can afford to upgrade some game components and add in a lot of other really cool stuff... including monsters! The Mi-Go and Ghatanothoa mentioned below will not be in the retail base game; if we unlock enough stretch goals beyond them, though, we can produce a whole beastly expansion that Kickstarter backers will get for free! \n     Every backer of Fate of the Elder Gods will receive the special promotional Elder God, Azathoth, not included in the retail version of the game. As the ruler of the Outer Gods, Azathoth's greatness is reflected in the special passive ability of his Dark Gift - Elder Signs only make him more powerful! When serving Azathoth you'll be begging other Cults to visit the Streets of Arkham and send those pesky Investigators your way to Hasten Doom!\nBackers at the Cultist level and above will also receive the special pack of promotional Cult cards that grant even more powers from your Ancient One!\nThese cards can be optionally added to any game. There is a Cult card for every god in the base game, as well as Cult cards for Azathoth and any of the gods that are unlocked through stretch goals. There are even a couple of unaligned Cult cards for even more variety! This promotional pack will not be available in retail and is a little something special to say thanks for supporting the Kickstarter.\nDark Gift\nBackers at the Dark Gift pledge level will receive a special hardcover book, Forbidden Lore: Uncovering Fate of the Elder Gods, filled with over 50 glossy, full-color pages of awesome Lovecraftian goodness! Inside this tome you'll find a ton of behind-the-scenes information on the art production process, including preliminary sketches and final pieces for the locations, miniatures, Elder God portraits, and more. You'll also uncover the literary histories of the Elder Gods and more deep facts about the history of Arkham and its mysteries. Forbidden Lore will include three of the designers' personal favorite Lovecraft stories - The Whisperer in Darkness, At The Mountains of Madness, and The Shadow Over Innsmouth - with special illustrations!\n Elder God\nBackers at the Elder God pledge level will receive the book, Forbidden Lore: Uncovering Fate of the Elder Gods, as well as a copy of Fate of the Elder Gods signed and numbered by designers Richard Launius, Darrell Louder, and Chris Kirkman! Backers will also receive the special 3-foot x 3-foot vinyl playmat, and two limited edition, 24\" x 36\" canvas prints of the art pieces for The Ceremony and Streets of Arkham, signed and numbered by artist Nolan Nasser!\n  Fate of the Elder Gods is truly a project of passion, born from a group of creators who not only have a love of boardgames but also a love for the Lovecraftian lore that surrounds the game.\nCall him the Duke of Dice, the Titan of Theme, or just King Launius; Richard has been designing and championing boardgames that tell good stories for 30 years, ever since his classic hit Arkham Horror was first released in 1987. Richard is known for his other great game designs, such as Defenders of the Realm, Elder Sign, Dragon Rampage, Cthulhu's Vault - a Lovecraft storytelling game, and more.\nDarrell is a graphic designer, multimedia director, father, science geek, grilling enthusiast, and game designer from Dover, Delaware. Darrell counts himself blessed; his best-selling first design, the chemistry game Compounded, is currently in its fourth printing, and his baseball game, Bottom of the 9th, is already headed to its third. His former knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos was fairly limited, but now considers himself an expert by osmosis after developing Fate of the Elder Gods with Richard and Chris.\nChris was born with boardgames in his blood and has been designing and developing games - both digital and analog - for over 30 years. Chris is founder of Dice Hate Me Games, and serves as Game Development Director at Greater Than Games, where he scouts for new and awesome things and then helps to make them even awesomer. The only thing he loves as much as gaming is the Cthulhu Mythos, so this project is a dream come true.\nNolan\u2019s career in board game illustration is relatively young, but the pure passion for his craft has quickly made him a rising star. Nolan has worked with the Greater Than Games team on three past projects - Spirit Island, New Bedford, and Exoplanets - using his talents for digital painting to craft those gaming worlds. Nolan is responsible for crafting the landscapes in Fate of the Elder Gods, creating the art for the Fate Clock locations, as well as the gorgeous game cover.\nJorge is a concept artist from Madrid, Spain with an incredible talent for character illustration. Jorge worked with the Greater Than Games team on Spirit Island, creating the incredible visages of the island's many protector spirits, and did character design for the ship captains and salty sea-dogs of New Bedford as well. Jorge is responsible for the character and monster concept sketches for miniature sculpting reference, as well as the awesome Elder Gods illustrations.\nChad is a veteran miniature sculptor from Dallas, Texas who has been a part of many projects in the boardgame world. Some of his most recent and well-known projects are sculpts for Mice & Mystics, Tailfeathers, and Specter Ops. He is, of course, responsible for all the sculpts in Fate of the Elder Gods, including the monsters... provided we fund high enough!\nFor US and Canadian backers, we are offering free shipping.

Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect.

For hundreds of years this historical event has held races of different kinds of boat, the most popular being the Gondolini Regatta, the Gondola Race! In this challenging race the gondoliers of Venice take to the canals with the cheers of local supporters and visitors alike to see who is the greatest of their number. Great spoils and fame await the winner...and the coveted title of Canal Master!\nIn Gondola, each player becomes a gondolier racing to be the first through five checkpoints hidden in the maze of canals throughout Venice in an attempt to win the coveted title of Canal Master!\nGondola is a fast-paced tile placement game of racing for 2-5 players. All the information you need to play is on the tiles!\nThe game begins with the designated start tiles already in play which reveal only part of the Gondola racecourse. Players then take turns placing additional canal tiles over the course of play, revealing more and more of the winding lagoon. Players are never quite sure what the route will be and where it will take them. The tiles are designed to work together, so you end up building a beautiful map of Venice along the way!\nUse cunning strategy and pivotal selections to outrace your opponents and become Canal Master. The winner is the player to reach 5 checkpoints first. So grab your remo and prepare to push your way to victory!\n  Gondola's large tiles are beautiful pieces of art where details pop.\n When connected during play, they create lovely cityscapes of Venice.\nPledge for the Kickstarter Exclusive Deluxe Edition of Gondola with these awesome upgrades and additions!\n  You can be a part of making Gondola so much better!

Tiles will also be the upgraded 2mm thickness. The tile/component bag is large at 8 inches tall and sporting a \"perfect for tiles\" 5.5 x 5.5 inch SQUARE BOTTOM!\nStack the Canal Tiles inside the bag during the game! \nGondola is played over a series of player turns with little downtime. Turns consist of three phases; the Place Phase, Race Phase, and Draw Phase.

You do this by playing cards face-down from your hand and declaring what they are, then giving one other player a choice to decide if you are bluffing or telling the truth. If they choose correctly, THEY get the Farm Animal card(s) you played, but if they guess wrong, YOU get the card instead. Whoever wins Farm Animal cards adds them to their collection. But you may also get Crows, pests that irritate Farmer Brown and count against you in the scoring. If you are a terrible fibber, then we have the solution for you! You are allowed to make the animal noise of the animal you are \"claiming,\" we have found that gets everyone laughing.\n   Setup:\n 1.) Place the 5 Animal Bonus cards in order of value (Cow, Pig, Sheep, Goat, Chicken).\n2.) Place the Set Bonus cards in a stack on the table.\n3.) Place 1 Robber and 1 Excuse Me Token in the middle of the table, face-down, for each player in the game and mix them up. (A 3 player game would have 3 Robber and 3 Excuse Me Tokens in the middle)\n4.) Everyone draws a Token, looks at it, and then keeps it secret.\n5.) Now add the Scarecrow Token, face-down, to the tokens in the middle and mix them up.\n6.) Shuffle the Farm Animal deck and deal out cards according to the number of players: 6 cards to each player for a 2-4 player game, 5 cards to each player for a 5-6 player game.\n7.) Remove 8 random cards from the deck and return them to the box.\n8.) Select the First Player (the last person to have visited a farm) and begin!\n       Actions to take during your turn:\nPick a player, pass them a card(s), and claim an animal.

Each of those goals we achieve will add another ENHANCEMENT to Fire of Eidolon. Some of these Enhancements will behave like traditional Stretch Goals which most are familiar with, but some will be different. The following is a list of the current Enhancements ready to unlock!  \nCurrent Stretch Goal Quests: \n          SOCIAL MEDIA SIDE QUEST:\nCurrent total: 2040!

Distributor/Manufacturer may collaboratively ship some rewards from other countries to save on shipping and customs costs.\nDelivering Your Reward Responsibly\nOur number one goal and responsibility is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for as soon as possible. Magic Meeple Games and its partners have years of collective experience overseeing planning and production to ensure Fire of Eidolon well be delivered to all backers in a timely manner. We ran into a speed bump with Darkrock Ventures but it is manufactured is likely to be in backers' hands before the conclusion of the Fire of Eidolon campaign. We have also taken measures to prevent the same delays from happening again. The bottom line is that Darkrock Ventures was produced and paid for on time, and while it has taken longer than we anticipated to deliver, it will deliver, and is doing so as we speak, and that is something we can all be proud of. \nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, just as much every pledge makes a difference, regardless of amount. Unfortunately shipping costs are something we all have to face, we have learned more about shipping and distribution and our service providers have become more creative in ways to save money. We are proud to offer FLAT RATE, CUSTOMS-FRIENDLY shipping available WORLDWIDE!\nOh, and that part about \"Flat Rate\"? We mean it, this time... it's really flat.\nOrder any amount of copies of FoE and only pay shipping on ONE!\nAdding additional copies of Fire of Eidolon will not incur additional shipping charges in this campaign. We are going to discount every pledge down to charging shipping on only the first copy of Fire of Eidolon in each order!*\n*Shipping price is for delivery of one entire order to a single address.\n*Residents of Brazil, Russia, and South America take note: to ensure your package is delivered, additional charges may be required to ensure delivery verification in certain regions of these countries. If these additional charges are not paid, the chances of lost packages in those regions increases sharply and our distributor is attempting to implement solutions to this problem. If you reside in any of these countries please inquire about your pledge before the end of the campaign as the $10 basic shipping charge cannot guarantee delivery in these countries.\nRegarding Customs: Our shipping partner, Ship Naked, offers what they call \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping\" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. While we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in Ship Naked's ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. We have had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. Pledge with Confidence!\nAfter the Kickstarter campain ends, we will use PledgeManager to manage your orders and give everyone one last opportunity to add on to their pledge. There are no separate Add-Ons during the Kickstarter campaign, only the pledge levels. \nIf you'd like to add additional copies of the game to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, or if you would like access to the special FoE Backer price on our previous project, Darkrock Ventures, you will be able to do so within PledgeManager after this Kickstarter campaign ends. (PledgeManager will charge backers separately for any additional add-ons beyond what was pledged for in the Kickstarter.)\n  Forget to order that extra copy for your friend?

It is prone to many surprises and problems even for experienced publishers. Fortunately our team is comprised of exceptionally experienced and talented individuals, with years of expertise in Game Design, Game Development, Print Publishing, Product Manufacturing, Project Fulfillment, Art, Technical Documentation, Retailer Support, Retail & Online Sales, Technology Support, and Graphics Design. \n\nWe co-published our first project, Darkrock Ventures, with the collaboration of the exceptionally experienced Gamelyn Games, and that project was a SUCCESS. We at Magic Meeple Games are proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have even more experience and knowledge in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nOur first project fell a few months short of our target Shipping date, we have identified several contributing factors to that delay and have actively made improvements in our process to prevent the likelihood of such delays happening again. Here are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done even more extensive pre-production for Fire of Eidolon than our last project. More of the Art and Graphic design was handled in-house for this project and we eliminated opportunities for this aspect of the project to cause delays. Portions of the project which we will be handling with the help of contractors is in process already and in many ways, already complete. We are better prepared this time around to go to print right after the campaign than we were for Darkrock Ventures, and pending the Enhancements (Stretch Goals, etc.) we will be able to produce and ship with a more realistic target turnaround. \n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturing industry veterans Gamelyn Games, among others, have used to create their previous projects. This is the same manufacturer with whom we worked for Darkrock Ventures. We have a great relationship with their team and we are now even more familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods, freight arrangements, and customs fees. Together, we have accomplished great things and we know that Fire of Eidolon will be just as outstanding!\n\n3. Professional distribution is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled once again by Ship Naked. They have been responsible for the fulfillment of previous Gamelyn Games/Magic Meeple Games titles. All of which were delivered reliably and professionally. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual, and customer service minded. They are responsible for our new shipping schedule, with is now even MORE cost-effective for backers outside the USA!\n\nDuring the manufacturing of Darkrock Ventures there was a technology failure that caused a delay. Things such as this sometimes cannot be helped no matter how prepared you may be. No project is immune to the possible mishap, but this road is familiar to us, our distributor, and our manufacturer (who made up for it by upgrading DRV's box for us!) and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. \n\nThank you for your confidence and support!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to customer service and backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nWe will be present DAILY during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! We couldn't do it without you! Look what we accomplished together with DRV!

What's a CCG Simulator? It's a board game about the entire CCG Experience. You play as a group of friends who are collecting a popular CCG, Millennium Blades, by opening packs, selling on the aftermarket, trading with friends, and winning tournaments. You'll go from starter decks to world champion all over the course of a 2-3 hour game session!\nMillennium Blades is an extremely ambitious game, consisting of over 700 cards and 300 unique illustrations. We were very nervous about how the game would fare in the board gaming community. Would it resonate with the experience of CCG players from around the world, or would it just be too crazy?\nWithin 48 hours of its launch, Millennium Blades was completely sold out from our warehouse, making it the most successful title launch we've ever had at Level 99 Games. The reception to the game has been overwhelmingly positive, with incredible praise coming from all across the spectrum of reviewers and players.\nMillennium Blades is a huge game. It's a game that could only exist with Kickstarter, and it's simply too big for us to reprint without doing another Kickstarter project.\nWe would like to invite you to join us in bringing a second printing of Millennium Blades to life, so we can share this great game with players who missed it the first time around! For fans that want to get involved but already have Millennium Blades, we've created some very cool new mini-expansions that can be used with the game!\nWe expect the new printing of Millennium Blades to arrive in November, alongside the first major expansion, Set Rotation.\nPlease note, this project is to fund a direct reprint of Millennium Blades. There will be no changes between the first and second printings of the game. However, the Set Rotation Expansion will contain some updated cards and rules clarifications.\nRead reviews and discuss Millennium Blades on BoardGameGeek!\n  \"This brilliant, demanding, glorious monster of a game combines all of the disparate parts of CCGs... Millennium Blades truly captures the essence of what makes collectible card games so much fun to buy, sell, trade, and play while still feeling wholly unique. 9.5 AMAZING\" - Travis Williams, TechRaptor.net\n\"Millennium Blades is a game about a game, one of the most meta things I\u2019ve ever played, not to mention utterly magical in how it transports its players to a simpler time, when a rare foil card might be the highlight of the week and cards were freely traded between friends. For those who love games and the people who play them, I cannot recommend it enough.\" - Dan Thurot, Space Biff\n\"An ambitious idea distilled into an accessible game of equal parts clever design, evolving game play, and tongue-in-cheek fun... What is there to say about a game that does exactly what it sets out to do, and does it with the Level 99 patented elegance and excess... 9.9\" - Hai Kulture\n\"Millennium Blades was clearly a labor of love for the designer and publisher and represents a most beautiful ode to geek culture... It is frantic and fun and can feel chaotic at times, but it is actually full of strategic and tactical decision points to challenge and engage players. Between the fun and the strategy, I can't see myself parting with this stunning achievement of a game EVER! SO MUCH LOVE! I could play this all day!\" - Mina's Fresh Cardboard\n\"The people who like this will likely love it. I really enjoyed this, and I'm really looking forward to playing it again. SEAL OF EXCELLENCE.\" - Tom Vasel, Dice Tower Reviews\n\"This thing is glorious in a lot of ways... I would recommend this highly to anyone who has played a TCG ever.\" - Joel Eddy, Drive Thru Review\n\"Millennium Blades is no collectible card game, but it perfectly encapsulates the feel of collecting, trading and competing in the world of a competitive CCG. It's both frantic fun, and thoughtful, deep tactical play... a perfect score: 6/6. So far, easily my top game of 2016!\" - Sean Ramirez, The Dukes of Dice Podcast\n\"Its deck building is compelling, its tournaments exciting, and with a nearly endless array of card combinations and set permutations, to say that game has immense variety would be an understatement... It's turned out to be one of my favorite games this year, both with my personal interest and as a clever, original game. 5/5\" - Ryan LaFlamme, Cardboard Republic\n\"As a lover of CCGs, I have played a lot in my day. Not so much now, though. It is a hole in my life really. Millennium Blades really scratches that itch. Actually it comes along, massages in a nice soothing balm, sings you a sweet little song and BOOM, you forgot the itch existed. This CCG simulator is thrilling, fast placed, innovative, and just a down right bucket of fun. As a matter of fact, I do not want to even talk about it any more, I just want to play it.\" - Robb, Blue Peg Pink Peg Board Gaming Podcast\n\"Millennium Blades is one of the most fun & clever games that we've played. We can't wait to play it more!\" - Edward Uhler, Heavy Cardboard Podcast\n\"The crazy fools have only gone and done it. It shouldn\u2019t work, it really shouldn\u2019t, but it does like gangbusters... ridiculously wild fun the work of a deranged genius... a contender for me of my game of the year 2016.\" - Mike B, Who Dares Rolls\n\"If you\u2019re like me, and you love CCGs but don\u2019t have the time anymore, this game is for you. If you\u2019re not sure whether you like CCGs, but this sounds like fun, this game is for you.\" - Chris Wilczewski, Geek On Anything\nSince Millennium Blades has been out on the market, there are a bunch of great reviews and tutorials to be found on youtube!\nMy favorite explanation of the game is still the preview EphFive did for us last year.

Check it out here!\n           Wizard of Legend is a fast paced dungeon crawler with rogue-like elements where you assume the role of a powerful wizard intent on overcoming the Chaos Trials to become the next Wizard of Legend.\n   Exploration of the dungeons is a seamless experience as you travel from one room to the next in search of powerful spells and items to aid you on your quest. All of the dungeon layouts are procedurally generated and are comprised of both randomly generated rooms as well as precrafted experiences. Enemy placement is also handled procedurally and enemies will gain new behaviors and spells of their own as you progress further into the game. In addition, each dungeon contains other would-be allies that will help you on your adventure.\n   Combat in Wizard of Legend is a blend of rapid movement and magic that involves chaining spells together to defeat enemies while quickly repositioning to avoid incoming attacks. The use of dashing spells is key in allowing you to control the pace of combat by staying at an optimal range to cast spells at enemies near and far.\nFor more information on chaining spells, check out our update!\n   Wizard of Legend will also feature local multiplayer game modes for cooperative and versus experiences. Co-op mode will throw two players into a more challenging adventure while Versus mode will pit them head to head in a match of intense magical combat.\nTLDR: Fast paced spell based action.\n  For the purposes of better illustrating the game mechanics and lore in Wizard of Legend, we've created a game... about the game, just for the Kickstarter Campaign! The game doesn't represent the final product, but will introduce you to the world of Wizard of Legend in a fun and interactive way.\nThis demo is a short 10-15 minute experience that takes place after the timeline of Wizard of Legend and is shown from a more modern perspective where the events of the game are now studied as an important part of history. In the Museum of Lanova's Chaos Trials exhibit, you can experience a few of the spells and challenges that will be present in Wizard of Legend.\nDisclaimer: Though this demo features the gameplay and combat mechanics of Wizard of Legend, it is a completely separate experience from the game.

Play it!\n  Every year, the most powerful and skilled wizards from around the world compete in the Chaos Trials for a chance to become the next Wizard of Legend.\nYou assume the role of one of these wizards, each with their own elemental specialization and choice of arcana. Arcana are magical tools that are created in the form of cards and are used to rapidly cast preset spells.\n     While these wizards normally have a plethora of arcana at their disposal, the rules and regulations limit them to begin the trials with just two arcana of their choosing. As such, their starting choices are usually their most favored and effective arcana.\n   Additionally, wizards that participate in the Chaos Trials are required to possess a powerful signature variant of their chosen arcana. These signature arcana are a testament to their magical aptitude as they can only be developed through a lifetime of training and mastery. Use of a signature arcana also requires an excessive amount of magical energy and can only be performed once enough energy has been accumulated.\nFor more information on signature arcana, check out our update!\n   Although you begin the game with only a couple arcana, you\u2019ll find many more to add to your deck as you progress through the trials. However, given that you can only have a limited number equipped at any given time, selecting arcana that complement each other and match your play style is the key to success.\nTLDR: You're a wizard. Surprise!\n  While raw chaos is at the core of all magic, manipulating chaos directly to produce spells is a difficult and time consuming process involving strenuous magical focus and gestures. Spell crafting Virtuosos quickly realized this problem and created an elegant solution that came in the form of Arcana.\n      Arcana are hand crafted trumps that have been traced with a preset spell and imbued with an element refined from raw chaos. Their creation allows for wizards to rapidly produce spells by simply channelling their magical energy through them.\n   Arcana are generally created with a specific element and spell effect in mind. While the element selected is almost always limited to one of the base elements, the effects are much more diverse as many different Virtuosos have created a wide variety of arcana with different effects. It is estimated that since their first creation, over 100 different types of arcana have been created.\n   Acquired only as a reward for overcoming the Chaos Trials, Chaos Arcana are extremely rare, given that the only known Virtuoso capable of crafting them is the Head of the Magical Council of Lanova. Even their use is said to be limited exclusively to exceptionally skillful wizards due to the magical finesse required to control the resulting spells. However, given that no other Virtuoso has been able to craft arcana that produces spells of raw chaos, many of the details revolving around the Chaos Arcana and their effects remain a mystery.\nTLDR: Arcana = Spells. Pew pew!\n  Every year in the City of Lanova, the Council of Magic, comprised of the most powerful wizards in the world, holds the Chaos Trials to determine if there are any worthy of becoming a Wizard of Legend.\n   These trials are held in Lanova Castle, where each council member shapes a section of the castle into a labyrinth filled with hazards and challenging enemies. The contestant that successfully navigates all of the challenges and demonstrates superior wizardry earns the right to become a Wizard of Legend!\n   As council members conjure and fashion the castle as they see fit, the stages that they create often reflect both their personalities and elemental affinities. And although the floor layouts are changed for every trial, each member tends to have favorite rooms or hallways that they may be inclined to reuse.\n    The enemies summoned by the architecting member also mirror their element and are often imbued with magical elemental abilities. To further add to the challenge, as contestants acquire new arcana and items, enemies will also be summoned with new abilities and equipment.\nFor more information on enemy progression, check out our update!\nTLDR: There's a tournament. Win.\n  Relics are rare magical items that were crafted and employed by powerful wizards of the past to enhance their magical abilities.\n   Each relic is unique and may have any number of effects, whether it be enhancing the use of arcana directly or having other more subtle effects.\n   However, while most relics were crafted to be beneficial to their owners, some are said to come at a cost for their use. Even worse still, some relics are rumored to carry a curse, having extremely detrimental effects on their owners.\n   Although it would be expected that these unique magical relics would be difficult to come across, such is not the case as relic vendors often attend the Chaos Trials where contestants pay high prices for a competitive edge.\n   Relics can also be found in oddly placed treasure chests which are rumored to be have been placed by a kind hearted, yet eccentric, council member.\nFor more information on relics, check out our update!\nTLDR: Relics are good! Sometimes.\nAt present time, all digital copies will be delivered via Steam Key and a free Steam Account will be required to play the game. If any other distribution options are added in the future, possibly a DRM free option or a digital console release, backers will of course have the option to select which of the options they prefer.\n    Contingent99 is a small two person team and we've been working on Wizard of Legend for almost two years now. While all the funding up to this point has been out of pocket, we're coming to Kickstarter to help make our dream a reality!\nAlthough many of the core mechanics of the game have been implemented, there's still a long way to go in terms of design, content, and polish. There are many more spells, items, enemies, and even full on stages we're looking to add to the game!

As a result, many Japanese products such as copper and raw silk are collected in Yokohama for export to other countries. At the same time, the city is starting to incorporate foreign technology and culture, with even the streets becoming more modernized. In the shadow of this development was the presence of many Yokohama merchants.\nIn YOKOHAMA, each player is a merchant in the Meiji period, trying to gain fame from a successful business, and to do so they need to build a store, broaden their sales channels, learn a variety of techniques, and (of course) respond to trade orders from abroad.\nRahdo's Final Thoughts\n  Yokohama is the most exciting euro game for me (Michael Mindes) since playing Orl\u00e9ans, and I personally want a copy with all of the deluxe components.\nOur previous Backers for Orl\u00e9ans are extremely pleased with their purchase, and we want to make this deluxified style of game available again.\nThe additional cost for the deluxe components matches our cost with no additional profit, to make them and deliver to you the backer. For this reason, TMG expects to make this deluxe version only once. We will make enough for Kickstarter Backers, some replacement copies, and some convention sales.\nMan Vs Meeple Coverage\n  Upgraded Components\n  From cardboard to metal coins.\nImproved Graphic Design\n        UNLOCKED - $325,000 - Add silk screening to the silk pieces:\nUNLOCKED -  $425,000 - Upgrade Foreign Agents (mercs) to be wooden blocks with flag stickers\nWe really love YOKOHAMA at TMG, which is why we are publishing it. In fact, it is part of the reason that we worked diligently to license the game from Mr. Hayashi and Kickstart it within 7 weeks of first playing the game.\nOf course, we also really want you to buy YOKOHAMA, so I recommend you check out what others are saying.\nUndead Viking's Review:\n Thoughts From Folks At Origins\n  Yokohama is a game for 2-4 Players, and can be played in 60-90 min.\nA turn in Yokohama is very simple, you place 2-3 assistants, then Activate your President, choose to fulfill any orders you can, maybe activate a mercenary...turn over.  The beauty in this game is how much depth of play emerges from those simple choices in the game environment.\nUndead Vikings Setup and How To Play:\n In the video above Game Setup is covered until 7:40 after which game play is explained as well as details for each Area and Management Board.\nRahdo's Runthrough:\n  Click Here to read the Rulebook.\n The linked rulebook above is the current English rulebook, however TMG will be making a few edit's and changes. While the majority of the game play will stay the same, there will be a few very minor updates to the Two Player game.\nAll deluxe copies of YOKOHAMA will be pre-packaged at the factory with a layer of bubble wrap and an additional box for protection during shipping.\nWe have all had that bad shipping experience, and we don't want that to happen with your game... Depending on where you live in the world, we are getting your Deluxe YOKOHAMA to you in the best ways that we know how:\nUSA - YOKOHAMA will be shipped in bulk to Amazon, and then promptly sent out to you as a Backer.\nCANADA - YOKOHAMA will be shipped in bulk to Snakes & Lattes, and then shipped to you from them inside of Canada.\nEUROPE - YOKOHAMA will be shipped in bulk to Ideaspatcher in France (with VAT paid upon import) and then shipped to you as a Backer from France.\nAUSTRALIA - YOKOHAMA will be shipped in bulk to our shipping partner in Australia, and then shipped on to you.\nBRAZIL - YOKOHAMA shipping will be handled by our \"tandem\" publishing partner Kronos.

Each player starts with a ten-card personal deck containing gold (for buying) and weapons (for combat). Each turn you get a new hand of five cards from your personal deck. When your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile into your new deck.\nShared between all players is an 80-card Market Deck. The game begins with five cards from that deck revealed, creating the Market Row. As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions.

Fueled by military precision and an unprecedented alliance with Dragons, the Imperial Armies knew countless victories and few defeats. The Empire grew until its greatest enemy was not any of the barbarian nations to the east, but its own unmanageable size. At the frontier, victories and expansion were replaced by an endless cycle of rebellion and re-conquest. \nWeary of war, the Emperor crafted a bold new strategy: Peace through trade. One hundred and seventy years ago, he ordered the establishment of Thandar, an independent frontier trading post at the junction of the four great rivers.\nThough many argued peace with the wild tribes was impossible, trade flourished and the trading post quickly grew to a town, then into a small city, and beyond... \nHero Realms is set in the sprawling metropolis that Thandar has grown into. The city-state is now home to folk from all the species and nations of the known world. While Thandar's trade has delivered its promised peace to nations, the wealth generated by its trade spurs endless political and physical conflict amongst it's residents...\nWhile at peace with its barbarian neighbors to the east, the Empire still clings to its military traditions. Its highly-trained soldiers, reality-bending wizards, and deadly dragons comprise the best fighting force the world has ever known.\nImperial's cards will allow you to gain health, and they frequently become more powerful as you have more champions in play.\nElven kingdoms older than recorded human history, ravaging orc war hosts, savage nomadic human tribes, trolls, and deadly wild beasts can all be found in vast wild lands east of the Empire.\nWild cards can give you large amounts of combat, force your opponent to discard cards, and allow you to draw and discard to cycle quickly through your deck. \nThe fortune in trade that flows through Thandar has fueled a powerful organized crime syndicate know as \"The Guild.\" The Guild has its hand in everything from petty street crime, to bribery or blackmail of political figures, to assassinations of those who would interfere with profits.\nGuild cards will give you large amounts of gold, allow you to stun (remove from play) opposing champions without spending combat, and let you acquire cards to the top of your deck or directly into your hand.\nThe Necros cult festers in the city's underbelly, preying on the homeless, the forgotten, and any that dare challenge them. The necromancers, vampires and cultists that fill the ranks of the Necros have been granted dark powers from the demons they worship.\nYour Necros cards allow you to sacrifice cards from your hand or discard pile, culling the weak cards from your deck and improving your future draws.\nThe Art\nThe price tag for our games may be relatively small, but with all our products, White Wizard Games strives for industry leading art. Our creative director, Darwin Kastle, personally works with each artist to bring his vision to life.\n  Ordering Multiple Sets\nWe know some backers like to order multiple sets. Maybe you want to keep your set for campaigning with friends on your game shelf and have an extra copy for your back pack for pick-up games. Or maybe you want to give some as gifts.\nWhen ordering multiples sets, you only pay shipping once, so teaming up with your friends for one big order can be a great way to save on shipping.\nTo order multiple sets simply back at the highest level that you are ordering and add in the cost for the additional sets you are getting.\nFor examples, lets say you wanted to get a Character Tier and two Gamer Tiers and you live in the USA. You would back at the Character Tier level and pledge a total of $103 ($45 (Character Tier) + $8 (shipping) + $25 + $25 (2 Gamer Tiers)).  \nShipping\nWe are making some improvements based on lessons learned from our last Kickstarter campaign, most notably every shipment will be packed in a box (NO bubble mailers).\nFor those of you backing from outside of the USA, we are using Customs-Friendly shipping. Here are the details from our shipping company:\n\"Backers in the USA, Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand are all covered by Customs-Friendly by Ship Naked.\nWhen a package ships Customs-Friendly by Ship Naked, we ship it through one of our many depots around the world directly to your door. This means that if you are in a Customs-Friendly region, you should not have any additional costs for receiving your reward package (customs fees, brokerage charges, etc). We pay the import costs to the local authorities when we import into your region.\nShip Naked guarantees their Customs-Friendly service. If you are in a Customs-Friendly region and you have any additional charges for receiving your package, Ship Naked will reimburse you directly for those costs via PayPal.\"\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThese are exclusive items for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe future of Hero Realms\nJust like with our other products, after the Kickstarter campaign is complete, Hero Realms will continue to grow. We will release an ongoing campaign of cooperative adventures, with a story that takes place over time. Make your mark in an adventure that takes place in Thandar and beyond! As the story develops, the game will develop, and the characters will progress with new options that will keep the game fresh and exciting!\nFor competitive players, Hero Realms launches with all of the deep strategy featured in Star Realms. And, just like in that game, we will continue to grow the game with optional expansions that will expand the scope and the depth of gameplay options. We will also provide support for organized play so that you can battle for prizes and fame.\nThank you for your support! We love making these games and we couldn't do it without the help of Kickstarter backers like you!\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with Star Realms and Epic, our backers are going to get an awesome game, delivered quickly. Both those games were delivered on time, but there is always a risk of unforeseen delays at the printer or freight companies. \n\nThis is our most ambitious product yet. There are so many different ways to play Hero Realms: Heads-up battles, multiplayer battles, different characters, bosses, campaigns, and character development. To give you all this awesome gameplay (and it is AWESOME), we had to do a TON of design, development, graphic design and art acquisition. All of that is very expensive, and that money is already spent. We just need the Kickstarter community's help with printing costs.\n\nGiven what we have invested in this game already, there is a risk that even though we deliver the game, we never make back all the money we invested to create it.

It's a quick, intense chase between the Fugitive, who is trying to get out of town, and the Marshal, who is trying to catch him before he does.  \nHunter or Prey - each side plays very differently.\nDeduction - using a simple set of numbered cards, you have to deduce where the Fugitive's hideouts are located.\nBluffing - You can feign large jumps to throw the Marshal off your trail.\nEasy to Learn - Read the Rules or Watch this how to play video. Spanish here. Chinese here. Russian Here. Italian here. French here. Portuguese here. German here.\n Here is what's included:\nStylish briefcase box - thick stock\n43 hideout cards - UNIQUE original art on each card\n10 event cards\n2 Player Role cards\n3 Pile Marker cards\nLaminated Notecard for Marshal to take notes\nDry Erase Marker\nInstructions\nI had some players ask for a follow up for Burgle Bros with the escape - getting out of town with the loot!  So with Fugitive I wanted to give the feeling of 'The Chase' - being on the run from an unstoppable force after you. Two goals were to build it on very basic elements and be short. It ended up with just numbered cards and only 10 minutes to play.\nI like two player games with different roles, but still in conflict, like Netrunner.  Using guessing games is not common, but I found it creates a good tension like guessing your opponent in Poker. Don't worry if you start out blindly guessing as the Marshal - your information builds quickly and you can start deducing a lot.  Feel free to try it out with numbered cards in other games(6 Nimmit/Category 5/'The Game') or the print and play files here.  I hope you enjoy it!\nUPDATE: I ran an AMA question-and-answer session on reddit. Head over there to read my responses.\nA note from Ryan Goldsberry, the illustrator:\nThe first time Tim played Fugitive with me, we only used blank cards with numbers. Despite having absolutely no art, the feeling of being chased and the tension of close calls and escapes was so strong that I knew the art would have to be freaking sweet in order to live up to the feel of playing the game. It was decided that the coolest thing to do would be to draw this out as one long chase. In my mind I was imagining a movie where the Fugitive is making crazy almost reckless moves to escape but the Marshall is pursuing him relentlessly...like the Terminator!\nHopefully the art will live up to this feeling. Each card will be original and unique. They will be presented sequentially, like reading a comic book. It is my goal that you could lay out all the cards, from beginning to end, and watch an entire chase happen. Maybe even imagine the conversations and thoughts that are going through each characters mind. I hope you'll love the game! I have a lot of cards to paint, and I'm working like a maniac right now to get it done.\n  \"Two games in one! As the Fugitive you play a bluffing game, trying to keep yourself one step away from capture. As the Marshal you are solving a puzzle while gathering clues and attempting to think like your quarry.\nGameplay is quick and tense, and many games come down to wire. Even after playing several games we are still exploring different strategies. Should I sprint to throw the Marshal off my trail, or move slowly and force her to make a lot of guesses? Should I draw clues from nearby locations to narrow the Fugitives choices, or take them from farther away to choke off his escape routes in the end game?\nA unique 10-minute game that I would recommend for anyone who enjoys logic puzzles, searching for clues, and outwitting your opponent.\" - Stone Librande\n\"Fugutive does an amazing job recreating that classic, high-octane, on-the-run chase, without sacrificing strategy. Easy to learn and simple to teach; it sets up in seconds, yet Fugitive somehow still feels meaty and deeply strategic. Replayability is strong too, thanks to those randomly selected event cards blended into each new game. It was an instant hit both as a gateway with my less experienced friends, and as a filler for veteran gamers. I have a feeling Fugitive will make it to my table regularly.\" - Bob Buechler\n \"I have to say, I'm pretty enamored with Fugitive. It offers a single-serving logic puzzle that two people are simultaneously trying to solve to mutually-exclusive ends, and that's something I've simply never seen before. The table dynamic generates genuine tension in the best way, and I can't wait to see how the Event cards will change the balance of things. And more than all that, it's just damn fun. I'm really excited for this one.\" - Gameosity  \n\"Whether you catch your perp or get away scott-free, Fugitive is a clever little card game whose potential is easily more than the sum of its parts. Its short play time and diametrically opposing roles affords you an entirely different feeling depending on which side of the table you\u2019re on. Against a fitting visual aesthetic, Fugitive has ample room for bluffing, number crunching, and continually trying to get as much of an advantage on your opponent as you can. At its most basic Fugitive is a short and straightforward abstract card game, but it is admirable how often the game\u2019s premise winds its way into the experience all the same.\" - Cardboard Republic\n\"I think Fugitive is an excellent game for two. It plays fairly quickly and I love the cat-and-mouse mind games that go on. I\u2019ve been a fan of Tim Fowers\u2019 other game designs, and I like the thematic tie-in to Burgle Bros., too.\" - Geek Dad\n\"Fugitive es un juego de los que te hacen cosquillitas por dentro cuando lo pruebas.

Stock up your truck, attract customers, and serve a hefty scoop of tasty frozen delight! The best truckers get to know their customers\u2019 favorite selections so they can always meet demand and gain an edge over the competition in the battle to claim the hottest locations. You\u2019ll see the business of icy entrepreneurship is no day at the beach. Buckle up, turn on the loudspeaker, and take to the rocky road...with ice cream!\n  Rocky Road a la Mode is a game of managing time and resources to meet the demands of sweet-treat-seekers! The game features multi-use cards and a time track that determines the players\u2019 turn order. The player whose ice cream truck is furthest back on the road goes next and may choose from several actions on their turn; stocking up on new treats, playing music over the loudspeaker to attract business, or passing out treats to fulfill customer desires. \nEvery choice costs time and will force players to move ahead on the road track. Once a player is no longer in the rear of the pack, their turn ends until they find themselves lagging behind again. In addition to gaining loyalty points from happy customers, players can gain bonus treats in their permanent supply so they can meet demand a little easier. \nThroughout the game, players will also be fighting to earn the right to take over several of the different territories that make Summer great; the beach, the pool, the park, and the ball field.\nNOTE: Art is not yet final!\nRocky Road a la Mode is a full-fat filler with meaningful decisions and an approachable theme that will grab casual players and gamers alike.\nHere's a taste of how it all works together:\nRocky Road a la Mode is a game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up and is designed by Joshua J Mills of the Board Game Designers of North Carolina. The game plays in 20-30 minutes.\nCheck out this SUPER SWEET Rules Overview with designer, Joshua J Mills:\n Here's a full 2 player play through with Josh and his wife Jamie:\n           Click here to get the Free PnP of Rocky Road: Dice Cream so you can take it for a spin before pledging for a Deluxe Scoop!\nCheck out this quick overview of Dice Cream right here:\n    Add prices above to your final pledge total to purchase additional games!\n  Rocky Road a la Mode is available world-wide and all copies will ship from within the US! International Shipping fees will be added to your pledge level when you select your home location.  \nAdded Shipping: US-Included!, Canada-$7, Everywhere Else-$15  \nNote: International Backers will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package. However, this campaign is CUSTOMS FRIENDLY. \nThe low price point and small box for this game should not cause any customs fees for backers pledging for 1-2 copies. We have learned that shipping is a costly endeavor, especially with the recent rate increase in the US Postal Service, and we must try to keep our costs as low as possible to keep our games at an appropriate price point for when they hit retail. We are saying THANK YOU to our early adopters on Kickstarter by offering the game below MSRP while covering the first $5 of shipping costs for all backers. We'll also be adding some extra content at no extra charge (when we reach STRETCH GOALS, of course).\n We have plans to add value (STRETCH GOALS!) to Rocky Road a la Mode that we think you will really appreciate. We plan to add value by upgrading components and increasing replayability with added game content.  \nWe have several stretch goals in mind and we hope to hit them all! But know that just as with our previous campaigns, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery.  \nThat being said, we'll be listening closely to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the ideas that comes our way.\nHere's a peek at the first three Stretch Goals to get you all super excited about what is to come:\n                              We think this game is GREAT but don't just take our word for it!

I know the \"time\" mechanism is in vogue right now, but it really does create interesting decisions as you weigh the trade-off of doing something awesome now but not being able to take a turn for a while.\" - Scott Firestone, Theology of Games\n\"I'll admit it, the theme and look of this game led me to some preconceived notions of the game. Once I got about 1/3 of the way through the rule book I realized I had a fun game on my hands. I've played it with my boys and it holds up both as a family game and as a great gamer game. That puts this game over the top for me: If I can grab one game off of my shelf and it hits with the family and my gamer friends, it's a winner!\" -Jeremiah Isely, Theology of Games\n \"Overall, I think Rocky Road a la Mode is an excellent little game, and fits in with Green Couch Games\u2019 motto of \u201cgreat little games that make great big connections.\u201d It\u2019s family-friendly but has enough to hold the interest of more experienced gamers (though it is a little short to be the main course for a game night). The individual mechanics aren\u2019t entirely new, but the combination feels fresh, and I think they\u2019re presented in a way that is easy to introduce to players who haven\u2019t already seen them elsewhere.\" -Jonathan Liu, GeekDad.com\n     \"Rocky Road is far from freezer burned, this game is a refreshing treat. It is easy to teach and understand and plays as smooth as soft serve ice cream.\" -Ryan Sanders, The Inquisitive Meeple\nCheck out Ryan's interview with designer, Josh Mills right here! Rocky Road: Dice Cream designer, Nat Levan even chimes in to talk about his one card game (available in the Deluxe Scoop pledge level!)\n    \"Every turn in Rocky Road a la Mode is both agonizing and flavorful.\" -Jason Dobson, Indie Cardboard\n   \"This is a fun set collection game that gives off a bit of a Splendor feel, the collecting of cards and using those cards to fill orders to gain permanent bonuses that allow for easier filling of future orders. But it plays quicker and let\u2019s face it, the theme is a ton more fun, I know I\u2019d take selling ice cream over jewels, and that kind of shows if you get to meet me ever in person.\" -Brandon Kempf, WDYPTW Podcast\n Kicking it with Meg says: (Read whole review here)\n\"Rocky Road a la Mode is a really fun game, simple as that. Even though it can be considered a take on the Splendor model, I definitely feel like I am getting more out of my play. With Splendor, I never feel quite as involved and I often end the game feeling underwhelmed. I like the theme of this better, I like the way turn order is determined, and I really love the way you build on bonuses to your truck.\" -Megan Dana Fauci, Kicking it with Meg.\nTaco's Take Reviews says: (Read whole review here): \n\"Rocky Road a la Mode is a fun game that works well with a wide age range and skill level. This is a great entry point into managing time and resources. More seasoned players will enjoy the engine building aspect of the game. The game is played in a half an hour which goes by real quick. I tried many different strategies and each had their chances of victory. The art is really fun and colorful.\" -Taco's Take Reviews\nStuart Dunn of Stuart's Study has this to say: (Read the whole review here)\n\"This was a quick game with a fun theme attached to it. It also had a bit of depth to it that I wasn't expecting.\" -Stuart Dunn\n \" This is SO good.

Brynnum and Richard Launius\n2-4 players each control a band of deranged cultists and use them to fulfill sinister plots, complete dark ceremonies, and control key locations in Arkham. Since you all want the world to end your way, prepare to meet opposition \u2013 not just from the investigators that roam the streets looking for occult activity, but form the other players too. The first player to reach 13 victory points win, but if you don\u2019t keep the investigators at bay, they\u2019ll call in a federal raid and make everybody lose - except for the cult with the least points who escapes notice.\n  Components Inside:\n1 Game board with Location tiles 4 Cult boards 54 minion tokens 1 Investigator Marker 20 Action Dice 7 Combat Dice 13 Investigator tokens 8 Tokens for tracking Madness and Victory Points 13 Spell cards 13 Item cards 13 Special Item cards 12 Ceremony cards 16 Cult upgrade cards 20 Plot cards 13 Forbidden Lore tokens\nIn Madness At Midnight 2-4 cults fight to be the first to summon their specific unspeakable horror. The goal is to gain 13 Victory Points through plots, cult ceremonies, and the powerful locations of Arkham. But on the path to unleashing their god, the cults must fight each other and the pesky investigators who threaten to save the world.\nThe Action Dice form the core of Madness At Midnight. Each player has a set and uses them to move cultists, activate location abilities, and initiate fights. You can, of course, reroll your Action Dice, but only as long as your cult hasn\u2019t gained too much madness. So the madder your cultists are, the harder it is to make them do exactly what you want.\nA big part of the game is to control or dominate important locations in Arkham, but you can also activate them to gain stuff. You can learn ancient spells at Miskatonic University, gain forbidden lore in the black lodge, acquire mystical items at the River Docks, and more.\nLocations change during the game depending on the moon phases \u2013 you simply flip the location tiles to reveal new abilities. This forces you to rethink your strategy and ensures that no game will be the same.\nWill your cult be the first to unleash an unspeakable horror on the world? Or will your plans be foiled by the other cults or the pesky investigators?\nView a Word Doc of the Rules HERE\n Our good friend Lance (aka Undead Viking) has been kind enough to do an amazing preview of Madness at Midnight for us.

It is set in the same world as Small City, also published by Alban Viard in 2015. Fans of this universe will recognize the city theme and challenging yet intellectually rewarding mechanisms.\nTRAMWAYS is a pure pick-up-and-deliver game \u2014 OK, with a twist of card management, but no randomness \u2014 in which players are trying to build their networks into a full-blown transit map.\n  The goal of the game is to have the most Happiness points at the end of the game. \nYou earn Happiness points by moving passengers, building new railways, and constructing new buildings. You take on the role of investors in the early 1920s who are trying to develop the most efficient rail network. You collect tickets (cards) throughout the game and use symbols on them to take actions.\nThe more efficiently you use your cards, the more you can do with them, but the more you must increase your stress level, as well. Stress is tracked on your personal board, and counts as negative Happiness points at the end of the game.\n                    Tramways has one foot squarely in the train game tradition: you need money, so you can build rail links, upgrade your network, and transport things (passengers, in this case).\nThe other foot stands in the deckbuilding tradition: You build your own personal deck by purchasing cards to add to your personal discard pile, and occasionally directly into your hand. Cards are then shuffled to form your new deck when you\u2019ve exhausted the current one. And although managing your hand and deck certainly must not be neglected, this is mainly a connection game: How can you benefit more than your opponents by transporting passengers?\nDuring the setup phase of the game the players are creating the Small City map, so no two games of TRAMWAYS will ever be the same, given the variety in buildings, available parcels, mountains, lakes, and more.\nBuilding tiles\nTramways also incorporates an original auction system to get the best tickets/cards. Some cards have a negative effect that you can not avoid when you play the card. So it is important to have as few of them as possible in your deck, lest they crowd your deck and make future hands less useful. Finally, the hand limit is small, so you can\u2019t afford much trouble creeping into your deck.\nPrototype auctions board, not final graphic\nThe Auction has a double impact. In a traditional, route-building train game, position on the map is crucial, but being first to transport cargo/passengers is also important, because once they are delivered, they are no longer available to be transported. So building first is important, and moving first is important, but you have to choose which action you will do first!\n4 of 106 cards\nThe Auctions have several unique twists as well: Each time you bid, you must pay immediately. You may not bid the same amount that someone else has bid before, but you do not have to outbid anyone to stay in the bidding. If it is your turn to bid, but you already have the highest bid, you immediately win the auction. Payments can be made with money, cards, or both. This introduces the dilemma of using cards to pay for a bid or saving them to use for an action later \u2014 especially because you need these cards this turn for your three actions, all of which require a card, and you might want to use multiple cards for a single action!\n  In Tramways, there are only 3 different types of actions:\n  So, it is quite easy to learn; however, each action is very powerful, and affects all players. Should you connect areas to each other or upgrade old buildings? Or, should you build new lines to add value to those buildings? Furthermore, should you be building long, expensive, but very beneficial lines, or short and inexpensive lines? When is it most appropriate to upgrade? \nLast but not least, an aspect of the game that makes this it particularly original is that you have the option to play fewer cards to take your actions, by using more symbols on the same card. The catch is that by doing so you increase your stress level, which in turn reduces your Happiness, and Happiness is all that matters in the end.\n  For more details on the components and the rules of Tramways, download the rulebook here (low-resolution version).\nThe English Rules : \nhttp://avstudiogames.com/img/cms/regles/Tramways_rules_EN_lowres.pdf\nThe French Rules :\n http://avstudiogames.com/img/cms/regles/tramways_rules_FR_lowres.pdf\nThe German Rules (first draft):\nhttp://avstudiogames.com/img/cms/regles/tramways_rules_DE_draft_160609.pdf\n      The game has been fully designed, developed, balanced, and extensively playtested. It is complete \u2014 which is why there are no stretch goals at the moment. \nThe little company known as AVStudioGames that I am running could not possibly produce dozens of Stretch Goals, which would be mostly useless, and such things often introduce delivery delays. I prefer focusing my time and energy on creating new games for you, helping this project to progress, from creating the graphics, to delivery at your doorstep. We feel that most stretch goals complicate fulfillment unnecessarily, and exponentially introduce problems for both you and us, and we do not like problems. =:) \nI have always sought to offer my games with the best components I can, at the best price I can. \nThat's why, depending on the total amount reached at the end of the campaign, I could upgrade the components. When you produce more copies, each copy costs less to produce, so back as high as you can!\n            not final version\n    not final graphics\n    Here the actual player board with the normal stress track and 2 Rail workers. \nAnother difficult Stress track is possible to print with less spots with different numbers including my favorite 17...with less Rail workers...\nand the new hard stress track for avid core gamers =:)\n The white meeple has finally reached the Red Leisure on the South of the Small City map, a nice home to be happy for the rest of his life...\nThank you so much !\nNSF (in the Netherlands) will produce the game. It is a very famous game manufacturing company that respects all the standards and really cares about the quality of the game components.\n  During this campaign, YOU have a ONE-TIME OPPORTUNITY to engrave your name in marble (so to speak) by putting your name on a Parcel space on the Small City map depicted on the modular boards!\nYou can lay claim to one of the 25 available Parcel spaces by simply pledging at the Venture Capitalist level. Your name with \"Road, Avenue, Drive,  or Place... \"will be automatically added by Sampo at the campaign ends. Then the files will be sent to the manufacturer.\nNote: Any requests for SPECIFIC Parcels will be entertained on a first pledged, first served basis, so don't delay!\nOne of the 10 Modular boards\n  Currently, we have no plans to put TRAMWAYS into the traditional distribution channels, so if you are interested in this game, and you like the concept, please pledge now. That is the best \u2014 and perhaps only \u2014 way to get this game.\nI am a mathematics teacher for a high class level and I have been designing games for over 10 years. Tramways is my 5th game:\n2012: Card City, a card game; http://avstudiogames.com/en/card-city/16-card-city.html\n2013: Town Center, a 3D city-building game, published by LudiCreations; http://ludicreations.com/product/town-center-4th-edition/\n2014: CliniC, a heavy, 3D hospital-building game; http://avstudiogames.com/en/clinic/12-clinic.html\n2015: Small City, a modern classic in the genre of city-building. http://avstudiogames.com/en/small-city/8-small-city.html\nI am back in 2016 with my first pick-up-and-deliver game, a special sort of triumph because I have designed more than 30 expansions for my favorite game, Age of Steam, since 2005.\nI am used to worrying about everything in the game design process, from the first prototype to shipping the games to my fans. I delegate the playtesting phase, rules corrections, and few other things to different teams in France, the United States, and the rest of Europe, but everything else is entirely me \u2014 except for the exceptional graphics, of course. Tramways was initially designed in 2011, but it took several years more to refine it and present this smooth-running, polished version on Kickstarter to you today.\nYou can visit my website at http://avstudiogames.com/en/\nI am working with the very talented architect, Sampo Siki\u00f6. Sampo excels at distilling all of my complex ideas into a perfect iconography, with the right symbols at just the right places. Please visit his website as well; he did beautiful work for the game Eclipse: \nhttp://samposdesign.com/portfolio.html\nPaul Laane, a Finnish illustrator, has worked on this project to create the visually stunning Art Deco universe. Since Tramways is a game set 100 years before Small City, this style was a fun option to explore. Aqua Design creates professional visual designs: \nwww.paullaane.com\n  The fulfillment of previously created games (Clinic, Small City) was handled internally, but was a time-consuming activity that distracted me from designing more great games. Therefore for this campaign, AVStudioGames has signed fulfillment agreements with 2 companies, one in the US and one in France. Rewards to the US will be shipped from within the US, and rewards to France, Europe, and the rest of the world will be shipped from France.\nI managed to minimize the shipping costs, and I'm pleased to announce that shipping is as follows::\n$10 if you live in the US\n$15 if you live elsewhere so spread the good news!\nAs the game is manufacturer in the Netherlands, our campaign is EU-friendly !\nLike my Facebook page :\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AVStudioGames-800700710043132/\nFollow my projects on Twitter :\nhttps://twitter.com/AlbanVIARD?lang=en\nBecome a fan on BoardGameGeek :\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/166571/tramways\n\n\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAVStudioGames has already put a substantial amount of money into the initial illustration and graphic design. \nWe now need your help to traverse the final route: Producing the game.

One of these planets will house an energy crystal which supplies players with an energy cube of that color when their ship is flicked into this planet. After an energy cube of each player color is collected, you may toss the space bomb onto the board in an attempt to blow up the other player's planets. Each planet is worth points (shown on the back of the planet) that you earn when blowing it up.\nAdvancement cards are given to players throughout the game which provide player powers or bonuses to aid in your conquest.

Its seasons shift sporadically and the strange folk that call this world home do their best to adapt to its ever changing landscape. The GearSeed Saga is a collection of 2 completely different card games set in the same world. Synod is a Kickstarter Exclusive Micro game for 2 players and was illustrated by Sandro Rybak. GearSeed is a combo driven, tile laying card game for 2 to 4 players and features the illustrations of Oliver Howe. Artist Jason Benningfield is responsible for all of the icon work that ties these two games together.\nThis is a short, 10 day project.  There are 5 different rewards available through this project (many of them are Kickstarter Exclusive!):\nReward 1: $1.00 - Print and Play files for Synod\nReward 2: $5.00 - Print and Play files for GearSeed + Synod\nReward 3: $10.00* - 1 Complete Copy of Synod\nReward 4: $13.00* - 1 Complete Copy of GearSeed\nReward 5: $25.00* - 1 Complete Copy of The GearSeed Saga\nRewards 3, 4 and 5 also include the Print and Play files for both games.  *Includes Domestic Shipping. \nAll cards are Poker-sized, 310GSM Blackcore with linen finish.\n*The Art and Lore of GearSeed added to all copies of The GearSeed Saga!\nSynod is a Kickstarter exclusive game. This micro game will never be available outside of this project.\nThe GearSeed Saga includes the content for both Synod and GearSeed, as well as an upgraded full color rulebook, and comes in a black box with gold foil imprint that\u2019s large enough to house both games sleeved. This is a Kickstarter exclusive reward and will not be available outside of this project. \nAs the seasons of GearSeed shift, so do the reigns of power in this peculiar and ever changing world. In Synod, which consists of only eighteen cards (15 Noble cards and 3 Favor/Synod cards), each player vies for control of the Synod of GearSeed. Using Noble cards belonging to the three Castes of GearSeed (Coalkin, Thorned, and Gremlin), players assert their influence in the Synod.\nEach turn, the player draws 1 Noble card and plays 1 Noble card.  Noble cards can be played either face up or face down. When played face up, Noble cards grant the player a special ability, influence, and the possibility of granting the favor of their Caste to the player. Face down cards are revealed at the end of the game and grant influence and are worth points if the requirements of their Schemes are met.\nWith simple mechanics, engaging gameplay, a limited card pool, and meaningful choices, it's not so much about the cards you draw; it's how and when you play them.\nSynod is a game for 2 players with a play time of 10-15 minutes.\nGearSeed is a peculiar world of shifting seasons and odd landscapes. In this tile-laying card game of the same name, players build and expand the world of GearSeed.\nPlayers build (play) cards next to existing cards to activate abilities, create combos, trigger bonuses, and score points. Each card is a territory belonging to one of the three Castes of GearSeed (Coalkin, Thorned, and Gremlin) or is a powerful Shrine.\nEach game of GearSeed takes place over the course of three randomly chosen seasons (rounds). Each season offers its own additional scoring and abilities based on what players choose to build.  During a Season, each player draws 3 cards and builds 2 cards.  A special Burst actions allows each player to play 1 additional card and gain bonus points when the time is right.\nGearSeed is a game for 2-4 players with a play time of 20-30 minutes.\nThe Stretch Goals for this project are based on the total number of backers. As this project reaches a certain number of backers, a new Kickstarter Exclusive Stretch Goal Item will be added to one of the Rewards!\nUNLOCKED!!! - 500 BACKERS: Custom Imprinted Vinyl Card Wallet for all copies of Synod.

After going through the out-of-house process with a few of our titles, we felt that it was time to give Darkest Night the Victory Point Games Premier Line treatment.\nThis is where Kickstarter comes in. Funds from backers will be going toward raising enough financial capital to fund a print run with our overseas printer. Funding over the initial amount will go into stretch goals to add to the game.\nThis game has been, and will continue to be, a long and adventurous road for The Little Game Company, and we are ecstatic that you are here to join us!\n We've also made a set of KS avatar images for Darkest Night fans! Download them here or click the image below and show off your favorite hero on your profile!\n  Due to the fluctuation of shipping costs, we will be charging for shipping through Pledge Manager once Darkest Night: Second Edition is ready to ship. In previous Kickstarters, we charged for shipping in the campaigns, but by the time the games were ready to ship, the shipping prices had risen dramatically from what we originally charged and ended up hurting us financially. Using this method, we can charge an accurate amount for shipping.\nHere are the estimated shipping rates for Darkest Night: Second Edition. Please note that these are subject to change as the cost of shipping fluctuates. As the cost of shipping changes with the market, we will do what we can to keep this information up to date. We will also be doing everything in our power to get you the best shipping rate possible.\nWhy is shipping so much? \nThere have been a number of people expressing concern about shipping domestic and overseas. We are working with a new distributor that has better rates and will be continuing to research to make sure we have the best rates possible when the game ships.\nThat being said, a substantial shipping rate is inherent when shipping a game this large. A copy of the game with a Miniatures Set is approximately 4 kg (more with shipping materials included) or over 9 lbs!\nTo offset the shipping amount, we're giving Kickstarter backers a deep discount off the projected MSRP of the game. We've also arranged a 3-game group reward tier so that you can get even more of a discount by pledging with friends.\nWhile we would love to offer our games to Russia and Brazil, the shipping and loss rates are just too high. If you are in Russia or Brazil and are very interested in Darkest Night: Second Edition, please send us a message through Kickstarter. We will be looking in to what we can do to support you.\n  Anyone who would like to place a bulk order, such as retailers or distributors, should contact us directly at distribution[at]victorypointgames[dot]com or through Kickstarter, and we will be happy to work with you to get you set up with whatever you need.\nIf it wasn't for the following people, Darkest Night: Second Edition wouldn't be where it is today.

The game is played through a series of Eras, with a time travelling twist - players can use Time Rifts to reach back to earlier Eras as the game progresses. \nPlayers assume the roles of iconic leaders of the four ideological Paths, striving for the supremacy and prosperity of their people, and do everything they can to prepare for a game-changing event: after the fourth Era, an asteroid impact shakes Earth, threatening to destroy the World Capital, New Earth\u2019s last independent city. When the time comes, the Paths can take their part in evacuating the collapsing Capital. In the end, one of the Paths will be the new home to the reformed World Council, and lead humanity to a brighter future.\n  Check out Update #8, Update #13, Update #18, and Update #20 for the stories of the revealed Leaders!\nTo reveal the whole story behind the world of Anachrony and the four Paths, visit our website!\nInnovative worker placement with Exosuits\nWhile your Workers can operate safely within your Path's perimeter, venturing out to a desolate, post-apocalyptic Earth is a dangerous undertaking. In Anachrony, you can use four different types of Workers, and certain Actions can only be used if they are protected by powered-up Exosuits. Workers and Exosuits are managed as separate systems, and both are required for success.\n  Exosuits vs. the standard Carcassone meeples. These 3D printed prototypes do not represent the final quality of the Exosuit miniatures, only their size.\nResource Management through Time\nAnachrony's smart time traveling mechanism allows players to request resources from their very own future at the beginning of each Era. These resources can greatly boost their progress, but as time passes, they will have to complete the loop by sending that resource back to their own past - the earlier turn. Failing to do so is a dangerous endeavor that may result in temporal Anomalies tearing up the present!\nPrepare for a game-altering Impact!\nIn Anachrony, you are striving not only for your Path's supremacy, but also to overcome an impending cataclysm. An asteroid is heading towards Earth, and its impact will be a game-altering turning point, changing available actions, opening up new ones, and initiating the countdown to the endgame. With careful planning, however, players can take advantage of the Impact's effects - or even mitigate them completely!\n  Our rulebook is currently available in English, and during and after the campaign, we will be translating it to other languages. Please note that the rules are about 90% final, so may be subject to minor changes.\nThe game will be shipped with printed rulebooks in English, German and French. The rules will also be available in digital form in Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, Croatian and Hungarian after the campaign.\n  If the picture link does not work, try this\nApart from the rulebook and some flavor texts, Anachrony and both its modules are completely language-independent.\nInterested in the game?

With the Path goals, we would like to give you the opportunity to further immerse yourself in the world of Anachrony. Now you can truly become a affiliated with to your chosen Path - and compete with the other three!\nWith your Leader Box, you also pledge your allegiance to one of the four Paths, and receive your game with its exclusive Box Sleeve.

Once I had a better idea of strategies and synergies, I couldn\u2019t wait to play it out again.\"\n        One of our top priorities in this project is to make shipping as affordable and straightforward as possible. We believe the fairest way is to charge shipping costs during the campaign, not afterwards, and we already have accurate shipping quotes in place to do so safely.\nFulfillment will be done from within the US, EU and Canada, so if you live in these countries, you won\u2019t have to pay any duties or taxes. We offer a heavily subsidized shipping cost everywhere: shipping to the US is free, to Canada and all EU countries is $8, and everywhere else is $30. It\u2019s that simple!\n                           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAnachrony is a big game with lots of components, and games like that usually pose significant manufacturing and shipping challenges. That said, this is not our first campaign, and our previous Kickstarter-published game, Trickerion - Legends of Illusion, was of similar magnitude, so we already have experience in producing big box games on a high level.\n\nFor manufacturing, just like with Trickerion, we will be working with Panda Games Manufacturing. Those who backed Trickerion, or any other Kickstarter game manufactured by Panda, know that the quality of their products is top-notch, and that there is almost no limit to what they can provide in terms of custom components. This is exactly what we need for Anachrony, and we're 100% confident that our game will be in good hands.\n\nAnachrony features 24 detailed, large miniatures, and this will be a new challenge for us. We are aware that miniatures can be a dangerous pitfall in terms of costs and lead times without proper planning, so we prepared everything we could in advance. We've been working on the minis for months - the 3D models you see here are already the result of lots of fine-tuning in cooperation with Panda, and we have a precise cost calculation for them as well. Panda should be ready to start working on the molds during or immediately after the campaign.\n\nWe have learned very valuable lessons with Trickerion's shipping. Because top-notch fulfillment is extremely important for Anachrony (a big box game with delicate miniatures) we will be working with proven partners that can ensure not only the timely delivery of the game, but also proper packaging and regular communication. We've been very happy with Ideaspatcher's services for the European and Non-EU/Non-US distribution, and are glad to continue working with them. For the US, we will be using new fulfillment options, either Ideaspatcher or Funagain. In Canada, we will be working with Snakes and Lattes for a Canada-friendly fulfillment.

For full detail on each reward scroll down to the PLEDGE REWARDS DETAIL section below.\nThe entire game consists of\n2 Ring cards that create the wrestling ring movement track \n2 Wrestler character/damage tracker cards \n2 Unique FINISHING MANEUVER cards\n12 Maneuver cards, made up of 4 Strikes, 4 Technical Grapples and 4 Power Grapples.\nIt's technically a \"micro-game\" and will packaged in a small vinyl wallet, perfect for taking it on the go. It's pocket-sized, portable and protective... and has proven itself with or growing line of wallet games.\nIf you want a BIGGER experience, scroll down because we have a 6-card bonus pack, deluxe edition and super deluxe edition of the game. \nYou can print the game right here, even with the tiny amount of ink left in your printer. It's 4 pages long with just black ink, and a few colored icons. The rules are another few pages, and you can even get by without even printing them out and just viewing them online.\n(Mostly) black and white Print and Play - with rules included: https://www.dropbox.com/s/smdcvpmd7i3wmkl/SP-PNP-BW-050316.pdf?dl=0\nRules only: https://www.dropbox.com/s/znwub0wu0jvjexl/SP-Rules-050316.pdf?dl=0\nGAME LEVEL - For $8 you will receive ONE copy of the Wallet Game, featuring 18 cards. This plays with 2 players and includes the characters Everyman Jr. and Diceman. \nGAME AND TAG TEAM BONUS PACK - For $11 you will receive the game level PLUS 6 additional cards. These will come in a small clear sleeve outside of the wallet and include 2 new characters for Tag Team action: C'Food Lou & Volcanessa. The bonus pack also includes their finishing moves and 2 tag cards to switch wrestlers. \n\nWith one game and a tag team bonus pack, 2 players can play an intense head-to-head Tag Team game. \n2 GAMES AND 2 TAG TEAM BONUS PACKS - This comes with everything above x2. Why? Well, if players have two sets of the game then they can use the bonus pack to play up to 4 players. We're throwing in an extra bonus pack incase you want to play 2 separate games at once. \nSUPER DELUXE GAME WITH PLAYMAT, MEEPLES, CUBES, NERDMAN AND BONUS PACK - For those who like to go a little over the top, this is made for you. It's the basic game and bonus pack PLUS a huge playmat that will make your table presence 100% more awesome. The playmat also includes a unique Cage Match Ring that deals damage to characters that are pushed beyond the turnbuckle spaces. \nAlong with the playmat we have 2 M.E.E.P.L.E.S (Millions of Extremely Energized Pocket Luchadores in Entertaining Skirmishes) to track your active wrestler's location in a fun, different way, 4 cubes to track your health, and an all new wrestler with unique finishing move.\nNerdman is based on designer Ryan Cowler's actual wrestling character, P.O.N.G. Ryan is part of Oakland, CA's Hoodslam league and we couldn't not get him into the game as part of this extra special level. \nEXTRA SUPER DELUXE GAME WITH CHAMPION T-SHIRT, PLAYMAT, MEEPLES, CUBES, NERDMAN AND BONUS PACK - This is it. There's nothing else to give away. We're throwing in everything in the Super Deluxe game plus a Champion T-Shirt, because you are our Champion and one of our top-tier backers. The shirt was created by the amazing people at Analog Gamer, so you should expect top quality. \nWe have a few fun things planned. We are at the limit on the size of the wallet, and we're almost capping our product size for print run, but we still have a few things in our back pocket if things go well. :)\nWe will be announcing a whole bunch of games that you can add-on to your pledge. You will receive discount rates and everything will ship together, but most add-on processing will be handled as separate payments through our site, buttonshygames.com (as we cannot track inventory here and we have some games in VERY low quantities). \nKeep an eye here or in the updates for news on the add-ons.\nFor now, here's something that isn't going to be available during the campaign, but we would LOVE for it to happen sometime soon. Awesome toy designer, Matthew Mullin has been working on some SuperPLEX figures based on the character designs. As soon as the designs are complete, we're going to dabble with some molding and see if we can unleash an army of SuperPLEX characters. Fingers crossed!\nInternational Shipping is expensive and we apologize. With $8 games, we cannot afford to absorb it into the pledges as larger companies will do. \nUSPS shipping went up in January and the biggest hit was small items - exactly what we sell :( - and under 1 lb international went up over $5 on average. Unfortunately with small games, international shipping can sometimes exceed the cost of the game. Here's a whole thread where we discuss this in more detail: https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/202374/item/4494023?commentid=6179110#comment6179110\nWe know it's tough and it's just something we have to deal with and a constant struggle so to balance this, we offer the following solutions. \n-Full Color Print and Play Pledge Level\n-Bundles / Add-Ons. The shipping charge for a second game is often not much more than for a single game. You can add multiple copies of SuperPLEX into one pledge or add-on additional games via ButtonShyGames.com\nRyan Cowler is someone with too many hobbies. He's an avid enthusiast/collector of vintage home game consoles and pinball machines, and has been a trained professional wrestler for over a decade, and dabbles in game design (JurassAttack!) all while from his home base in Patterson, California with his wife and 2 daughters. Even with his family life and all his ridiculous interests, he manages to find time to put his creative juices to work through various game designs and loves the process of creating fun and enjoyable experiences that bring people together. \nRyan wrestles for HOODSLAM, a 21 and over only (don't bring your kids!) professional wrestling promotion based out of Oakland, California. HOODSLAM is what would happen if the DNA of the circus, pro-wrestling, video games, and 80's/90's nostalgia were all used to make one ridiculously crazy super-being.

On each day, you must choose between: buying new canvases, painting the canvases you already own, or working in order to get more paint.

But be careful, word has it that the other Nobles have hired their own unsavory agents, so you will need to summon Escorts (shields) to try and keep the roads clear of threats to your Envoys.\nAs the turns progress, players must remember what Vassals have already been sent to court and predict which ones will be sent out next.

The next best thing you could do is to help us build awareness for the game by following us and sharing our posts on Twitter and Facebook.\n                                                                                                                                      We've built in a small discount for ALL shipping. We like to be completely transparent about everything we do. Here's a breakdown of the shipping costs and the discount you're receiving for pledging on Kickstarter.\nIf you'd like to add-on additional copies of Quests of Valeria, you can add any number of copies by adding $19 for each additional copy. \nTo add more games beyond the first, manually enter the $$ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge. For example, if you're in the USA, enter \"$39\" for 2 copies of Quests of Valeria. \nOur previous games, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, ManaSurge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, and Villages of Valeria will be available to add onto your pledge in limited numbers, but they will not be delivered until February when Quests of Valeria is being fulfilled. These games will also not be discounted. We encourage you to ask your FLGS to order these games from Peachstate Hobby or Alliance in the USA and Esdevium in the EU.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution. If you're a retailer, please contact David at david@dailymagicgames.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nWe wanted to publish this game on our dime, but due to popular demand from our previous Kickstarter, Villages of Valeria, we are now bringing Quests of Valeria here so that the community can help us make an even better version than we had planned. Every dollar we make will go directly back in to making Quests of Valeria a better game. Our Stretch Goals are designed to add more content to the base game - so your pledge really makes a difference in making the best game possible.\nHere are some incentives we are offering to all our backers:\n32% off MSRP. Pay only $17 instead of $25.\nDiscounted Shipping. All pledge levels get $4 off.\nGet *Kickstarter Limited Exclusive content. 1 Guild Master Card - given to you for FREE.  \nDaily Magic Games is a designer-friendly and customer-focused publisher specializing in casual tabletop games that are easy to learn and play, yet layered with strategy and depth.\nWe're based out of Seattle, Washington and like to focus on the growth and promotion of game design in the Pacific Northwest. We've even started a playtesting event network called playtestNW to help local designers meet each other and playtesters on a regular basis. Our hope is that we're helping designers build better games. \nWe are focused on listening to what our customers have to say and making sure that we are producing the type of games you want at a high quality. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of Updates post-Kickstarter.\nWe're happy to report that of our previous four Kickstarter games:\nSwinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge delivered one month late in December 2015 and is nearly sold out.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms delivered on time in January 2016 and it has been selling so well that we've ordered another print run! Woot!\nManaSurge is on a boat to the USA and on track to deliver on time in May 2016. \nVillages of Valeria is in to the printer and on track to deliver on time in September of 2016.\nWe like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital game background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games and has designed two successful board games: Sunrise City and Valeria: Card Kingdoms.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout the campaign, we will be as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Quests of Valeria is completed with the exception of stretch goal content. The art and design for the stretch goal content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the campaign ends.\n\nWe hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Our Newest Valeria-Universe Game", "update_content": "Live on Kickstarter Right Now!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Margraves of Valeria: Funded!", "update_content": "Greetings Questers...\nJust a quick note to let you know that our newest Valeria game, Margraves of Valeria, is now live on Kickstarter.

It will bring you more reasons to travel the solar system, picking fights with nasty events, and delivering much needed cargo to the Interworlds! It offers several new card types including four unique ships each with different abilities.\nHelionox Mercury Protocol\nThe Helionox is a solar event that takes place over the course of thousands of years. As the sun slowly dies, the Interworlds (the planets within our solar system) begin to feel the negative effects. Cold snaps and solar flares become more and more common which causes all manners of civil unrest. One of the greatest catastrophes thus far is the ruin of Mercury, a once colonized settlement of the Interworlds. Lashed by solar flares, Mercury burnt to an orbiting husk in a matter of hours. Most of Mercury's inhabitants were unable to escape the devastation.\nMercury itself began as a penal colony, run by a group of fringe scientists. Its close proximity to the sun allowed for experimentation that would have been impossible anywhere else. As the generations passed, people born on Mercury developed strange genetic abilities as a result of these experiments. These abilities manifested as both physical and mental enhancements.\nAs the refugees from the Mercurian catastrophe spread out across the solar system, the Interworlds governments were faced with serious political questions. Could they bring these strange, other worldly beings into their worlds - into their communities? These questions eventually led to the Mercury Protocol - a strict policy banning Mercurian tech. For many Mercurians, however, their tech was integrated into their genetic make up. In some cases it even kept them alive.\nWith the Mercury Protocol expansion we hope to further develop the world of Helionox, exploring many new characters and new tech that survived the catastrophe on Mercury and the political dilemma it created for the Interworlds.\nHow To Play\nPlayers compete for \u201cInfluence\u201d by overcoming both social and stellar events, traveling to different locations around the solar system to establish embassies and gain special abilities, and acquiring powerful technologies and operatives from an abundant marketplace.\nRhado Runthrough of Helionox!\nOn their turn, players purchase cards from the market with \u201cCredits\u201d and integrate these cards into their deck for use later in the game. Players can also choose to overcome one or more of the disastrous events spreading across the colonies by using \u201cDefense\u201d. Both Defense and Credits are gained by playing cards or using Location and Architect abilities. Players continue building increasingly powerful combinations to acquire Influence points on subsequent turns. But time is limited!\nRhado Runthrough Extended Gameplay on Helionox\nOnce the last card of the \u201cevent deck\u201d is played, the game is over. The player with the most influence at the end wins.\nSpecial thanks to Rhado for the excellent videos!\nStretch Goals\nReviews\nWe are very excited that the first Helionox game was met with such good reviews!

If you live in one of these areas, we recommend you use a USA address and have the game forwarded to you via a postage forwarding company.\nWe are working with several fulfillment centers all over the world to ensure a fast, and affordable delivery. We try hard to offer the best solutions for everyone, but shipping rates continue to rise.\nPLEASE NOTE: We do not damage your games during shipping, shipping carriers sometimes have that damage in transit. We do not charge high rates for shipping, Shipping Carriers pass those fees along to us. We subsidize all shipping costs from our profits, because it is important to us to help spread the word about our project.\nWe are a small business who relies on shipping companies to fill our Kickstarter campaigns.

It will contain 108 high-quality poker sized cards:\n8 Factory cards\n20 Mining cards\n7 University cards\n14 Enrichment Plants cards\n6 Special Agent cards\n4 Landmarks cards\n13 Bomb Plan cards\n4 Bomb Loaded cards\n31 Resource cards\n1 Start Player card\nThe deluxe version will come in a telescoping two part box and has all the stuff from the standard version, plus these optional but handy wooden bits:\n25 Yellow-cake wooden cubes\n25 Uranium wooden disks\nSince the Deluxe Version has out sold the standard Retail version on this campaign, we will upgrade the wood bits to nuke symbol and mushroom cloud shapes!\nDeluxe Edition Box Example\nAll pledge levels include the Print and Play files which will be released shortly after the campaign ends.\nYou can download the rough rules: HERE\nGame play is simple, but never the same way twice. The goal is to claim the Bomb cards for points. This takes resources to accomplish.\nResources are earned by \u201cchaining\u201d cards together. You place a card sideways to use it as workers and vertical to make use of the building. You then play another card that uses the outputs of the previous card as its input. Which, in turn, provides its own output. And so it goes until the eventual output is what the player wants. Most of the time this is going to be Yellow Cake when the game begins, followed by \u201cUranium\u201d, and eventually being able to provide enough resources to build a bomb.\nThe Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction can be played by 1 person. The game is set up and played liked normal. Where applicable, a small number of cards list how they are used if being played in a solitaire game. The goal for the player is to earn as many points as possible before the Industry draw deck is depleted. After that, the player\u2019s goal is to beat their previous high score.\nHOW TO PLAY VIDEO by Eric Jome:\n .\nEDO's GAME PREVIEWS:\nFATHER GEEK REVIEW\n\"Challenging, engaging, and fun, I really enjoyed my time with The Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction. It was enjoyed by all our players for different reasons that ranged from creative play to engrossing problem solving. Most importantly, everyone had fun. If you enjoy card games where you must build and connect your logic to achieve victory, do sit down and play The Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction.\"\nMuch more details on how to play and feedback from all ages of players can be found here in his complete write up:\nhttp://fathergeek.com/manhattan-project-chain-reaction_prepub/\nWe won the Father Geek Approved seal which means this game is great for kids, casual gamers, and heavy gamers.\n* ACHIEVED! All Deluxe copies will come with these enhanced wood bits!\nWhile not a true stretch goal, we have decided that if we sell a total of 1500 or more Deluxe copies (which as of Sunday the 17th we're at 1132) then we will pay for upgraded wood bits to make the Deluxe version of the game even more special. These will be a solid color bit with a stamp/print of one color over the top of them. Similar to the skulls we did in our Dead Men Tell No Tales campaign (that turned out great).\nOur goal was to offer the best special game in the Deluxe addition from the start and not to make you all chase stretch goals. We realize that's not as exciting but we hope you enjoy what we are offering.\nSHIPPING EXPLAINED\nShipping is already included in ALL pledge level prices.\nWe are paying roughly $6 toward shipping for most backers (a bit more for non-USA). When you buy a bundle of 4 games, we offer more of a discount. That makes USA shipping included, but for other countries, we must charge what USPS charges us (minus the $6). Make sure you only back the reward level for your region.\nWe will ship with a value of $15-22 which should avoid VAT and import taxes in most countries. We've attempted many methods of dealing with shipping to Europe, and ended up losing money on all of them. We realize shipping is expensive, so if you prefer to wait, this game will eventually be in your local stores worldwide.\nAlso note, that backers of this campaign will get their games weeks before anyone else as we ship to distribution at least a week after we've finished shipping to backers.\nNOTE: The deluxe version will only available here at Kickstarter and a small number of direct sales at conventions and our own website. It will NOT be in game stores.\nWe have been publishing quality games and accessories for over 5 years and have run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns including the highly rated game The Manhattan Project. Pledge with confidence that we will fulfill your rewards with the highest quality and in a timely manner.\nABOUT THE DESIGNER:\nJames Mathe is the owner of Minion Games as well as a few hobby game stores in the Milwaukee area. He created RPGNow.com (DriveThurRPG) in 2001 and has since helped thousands of people learn how to publish games and run Kickstarters. One of the goals at Minion Games has been to get more unknown designer games to the market, so many of James' designs still sit on the shelf.

We believe Thief's Market by Dave Chalker is just such a game.  \nCheck out how Rob Lundy and Adam McIver bring this game to life, you'll see why.\nBy backing Thief's Market on Kickstarter now, you helped us make this game a reality, but you will also receive the Game far in advance of anyone else.  This is because we will be sending the game directly from China.  (More information on shipping further down the page.)\nThief's Market is a big game packed into a small box.\nYou are going to receive:\n13 Custom Dice!\n41 High Quality Market Cards\n+8 Unlocked Market Cards! (49 Total)\nStart Player Marker NOW A WOODEN MEEPLE\n+Stretched into a Silkscreened Start Token.\nPlayer Reference Cards NOW ENLARGED!\nCoin Tokens \nInfamy Tokens \nRulebook\nAnd that doesn't have to be all, you have unlocked 12 stretch goals so far, check out the next Stretch Goals below to see what else we have in store.\nTo those that backed our project in the first 3 days as Early Birds, thank you so much for getting us off to such a great start.\nThief's Market is played over a series of rounds.\nEach round you will split the loot from the day's heist, and then use your share of the loot to buy useful items, accrue finery, and employ henchmen, each represented by a card in the market. \nThese cards that you purchase may grant special abilities that will allow you to manipulate your take even further as you go to the Market, for example...\nSAMPLE TAKE:\nIn this example you have already purchased the Alchemical Lab and the Fence in previous turns. Now this round your take includes a Diamond, Ruby, Gold Bag, and Infamy.\nUsing the cards you have available you may:\nPurchase any card costing a single gem of any color by using your Achemical Lab with your Ruby.\nIf you do this you may trade your Diamond to the Fence for a Gold Bag for some gold to be used in a later round. \nOr...\nBuy a card that costs a Diamond and Any Color Gem \nIn both cases you will still get your Infamy Token and Gold in addition to the card you chose to buy.\nOnce the last deck can no longer fill in the market, the player who has gained the most notoriety points will be the next king of thieves!\nWHAT DO THE SYMBOLS ON THE CARDS MEAN?\nHere's a reference Key to the Symbols:\nCHECK OUT THE VIDEO AND RULES BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS.\nPLAY\n\nIf you would like to read the rules:\nAt 41 cards, Thief's Market is a complete game that you will bring to the table over and over again.

However, In a small box game that is a lot harder to justify...\nBut In the years that TMG has been using Kickstarter, we have learned time and time again, that this is a special place, making big dreams a reality...and that is why Michael figured out exactly what was needed to make Metal Coins a reality in Thief's Market as a Kickstarter Exclusive.\n Here's an excerpt from the TMG Newsletter where Michael give the details:\n\"When I first used stretch goals for game upgrades (Kings of Air and Steam in 2011) the idea was that with a larger order volume (more Backers) our cost per unit would decrease (raising our gross margin) and we could offer more to the Backer.\nWe will be doing this with Thief's Market. I carefully calculated where our margin increases (savings) would allow us to add metal coins exclusively for Kickstarter Backers. This was at around $422,356.\nThus, we have decided that at $400,000 of funding (accepting a slight margin decrease), we will add metal coins for Kickstarter Backers.\"\nThief's Market has been in our pipeline for a while now as we worked on getting it just right.  We asked some of our play testers their thoughts on the game and here are a few of things they had to say...\nAlso, we have sent out a handful of print and play versions with the final dice mold samples to some trusted review channels:\nUndead Viking:\nWe will keep this section up to date as more reviews come in.  Please take some time to see what they have to say... \nGameosity Preview:\nTheology Of Games Review:\nGEEK DAD's Review:\nIndiecardboard Review:\n\"Each round in Thief\u2019s Market feels like a feeding frenzy caught in slow motion.\"\nModify or Die Review:\nBoard Game Renegade Preview:\n                 What do we mean \"Global Friendly\"?\nTMG will be using a direct shipping agent in China to fulfill KS pledges worldwide. This will be provided FREE for all global backers except for Brazil. Shipping to Brazil will be an additional $6.\nIn 2015 we did a global shipping test with Flip City at a $20 price point, using this same shipper, we didn't have any concerns with Import fees , or damages reported to us from any of the many countries we shipped from. \n Given the lower price point, and the same package size we don't anticipate any of our backers having problems importing Thief's Market into their home Country.\nA \u201cfair division algorithm\u201d sounds pretty dry, but it turns out, it\u2019s a great way to start making a game.\nFor a while, my friend and game designer mentor Kory Heath had been working on different games that involve, essentially, taking a pile of stuff and dividing them up. One of the simpler forms of this is \u201cI cut, you choose\u201d where one player divides stuff up into two piles, and the other player chooses which one to take (usually, the player doing the dividing gets the leftover, which is what makes it fair.)\nWhile Kory was making mostly card games, one version I helped him playtest involved rolling a pile of dice with different colored sides, and dividing those using the following method:\nWhen it\u2019s your turn, you must do one of the following things: take any number of dice from the center and put it in front of you, or steal the set that someone else has taken. If you do, you must return at least one die to the center.\nThen go to the next person, who has the same options, until only one person doesn\u2019t have a set. They can either steal as normal, or take everything remaining in the center. In this way, everything will end up taken by someone.\nFor various reasons, his version didn\u2019t work. For one, it was TOO fair for what you were trying to do under the simple scoring system. Shortly after some playtests at a game design retreat, he moved back towards card games.\nYears later, I remembered that prototype, and how much I enjoyed that core idea. With his blessing I decided to take my own crack at using dice with that \u201csteal and reduce\u201d system.  I knew that I needed something that had less of a chance of being too fair, where you didn\u2019t know the exact value of each die. Additionally, in order to make sure there was a little more variation in rounds, I added a rule that when you steal another pile and return dice to the center, the die you threw back was rerolled. In that way, the set of dice you start the round with isn\u2019t always what you end up with. It even means that if the first player hates the initial roll, they can take EVERYTHING from the center, forcing someone to steal from them and reroll some of the dice.\nThese tweaks proved to be successful, as did including a Start Player marker in the set of dice to add extra texture. However, the real problem remained: what do you do with the dice once you have them, and how do you make it interesting?\nI tested different versions using tried and true scoring methods: majorities, area control, set collection, even a train game. None hit the mark until I returned to that same game design retreat. Playing other published games and talking with game designers was how I hit on the idea of making a center tableau of cards for purchase that cost different combinations of colors. Those cards in turn could be \u201cengine\u201d cards instead of just scoring methods. Turn one die into another kind. Turn dice into points. Buy extra cards on your turn. And so on.\nWhen figuring out all the possibilities of card costs I decided to make only four sides of the dice used to buy cards, so the other two could be special. One became a \u201cdelayed Wild\u201d (tokens that could be spent on future turns) and the other straight up Points.\nThe first prototype under this system I called \u201cSpell Dice\u201d since I used Magic Set Editor (software designed to create new Magic: the Gathering cards) to make it and it came with its own magical layout. Each card was a different magic item, so for instance the cards that scored in pairs became Magic Boots.\nI knew I had something from the first playtest. Players would know what cards were available to decide what they should value, and needed to balance between being too greedy and not capitalizing enough from each roll. There were decisions points to go for a specific card and strategy, or just bank Wilds and Points for future turns to stay adaptable. Once it was clear that players were going for a specific track, it became easier to tell which dice they cared about. \nI took the game on a tour of various game design conventions, including Metatopia, Unpub, and smaller events. It quickly became clear that the theme wasn\u2019t connecting: it didn\u2019t feel like you were casting spells and magic items didn\u2019t do what they sounded like. The next version I went Full Euro: the dice were resources like bricks and grain and the cards were different buildings you add to your village.\nThat was closer: the variety of card names connected to players easier. I had been showing it as \u201cVillage Dice,\u201d but that was giving players the impression it was closer to a light, short game ala Zombie Dice and Martian Dice, when it\u2019s a 45 minute-ish strategy game. It then became \u201cMarket Square\u201d for the next set of conventions, where it caught the attention of Tasty Minstrel Games, and we made the agreement for them to publish it. During development, we talked about changing it into a fantasy theme to fit into the same world as one of their other great games, Harbour.\nInstead of splitting resources, you were thieves splitting up the loot, and then using it to acquire various valuables, hideouts, and henchmen (such as a Gauntlet of Evil Intent or an Anthromorphic Water Buffalo) to increase your abilities and status as a thief. It has returned to the fantasy/magic theme, but in a way much more connected, with great names for the cards. It\u2019s also gained a criminal side, which given two of my previous games (Criminals and Heat) is marking me as a shady character of the game design world.\nOther than continuing to refine the game through more playtesting there was one more important step for me: I showed the near finished game to Kory Heath, who had created the core mechanism and inspired the whole thing. After the first game, he had just one word for me: Publish!\nThank you so much for taking the time to look through our project, and Thank You for Backing...it's because of You we get to keep bringing great games to your table.

However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games.\nIn Tiny Epic Western, you are the boss! And upon your boss card, you will keep track of your posse and your influence.\nYou'll be sending your posse members around town to play poker, gain influence, and purchase buildings.\nEach location offers compelling options of where to place your posse members. Like using a building there, gaining instant influence, or doubling down for extra influence at the risk of not getting any.  \nYou will play a poker hand at EACH location you send a posse member to.\nWinning will get you the \"poker pot\" and any extra influence from a \"double down\" spot. You will need this influence for acquiring buildings later on in the round.\nThe Sheriff's Office is a unique location offering players the ability to change the value or suit of their poker card. It also offers a way to acquire an extra building each round and even activate your 3rd posse member! \nBEWARE! If you're standing in the way of your opponent, they can send their posse member in for a duel and possibly take your spot!\nFighting doesn't go unnoticed around here, or unrewarded for that matter, it is the wild west after all. The winner of the last duel always takes the wanted card.\nAfter the locations have been resolved, and players have gained influence for their winning poker hands, a buying phase occurs. Players can now use their influence to acquire one building from a location where they have a posse member. Remember, hitting up the Sheriff's Office can get you an extra buy during this phase; that can be a real game changer!\nBuildings offer you victory points, access to their abilities, and industry influence. \nAt the end of each round, the player who had the best poker hand at the Town Hall advances one of three industries forward in their rank.\nAt the end of six rounds,or as many bullets as a revolver can hold, the game is over. The industries have now been ranked 1st through 3rd and the majority share holders (players with the most industry influence) will be paid bonus victory points respectively. Players add that to the sum of their victory points gained from acquired buildings, with the wanted player gaining an extra 2, and the player who has the most victory points is the winner!  \nClick to enlarge! *this stretch goal does not increase the card count of base or deluxe.\n                                             Upgrades the Premium Print 'N Play and will also be made public on BGG for all TEG players.

Every backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping is very expensive and is a cost we all need to share. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nRegarding customs: because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 and 2 copies, will not get hit with customs or import fees. The games will be delivered right to your door. We have shipped thousands and thousands of copies of Tiny Epic games to international backers without any occurrences. \nAll Add-Ons for this project are included in the reward tiers and/or will be handled AFTER the project within PledgeManager.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with Panda Game Manufacturing again. Having worked with them on over 10 separate projects, we have a great relationship with their entire team. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs.\n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked again. Having worked with them for over 3 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers. \n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

During the campaign, backers have been voting on content for 12 cards to include in the game. (Just like fair organizers, backers have been able to use their influence and supporters to get the exhibits they want into the game!)\nVoting on the final 2 cards, Midway tickets, will end an hour after the campaign ends. See Update #10 for details on how to vote.\nBackers have been voting on content for 12 cards during the campaign.\nWe finished the artwork for the first 8 selected cards during the campaign, ...\n... and the artwork for the other 4 will be revealed in Update #13.\nJames Edgcomb, BoardGameGeek reviewer \u2014 \"I really enjoyed this game. It plays fast, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s easy to pick up. ... Your choices are not easy, and there is more strategy than I would expect from this style of game.\" (link)\nWorld's Fair 1893 is an area majority and set collection game for 2-4 players that plays in about 40 minutes. On your turn, you send a supporter to one of the fives areas and collect all the cards next to it. Choose carefully to collect the cards you need and also beat out your opponents for control in the various areas:\nMain Exhibits - Influential Figures - Midway Tickets\nThe main exhibit cards could earn you the most points, but only if you have the supporters you need in the matching area to get the exhibits approved into the fair.\nFavors from the influential figure cards will increase your supporters in the areas and help you approve the exhibits you've already collected.\nThe Midway ticket cards for the fun and profitable attractions score you a small number of points and move the game forward.\nYou can download and read a draft version of the full rulebook:\nIf you want to play World's Fair 1893 to see if it's a good fit for you, you can use our print-and-play (PnP) files to make a prototype. It requires 16 sheets of card stock to assemble:\nErik Dewey, Indie Cardboard \u2014 \"There is interconnectedness to everything in World\u2019s Fair 1893 which keeps the gameplay strategic [and] increases its weight beyond what you might expect.\" (link)\nScot Eaton, designer of Blend Off from Thunderworks\n\"The best [at Gen Con] was definitely World's Fair 1893.

The artwork is beautiful, the cards are detailed, and the mechanics are relatively simple once we had played a few turns. ... World\u2019s Fair allows for plenty of competition, but also rewards second-place finishes, so it mostly avoids winner-take-all, cut-throat game play.\"\nPunching Cardboard, podcast episode (21:00-59:17)\n\"A lot of games could really learn something from [World's Fair 1893 about] flow. ...

He lives in Dallas, Texas with his wife and two young sons. He works as a web developer at a software company in his day job, and he will be handing the official communication for this campaign.\n\u2014 About the Artists \u2014\nBeth Sobel is an illustrator from Bellingham, Washington with an MFA in Painting from Savannah College of Art and Design. She illustrated our game Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, as well games from Stonemaier Games, AEG, Fantasy Flight, and more. In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, reading, and a weekly board game group.\nAdam McIver, owner of The Cre8tive Dept, works full-time as an artist and graphic designer in the gaming industry. His work can be seen in games from Crash Games, Dice Hate Me Games, Green Couch Games, and more. He lives in Cincinnati.\n\u2014 ORGANIZER \u2014\nFor the ORGANIZER pledge level, we contribute $8 towards shipping costs for all backers.

For any number more than one copy of the game, you should use the DOUBLE ORGANIZER pledge level. The pledge amount will be automatically calculated for two copies, but you can pledge an additional amount for additional copies. Here is a chart showing the total pledge for multiple copies:\nFoxtrot Games would not exist without the amazing support and enthusiasm from our Kickstarter backers. It has been so rewarding to have so many of you join us to publish this game, Relic Expedition, and Lanterns, to interact with you on BoardGameGeek and Twitter, and to meet some of you in person at conventions and at game stores.\nAndrew Brooks, Lanterns backer \u2014 \u201cTo me, the ideal of what Kickstarter can achieve is a community of people supporting a vision they believe in and want to become a reality. Being a part of the Lanterns campaign and seeing the joy it brought to many (including the creators) proved to me that this ideal is still possible.\u201d\nThe Fisherman - Electric Fountains - Windmills\nThis project contains a number of items that might typically be added only as \"stretch goals.\" However, we are including these all right from the start: to reduce the risk of new artwork delays, to give you the best value we can, to thank you for backing early and for joining us for the full campaign experience, and to show you how much we believe in this game: \nUpgraded cards (310 gsm, linen finish)\nMore variety in Transportation card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Manufacturing card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Agriculture card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Fine Arts card art (7 new illustrations)\nMore variety in Electricity card art (7 new illustrations) \nMore variety in Midway card art (27 new illustrations)\nWooden Ferris wheel car marker (custom)\nFerris Wheel Car Photo \u2014 Ferris Wheel Car Marker\nWe are fortunate that our previous game Lanterns: The Harvest Festival did well on Kickstarter and has continued to sell well since. This has given us some profits that we can afford to put into World's Fair 1893 to include these additions right from the start \u2014 while still keeping the project's funding goal low.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing thousands of board games is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor.

Scroll down for more info!\nIt's a race to the finish when some super-smart, yet somehow clueless, engineering students invent rocket-powered skis and decide to test them out at Yeti Mountain!\nIn Avalanche at Yeti Mountain, players play dual-use cards \u2014 the same cards used to make up the ski slopes of Yeti Mountain \u2014 to determine their speed in a race down the mountain. If players collectively exceed the speed limit, which is determined by the number of players, the fastest players crash only moving one space forward towards the goal. Players may also activate rocket jumps to overshoot the competition but at the expense of causing an avalanche to begin chasing them down the mountain. If that's not enough tension, rocket jumps are possible only if the Yeti, awoken from his slumber by all of the rocket-powered racket, doesn't attack and deactivate players' rocket-powered skis! The last skier standing, or the skier who makes it to the bottom of Yeti Mountain, wins the game.\nGame setup for 4 players!\nAvalanche at Yeti Mountain is sticking to the Green Couch Games mantra of making \"great little games that make great big connections\". This small box card game appeals to a wide audience, satisfying gamers and families (and even SOLO players), creating a social experience while jockeying for the best position by managing your cards wisely. \nAvalanche at Yeti Mountain is a game for 1 to 5 players, ages 10 and up and plays in about 20-30 minutes. The game is designed by Matt Wolfe, designer of Wombat Rescue from Eagle-Gryphon Games and regular contributor to The Geek All-Stars Podcast.\nCheck out this rules overview from designer, Matt Wolfe:\nClick the image for more info from Update #4!\n                   Click the images to see the full reviews!\n\"I think this game is great. It's not just about the card you play but also the card your opponent plays. There were many times I tried to rocket jump hoping my opponents played low cards only to break the speed limit and crash. The Yeti allows the players further from the bottom to catch up by preventing players from rocket jumping the next turn. This helps to combat a poor start draw. The avalanche is a big equalizer too. If you and your opponents try to rocket jump a lot, you increase the avalanche speed and could end up getting crushed by it...The replay factor is really great too.\" -Aaron Kuzava on BoardGameGeek.com\n                              \"Green Couch Games has been publishing what it calls \"great little games.\" They're small-box games, usually without a lot of complicated components, and are generally fairly easy to pick up and play. So far they've published Fidelitas and successfully funded two more, Best Treehouse Ever and JurassAttack, all three of which I've reviewed here on GeekDad. I think Avalanche at Yeti Mountain goes nicely with the others: it's a quick game both to learn and to play, and has a mix of luck and strategy without having so many choices that it gets bogged down.\" -Jonathan Liu from Geek Dad\n\"Avalanche at Yeti Mountain is an excellent example of an otherwise simple game neck-deep in immersive theme and engaging artwork. I am a fan of everything coming from Green Couch Games lately, and this is no exception. They are doing the best job of releasing silly, cartoony games into the world, bar none.\" -Daniel Zayas' First Impression on The Meeple Mechanic\n  \"Avalanche at Yeti Mountain slides effortlessly into the stable of Green Couch Games\u2019 numerous filler-style titles, cramming a good amount of decision making and delightful illustrations into a small package. I highly recommend you to check it out; anything else would simply be abominable.\" - Dan Halstad, League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"Avalanche at Yeti Mountain is a fun little race! The boys and I had fun wiping each other out or trying to guess when it would be a good time to rocket jump! Green Couch Games delivers another fun filler! \" -Jeremiah Isley from Theology of Games \n\"Avalanche at Yeti Mountain is a fast, fun race game that can go anywhere, and that anyone can play.

The demand for the game has been astounding and the game has quickly sold out at most retailers. We are pouring the profit from the first printing back into the reprint, but we can use a little bit of additional help.\nNote that you may be able to find the game at your game store and if you do we suggest you pick it up! But the packs and additional content you can still back right here.\nSo what's new this time?\nCustom Threat Markers from our friends at\nThe base game of Hostage Negotiator comes with 3 Abductors as you can see above. Now along with the basic Red Threat Marker that comes with the game, you can have a custom Meeple for each Abductor!!!! These will not come with the retail version of the game.\nAND ALSO...\nNegotiator Cards: Series 2\nAn All New set of Negotiator cards! These cards are open to be sponsored by YOU, the backers, and if you missed out on getting your own Negotiator card the first time, this is your chance! We will work with you and our artist to create a new Negotiator card in your image (or someone else's image if you prefer).\nWe are providing the first Negotiator Card courtesy of the recent \"Save 1,000 Hostages Solocon Challenge. There are opportunities for 7 male and 7 female Negotiators by backing at one of the $200 pledge levels. (Note, some of these may be allocated off site and if so, the limits here will be reduced)\nExample Negotiator Card (from Series 1):\nFor those of you interested in the first Series of Negotiator cards, you can purchase them from the BGG store soon. http://boardgamegeekstore.com/\nNow if you are new to the game, let's take a look at the back of the box so you can understand what all the excitement is about...\nWe wanted to make sure you had the critical information such as player count, length of play, recommended minimum age, and, of course, what comes in the box!\nObject of the Game: Your goal as a Hostage Negotiator is to save the hostages and have the crisis end with the Abductor\u2019s capture or elimination. To win, at least half of the hostages must escape with their lives AND the Abductor must be captured or eliminated.\nThe Game plays over multiple turns with each turn being comprised of 3 phases.\n1. The Conversation Phase - this is where you play and resolve conversation cards from your hand by making a Threat Roll to influence the Abductor's Threat Level, earn Conversation Points, and save hostages. Thematically, this phase represents the back and forth dialogue between you and the abductor. Perhaps a calm conversation... or... a tense and heated exchange depending on the cards played and the results. It could also represent actions such as sending in a field team to extract some hostages while you occupy the abductor.\n2. The Spend Phase - this is your chance to spend any Conversation Points you may have earned in the Conversation Phase. Similar to a deck building game you will buy cards from the available area on the table, but in this game all the cards you buy go directly into your hand for use in the next or another future turn. Thematically this represents the conversational equity you've built up with the Abductor by influencing him (or her!) and/or keeping him on the phone longer so you and your command can plan a potential use of force!\n3. The Terror Phase - this is where you will draw and resolve a Terror Card. In general, bad things will happen putting pressure on the Threat Level or worse... losing one or more hostages. Thematically this represents the Abductor's (or sometimes another individual such as a hostage's) actions between conversations. Maybe the Abductor decides he/she is angry or that you are not listening to his demands. Or maybe a hostage attempts to escape! The number of cards in the Terror Deck are limited to represent the ticking of the clock... after all, the Abductor has only given you a limited amount of time to meet his/her demands!\nThe above is only a general summary of play, but we hope it gives you a good idea of the game. There are other details not discussed here such as Demands, the Pivotal Event Terror Card, the 2nd in Command, and more!

We designed the items and monsters for both dungeons to play nice with each other - mix and match cards from the two to design your own dungeons!\nBack this campaign and receive a unique Kickstarter promo card per deck and save $1 off the retail price! Pledge for both decks and get another $1 off and save on shipping!\nSmall Footprint - Ever want to play a deck-builder but not have to lug around a giant box? 100 Swords is the same size as a traditional poker deck, both in terms of card count and box size. Those 54 cards include everything you need to play - 18 starter cards, 3 rentals, and 33 cards in the dungeon (including items, monsters, and its infamous boss).\nEasy to Learn - There are only 2 types of cards in 100 Swords; items and monsters. Learning the game only takes minutes, and once you know it, teaching it takes half as long. The rules of the game are a straight foward take on classic deck-builders with some interesting quirks thrown in that mix the genre up in new and interesting ways.\nTactical Gameplay - Each turn in 100 Swords is a puzzle where you do your best to use every card as optimally as possible. You'll have to use every bit of info you have to not waste any resources and play the best possible turn, every turn.\nHidden Information - When you first step into the dungeon, every card you'll be interacting with will be face-down. As the game progresses, cards will change from hidden to revealed and back again. As the dungeon shifts from players defeating monsters and acquiring items, you'll be wracking your brain to remember if that card you're moving to is that awesome sword, or a powerful monster.\n\"Having to literally explore the marketplace of cards....gives you a surprising amount to think about!.... Incredibly thematic.\"\nRichard Ham - Rhado Runs Through\n\"The art, humor, and game play in 100 Swords comes together to form a delightful dungeon delve. Elements like item rental and using your equipment as energy are clever and the deck building makes me feel like I'm improving my bag of tricks to tackle the dungeon. I recommend this for anyone looking for a light hearted deck builder that plays quickly.\"\nSuzanne - Dice Tower Contributor\n\"I think this would be an excellent game to teach somebody the ropes of how to play a deck building game.... A whole lot of puzzle solving greatness in one tiny box!.... The possibilities of expansions are literally limitless.\"\nUndead Viking\n\"....A great gateway game to deckbuilding. Very few deckbuilders have an ability to be simple, but offer challenging choices and situations and I think 100 Swords does that very well.... My 10 year old loved saying \"I'm using this crappy sword\" which was pretty funny.\" \nTox - Crits Happen\n\"100 Swords is a great balance between luck and light strategy. I love when a turn comes together and you get more equipment room after room. Of course, finding a big baddie and taking him down or sneaking by him and getting more stuff is fun too, as long as my opponent isn't able to get by the monster!\"\nKen - Geek-craft.com\nCheck out the full Across the Board Games preview here!\n\"100 Swords is a satisfying and fun romp through a dungeon without the tediousness of a classic dungeon crawl.\"\nAcross the Board Games\nCurious how the game works? Check out our video below! You can also download the rules here.\nEach turn, you'll be playing cards to move into, and interact with the dungeon. A lot can happen on a given turn, maybe you'll find some cool items? Or maybe you'll run into some tough monsters?\nWhen you play cards for movement, you can move up to that many rooms deeper into the dungeon. But when you play a card for movement, strength, or energy, any unspent points are zeroed out, so it's important to move, acquire and attack efficiently!\nYou'll also be using the cards in your hand to defeat those monsters, and acquire items. Acquired items will end up in your deck, which in turn will make you more powerful and more able to defeat stronger monsters! Many items also have effects that are important to consider.\nDeciding when and how to use the cards in your hand and which cards in the dungeon to acquire or defeat is the key to winning 100 Swords!\nWhen the dungeon deck has too few cards to refresh the dungeon, or when you defeat the boss, the game is over! And remember, it's all about the gold! At the end of the game the player whose cards are worth the most gold wins!\nCheck out this walkthrough to see the game in action:\nRichard Ham of Rhado Runs Through is awesome and put together this great gameplay runthrough below!

They're only $6 each, and we designed our Dungeon Builder Sets to be used in two ways:\nThe first is easy, choose your favorite dungeon, slap on the Dungeon Builder Set's items and monsters, choose which boss you want to play with, and get to it! Now your dungeon is longer, and has new cards that change up gameplay. Adding a Dungeon Builder Set to a dungeon will lengthen playtime up to 10 minutes. If you have both decks and both sets, you have a lot of variants to play with!\nThe second way you can use a Dungeon Builder Set is to make your own dungeon from scratch! Take cards from the two dungeons and the two sets, construct your own dungeon dive, and compete with friends!\nIn this Kickstarter, we're giving you the Dungeon Builder Sets for two dollars off retail price, and we think they're a great value! Be sure to check out the Deck and Set Card Lists to see what each set comes with!\nWe\u2019ve got this awesome new premium playmat available as an add-on. We produced multiple playmats for our campaign for Shift, and we were super happy with their quality! They have a smooth polyester surface with a rubber base to prevent slippage. You do a lot of card sliding in this game, so we\u2019re pretty stoked for this one! : D It\u2019s $18 through this campaign ($20 post campaign). It\u2019s been added to the Pledge Calculator for all reward tiers. Both players use the same mat, so you'll only need one!\nIf you back at any tier that includes the game, you'll be receiving this awesome 100 Swords sticker for free! It's designed to fit on the standard and 100+ Ultra PRO deck boxes for all of your storage needs. If you want more than one sticker, add $1 to your pledge for each extra!\nThe Darkness Dungeon Builder Set has been unlocked! That\u2019s a brand new final 15 card set!

It was even published in Brazil by our friends at Funbox Jogos!\nIn Spring 2014, we Kickstarted a microgame called Province, which has sold nearly 10,000 copies to date. It was also our first game to reach stores. Province tackled the challenge of making a competitive two-player micro eurogame. We think it's pretty swell. Other people seem to agree!\nThe following Fall, we brought our micro ameritrash game, Shadow of the Elder Gods, to Kickstarter. In it, 1-4 players work together to stop a deck of eldritch threats from bringing about the end of all things.

Gather resources to add buildings with new actions, and launch ships to go whaling. Go out longest for the best choice, but wait too long and the whales become harder to catch. And don't forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance risk management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.\nNew Bedford is a game for 1-4 players, ages 13 and up, and designed by Nat Levan. New Bedford is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone, and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\nIf you'd like to know more about the design process behind New Bedford, designer Nat Levan has extensively chronicled the game's development on the Oakleaf Games blog. Nat also sat down with the Dice Hate Me crew on episode 74 of The State of Games podcast to talk about the game; the New Bedford portion begins at the 25 minute mark.\nA bit more detail: Over twelve rounds, players take turns placing their two workers. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: Taking goods (food, wood, and brick), selling goods, constructing buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus of more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.\nMost buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay you to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.\nYou need to spend food to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common - an historical reflection of the toll that whaling had on the environment. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the \"lay\") must be paid in order to keep the gathered whales.\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into New Bedford, you can download the print-and-play version of the game right here: (Components and Rules).The PnP includes all the buildings, whales, the town board, the player boards and the whaling board. You'll need to provide bits to represent the wood, food, brick, meeples, ships, and money (cubes, coins, toy boats - whatever you'd like).\nNew Bedford will offer the same hallmark replay value as other Dice Hate Me titles from Greater Than Games, with high-quality components, thick punchboard bits, and lots and lots of wood. Here's a list of what you'll find inside the box:\nBase Game Components\nNew Bedford will come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Rooster\"-sized box - the same size as Compounded and VivaJava Dice. What's this crazy talk? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nIn addition, backers at any level may add $6 to their pledge to receive a copy of Nantucket. This is a small, 2-player game with a whaling theme also designed by Nat Levan.\nNantucket takes you to \"The Little Grey Lady of the Sea\" during the early American whaling industry. You need just a few cards and coins to play in whatever port you find yourself. Mix and match two cards to form the modular board. Then use your single action each round to carefully build the town and send out ships. After performing your actions, flip the coins on your ship to catch a whale. Play until the town is fully constructed, supplies run out, or the last whales are taken. Between buildings and earned coins, may the best captain win!\nIt will be available after the campaign for $9.95, but is available to backers of this campaign only for $6, and will not increase your shipping charges. Check out this update for more information, or click here to access the Print and Play!\nIf this project funds, we will be able to make an incredibly fun game. By way of thanks, we will be sending every single backer a copy of the White Whale Promo! This promo pack adds four super-rare items to the whaling bag, including The White Whale, which destroys a ship if caught!\nIn addition to this promo pack, which will be sent to every single backer, we have some additional awesome content that we'll be able to include free of charge to every backer if we exceed our funding goal:\n$25,000 - Funded!

We've planned stretch goals out through $80,000, which will be the final stretch goal point for this campaign. Thanks for supporting New Bedford!\nAs with previous campaigns, we unfortunately have to charge shipping on this campaign, but are continuing to work to minimize the shipping cost to you. Shipping on this campaign is priced as follows:\nUS: $9\nCanada: $14\nEU: $35\nOther: $50\nFor customers in Canada, the EU, and Australia, this includes customs duties and import taxes, but it does not for other countries.\nWe know that international shipping is annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have work-arounds.You can add additional copies of New Bedford, including all stretch goals, to your pledge for +$29, and the shipping rates are fixed regardless of the number of games. If you have a bunch of friends who want to support this project, just make one group pledge for as many games as you\u2019d like, and you'll all receive every stretch goal!\nBy 1848, the city of New Bedford in Massachusetts had become the most powerful city in the whaling industry and was soon to be one of the richest cities in the world. Whale oil exported from New Bedford helped to fuel the world and, eventually, usher in the Industrial Revolution; in time, it would be referred to as \"the city that lit the world\".\nIn 1841, Herman Melville sailed out from New Bedford working as a whaler on the ship Acushnet. His experiences in whaling eventually lead him to write the novel Moby-Dick. It was published in 1851, and New Bedford is the initial setting for the novel.\nHistoric New Bedford\n\"The theme is wonderful and absolutely fitting. It\u2019s well integrated and unique... The bottom line... New Bedford is a town worth visiting.\" - John Moller, Cartrunk Entertainment (click to read his full review)\n\u201cBefore I even had the chance to crack open New Bedford, the game caught my attention because someone had mentioned that it was like a more concise and elegant version of Le Havre. While I\u2019ll agree that the two games do share some similarities, saying that New Bedford is essentially Le Havre light does it a great disservice. New Bedford offers its own unique experience that feels fresh and not borrowed.\u201d - Kyle Chivers, Euro Board Game Blog (click to read his full review)\n\"New Bedford does a lot of things right - but the best thing about the game is that it is one of those games that is easy to both learn and teach, but will surprise you with its depth after you dive in for subsequent plays.\" - James Flemming, Board Game Reviews by Josh (click to read his full review)\n\u201cBeyond the theme, I like New Bedford for several game-play reasons. I am reminded of Puerto Rico from the standpoint that players can score through the staple process of whaling as well as from buying buildings to augment the town of New Bedford. Likewise, New Bedford includes the worker-placement-building quality of Le Havre with buildings that facilitate collecting materials, constructing buildings, or sending out whaling ships. I actually find New Bedford cleaner and more elegant than Le Havre.\u201d - Paul Owen, Man Overboard (click to see more comments)\n\u201cSolid worker placement game. The two different elements to the game, building the village and the whaling, complement each other nicely. I got to play this at Grand Con at an Unpub event. Multiple victory paths and some interesting combos can be made with some of the village tiles. Can't wait for this one to come out.\u201d - David Taylor, To the Table\n\u201cWhen I played New Bedford when it was printer paper and glue I fell in love with the concept and game play. Now that I see the final product the game has been brought to life in a whole new way and still sits in my top five to play as two player with my hubby or with a group of friends!\u201d - Lesley Louder, The Chalkboard Gamer\n\"New Bedford has all the strategizing of a game like Agricola without the stress. It wonderfully meshes worker placement, town building, and tile drawing in such a way that it plays fast without comprising any depth.\u201d - Scott King, game photographer and blogger\n\"Such a smooth, engaging gaming experience. New Bedford is a great low-cost-of-entry euro that has enough game for game night, but is still completely accessible for my family.\" - Matt Riddle, co-designer of Fleet and person of no consequence\n\"When I played this game at an Unpub over a year ago, I was unsure if I would like a game about whaling. That was quickly proven wrong, and I told Nat when he was done with New Bedford I wanted a copy of it.\" - Derrick Vidal, Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\u201cFrom the moment I sat down with New Bedford and took my first turn, I knew that I was seeing something special. While I\u2019ve had the privilege of playing several games in the Unpub program, only a few of them make me want to drop money on the spot. New Bedford was exactly that. The cool thing is, I\u2019ve only seen it get even better! Take my money now!\u201d - Greg Miller, Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\"One of those rare occasions where everyone at the table was lost in the world and loving every minute.\" - Josh Mills, game designer\nNew Bedford\u2019s design was influenced by a time when whaling was a part of daily life - and that eventually lead to a modern crisis for many species of whales. To make it clear, we don\u2019t condone modern whaling. But we think that the history of New Bedford and the whaling industry is an important subject. Just like our chemistry game, Compounded, we believe that games designed for entertainment can also be educational - and, in this case, foster discussion about a controversial topic. For more information on modern whaling and conservation efforts, please check out this overview from the World Wildlife Fund.\nNat & Chris\nWe knew that the theme of historic whaling could be considered a bit controversial by some, but we believe in New Bedford and in the theme. As Herman Melville once wrote about his novel, Moby-Dick, \"To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.\" We think New Bedford is a mighty little game, and we are proud to present it to all of you. Thanks, as always, for the continued support for Dice Hate Me Games from our Kickstarter family. You continue to amaze and humble us.\nLet's keep sailing,\nChris & Nat", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBefore the merger of Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games, a previous version of New Bedford was on Kickstarter, only to see its campaign canceled. There were many reasons for the decision to cancel the project at that time, which was discussed on episode 76 of the State of Games podcast. However, we believe that the most important reason was to make the game much better. We believe that we have done so, and are thrilled to re-launch the game at this time. However, there is a risk that people will not be willing to take another look at this fantastic game.\n\nAdditionally, as with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "Errata Tiles", "update_content": "Greetings Backers!\nBy now, all of you *should* have gotten your errata tiles if you selected that option in BackerKit.

If you do not already have the original meeples, the $48 pledge level would give you 1-of-each of all 32 factions from the original game and the Heroes' Call expansion.\nYou could then use the standard meeples that come with the game, just as you normally would, and then use our lovely Character Meeples (which match the art for each faction) to represent your 32 heroes.\nOption B (The Complete Upgrade):\nYou may already be playing your copy of Tiny Epic Kingdoms with our fabulous 112-piece Character Set. Your love of everything Tiny Epic is unparalleled! You are ready to complete your set with another 112-piece set of Character Meeples for the 16 new factions of Heroes' Call! The complete sets of Character Meeples are 7-piece sets of each faction, with two pledge levels to pick from, depending on whether or not you already have the original 112-piece set or not.\nBy choosing this option, you are completely replacing the stock meeples with Meeple Source Character Meeples. This expansion incorporates heroes though, which are currently being represented by a larger solid color meeple. We wanted to come up with a way to distinguish your hero as such, without compromising the Character Meeple art that perfectly matches the game itself. Understanding the importance of being able to identify a hero as such at just a glance, we have decided to include 32 gold-colored wooden pedestals (for free) with your complete set of meeples, for your heroes to stand on. In testing this concept, we simply used a single drop of super glue under each foot of the meeple, which did the trick. Another option that some of you may choose would be to hand paint the base color (the sides/edge of the meeple) another color, such as gold or silver, to differentiate your hero from the others. In any case, we will not be painting or gluing your hero meeples for you, but allowing you to choose how to give your distinguished heroes the recognition they deserve!\nAs of July 14th, we do currently have a limited number of the 16-piece sets of original TEK Character Meeples and the 112-piece complete sets of original TEK Character Meeples, available for immediate shipping (separate from your Kickstarter pledge) at MeepleSource.com.\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL.

But you don't have to take that from them! You will have ample time to plan around these attacks and there are special protective Dome Shields that can be activated by spending Neutronium as a fuel source.

Collect them all!\nThe more Followers and Likes we can accumulate means the more people know about our projects, which equals more awesome content in every game! THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nAll rewards for this project will be shipped from the USA.\nDelivering Your Reward Responsibly\nOur number one goal and responsibility is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for. Gamelyn Games brings years of experience to this project and has overseen all of our planning and arrangements to ensure Darkrock Ventures will be delivered to all backers in a timely manner just like all of their previous projects.\nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, just as much every pledge makes a difference, regardless of amount. Unfortunately shipping costs are something we all have to face, but that does not mean we cannot be transparent about this challenge and tackle it responsibly. The learning experiences Gamelyn Games has overcome with shipping have come to this campaign in full, and we aim to manage our (and your) risk in a responsible and professional manner.\nShipping costs are a very real factor. They can be volatile and are never trivial. Further, I do not feel that claiming to offer \"Free Shipping\" only to hide that very real & significant cost somewhere else is the best way of doing things and our backers deserve better. We have decided to offer affordable FLAT-RATE shipping to various regions, but at the same time offer CUSTOMS-FRIENDLY shipping available to ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD through our friends at Ship Naked to offer the best overall value we can for your pledge.\nWe will always endeavor to keep shipping charges as low as possible by offering discounts on pledges for more than one copy at a time through campaign rewards and add-ons made available through Pledge Manager. The best way to get the game for the lowest cost possible is to split a multi-pack with some friends or family members, everyone can share the cost benefit and more copies ordered means Darkrock Ventures itself will become a better game.\nRegarding Customs: Our shipping partner, Ship Naked, offers what they call \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping\" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. While we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in Ship Naked's ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. Historically, Gamelyn Games has had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. Pledge with Confidence!\nInternational Backers Please Keep in Mind: While the shipping costs outside the USA are greater, every base copy of the game will be sold $11 below MSRP through this campaign, with discounts even greater when multiple copies are ordered. Plus, you are guaranteed to get the game before general retailers AND with all bonus content which may never be available at retail at all. Making you pledge in this campaign your BEST VALUE for the complete Darkrock Ventures experience! Get some friends together to split a multi-pack to maximize the value for your pledge!\nClick the image to see an interview with the Designer of Darkrock Ventures!\n                                                                                                                                                                  Michael Eskue is the designer of Darkrock Ventures, as well as many other awesome games such as the TableTop-featured Council of Verona from Crash Games. Michael is an experienced designer and we hope you'll agree he has outdone himself with Darkrock Ventures!\nMeet the Rest of the Team!\nNot pictured: all of the outstanding fans, reviewers, playtesters, and backers! (Sorry, there wasn't enough room for everyone!)\nAll Add-Ons for this project are included in the reward tiers and/or will be handled AFTER the campaign within PledgeManager. There are no separate Add-Ons during the campaign.\nIf you'd like to add additional copies of the game to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, you will be able to do so within PledgeManager after this Kickstarter campaign ends. \nPlease do not add to your KS pledge for add-ons, you will pay for them in PledgeManager.\nWant extra copies after the campaign ends?

It is prone to many mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe at Magic Meeple Games are new to publishing, but not to the industry; and with Gamelyn games are our publishing partner, we're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic design over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated. All we need now is your pledges to make it happen!\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer Gamelyn Games has used to create all of their previous projects. Gamelyn Games and Magic Meeple Games both have a great relationship with their team, we are very familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together, we have created some great games and products and we hope that Darkrock Ventures will be our next!\n\n3. Professional distribution is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They have been responsible for the fulfillment of previous Gamelyn Games titles. All of which were delivered on schedule reliably and professionally. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers and they have extended the same level of service and expertise to Magic Meeple Games' publications as well. \n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project is immune to the possible mishap, they can happen to anyone but we want to show that this road is familiar to all parties involved and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. Thank you for your confidence and support!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible. \n\nWe will be present daily during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! We couldn't do it without you!

The main deck consist of 40 \"Players\" (10 types in 4 colors) and while drafting you're looking to make color combos amongst the available cards for that round.

Thanks Erik!!!\n \"I am an active sports enthusiast. Football is one of my passions . As a fan I have attended the NFL Draft for 10 years , the Super Bowl and the NFL Pro Bowl as recent as January in Phoenix ,so I take my football seriously! I recently was introduced to Pigskin. This card game of strategy was fun. After a couple of hands I started to create my own playing style while focusing on the details of football with intensity.\"\n-Jake Barber (Life long sports fan and former radio personality)\nCLOAK AND MEEPLE:\n       Pigskin is a complete game as is so your pledge is supporting the 2 years of development that has gone into bringing you a well tested game. There are NO game play related stretch goals to unlock BUT let's see what we can do about more artwork!\n      There are 3 Social Media Stretch Goals\n1: More Twitter Follower, More Quarterbacks!\n@RoarArtGames is currently at 960 Twitter Followers, this is really amazing considering I am new to the world of publishing. What I am pushing for is to reach 1,300 Twitter Followers and EACH color will have their own Quarterback drawing. Right now each Quarterback card has the same drawing, if @RoarArtGames can reach 1,300 followers than that changes to each color having their own unique Quarterback! This one is going to take all we've got so make sure to please pass the information along.\n2: More Facebook Likes, More Defensive Players!\nLowered from 100 likes!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RoarArtGames currently has 63 likes, which is considerably amazing due to the fact that I do not utilize it enough. I'm a 50-60 hour-a-week working man with a little baby at home, my hours are very limited. But if we can get 75 likes on the Facebook page for Roar Art Games each color will have their own unique Defensive Player drawing! It seems impossible BUT there is no such thing as impossible. Impossible is a mispronunciation of I'm Possible. Let's do this!\n3: Hashtag and Tweet for more Offensive Players!\nWe did it!!!!\n      This one is a little more trickier BUT is the easiest to reach. Starting July 10th I will be counting the hashtags on Twitter #PigskinStretchGoals. Each time you use the hashtag be sure to add @RoarArtGames so I know who you are. An example would be: \"It cost nothing to support #PigskinStretchGoals and you could win a prize from @RoarArtGames.\" If we can reach 250 hashtags then each color will have their own unique Offensive Player drawing! The other great part of this one is that everyone who uses the hashtag will be entered into a drawing to receive upgraded point tokens! As long as you use the hashtag once, you're in the drawing. The number of times you use the hashtag will not affect your chances of winning. The upgraded tokens are composite material with a sticker applied to both sides. 2 winners will be selected after the campaign is ended and we have reached our funding goal!\n      The total hash tag count was 380+! There will be more artwork for the offense player cards! YAY!!!!\nThese may seem difficult to reach but if we all work together we can get it done! If you're willing to get the extra yardage for the team then I'm willing to add more flavor to the game art! Now any combination of these may get unlock and have no effect on game play but it'll be great to see if we can make this a reality!\nOne line at a time\n       I am both game designer and artist on Pigskin, I tend to be more of an artist over a designer though. I've always enjoyed creating my own art and am a big fan or cartoons. My style of artwork tends to be very cartoony and over the top. For Pigskin I went through several different design ideas before settling on what is now in the game.\n      Graphic design and user friendly design was always at the forefront from very early so as the game developed mechanically it also developed artistically. I have been drawing my entire life and enjoy making games with my artwork. The artwork is practically completed with minor changes to make. The stretch goals for the campaign may unlock more artwork as well.\nDetails about the artistic process\nTook a little more than a season...\nThe evolution of a Quarterback\n       Pigskin started in development about 2 years ago as a game looking to mix poker and Football. Mechanically it was very basic and ultimately was okay just not dynamic enough. Throughout 2013 I would make minor changes and play test it here and there just to get a feel for what were the major problems with the game. In that same time I also was playing a lot more games especially card games.\n       2014 was a big year for me personally as that is when my daughter was born. I worked on a ton of different game designs and would still tinker with Pigskin from time to time. The main idea of a deck of players and Touchdown tokens was always at the core but creating good synergy between the cards was very difficult. It went from being a clunky 2 on 2 game, to a deckbuilder and even an expansive idea with a tournament style game play until finally getting into the groove that it's at now.\n      2015 has been an improvement process for Pigskin as each play test helped refine it more and more until finally getting to it's current streamlined, user friendly state. Throughout all the changes though it's been a passion for me from day one and I am so proud to have put in all the work to finally bring it to you.\n      I also want to take this time to give a big shout out to The St. Louis Board Game Designer MeetUp group who have been amazing for the community and continue to push game design. Thank you!\n      Click here to read an fantastic interview I did with The Inquisitive Meeple to get a better idea of the design process and who I am!\nMore than just a Kickstarter campaign\n      I have always been an overweight person and although comfortable with my body size I had a stark discovery one night. I was getting ready to go out to a board game night and had 2 shirts not fit me! It was a real eye opener for how I had been eating/living and I needed to make a change. So part of doing this Kickstarter campaign I've decided to challenge myself by committing to losing 18 lbs through out the duration of the Kickstarter campaign.\n      I welcome everyone else to do the same if they so choose. Please post any updates or tips you have in the comments. I will be posting results as well. :)\n      I'm starting this campaign at 270 lbs so by the end of it I'm working to be 252 lbs. It will certainly be a challenge but one I am looking forward to as we march towards victory.\n       I am a proud father to a lovely little girl and proud husband to a very fantastic hard working woman. I've been playing hobby games for 4-5 years now and regularly attend both a Board Game MeetUp group and a Board Game Designer MeetUp group. I live in the great city of St. Louis, MO which is quickly becoming a creative hub for game design in America.\n      I spent 10 years of my life playing in punk rock bands in Texas and fully embrace the D.I.T (Do It Together) lifestyle. I carry that spirit with me into game design as I look to produce games that have \"cross over\" themes and fun artwork. It's been 10+ years in the making and I'm looking forward to working together to make fantastic games for you and your family.\nSend me a friend request! Let's talk about games!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/roaranimation\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RoarArtGames\nOn Twitter @RoarArtGames\n            In this section I'll be clearing up any questions you may be wondering as far as the \"nuts and bolts\" of this campaign is concerned.\nHow is the game being manufactured?\nThe cards/rules/tokens are being printed in the US. The Touchdown Tokens are per-manufactured and are available at wholesale. The game will be produced by hand and shipped out. Don't be too surprised if I write a personal thank you letter as well :) \nI don't like/understand the game of Football, could I still play this game?\nPigskin uses Football as a theme but the game play is not simulating a real Football game. You don't need to know anything about Football to enjoy this game. I would heavily suggest you read the rules first and then decide for yourself if it's something you'd want to back. The game mechanics are light-euro mechanics wrapped up in a Football package. :)\nWhy is this a US only game?\nShort and simple: Shipping. I'd like for Pigskin to have as large an audience as possible and am fully aware that American Football is vastly gaining popularity in other countries BUT from a logistical point of view it can be very messy to ship to other countries. If you are interested in this game please look into the Print and Play because it's honestly much cheaper than for me to charge ($20-$40) for shipping. Once you have the Print and Play make as many copies as you want. :)\nCard/Token quality?\n305gsm black-core matte card stock - Same as Magic: The Gathering cards\n60 point (0.06 inches) thick chipboard for the tokens", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risk involved are at a minimum. 80-85% of Table Top Kickstarter campaigns end up costing more than what was raised which means the creator either has to fail to deliver or pay the rest out of pocket. Neither of those scenarios sit well with me so I took a very simple approach to this campaign. I am working only with printers I have worked with before and am ordering from within the US. I am planning on a small production run and am only printing what is backed. There's no freight charges or shipping containers to factor in.\n\n I've spent 10+ years making albums, T-shirts, promo cd's, flyers and posters in this same way so I am over qualified to bring you a game you're going to enjoy for years. My name is Royce Banuelos and you'll always have a direct way to reach me.

You can be the king of the ring with this thing! 10\" x 15\" with 1/8\" rubber backing!\nIn JurassAttack!, two players face-off in an epic head-to-head dinosaur battle!\nIn this quick card game, each player chooses a dinosaur or pack of dinosaurs from their hand, then reveals them simultaneously to compare Ferocity values to see who has the highest. Each of these prehistoric pugilists have their own special abilities, combo possibilities and varying score values to add to the tide of battle! After resolving the special abilities of each dino, the winner adds their rival's dinosaurs to their score pile while the loser gets to draw new cards. A well-placed bluff or an intentional loss may provide an edge to victory in this game of subtle strategy and prehistoric pounding!\nSome dinos hunt alone while others may pack (be played in sets) with dinos of different types. Some dinos have acid spit that blinds the other player for a turn while others take a swing on the way to their opponent's score pile. And sometimes, players may be able to sneak some of their precious eggs into their own score pile to protect the future generation.\n Check out this how to play video and review from To The Table:\nNEW!

There are a couple reasons for that. \n1. We want to get this game made and get it to production quickly after the campaign closes. By wrapping up the project a little earlier, we'll be able to get the game to the printer more quickly which leads to faster delivery to you!\n2. A short campaign might help us avoid the mid-campaign slump. There is a time in every campaign when things really slow down so we are experimenting with a shorter campaign to cut down on the amount of time spent in the valley.\n3. It's a small game at it's core so we want to keep it that way. While we have some Stretch Goals planned (see below) to add value to the game, we really think that one of the things that is so special about this game is that it packs a big punch for being such a small game. So with a shorter campaign, we'll try to avoid too much time for our collective braintrust to make this thing into something we didn't intend. We're not interested in experimenting with genetically modified dinosaurs...we saw how that worked out. \nSo a quick campaign for a quick game. That's the plan. We're sticking with it but we'll need your help more than ever to help us get the word out, far and wide, to help us connect with backers that will enjoy JurassAttack! \nClick the images below to go straight to the source!\nAll Us Geeks interviewed Ryan on The Game of Crowdfunding Podcast right here!\n                             \"JurassAttack! is an excellent 2-player game and gets a dino-sized thumbs up from The Inquisitive Meeple.\" -Ryan Sanders, The Inquisitive Meeple.\nCheck out here interview with designer, Ryan Cowler here.\n\"JurassAttack is a keeper.

The cards, even in pre-production format, are fantastic. I love the art and design on them, and I also love that they are tarot sized, it is about dinosaur fighting after all, so the cards should be bigger than normal, right? The play is quick, which is kind of important in this as it isn\u2019t meant to be a big full game, it\u2019s a fun directly confrontational filler that plays in about 10-15 minutes or so and there are some good opportunities for bluffing your opponent.\" - Brandon Kempf, What Did You Play This Week Podcast Thing\nListen to Brandon chat with his 11  and 5 year old daughters about the game here!\nListen to Jason (publisher) interview Ryan (designer) on the 20 Minutes of FIller Podcast, right here. \nFind more info and images at our page on BoardGameGeek.com.\n\"A ferocious duel in a bite-size playing time.\" - Chris Handy, game designer and publisher (Cinque Terre, Pack-o-Game)\n\"JurassAttack! is a compelling two player dinosaur battle.

Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our two Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2014-2015 longshoreman west coast work slow down that delayed all of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to buy it verses the cost to produce it. This event did not occur in either of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount of the model.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #110", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

Never daunted by the challenge, and behaving like a true Gallerist would, designer Vital Lacerda put the word out to budding and established artists that he was in need of new and original works of art in the fields of painting, digital art, photography and sculpture to use in a game about sponsoring new artists!  Here are some samples (with notes) of the exciting art that Vital was able to line up:\nThe Gallerist Rulebook\nNEWS FLASH on July 4, 2015:\nALL TEN (10) Stretch Goals have been achieved with 24 hours still to go!\nIn setting up this Kickstarter for The Gallerist, we decided to minimize the emphasis on Stretch Goals and give Backers an excellent price ($21 off expected MSRP), and a subsidy on some pricey shipping as well (this game weighs 8 lbs and measures 15.5\" by 12.5\" by 3.0\"). \nThe following Stretch Goals were hand-picked by designer Vital Lacerda to subtly enhance the game play of this high-quality production.  These are not Kickstarter exclusives. However, we will produce only limited numbers of these Stretch Goals and they will not be packaged in any retail versions of this game.  We have not made a decision at this time whether these will be for sale at a later date.\nWhat better way to complement a game which the designer sub-titles \"The Art of Strategy\" than to feature Eagle-Gryphon-created Add-On Games of Art and Strategy; as well as Add-On Games of Strategy and Art.\nThese are offered to you at significant savings and they include FREE SHIPPING in the USA if your pledge is over $100;  and FREE SHIPPING in the EU, Australia and Canada if your pledge is over $220.\nGames of Art or Masters Gallery or Mus\u00e9e\nPetite Pastiche or Fantastiqa Rucksack or Cubist \nThrough the Ages or Rococo \n Zong Shi or Francis Drake\nClockwork Wars \nEmpires: Age of Discovery\nDawn: Rise of the Occulites\nHow do I add these \"Add-Ons\" to my pledge?\nYou simply add the amount of money needed to purchase any of the add-on games to the amount of your pledge! You can always change the amount of your pledge (while the KS project is active) by using the \"Manage My Pledge\" button.\nWhere or how do I indicate the specific item(s) I have added-on?\nAbout 7-14 days after this KS project ends we will send you a survey and ask you to indicate exactly how to allocate your pledge between the base game and the add-ons offered here. You will be in touch with our Pledge Manager, Ruth Cumberbatch, until you both have all the details of your pledge and shipping worked out.\nAfter playing the prototype, these players said:\n \"I never thought micro-managing my own Gallery could be so much fun!\"        -Ben Martin\n\"I loved the theme; buying & selling art and raising an unknown artist to celebrity status. Together with the mechanics, it is a real nail bitter of a game.\" -Oliver Brooks\n\"The only board game where I liked being kicked out!\" -Joel Wright\n\"Single play of what was described as \"near final rules + art\". Impressed by what I saw.\" -Steve Kearon\n\"Again an original theme, put together by some original mechanics.\"        -Bruno Val\u00e9rio\n\"A heavy euro with a lot of moving parts. Interesting decisions to be made throughout the game. \" -Neil Henning\n\"Although I suspect I will like this more against human opponents, the solitaire game does what I like: Gives you challenges that are unique to the solitaire game, so you have a reason to play it, other than having no playmates.\" -Nathan Morse\n\"Vital Lacerda is one of the most brilliant designers in the industry today and The Gallerist is one of his finest games. This visually stunning euro is one you will want to play over and over again.\" -Suzanne Zinsli from Cardboard Edison\nWhile a Reviewer said:\nThe way the Artists are discovered, the way we buy, exhibit and sell the artworks all makes sense, has it's always the case with games by Vital Lacerda. We can also do marketing actions to promote the artist fame and reputation making their works more expensive for the players to get and more valuable when you sell them. There's also a mechanic of area control and bidding, it's not bidding like in an auction game but rather you pay certain amounts of money to get into a specific space on the Foreign Market so you can be one of the Gallerist to get one of the Artworks in display at the end of the game, and there aren't enough for all players, so the one that spends the less leaves without a work for the Gallery.\n       One of the more interesting mechanics in the game is that no player is ever blocked out of a space like in most worker placement games... you can get to any place you want but you'll be bumping the player that was already there and that means that the bumped player will have the option of doing an Executive Action at the end of the current player turn... so when you bump someone you are giving them the chance to do some extra actions (provided they can do them)\n       The game is AWESOME!!! I'm starting to think that Vital only knows how to do great games...  It's lighter than his previous games, it's probably the lighter one but that doesn't mean it's light! It isn't!!! There are a lot of things to account for...\" -Paulo Renato\nHello everyone. I'm Vital Lacerda, the designer of The Gallerist. I was born in Lisbon 48 years ago, a city I adore and still live in with Sandra, my wife, and my two lovely daughters. I have a masters degree in Marketing and Advertising, and after working in advertising agencies for almost 15 years as an art director, I decided to try my luck as a freelance graphic designer. I've been working like this since 2007. At that same time I also began designing board games, my true and great passion.\nMost of all, I consider myself a gamer and still a wannabe designer who had the luck of having a few publishers who believe in my games. I published Vinhos in 2010, and CO2 two years later. Last year was Kanban. Fortunately, all my games were well accepted by enough gamers that they were \"successful\". The Gallerist will be my 4th game.\nI have a tendency to design \"thinking\" games because those are the types of games I love to play. A big box game takes a lot of time to design, play test and develop. So when I begin such an endeavor, I always look for a few characteristics that are fun for me in those type of games. They need to be challenging; they need to require deep thinking and difficult decision-making; they must allow great control; and to involve intense competition and heavy strategy. Those are the games I love to play and design. I usually start to look for a theme to be the foundation of the game. Strategic thinking inside a game that is supported by a strong theme must always be present. That it is the most challenging thing when designing such a game. The Gallerist is not an exception to any of this.\nI like interconnected mechanisms a lot \u2014 pursuing strategies, different complex paths \u2014 but I also love to adapt, make tactical moves, and have some randomness in games. I try to avoid luck in longer games. I believe luck should be delivered not by the system, but by player decisions.\nI also love to move pieces on a board. That is precisely one of the things I most care about in games. I love moving wood and cardboard over the board, I like to touch, to feel. For me, it makes the game much more dynamic, colorful, and fun. Because of that my games always deliver to the players loads of great components inside a big heavy box. And you may expect the same in The Gallerist. I hope you enjoy The Gallerist as much as I enjoyed designing it.  I really still love playing it! Go to the rules section above, read the rules and take a look the video.  I sincerely hope this is a game for you!\nPARTNERS in Brazil; Italy;  Israel; Germany/Austria/Switzerland;  and France/Belgium\nWe are very pleased to announce that we will have co-production partners in Brazil; Germany/Austria/Switzerland; Italy; Israel and France/Belgium for The Gallerist.

Here is more information from them:\nEn EGDGames s\u00f3lo pensamos en la gente y por eso s\u00f3lo ofrecemos lo mejor. Todos los juegos de mesa que busques los tenemos, y si no, lo buscamos, lo traemos y te lo enviamos a casa. Siempre al mejor precio, con el mejor trato y en las mejores condiciones.\nEGDGames, juegos de mesa y crowdfunding van de la mano, porque hacemos lo que nos gusta.\nTe invitamos a que nos visites en www.egdgames.com Y puedes contactar con nosotros en crowdfunding@egdgames.com\n\u00a1Te esperamos!\nWe are aware that many of you would like to be able to pick up your copy of The Gallerist at Essen (which is earlier than usual this year).  If possible, we will try to accommodate you.  Clearly this is going to be tight timing given the schedule for both production and shipping as well, but we will do the best we can.  If you want to try the Essen pick up option, please select Antarctica as your shipping address and Kickstarter will automatically add $10 to your pledge to help us defray import fees, taxes, and drayage expenses that we will incur. If we are not able to get the games to Essen in time, we will apply the $10 to conventional shipping from our Netherlands warehouse to your real shipping address, which we will get from you at the time of our post-Kickstarter survey--a week or two after this KS ends.\nWe will ship US orders from our Eagle-Gryphon Games warehouse in Kentucky; Canadian orders from Board Games Bliss in Ontario; Australian orders from The Games Capital in Canberra; and Asian orders from our warehouse in Shenzhen, China (mainland).\nSpeaking of both Canadian and Australian shipping, and Board Games Bliss and The Games Capital, Canadian and Australian backers can now order many of our games directly from them.\nFor more information about the titles available in Australia contact Customer-Service@Eagle-Gryphon.com or contact TGC via thegamescapital.com.au.\nMULTIPLE COPY purchases of The Gallerist Game count towards FREE shipping in the US and in the EU, Canada and Australia!\nAs we have said above, if you are in the EU (outside our partner companies' countries); or Australia or Canada; and you pledge $220 or more (including Add-On games) then your shipping is FREE.  If we are shipping to you at a US address and your pledge is over $100 (including Add-Ons) then your shipping is FREE as well. NOTE that this applies to multiple purchases of the Gallerist Game itself (for instance 4 times $59 - $236 and FREE shipping in the EU countries, Canada and Australia) and does not require the purchase of add-on games (though you should consider those as well!)\nCanadian shipping is $18 for one game, Australian shipping is $18 for one game. The Netherlands is $14 shipping. The UK is $21. EU shipping varies a lot by country, as does the rest of the world!\nIt has been our experience that many people (including sophisticated international Kickstarter Backers) frequently confuse \"shipping\" expense and \"postage\" expense. What we try to cover with the above fees (in part) is shipping expenses, not just postage. Postage is the actual charge your country's postal service (or UPS, FedEx, etc) charges us to deliver a package within that country.\nShipping is far more comprehensive and includes: getting the container shipped to the US, or the EU, or Australia; the Customs and VAT (or equivalent) and other import fees and taxes; the drayage from the port to the warehouse (not cheap!); the warehouse fees to unload and sort out and prepare packages; the materials and labor involved in the last item; fees to the warehouse for their service to us, and only after all of that, the postage! We need to cover all of those costs--and they really add up. Frequently they cost as much or more than the game(s) did to produce.\nWhen we combine a low margin price (such as this one we are offering on The Gallerist) with this shipping expense, we do not make any profit if we are not very careful. The shipping we are charging for this project is as low as we can make it and still stay in business.\nInternationally, for two or more games, get in touch with us and tell us the total of how many games you want and which ones; and where you would like them shipped. To get in touch with us, please send us a Message (not a Comment please) using the \"Contact Me\" button at the top.\nWe will not ship to Russia, the Ukraine and select other places except for specially-made arrangements wherein the Backer takes the risk involved in receiving the package.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEagle-Gryphon Games stands by our products, but sometimes issues do happen. Please contact our customer service department with regard to any such issues within 90 days of receiving your copy of The Gallerist.\n\nShipping issues are relatively uncommon, but they do sometimes occur, especially when shipping to destinations outside of the US. We will obtain tracking information when it is possible, but sometimes it is not. We cannot guarantee that there will not be shipping problems, as we cannot guarantee the service and reliability of the various postal/delivery services involved around the world. You will have to assume that risk along with us.\n\nEagle-Gryphon Games has completed 49 Kickstarter projects to date. 43 of those projects have completed or are in the midst of delivery. The other projects are in the midst of shipping or are still in the production process. We keep Backers notified by Updates about the status of their projects. We deliver on our promises reliably and usually on time (the very few delays we have ever had were related to production schedule issues which we have only, at best, partial control over).\n\nTo put it simply, you will get everything you are promised when you pledge to one of our Kickstarter Projects, and it will be delivered to you in as timely a manner as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "A new game from Vital Lacerda -- Lisboa -- is on Kickstarter now!", "update_content": "Here is the link to Vital's latest game -- Lisboa!\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2002188924/lisboa-vital-lacerdas-new-game-of-rebuilding-and-i\nWe started this KS project just 4 days ago and already it has made its pledge goal and achieved 12 Stretch Goals as well.

To do this, I have adjust my shipping discounts from previous projects. Shipping is a volatile cost that I cannot undermine. I simply cannot commit to shipping methods or discounts that would price me out of fulfilling my responsibility to you. Thank you for your patience and understanding regarding this.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to me, regardless of location, there are just certain realities in shipping costs that we all have to face. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, I have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nRegarding customs: because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 and 2 copies, will not get hit with customs or import fees. We have shipped thousands and thousands of copies of Tiny Epic games to international backers and I've only heard of a couple of incidents where a backer (of 1 and/or 2 copies) was hit with any sort of fees.   \n\"Tiny Epic\" is a series of games designed by Scott Almes and published by Gamelyn Games. Each game in this series must strictly adhere to TWO core values: Tiny and Epic! Tiny meaning small (pocket-sized) box with simple and easy to understand rules. Epic meaning gratifying gameplay with lots of strategy and replay-ability. Over the course of numerous games, the series will explore many unique genres and themes. \nCurrently the line features a 4X/Civ game Tiny Epic Kingdoms, a cooperative Tower Defense game Tiny Epic Defenders and a intergalactic dice driven/engine building game Tiny Epic Galaxies.\nThe \"Tiny Epic\" series began January of 2013 on Kickstarter with its flagship game Tiny Epic Kingdoms! Which has sold a collective total of over 20,000 copies.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Kingdoms Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Kingdoms\nThe second game in the series is a thematic sequel to Tiny Epic Kingdoms called Tiny Epic Defenders.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Defenders Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Defenders\nTiny Epic Galaxies, the third installment in the series. \nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Galaxies Kickstarter page.\nClick here to learn more about Tiny Epic Galaxies.\nGamers can expect to see more Tiny Epic games in the near future! Stay tuned by joining the Gamelyn Games Newsletter. \nAll Add-Ons for this project are included in the reward tiers and/or will be handled AFTER the project within PledgeManager. There are no separate Add-Ons during the project.  \nIf you'd like to add additional copies, or other menu items, to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, you may do so within PledgeManager. \nDo not add to your KS pledge for add-ons, you will pay for them in PledgeManager.\nCheck out our exciting PledgeManager menu below:\nPledgeManager is a post-project service used to collect backer's shipping data and to provide additional product options.

It is prone to many opportunities for mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully fulfilling board game projects from Kickstarter.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer we have used to create Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, the Fantasy Gaming Figures, the GIANT Meeples, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Tiny Epic Defenders, and Tiny Epic Galaxies. We have a great relationship with their entire team. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together we have created some great games and products and we hope that Tiny Epic Kingdoms Heroes' Call and Tiny Epic Kingdoms 2nd Edition will be our next!\n\n3. Professional fulfillment is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They were responsible for having fulfilled the shipments of Rise!, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, Tiny Epic Kingdoms, Tiny Epic Defenders and, the soon to be shipped, Tiny Epic Galaxies. All were delivered on schedule with professionalism and reliability. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project won't experience mistakes, they happen to everyone but it does show that this road is familiar to all parties involved.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process, as to involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nI will be present daily during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

The cutthroat members, the Apothecaries, have grown too savvy of each other's schemes. They've chosen you to compete in their black market game! Conjuring powerful magic and deception, outwit your adversaries, and you too might join Apotheca.\nApotheca is a 30-minute, potion-crafting strategy game for 2-4 players ages 14 and up. \nDevise your plans by hiding ingredients in the marketplace. Reveal secrets to collect precious gems. Recruit powerful apothecaries to do your bidding. The first apprentice to make three potions becomes a member of the secret potion society!\nOnly clever folk can navigate this mysterious market. Can you master the world of Apotheca?\nAsymmetric Powers \u2013 Each of the 15 apothecaries boasts a unique ability to manipulate potions in the market, from familiar movements to innovative brain benders. Combine your powers to set up potion matches your opponents won't anticipate!\nHidden Information \u2013 Deduction is key to Apotheca. Only you know the true identity of the secret potions you bring to the market, creating a rich level of strategy when combined with the apothecary powers. But don't worry, this isn't a memory game - the arrows on the back of the potion cards indicate who placed them, so you can peek at your secret potions at any time!\nChallenging Choices \u2013 Your actions are limited each turn. The tradeoff between hidden information, resource gathering and board control makes it challenging and satisfying to craft the perfect plan. Counter your opponents' powers by starving them of information, build up resources to prepare for the end-game, and bluff your way to victory when your opponent least suspects it.\nEasy to Learn, Hard to Master \u2013 Apotheca is deceptively simple. Just when you think you've mastered the many apothecary powers and endless board positions, a refreshingly creative move will leave you thirsty for more potion-brewing. We've seen a countless number of Apotheca games, and are still surprised by the strategies of new players and veterans alike.\n*Art and components are subject to change.\nShipping fees are added automatically upon backing the project.\nGames shipped to backers in the US, Canada and EU are shipped from within those territories. No extra customs charges!\n\nWestern EU countries include:\nAustria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.\nEach character in Apotheca has a mysterious story, a unique ability, and lush full bleed art.

I can see this game being a contender for several gaming awards.\" -Chris James of Casual Game Revolution\n\"Apotheca is worth getting excited about.

Elegant, crazy, and colorful.

SUNDAY! SUNDAY! Monster Truck Mayhem is invading the SuperMegaDome! Brought to you by Ridback Pub, 101 The Animal, and Big Al\u2019s Sound Emporium, this thrill show spectacular will BLOW YOUR MIND! All your favorite trucks and more will be there\u2026 AND SO SHOULD YOU! Car crushing, mud sliding, bus jumping, and general mayhem for only $39! Less than FORTY BUCKS gets you the whole seat... but you will only need the edge Edge EDGE!\nMonster Truck Mayhem is a real-time dice-rolling racing game, designed by Ben Pinchback & Matt Riddle, creators of the award-winning games Fleet and Eggs & Empires. Players simultaneously roll their dice to race around the SuperMegaDome track, and the winner is the first player to cross the finish line!\nPlayers use custom dice to move 1, 2, or 3 spaces at a time. The numbers, \u201cTire\u201d and \u201cBoost\u201d die faces are used to navigate course obstacles like the Car Crush, Bus Jump, Death Chasm, and more! Three \u201cBoost\u201d is an instant movement bonus. Three \u201cTires\u201d causes another player to spin out!\nCrush obstacles AND the competition, and be the first monster truck to cross the finish line to take home the SuperMegaTrophy!\nMonster Truck Mayhem will offer the same hallmark quality as the other Dice Hate Me titles from Greater Than Games, with fine components, thick punchboard bits, and lots of replay value. The projected MSRP for Monster Truck Mayhem is set at $40.\nHere's a list of what you'll find inside the base game box:\n6 thick punchboard Monster Trucks, with stands\n6 punchboard Monster Truck player boards, with special Mayhem Bonus abilities\n6 double-sided, interlocking track boards for variable set-up\n15 custom-molded Racing Dice\n1 Special Truckdor custom-molded Fire Die\n4 Drive Angry! punchboard tokens for Big D\n3 Insanity Roll! punchboard tokens for Cthulhu Crusher\n8 Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! cards\n6 blank Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! cards for adding your own special announcements\n2 Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! punchboard pieces for variable set-up\n2 1-2-3 Burst Wall punchboard pieces for variable set-up\nFull-color rulebook\nMonster Truck Mayhem will be the first official title to come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Dragon\"-sized box - a box that's almost a foot square and three inches deep, so it's truly monster-sized!  What's this crazy talk about box sizes anyway? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nThe Monster Rally expansion pack will be sold separately in retail stores, but will be included for free with every Monster Truck Mayhem pledge (a $15 value). This expansion pack will provide rules and a points system for playing multi-lap races and campaigns where players can purchase awesome upgrades for their trucks! \nHere's what's included in the expansion:\n1 custom-molded green Hood Scoop Die \n1 custom-molded purple Sweet Spoiler Die \n2 punchboard Icy Track tokens \n2 punchboard Smokescreen tokens\n12 Monster Upgrade cards\n2 thick punchboard Monster Trucks, with stands\n2 punchboard Monster Truck player boards, with special Mayhem Bonus abilities\nRules sheet for playing rally and campaign races, with points system for purchasing upgrades between races\nWe'll be revealing more details on the extras included in the Monster Rally expansion as the campaign goes on!\nAbove is a shot of the prototype base game with beginner track boards in action, which is very close to what the final production copy will look like!\nBig D is the flagship truck for the Dice Hate Me Monster Racers team. Four times during a race, Big D can activate the Drive Angry! Mayhem Bonus and move forward three spaces without rolling the dice. As any good Dice Hate Me fan knows, if there's a chance not to rely on the dice for a good result it's probably in their best interest!\nCthulhu Crusher brings a special colour out of space to the SuperMegaDome, filling his opponents' hearts with sheer terror! Cthulhu Crusher can make three other racers go insane during a race, forcing an opponent to roll their dice and move backward double their highest die roll. The Insanity Roll is a great way to keep the race leader in check, and help guarantee that this racer crushes the competition!\nThis wicked spirit of war from Norse mythology is one of the fastest racers in the SuperMegaDome! Whenever Valkyrie rolls three \"Boosts\" on her Racing Dice, she can choose to speed forward 5 spaces. The other trucks better watch their rearviews, as just when it seems Valkyrie may be left in the dust she's suddenly a quarter track ahead! \nTruckdor is here to burninate EVERYTHING!!! This fierce dragon uses a special Fire Die with a wild side that can be used as a 1, 2, 3, Tire, or Boost. With Truckdor's flames heating up the SuperMegaDome, the other trucks are TOAST!\nThe tracks of the SuperMegaDome can often be treacherous, with incredibly muddy slick spots that can keep trucks tied up without traction for a long, long time. Cap'n Crabby only laughs a mighty YAR HAR at the slick spots since he gets traction with only one Tire on his Racing Dice! Full speed ahead!\nWe have three more trucks to unveil over the course of the campaign (1 in the base game, and 2 in the Monster Rally expansion). We'll be back with more on those in future updates, and we'll have some new art to show off from artist Benjamin Raynal, as well!\nThe videos shown below were shot at Origins Game Fair 2015. Many of the components are prototypes (albeit close to the final production), and the demo board was built as a mounted, one-sheet poster using the beginning tile set-up. It's important to note that the game will include double-sided, interlocking tiles for variable play instead of one big board.\nEveryone should take a moment to note that Ben Pinchback, co-designer of the game, snuck in all quiet-like with Valkyrie for the win in this video. You can also notice him using his veteran skills to calmly count out spaces to make sure he wasn't spun out in the last stretch of the race to take the win. Ben holds the record for wins in Monster Truck Mayhem, so he's kind of a ringer. Then again, he did design the thing.\nYeah, we said it: NO STRETCH GOALS. And we mean it! We decided to unlock all of them for you from the start.\nWhen we first started planning the Kickstarter campaign, we had broken the game down into several stages. The box was initially going to be smaller, the overall components fewer, and the funding goal a bit lower. Our first stretch goal would have been to monster-size the game once we reached a comfortable funding level, then add additional track pieces. We knew we wanted to provide the Rally expansion bits because that would turn an already-great game into an incredibly-awesome game, so those would be next, broken into two stages. Then we'd dig into some extra trucks if the campaign did well.\nAfter all that, we finally took a step back and realized that we wouldn't want to produce a game without any of that awesome stuff, so we decided to just \"unlock\" all those stretch goals in the beginning, be realistic in our pricing and funding goal, and rev up the engines from the start. Every backer will now automatically get the absolute best of everything in Monster Truck Mayhem without having to wait and see how things progress through the campaign.\nOne pledge level, no stretch goals, just the biggest, baddest, maddest, monster truck racing game ever. Let's do this!\n\"Monster Truck Mayhem is a ton of fun in a few minutes. They say the Kentucky Derby is the most exciting sport in under 2 minutes, and if so, Monster Truck Mayhem may be the most exciting game in under 10 minutes.\" - Richard Launius, designer of Arkham Horror, Defenders of the Realm, Elder Sign & more\n\"Aside from the fervent yelling and screaming coming from the players, the art from Benjamin Raynal might just be the first thing to grab your attention. Vibrant colors on stylized, chunky cartoon monster trucks make the game feel big and in-your-face. The interlocking, modular track tiles (yep, you heard correctly \u2013 modularity = replayability!) have a wonderful amount of detail, from the individual cars waiting to be crushed, to the thick grime of a muddy oil slick that will have you spinning your wheels while your friends catch up. The design of the game makes you feel like you\u2019re there at a monster truck rally.\" - Matt Halstad, League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"You don't have to wait for Sunday Sunday Sunday to enjoy monster truck racing. You can enjoy it any day with Monster Truck Mayhem. This is a frantic dice rolling game that is loads of fun. Lots of yelling, screaming and laughing as you try to get your truck around the track as fast as possible without spinning out. Great art fits the theme perfectly. Easy to learn, plays fast. Wonderful adrenaline-pumping game.\" - Marty Connell, Rolling Dice & Taking Names\n\"You just aren't prepared for the levels of over-the-top fun that MTM brings. Matt and Ben have created the anti-Feld we've needed for sooo long. MTM is the smartest stupid game I've played in ages, and I'm backing it on Day 1.\" - Paul Imboden, Split Second Games\n\"Monster Truck Mayhem is a frenzied dice fest that's bound to bring out the inner child in anyone. Blowing past your opponent as they shout \"Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!\" at the top of their lungs makes for a raucous fun time. If you want a wildly addictive game that could potentially double as a workout, look no further!\" - Tiffany Bahnsen, Socially Inept Gamer and League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"I played 3 games of Monster Truck Mayhem at Origins. It is my favorite live-action dice game I have ever played. The game actually IS a race as you are rolling and making decisions as fast as you can. The variable truck powers make the game even crazier and add even more replay value to the package. I don't have any affinity for monster trucks, but this game is awesome. I can't wait to get my own copy.\" - Keith Collins, @MajMalfunction\nWe won't lie, like many other Kickstarter projects, some Dice Hate Me Games projects have been delayed a couple of months beyond their expected release date. Just to be safe and to project a more realistic timeline for our manufacturing deadlines, we decided it would be best to place delivery of this project about a year out. Our hope, however, is that we will deliver much sooner than this anticipated deadline. Based on previous projects, we feel that this is an extremely safe timeline for production. However, we'd much rather surprise all of you with an earlier delivery than a late one - and we're aiming to race this one out fast!\nGame Design: Ben Pinchback & Matt Riddle (Fleet, Eggs & Empires, Floating Market)\nArt: Trucks and box art by Benjamin Raynal (King of Tokyo), base track art by Jeff Brown (Fallen, Monstrous)\nGraphic Design: Chris Kirkman (Brew Crafters, VivaJava, Sunrise City)\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, Dice Hate Me Games would not be able to bring quality games to market. To show our respect and appreciation, DHMG promises that backer copies of Monster Truck Mayhem will be shipped out before copies are available for purchase at retailers or conventions. DHMG also pledges to keep all backers informed at every step in the development, printing and delivery processes. We love staying in touch with all of our supporters, so please never hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.\nShipping, in particular international shipping, has been a perpetual headache for us. Amazon and other dedicated online retailers offer free or heavily discounted shipping that we are unable to compete with without enormous losses. As is, we price shipping lower than our actual cost to ship to a given destination, and pledge that your rewards will actually arrive safe and well-protected in shipping, or we will re-send them. Below are our shipping charges for this campaign:\nUS: $10\nCanada: $15\nEU: $35\nOther International: $50\nEU Friendly\nEven though we recognize that the international shipping fees are ridiculous, they will by no means cover all of our international shipping + customs charges. However, we hope that they will at least allow us to not lose money on international rewards. We would rather charge a high shipping fee than get rid of international delivery all together - we love our international backers!\nIf you want to back for multiple copies of the game, you can, and you won\u2019t have to pay for additional shipping! For instance, if you live in Ireland and you and your friends want to go in together and pledge for four copies of the game, you can have one person pledge for $191 \u2014 $39 + $39 + $39 + $39 + $35 for shipping. That would ultimately break down to $8.75 per person for shipping\u2026 much more reasonable! We know international shipping is crazy expensive, but we hope this option helps out a bit.\nFor Christmas in 1983, I asked Santa for a motorized Bigfoot\u00ae monster truck. It had a key in the truck bed that you turned to make it go go go over anything, and that truck went everywhere with me.\nBy the time I was 13, I had just about forgotten Bigfoot\u00ae. Other things started catching my attention, such as, well... girls. Every Fourth of July week in my youth, my family always vacationed in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. There was a particularly fetching young woman staying with her family at our motel. I worked up the courage to ask her for a walk on the beach and a grand night at the local arcade, likely spending a romantic evening duking it out on an old copy of Tapper or Karate Champ. Her simple response: \"Sorry, but I'm headed to a monster truck rally.\" \nBelieve me, I've never forgotten about Bigfoot\u00ae or the other legendary monster trucks from that day forward. \nWhen Ben & Matt first showed me Monster Truck Mayhem I immediately felt like that nine-year-old turning the key in the bed of my awesome Bigfoot\u00ae toy, and I was reminded just how cool - and alluring - monster trucks can be. There's just something about this game that grabs your inner kid. I have witnessed that transformation in so many adult gamers when we've put this game in front of them, and the joy many of them have found in introducing their kids to the fun. I'm so proud to be able to offer this bit of bottled magic to everyone, and I can't wait for each of you to rev up the engines, crush some cars, and feel young again.\nAll the best,\nChris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with our overseas manufacturer and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and have worked through - and learned from - kinks we may have encountered in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. Sometimes even personal life events can blindside you. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dice Hate Me Games\n20 created \u00b7 2 backed\nDice Hate Me Games, LLC is a division of Greater Than Games, LLC, committed to bringing entertaining, innovative, and challenging games to...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 38, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dicehateme/monster-truck-mayhem-real-time-monster-truck-racin", "project_name": "Monster Truck Mayhem: Real-Time Monster Truck Racing!"}}, {"backer": "Ken Grazier :: Geek-Craft", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 38, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludicreations/town-center-beaune-turku", "project_name": "Town Center: Beaune / Turku"}}, {"backer": "Ken Grazier :: Geek-Craft", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 38, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nevermoregames/dark-dealings-dark-lords-defending-against-pesky-h", "project_name": "Dark Dealings: Dark Lords Defending Against Pesky Heroes"}}, {"backer": "Ken Grazier :: Geek-Craft", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 38, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/467068973/boardgames-that-tell-stories-2-by-ignacy-trzewicze", "project_name": "Boardgames That Tell Stories 2 by Ignacy Trzewiczek"}}, {"backer": "Ken Grazier :: Geek-Craft", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 38, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1960349413/monstrous-the-game-of-mythic-mayhem", "project_name": "MONSTROUS -

The last 30 days have been incredible, and we couldn't have done it without you!\nDr. Reed is the foremost pioneer in connecting the human mind to digital systems. It was his intention to see if people could work together while dreaming, but what he discovered was an untapped source of creativity that brings dreams to life. It doesn\u2019t matter what age, gender, or race a person is--they have the potential for unimaginable ingenuity. Now you too can live your dreams by participating in Project Dreamscape.\nYour turn starts by choosing whether or not to take a facedown card, called a Z card--these Z cards are currency in the game, but also count against you when it comes time to tally up the scores. Z cards are used to purchase cards from the Dreamscape, which are then placed in your REM stack. You must choose one of the two abilities on a card to activate when you collect it, but the real fun of the game comes from chaining these abilities together.\nAny one of the eight dream abilities in Project Dreamscape, by itself, produces only a minor effect--take a card, flip a card, rearrange some cards, and so on. But with some clever card play, one dream ability can lead to another until you've collected several cards or even cleared the entire Dreamscape. This continues until there are not enough cards to fully refill the Dreamscape after a player\u2019s turn. At that point, the game is over and it's time to score.\nScoring is simple. Just lay out your faceup cards in the order they were stacked, and then find matching abilities that appear on adjacent cards (the orientation of the cards does not affect scoring, but you may wish to rotate the cards to find these chains). Wherever two or more copies of an ability are next to one another, you score points as shown on the score chart. After scoring all of your chains, subtract points equal to the amount of Z cards you have, and that\u2019s your final score.\nFor some examples of Project Dreamscape's chaining mechanics, check out Richard Ham's wonderful run-through:\nCheck out the full rules for more information, and the free print-and-play files on BoardGameGeek:\nProject Dreamscape: Rules\nProject Dreamscape: Print-and-Play files\nProject Dreamscape also has a single player variant, although it's currently only available digitally; however, we hope to include the rules in the box over the span of the campaign! You can find the rules for Virtual Dreaming on BoardGameGeek:\nProject Dreamscape: Virtual Dreaming\nInside Project Dreamscape, you'll find a sleep deck of 52 cards, two reference cards, five Z shield tokens, a full-color rulebook, a special active player marker, and an expansion deck consisting of 54 cards (three alternate dream types!). The game will come packaged in a sturdy two-piece box that measures approximately 3.5x5.5\"--about twice the width of a deck of cards, and still very pocket-sized!\n\"Small, portable, and challenging, Project Dreamscape engaged each of our players and kept them hooked. Each game provided new insight on new ways to manipulate and organize the Dream cards, mess with opponents, and create killer combos. Project Dreamscape is a game you can learn how to play in 5 minutes and take all afternoon to work out the many different ways to win. Now that\u2019s a good game.\"\nCyrus Kirby, Father Geek (full preview)\n  \"It took a couple turns to understand some of the combos and nuances, and then we were off and running! Terrific, clever game!\"\nChris Leder, Game Designer, Roll for It!\n  \"The peaceful artistic style of Project Dreamscape guides you through a quick, combo-making dream you'll want to have over and over again.\"\nBrian Henk, Overworld Games, Designer of Good Cop Bad Cop\n  \"It's a fun game that I think will only get better with more plays.\"\nJason Glover, Greygnome Games\n  \"Deceptively cute, PD is a light, yet deeply strategic card game that keeps you on your toes until the very end.\"\nChris Chu, play-tester\n  \"A nice challenge in a small package. I like that I can plan a couple of turns ahead and that my plans are never totally wiped out, but I have to continually respond to changes in the available cards.\"\nKell Brigan, play-tester\n \n\"Project Dreamscape might put on a cute, simple facade, but there is deep strategy to be found in this dream world. The ability to rearrange the dreamscape and play powers off of other players' cards is a fresh and ever-changing way to formulate your strategy. Just don't plan too far in advance, because other players' sinister arrangements can plunge your perfect plan into deep sleep!\"\nJohn Shulters, play-tester\n  Richard Ham, Rahdo Runs Through:\n Nick Meenachan, Board Game Brawl:\n  Dave Taylor, To The Table: Full disclosure: David Taylor is a guy that I believe in and I enjoy his reviews, so I really wanted him to try out Project Dreamscape; however, I do support him on Patreon, so please keep that in mind.\nJeff King, All Us Geeks: Full disclosure: Jeff King is also a good friend of ours, but as he explains in this video, that didn't even need to be considered:\nAll pledge levels from $16 and up will also include the premium Print-and-Play files, which feature the final files (including the cards, backs, box, and rules) sent to the manufacturer!\nThis very limited pledge level will get you a copy of the special edition (See the Dreamer pledge), as well as one of the original water color art pieces from Project Dreamscape\u2019s eight dream types--not a print, but the original painting. These beautiful pieces of art measure 4x6\" and will be handled by Julie herself in a stylish frame of her choice.\n\nEach of these paintings are first-backed, first served. If you back at this level, please send me a private message letting me know which painting you\u2019d like to have.\nWant to see some larger versions of the artwork? Check out our gallery on BoardGameGeek!\n If you would like to add one or more of the items below to your pledge, simply increase the dollar amount of your pledge by the price listed under each add-on. After the campaign is over, but long before shipping begins, I will send out a survey to ask you what add-ons you included in your pledge.\n$15 - Roll-Up Game Mat\nPainted by Julie Okahara, this completely optional (but totally awesome) roll-up mat depicts a field of dreamers with the cards placed over them representing their dreams. Directly below them are the Z shields from the back of the deck which depict the Z card cost for the card in that space. Above, their collective dream features the sun (the draw pile), and the moon (the discard pile). This mat measures 10x15\" and has an 1/8\" rubber backing.\n $15 - Extra Copy\nGrab additional copies of Project Dreamscape for only $15 each. A great way to save on shipping!\nAll backer rewards will ship from the US.\nProject Dreamscape will cost about $5 to ship domestically, and this is built into the cost of the game. For international shipments, there is a small extra charge to help with shipping costs:\nBase game: +$4 for international shipping\nBase game and the game mat: +$4 for international shipping\nBase game and Tower: +$8 for international shipping\nCollector's Edition: +$10 for international shipping\nCollector's Edition and artwork: +$20 for international shipping\nThese premiums are only applied once. For example, if you order two copies of Project Dreamscape, you will still only pay the $4 one time; however, while Project Dreamscape is naturally import-friendly thanks to its small size and low price point, anything more than the base game may be subject to extra fees.  \nWe will be holding a local pick up event when the games arrive, at a location in the Sacramento, CA area. The option to attend will be available when surveys go out.\nA word from Ben Haskett...\nSarah and Will organize a game designers meeting each month, where local designers can get together and play test each other's games. I was first invited to attend the meet-up about two years ago (where we became good friends), and it was at one of these meetings that I first played Project Dreamscape.\nI remember the first couple of turns very well, as I struggled a little bit to find my footing. I understood the basics; you use facedown cards to buy faceup cards, you play one of the two options on each card, you chain them together... but on my third or fourth turn, the game just clicked for me. I realized that these eight dream types, while perhaps a bit mild when played alone, could be combined for a very satisfying \"never-ending turn\" effect found in games like Dominion. By the end of the first game, I knew we had to take Project Dreamscape to the next level.\nWill and Sarah Reed\nThe two of them already had an artist in mind, Julie Okahara, who created some beautiful watercolor art for the game.  Playful and dreamy, with just a hint of uneasiness, her paintings were a perfect fit for the game's tone.  Her work typically utilizes mixed media, which is in full effect here--if you look closely at the card art, you can see that sections are cut out to reveal all sorts of glittered and textured papers.\nThe design goal with Project Dreamscape was to create a big experience in a small package--not a micro game, mind you, but simply a small game that packed a lot of compelling decisions into a 30-minutes experience.  The mechanics came first, and the theme was later integrated as Will lay awake at night tying to pair something with the game; when you're asking yourself, \"What do people want the most?\" late at night, I suppose it's easy to understand why Will settled on sleep as an appropriate theme.\nFor more insight into Sarah and Will's design process, check out their designer blog posts on Project Dreamscape:\nHow I Designed Project Dreamscape\nMechanics First\nSetting Design Goals\nIncorporating Play Styles\nUnexpected Group Think\nTiming & Number of Players\nExpanding Meaningful Choices\nModifying for Production\nIncorporating Play-Tester Feedback\nItems for the Future\nUnconventional Player Interaction\nThe Finished Look\nAll of Project Dreamscape's artwork was hand-painted by the talented Julie Okahara. For more information about her wonderful art, check out her website at www.julieokahara.com.\nTo get a closer look at the artwork that Julie painted, check out our gallery on BoardGameGeek.\nHuge thanks to all of our play-testers!\nTrey Alsup, Dave Berlin, Jessica Berlin, Kell Brigan, Chris Chu, Dominique DeMille, Olivia DeMille, Jareth Elkins, Charlie Fish, Jon Fromm, Jason Glover, Patrick Girvin, Sarah Graybill, Brian Henk, Jacob Knoester, Alexia Lara, Luis Lara, George Lavana, Chris Leder, Walter J Little V, Cody Parcell, Ben Ritter, Brian Ritter, Jon Robinson, Robert Salls, Nick Shaw, John Shulters, Roland Strebe, David Studley, Jason Taylor, Trent Twaddell, John Vang.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the second Kickstarter campaign I\u2019ve run. While my first campaign was very successful, there was still a lot to learn from the experience that I will be able to apply directly to Project Dreamscape. There may be unforeseen circumstances (my first campaign is a testament to them!), but I pride myself on being open and honest about every step of the process; even if it\u2019s bad news, I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re aware.\n\nI have two personal goals with this campaign, and the first is to deliver on time. Having been through the process now, I feel like I have a better understanding of where delays might occur, and I've taken measures to solve those issues beforehand. Further, Project Dreamscape has the benefit of being a small card game. This will greatly reduce the amount of time required by the manufacturer to produce a proof copy, and mitigate the chance for issues--in other words, Project Dreamscape will be able to begin production very soon after the close of the campaign.\n\nMy second goal is to make shipping easier for international backers--there was some behind-the-scenes confusion in my first campaign concerning how EU shipments were to be handled. Project Dreamscape will ship out to backers from the US, but to touch on the game's size once more, it's small enough that one copy of the game will easily ship from the US in a small package and almost certainly not get held for additional customs/broker fees.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture is Now Live!", "update_content": "   "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Undine in 2017 \u2013 Audio Books and Board Games", "update_content": "Hello, dreamers!

Our choice to use them is a direct reflection of my desire to make Trainmaker the absolute best it can be. \n If we fund, we promise that Trainmaker will be a thrilling and rewarding experience for you and your family and friends. However, if we overfund, we will be able to expand the game in both quality and quantity. You see, the more we raise, the more units we will be able to manufacture. This equates to a lower unit cost. These savings WILL be added back into the game in the form of additional content and better-quality components. Below are these additional goals and rewards:\nAll Aboard is a quick solo game designed by Chris Leder. It is played with the train meeples and dice from the game. Chris is known for his one card game designs as he had a successful one released with Roll For It! last year.\nLawmen vs Robbers is a two-player game designed by Jonathan Gilmour, the designer behind the hit Dead of Winter. It plays a bit like Liars Dice, but with each player in the role of either Lawman or Robber. Each having their own distinct powers. Will include 2 all new role cards with all new artwork.\nThis will include a nice linen finish on the box itself.\nRail Tycoon is a 2-5 player game designed by Stephen Avery, the designer behind the hit Nothing Personal. In Rail Tycoon players will use almost all of the games components in a new way. This is a dice driven and card melding good time! Will include 5 all new tycoon cards with all new artwork.\n7 Custom-Molded Dice\n40 Station Cards 300gsm Unlocked!\n12 Contract Cards 300gsm Unlocked!\n6 Custom Train Engine Meeples Unlocked!\n2 Reference Cards 300gsm Unlocked!\n2 Piece Setup Box\nBONUS All Aboard Mini Game designed by Chris Leder!\nInstructions \nTrainmaker will mark the second game in our Small Box Series, with the Award-winning Dig Down Dwarf as the first. Our goal is build up a nice library of smaller games with a variety of mechanics and themes that all play big!\nTrainmaker is a 2-6 player game that takes roughly 20-30 minutes to play and is enjoyed by players ages 8 and up.\nThe object of the game is to collect either one of each station type, or to complete your hidden contract. The first player to do so declares victory!\nAt the beginning of play, each player receives two random Contract Cards. They choose one and then discard the other from the game. This contract is the player's hidden objective for the game and is a separate and secret route to victory.\nThen the game begins as players take turns rolling dice in an attempt to secure Station Cards.\nPlayers may go after additional Station Cards on their turn if they are willing to begin a train with two engines instead of one! If they do so, and take a Station Card, they can re-roll all the dice used to create that train and go after another Station Card. It is possible to clear the table of all three available Station Cards on one turn if you are lucky and take a few risks!\nLastly, many of the station cards offer the player \"Discard Powers\". A player may discard an owned Station Card during their own turn to invoke a special \"one time\" power like re-rolling all their dice, or setting a die to a particular side. These powers offer the player a way to take further risks and make more choices during play in order to win. \nPrint & Play Files and Rules Download Link\n >>>Link to Lyris Laser Studio<<<\nAbove are some pictures of the prototype of the box from Lyris Laser Studio. As you can see the craftsmanship is very nice! The picture in the bottom-left illustrates one of our \"small box series\" games fitting perfectly into the box with plenty of room for goodies!\nWhat is the Outlaws Expansion?\nThe Outlaws expansion introduces 3 bandits to the Station Cards deck. These jerks spend a round robbing players of one of their dice if they happen to roll the train car the outlaw wants to rob! But to counter this, 6 new Station Cards are added and each has the passive U.S. Marshal ability to protect the player from the bandits. The bandits are smart enough to move on to easier prey. \nWant to customize your pledge? You may add on any of the following items to your pledge by simply increasing your pledge amount by the dollar amount indicated next to each item. Example: You have pledged at the $46 level, but want to add two roll-up game mats. Simply add $36 to your pledge for a total of $82. (46 + 18 + 18 = 82). Worldwide Shipping is included in these prices! \nYOU MUST BE A BACKER AT THE $20 LEVEL OR HIGHER TO ADD-ON ANY ITEMS! THE AMOUNT OF AN ADD-ON MUST BE ADDED TO YOUR PLEDGE BEFORE THE KICKSTARTER ENDS!

I wanted to explain the shipping costs to everyone, so that you can see exactly where the numbers came from. Below is a nice chart that shows the dollar amount you need to add to your pledge depending on where you live and the shipping credit that is applied at each level. Whatever the cost is to ship within the U.S. becomes a credit that is applied to Canadian and International shipping. Example: It costs $7 to ship one copy of the game within the U.S. and it costs $15 to ship the same package to Canada, so $7 is taken off the cost for Canadian Backers, thus you only have to pay $8 and not the full $15.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur goal is to make a quality product and we understand the challenges of doing so.

You can choose from a selection of these 5 lovely colors:\nWe wanted to make a lot of different kinds so you can choose your favorites, so we introduce you to these Metal Sets:\nFor all your fantasy games you want to give an elven look. I can cerainly see them used as coins in many LoTR games.\nFor games set in the Asia, such as Yspahan, or Camel Up\n One of our favorites. I would certainly use them in dwarven-themed games like Caverna, Terra Mystica or any other fantasy game.\n This is our more royal set, the one a king would love to have on his region, or a player on his Caylus or Game of Thrones.\nYou can't make anything Legendary without a Dragon. And this set would be much less legendary without this Dragon set. You can easilly use them in asy fantasy game or in DnD\n A collection for games set in Asia, or else Far East. Can be used in games such as Takenoko, In the Year of the Dragon and much more.\nIt was time that these doublons got a level-up. This pirate theme will be great for games like Merchants and Marauders.\n One of our most unique sets. Coins so futuristic can certainly be used in Android:Netrunner or any games set in the future.\n A Steampunk coin set for games like Steam Park or Mission:Red Planet. Let's shine these gears!\nWe couldn't resist making something from our own history. You can use these goodies in games such as Cyclades or Colloseum.\nIn the dark medieval times, currency was more functional than pretty. We really tried to keep them simple, but sometimes inspiration cannot wait.\n Orc Coins Unlocked:  The most battered of all! For your Warhammer and other fantasy games! We could not resists another fantasy coin set,\n Wild West Coins unlocked: To live the Wild West the proper way thorugh games such us Carson City or Shadows of Brimstone.\nThe material used in all coins is Zinc alloy, and the sizes vary from 2.7 to 3.2 mm thick, while the diameter is from 2.9cm to 3.5cm wide.\nYes, that means they are pretty massive.\n\nBut, don't take only our word for these. Check out what all these guys think about them in these video presentations:\n Update: New video review from Undead Viking and Geek-Craft!\n\nAlso, here you can read a review from Rob from GeekDad.\n\n\nAnd here is an image of  the coins of the Dwarven Set and the Greek Set. Can you spot that little on the corner? That is a USD quarter (so you can have a reference for their size). Also, you can see the comparison of the thickness of the coins (both our larger sets like the Dwarven ones and the smaller like the Greek).\n\nBoth Images were created from ConnectMoreBoardGames. Many thanks David .\n\nAnd this is an image demonstrating the different diameters in each Set.\n\n\nFree International Shipping\nWe knew from day 1 that we started the project that most backers would be afraid of a big cost through shipping (especially since our coins are that massive).But you don't have to worry about it at all. As we decided, shipping will be absolutely free for all backers anywhere in the world.\nAnd since we are talking about delivery, we are going to start production immediately after the campaign is over, since the only thing missing to start is funding. That means that you are all going to receive your coins by July (or even sooner than that).\n\nAlso, our project is EU friendly, so none of our European friends has to worry about customs.\n \nYou want some of these cool coins for you?

It's been over two years in the making, and we're excited to have you join us in making this game a reality.\nBreak out your gavel, dust off your lock-box and get ready for action-packed auctions in Vault Wars!\nVault Wars is a tabletop auction game of bidding and bluffing for 3-5 players that plays in less than an hour. (There's a 2-player variant, too!) Check out the rule book, or follow the overview below:\nSetup\nPlayers are each given starting Gold, and two (secret) Aspiring Hero cards that give bonuses for finding specific kinds of items.\nVault cards are drafted before gameplay begins.\nGameplay\nEach round, players secretly select one Vault, revealing them simultaneously. Each Vault provides a unique experience, introducing new ways for the players to bid.\nTaking turns as the Auction Master, players lead a cut-throat bidding war to selling off their Vault's items to the other players.\nBidding\nPlayers bid until 1 player is the winner -- paying the Auction Master and gaining the Vault's Items.\nCollect gems for massive Victory Points, Weapons to gain a pile of Gold, or rare Artifacts to gain powerful abilities. In addition to valuable Items, there's lots of junk to fool your opponents into bidding on.\nSelling Items\nAfter all selected Vaults have been auctioned off, players may sell their items to gain Gold, or save them for Victory Points -- paying storage fees to keep them around. Players who are short on Gold can visit the Loan Shark, gaining Gold and taking a Corruption Token (worth negative Victory Points).\nEnd of Game\nThe player with the most victory points from Items and one Aspiring Hero after all the auctions will be the winner!  \nSide Note: Vault Wars is a standalone game thematically set in the same fantasy world as our previous game Epic Resort; you don't need to have any experience with Epic Resort to enjoy Vault Wars.\n We'll be releasing reviews over the first week or so of the campaign to help give each reviewer some time in the spotlight.

Vault Wars challenges players to interact, with everyone possessing different amounts of hidden information, and yet it isn't a deduction game.

In addition to a useful insert and full color rule book, you'll also get:\nCards\n73 Item Cards (32 Unique Items) - Gem series, Armor series, Weapon Series, 12 Unique Artifacts, Junk, Dragon Eggs\n16 Vault Cards - Small Chest, Necromancer's Crypt, Rune-carved Pyxis, Svelte Elven Cabinet, Dwarven Lockbox, Guildmaster's Workshop, Gilded Cupboard, Troll Cave, Constricted Catacomb, Gear Chamber, Abandoned Mineshaft, Gambler's Den, Hero's Tomb, Cedar Trunk, Thief's Safe, Dragonslayer's Hoard\n10 Aspiring Hero Cards - Warrior, Paladin, Berserker, Rogue, Ranger, Temptress, Hoarder, Priest, Warlord, Engineer\n1 Loan Shark Card\n12 Card Worker Expansion - Guildmaster, Street Performer, Dungeon Master, Versatilist, Brewmaster, Lazy Peon and more!\nPunchboard\n60 Coins (1, 5, 10 value denominations)\n12 Corruption Tokens\nThe Tabletop gaming community is thriving! It's been an incredible experience as a publisher watching the community grow so much over the past few years. It's an exciting time for us as gamers with so many unique and interesting games, and I'm honored to have you consider Vault Wars as one of those options. Here are just a few reasons why we feel this project is worth your support.\nFast Moving and Fun - The rhythm of Vault Wars is quick to learn, and the thematic elements tie closely to their game impact; helping you stay focused on having fun and keeping an eye on your tricky opponents.\nUnique Auction Mechanics - Variable bidding rules, partial information on Vault contents and pay-the-player are all combined into a streamlined package that keeps your whole group engaged at every turn.\nYou're helping Independent Game Design and Publishing - Everything you see in this project is the product of a massive effort by several passionate, independent creators. The efforts that went into the game design, illustration, graphic design publishing are all crafted by individuals who absolutely love our hobby. Without you, we wouldn't be able to bring these creations to life!\nAs a backer, you have the chance to make it in the game! We're including a unique line of flavor text on all 30 of the Junk cards, and we want YOU to help pick what makes it on the cards.\nHere's how it works:\n1. Become a backer of Vault Wars (any level is fine)\n2. Go here to find the backers-only submission link.\n3. Vote on the submissions each week during the campaign. The best text will make it in the game!\nBackers help decide the flavor text for Junk cards!\nTo keep our costs low, we honed the game components into the smallest set possible without compromising gameplay. With your support, we'll hit our initial funding goal and we'll be able to publish a great game. \nIf we exceed that goal (Edit: WE DID, thank you!), it gets even better for everyone! We're excited to see how far this project can go and just how much great additional content and upgrades we can fit in the box for you!\nVault Wars works great as a pure auction game, but sometimes you need a little help finding the right gear... naturally you'll hire some workers!\nWith the worker expansion, a market full of skillful helpers are available to be hired each round. Every worker provides a unique ability that will give you an advantage during the game, but hiring them will cost you gold! The longer a worker goes un-hired, the cheaper they get... but don't wait too long or your opponents will snap them up first!\nIf you help spread the word about the Vault Wars Kickstarter project and we can reach our stretch goals -- including the Worker Expansion in every copy of the game!! (Edit: WE DID IT, thank you!)\nStep up your Vault Wars experience by upgrading to the Deluxe Edition to get 60 Custom Metal Coins and 6 Wooden Corruption Tokens. These coins will be custom made by Fantasy Coin, LLC and are extremely high quality and are styled to fit right in with the aesthetic of Vault Wars! Just pick the AUCTION MASTER - DELUXE reward tier above.\n3D render of the Deluxe Edition metal coins\nVault Wars - Deluxe will include 60 Custom Metal Coins made by Fantasy Coin, LLC\nNote: To be able to fit everything in the box, the metal coins and corruption tokens will replace the punchboard coins and tokens.\nGreetings, Auction Masters!\nFor those who are new to our games, welcome!

A game of Bottom of the 9th can easily be played in 5 to 15 minutes.\nBottom of the 9th will feature 20 player cards with beautiful custom art from artist Adam McIver that capture the look of classic baseball trading cards. These cards will even feel like classic trading cards since they will be printed on 1mm punchboard, just like vintage cards.  \nEach player card features abilities that can be used when they gain an upper hand on the opponent, allowing them to manipulate dice. Pitchers have an ace pitch that will activate when they choose to throw it as long as the batter doesn't predict both of the pitch variables (High, Low, Inside, Outside).Batters will have a unique MVP ability that activates whenever the player is able to accurately predict the type of pitch thrown. Most players also have a latent trait that can affect the game, alter their play style - or even give an advantage to the opponent!\nWith myriad customizable line-ups, the possibility of two added expansion packs in the stretch goals, and rules for advanced league and solo play, Bottom of the 9th will keep gamers wanting to play ball time and time again.\nBottom of the 9th will offer the same hallmark replay value as other Dice Hate Me Games titles, with high-quality components, thick punchboard bits, and lots of wood. Here's a list of what you'll find inside the box:\n20 punchboard player cards, full-color front and one-color back, in a foil-wrapped pack\n2 reference cards\n2 playing field pieces in card stock\n1 custom silk-screened Pitch Die\n1 Pitching Control Die\n1 Swing Die \n4 wooden base-runners\n4 wooden Pitch Tokens (2 red, 2 white)\n3 wooden Out markers\n2 wooden Strike markers\n3 wooden Ball markers\n2 wooden Fatigue markers\nPunchboard \"stick of gum\" batter ball and strike count tracker\n15 Event & Scenario mini cards for solo play\nFull-color rulebook\nSticker sheet (for Pitch Tokens and Fatigue Markers)\nBottom of the 9th will come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Monkey\"-sized box - the same size as The Great Heartland Hauling Co., Belle of the Ball, and Carnival. What's this crazy talk? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nBottom of the 9th is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\nHow to play Bottom of the 9th, from Rodney Smith of Watch it Played!\nWatch a full game of Bottom of the 9th! \nWant to try out Bottom of the 9th for yourself? You can download the print-and-play files right here! You'll need to provide a few components of your own (like some tokens and three dice), but we'll give you the board, the rules, and a sampling of enough pitchers and batters to really get a feel for the game.\nFor those wanting a video how-to-play, here's a great overview of game play by Steve Tower of After Further Review.\nRodney Smith of Watch It Played is also preparing one of his excellent gameplay videos that should be available later this week. Stay tuned, and we'll post as soon as it's ready!\nAnd for those wanting to know more about the development of the game and a discussion on gameplay, you can listen to designer Darrell Louder talk all about it on Ep. 80 of The State of Games podcast! It's a great episode, all about the Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games merger, but for those just wanting jump straight into the Bottom of the 9th action, that starts at the 1hr 11min mark!\nBottom of the 9th was originally designed as a head-to-head competition between two players - that is, until veteran game designer Richard Launius (Defenders of the Realm; Arkham Horror; Run, Fight or Die)  caught baseball fever after playing the game. \nRichard has been a fan for much of his life - the Chicago White Sox adopted his uniform design for the ball club back in 1981, after all - so when the veteran game designer dropped us a line and said he had an idea for solo play? We were all ears.\nThe man, the myth, the legend - Richard Launius, ace fielder.\nRichard's design concept pits one player, controlling the batting lineup, against a randomly-controlled ace pitcher. Scenario and event cards control the game state, creating managing decisions during the game for the player-controlled team. Mike Mullins has been developing and refining Richard's core concept through tweaks and tests, and we are very excited to offer this solo play option inside the box.\nStay tuned to future updates for a link to the refined solo rules!\nAchieving our base funding goal ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish Bottom of the 9th with the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of Bottom of the 9th is priced according to our initial funding goal; however, if we exceed that funding goal we will be able to add more to the game!\nHere is a list of potential stretch goals that would allow us to upgrade components and help us add expansion decks to the game!\nACHIEVED! Folding Playing Field game board - One goal we're super excited about, which is why we put it first! We can now upgrade the Playing Field from cardstock to a thick, dual-fold game board!\nACHIEVED! Laser-etched Pitching Die - We can now afford to upgrade the custom Pitch Control Die from silk-screened to laser-etched.\nACHIEVED! Big League Support expansion pack - This stretch goal introduces 12 new player cards to the game in an expansion pack outside the box (some of which you can see above). There'll be some new pitchers and batters, but with this pack we'll also introduce support personnel such as general managers, a trainer, and even mascots. It'll even be foil-wrapped like baseball cards! The retail value of the expansion pack will be $4.95, but each backer will receive the Big League Support pack for free as part of their pledge!\nACHIEVED! Silk-screened Pitching Tokens - We can now do away with the sticker sheet and silk screen the information right onto the wooden Pitching Tokens!\nACHIEVED! Custom Base Runner Meeples - With this stretch goal, the base runners will be wearing little hats and sprinting for the next base!\nACHIEVED! Sentinels of the 9th expansion pack - In case you missed the news, Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games (makers of the awesome Sentinels of the Multiverse line of card games) have merged! That means we can easily combine resources and do crazy things like put superheroes in our baseball games! In this expansion, you'll be able to bring some familiar Multiverse heroes and characters like Legacy, Haka, Tempest and Mr. Chomps to the field. This would be another expansion pack added outside of the box and retailing for $4.95 - but, of course, backers will receive it for free, adding even more value to your pledge!\nACHIEVED! Custom Pitcher Meeple - This stretch goal will be a little meeple for the mound! It serves no in-game purpose, but it's still amazingly cool. This will be a Kickstarter promotional not included in the regular retail version of the game, and will only be initially available as convention or contest promotionals.\nPlease help spread the word of Bottom of the 9th to family, friends and anyone else you think would enjoy the game so that we can reach our funding goal and roll out those stretch goals!\n\u201cBottom of the 9th is the best baseball simulation I have ever played.\u201d - Mike Fitzgerald, veteran designer of Wyvern, Mystery Rummy, Hooyah, and Baseball Highlights: 2045 (and not to take anything away from Mike's own Baseball Highlights: 2045 which is one of the best baseball games we've ever played)\n\u201cNot since APBA have I enjoyed a baseball game as much as Bottom of the 9th. Suspense, strategy, getting into your opponents head, and dice make this a game that is a Must Buy on the Rolling Dice & Taking Names game scale.\u201d - Tony McRee, Rolling Dice & Taking Names podcast \n\u201cBottom of the 9th is exactly what I wanted it to be - a tense and exciting showdown between pitcher and batter with everything on the line.\u201d - Ben Pinchback, co-designer of Fleet and Eggs & Empires\n\"I could give you a longer review \u2013 yes, but this is a meeple-sized one. And in the end, it really boils down to this \u2013 Bottom of the 9th feels like a game that Dice Hate Me Games would put out, not just in its classic Americana theme, but also in its gameplay. Games published by Dice Hate Me seem to have their own rhythm and cadence in their gameplay, and Bottom of the 9th fits that \u201cDice Hate Me Games feel\u201d to a tee. If you are a fan of baseball or even a fan of games published by Dice Hate Me Games, Bottom of the 9th really should be a game you take a closer look at.\" - Ryan Sanders, The Inquisitive Meeple \n\"Bottom of the 9th is reminiscent of the old, pure, luck-based dice-rolling baseball games. It adds strategy and replayability while retaining enough of a luck mechanic to keep you twitching for your d6 when that pesky batter manages to catch a piece of a pitch and you need to throw him out at first. Quick, fun, and addicting. Best sports game you don't play with a ball.\" - Brian Gerdwagen\n\"This game is tons of fun. It offers up the same feeling of tension as you would while playing (or watching) a real game when it is all on the line. Each game you play will tell a different story.\" - Steebin, The League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"Love how much tension was crammed into such a small game. The selection of pitch location and then the die roll really had you on edge. I also really enjoyed the nostalgia you incorporated with the layout/design.\u201d - Dan Halstad, League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"Loved this game. Instant backer when it hits Kickstarter!\u201d - Steve Seebode, Unpub designer and playtester\nFor those true ball fans who want the very best, we're proud to offer a limited amount of ALL-STAR GAME pledge levels. When you pledge for this level, you'll receive one full copy of Bottom of the 9th signed by Darrell and Mike with all applicable stretch goals, as well as a special clipboard field, signed and numbered, complete with several sheets of box score tracking pads to record your games and league play! You'll also receive a limited promotional Bl\u00fcdle the Noodle mascot card - the official mascot of the Unpub Network! Bl\u00fcdle was given away as a promotional at Unpub 5 in Baltimore, so only attendees of that convention own an official Bl\u00fcdle.\nThese promotional items will only be available for purchase during this Kickstarter campaign. However, you may still be able to find Bl\u00fcdle through certain convention giveaways, or by using Sentinels Points at the Greater Than Games booth at conventions. The clipboards will be given out as prizes for winners of upcoming Bottom of the 9th tournaments at conventions. So if you don't grab the ALL-STAR GAME pledge level here, keep an eye out for these possible promotions at conventions throughout the year!\nAnd if you still really, really want Bl\u00fcdle and can't get an ALL-STAR GAME pledge level, you can add on a promotional Bl\u00fcdle card to any pledge for an additional $5! This card is slightly different than the limited card given out at Unpub 5, but it'll still enable you to easily add Bl\u00fcdle to your games of Bottom of the 9th!\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, Dice Hate Me Games would not be able to bring quality games to market. To show our respect and appreciation, DHMG promises that backer copies of Bottom of the 9th will be shipped out before copies are available for purchase at retailers or conventions. DHMG also pledges to keep all backers informed at every step in the development, printing and delivery processes. We love staying in touch with all of our supporters, so please never hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.\nGreetings ball gamers!\nIt\u2019s officially spring training time and I am super excited for this Kickstarter campaign! Since we started developing and showing off Bottom of the 9th a year ago, so many board game and baseball fans have been expressing enthusiasm and support for the game. Honestly, I can\u2019t remember a game that we\u2019ve announced that has generated more buzz and excitement than Bottom of the 9th, and that is humbling and amazing!\nIt\u2019s also an exciting time for Dice Hate Me Games, as we recently announced our merger with Greater Than Games, which you can read all about here and listen to us talk about here. Some of you who have been supporters of Dice Hate Me Games for a few years now have asked if this will change anything about what DHMG is known for or what we love to do. The emphatic answer is absolutely not - this can only make things better! Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games will be able to work together to bring you the absolute best games out there, guaranteed. This is an amazing opportunity for us - and an incredible time to be a fan of both companies!\nAs always, I appreciate the continued love and support from our Kickstarter family. You\u2019re the absolute best in the game!\nHappy ballgaming!\nChris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with our overseas manufacturer and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and have worked through - and learned from - kinks we may have encountered in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. Sometimes even personal life events can blindside you.

That is the time we will reconcile our bookkeeping with yours!\nShipping for your basic pledge is now automatically added to your pledge based on the country you are shipping to:\nUSA shipping is $4 for Seven7s or $11 for the 5-game bundle\nCanadian shipping is $10 for Seven7s or $12 for the 5-game bundle\nAustralian shipping is $11 for Seven7s or $17 for the 5-game bundle\nNote that this game will ship to you by/around July, 2015!\nOther International Shipping Locations\nWe regret that Seven7s and the rest of the E\u2022G\u2022G Series games do not lend themselves to the Kickstarter experience internationally. These games all have a relatively low MSRP and even lower pledge cost. As a result Shipping Costs  are higher than the cost of the games, and often significantly higher. For this reason, we are not offering pledges for most International backers.\nThese games will be available through the normal distribution channels in the future and we will have them at Essen and other venues where you can pick them up.\nIf you are interested in buying all 5 of the current E\u2022G\u2022G Series, the shipping may be much more reasonable for a bulk order.

One of the first decisions of the Alliance is to build immense space stations all along the galaxy in order to promote trade among the allies, strengthen diplomatic relations and help keep the newly established peace.\nEach player takes the role of one of those races, trying to build the best space station.\nPlayers use a card drafting mechanism, select location cards, place them on their station, and score victory points according to where in the station they place them. Construction lasts 4 rounds and the player with the most points in the end wins the game.\nThe rules can be taught in less than 5 minutes and each game lasts approximately 30 minutes.\nThe game is great for both new and experienced players, and offers elements that can increase complexity and allow different levels of strategy.\nTo download the English rules of Among the Stars, click here.\nAll boxes of the AtS Universe. New Dawn & Among the Stars + Expansions.\n  A new era has begun. The Alliance's attempt to revive the worlds that were destroyed during the Purge was met with great success and the future looks bright for the first time. Those sectors that were abandoned before, have now become very active and are blooming with life.\nDue to the increased traffic, the construction of new Stations in the area was deemed necessary. Once again, the alien races rush to build the best Space Station, in order to take advantage of the new opportunities that arise. To that end, Advisors are being sent by the Alliance to assist in the construction. \nRevival is a stand-alone 2-player game, as well as an expansion for Among the Stars. It includes exciting new features such as: \n\u2022 30 Brand new Locations  - 15 Basic and 15 Special (90 cards).\n\u2022 New 2-player rules that are more strategic and skill-testing. These rules can also be used for Among the Stars base game.\n\u2022 Spaceships is a new highly-interactive mechanic used by a lot of the new cards. It allows the players to put Spaceship tokens on the Stations, preventing anyone from building on those spaces.\n\u2022 Advisors is a new module that can be optionally added in a game of Among the Stars. It increases competition among the players in order to control Advisor cards that grant them special abilities as well as additional victory points.\nTo download the English rules of Revival, click here (pre-published version)\nYou can watch a review of Revival by Rahdo here:\n You can watch a review of Revival by Undead Viking here:\nThe Ambassadors \n8 years later, the memories of the purge which brought about the end to the war are still fresh. There is still fear and distrust among the members of the Alliance, and the construction of the stations has proven to be more challenging than expected. The purpose of the alliance is questioned and immediate action is required.\nAmbassadors from each race are dispatched to every corner of the galaxy to assist in the construction of the stations.\nThis expansion adds a new action that allows you to invite ambassadors from other races who give you permanent or one time abilities.

Supplier shortage, holiday traffic and weather conditions are just a few of the reasons a production could be delayed. Artipia Games should not be held responsible for delays caused by third parties. In addition, some of the items shown might differ from final product due to supplier/manufacturer error.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS \nWhen dealing with a large number of orders, there is always a chance that errors will occur. If after you receive your order, you find out that there are items missing, please contact us at support [at] artipiagames.com and we will send you the missing items as soon as possible. \nIf your package arrives damaged, please take a few photos of all damaged items and email them to us at support [at] artipiagames.com. We will send you replacements for the damaged items as soon as possible. Our previous packing solution was over 99.5% damage-proof. However, there were a few cases where the packages were hit so hard that damage was caused to the games\u2019 boxes. Replacement were sent to the backers who received damaged boxes. The games shipped through this campaign, will be sent out in a larger and stronger package which will better protect the contents against such damage.\n\nDELIVERY DATE \nOur current estimation for delivery is August 2015. We are optimistic that this campaign will be delivered sooner than that. However history has shown that no matter how well you plan things, there is always a chance of delays caused by third parties. Please understand that we want your orders to be delivered quickly as much as you do. Please note that some of the promo material may be delivered separately in a later date due to production time needed.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS \nIf a package is not delivered due to a backer's fault (wrong address given, backer didn't claim the delivered package from their post office, etc), the backer may be requested to pay additional shipping fees for the item to be sent out again.\n\nDELIVERY ADDRESS \nAs soon as this campaign is over, you will be requested to complete a survey through which you can let us know which items you have ordered as well as where you would like us to ship your order to. By keeping in mind that your order may be shipped sooner or later than the estimated date, please give us an address that will surely not change. (If for example you think that you may be moving to a new house around February, please give us the address of a friend or relative to ensure a successful delivery)\n\nSHIPPING \nPlease read the Shipping section above.\n\nORDER FULLFILMENT \nPlease note that your order may be delivered in multiple packages. This is done due to weight limitations for group shipments. Each game or expansion ordered through this campaign will most likely be delivered on a separate package. Even though the items you ordered will be shipped at the same time, there is always a chance they will arrive to you several days apart.

Starting out with just a simple trick and a handful of helpers, you will embark on a journey to become the greatest illusionist alive.\nInspired by movies like the Prestige, Now You See Me and the Houdini mini-series, we created a world where magic and illusion are part of people\u2019s everyday lives. Most of the magic tricks in the game are part of the repertoires of real world illusionists, past and present, but a pinch of supernatural was also added to the mix \u2013 just so you can never be sure whether those Spiritual tricks are really merely illusions...\nEach turn, you will visit Magoria\u2019s various Locations \u2013 the Downtown, the Market Row, the Dark Alley and the Theater \u2013 to expand your team, learn more and more intricate magic tricks, get components for them, and prepare them in your Workshop. Each turn concludes with a Performance phase in the Theater, when players may perform a breathtaking magic show for Fame points and money. After the sixth Performance phase, the player with the most Fame points wins the game, and becomes the next Legend of Illusion.\nThe four starting characters are all inspired by great illusionists of the golden age of magic. You can read their story at trickerionboardgame.com.\nThanks to you helping us fund in less than 24 hours, we will add four more Magicians to the game! \nBoth the Illusionist and the Legend Box will ship with 8 Magicians to choose from instead of the original four, with four additional double-sided Magician cards and four additional Magician Poster Cards.\nThe four new Magicians will be revealed in this section as the project moves forward, so check back often!\nMore Coming Soon!\nTrickerion is a massive game, but its length and complexity is yours to decide!\nThe base game is very easy to grasp and takes 60-90 minutes, but for a truly epic battle of wits, feel free to enhance the game with the Dark Alley and the Magician Powers built-in expansions.\nThe Dark Alley expansion is included in both the Illusionist and the Legend Box.\nThis expansion adds a whole new Location to the game. It also comes with 60 new Special Assignment cards, a new tier of Tricks, and 20 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn, giving the game additional variety.\nThe Magician Powers expansion is included only in the Legend Box.\nYour Trickerion Shards gain a whole new gameplay significance with this expansion: They will unlock Power Card slots that allow you to customize your Magician by learning diverse abilities to enhance your game. As there are 90 different Power cards available, it will open up a multitude of new strategies and adds even more replayability to the game!\n\u201cThis is a rock-solid worker placement with a bunch of really, really cool evolutions.\u201d\n- Rahdo Runs Through\nTrickerion is a worker placement game at its heart, but we've added many new elements to spice up the formula and create a fresh gaming experience for even the most seasoned tabletop game fans out there.\nBefore placing their characters, players secretly and simultaneously plan their turns using Assignment cards, reducing player downtime during the placement phase, and letting you adjust your strategy according to your opponents\u2019 plans \u2013 if you can see through them!\nLocations in Trickerion have several Actions to choose from, each costing a number of Action Points. You are unlikely to get fully blocked out of a Location, but the number of Action Points you\u2019ll get to spend on Actions strongly depends on when you get to a Location and who you\u2019re getting there with.\nEach turn concludes with the grandiose Performance Phase, when the shows prepared during the turn are presented to the awestruck audience. The way these performances shape up is entirely up to the players: from a single trick gig to 6-trick blockbusters, Thursday to Sunday, you can even co-perform with others for greater rewards \u2013 the possibilities are endless.\nEnglish Rules\nFrench Rules (translated image captions here)\nCzech Rules\nCheck out our latest, formatted rule book for detailed rules of the game.

Internationally, we pay for shipping from China; customs and government fees and taxes; dock fees; transport to warehouse expenses; warehouse fulfillment charges (including handling and materials) and the postal rates charged by your country.\nIt has been our experience that many people (including sophisticated Kickstarter Backers) frequently confuse \"shipping\" expense and \"postage\" expense. What we try to cover with the above fees (in part) is shipping expenses, not just postage. Postage is the actual charge your country's postal service (or UPS, FedEx, etc) charges us to deliver a package within that country. Shipping is far more comprehensive and includes: getting the container shipped to the US, or EU or Australia; the Customs and VAT (or equivalent) and other import fees and taxes; the drayage from the port to the warehouse (not cheap!); the warehouse fees to unload and sort out and prepare packages; the materials and labor involved in the last item; fees to the warehouse for their service to us, and only after all of that, the postage! We need to cover all of those costs--and they really add up. Frequently they cost as much or more than the game(s) did to produce. When we combine a low margin price (such as this one we are offering on Floating Market) with this shipping expense, we do not make any profit if we are not very careful. The shipping we are charging for this project is as low as we can make it and still stay in business.\nIn the US, for two games, it would be $58 for the games and $14 for shipping (a total of $72). \nInternationally, for two or more games, get in touch with us and tell us the total of how many games you want and which ones; and where you would like them shipped.

Select a reward from the column to the right or click one of the rewards on the image above.\n  Handground is the result of thousands of coffee enthusiasts around the world contributing their time and ideas. From home brewers to national barista champions, people from all corners of the world have leant lifetimes of experience with coffee. \nThe power of this experience shines through in the design of the Handground coffee grinder. It took hundreds of iterations and incremental improvements to get to the final design and there is no other way it could have been done without the help of these people. Here are just a few pictures of the people behind Team Handground.\nBy backing this project you will join Team Handground and have the opportunity to participate in decisions going forward as we move into production. \nThe idea to make a better coffee grinder started from something we called the \"Crowdsourced Coffee Experiment\". We were attempting to apply a Japanese principle called Kaizen to our coffee routine. It wasn\u2019t long before we learned how important a good grinder is to making better coffee so we purchased an entry level manual grinder. \nThe new burr grinder was a noticeable improvement over the blade grinder, however we couldn't help but notice areas for improvement. Since Kaizen means continuous improvement we started to look for better options. Yet after searching the market and seeing the same ancient designs being repeated over and over we finally thought, we can do better.\nOriginally we wanted to name the company Kaizen Coffee but decided to do a survey with our top 4 name choices. The surveys came back and we learned a ton of things that we didn't know that we didn't know. For example, Kaizen is impossible to spell and associated with German culture (which isn\u2019t a bad thing) but it is a Japanese term that was being perceived as something other than what we intended.  \nHandground, on the other hand, was easy to spell, simple to remember, and had tons of positive connotations. The choice was obvious, but only after consulting the coffee community. We decided to apply the same crowdsourcing principles everywhere we could for the rest of product development. That's when we held a design competition. Hundreds of designs came in and Team Handground helped narrow down the pool to 6 finalists. After the final round of voting, Joaquin Herlein had won with a design that was the beginning of everything you see now.  \nJoaquin has continued working with Team Handground to improve on the initial design. Every time a major design decision or tradeoff arrises, members of Team Handground give their opinions and ideas through surveys and open ended responses. This effort has led to a 50% reduction in the number of screws used and an overall height that brings the grinder into alignment with the golden ratio. \nWe started our Instagram on day one as a way for us to document our journey but it has turned into so much more. I don't think we want to try to count how many hours we've spent on IG, but the community we found is great. \nWe decided to take the show on the road during the Kickstarter campaign and tour up the west coast to visit some of the biggest coffee cities in the USA. If you live in any of these cities, come say hi and see the Handground prototype in person.\nMaterial Specifications\nBlack Handground Grinder\nThe black version of the Handground grinder will be made out of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, otherwise known as ABS plastic. ABS is considered superior for its hardness, gloss, toughness, and electrical insulation properties. ABS's light weight and ability to be injection molded and extruded make it useful in manufacturing products for everything from musical instruments, to golf clubs heads, to automotive components including bumpers, protective headgear, luggage and protective carrying cases, to coffee grinders :) The list is endless for the applications of ABS plastic.\nIt is a very strong and durable plastic that will withstand the abuse of even the most careless coffee brewers.\nNickel AND Copper Handground Grinder\nThe nickel and copper versions of the Handground grinder will be made out of ABS plastic and then electroplated with either nickel or copper metal.\nElectroplating enables us to coat plastic with metal to achieve a real metal surface to increase the strength of the plastic substantially without adding a ton of weight to the product. This is a common practice used in home appliances like the sink faucets and handles and in the auto industry. These products look and feel metal because they are coated in actual metal, but if you were to break one in half (which is very hard) you would see that the inside is actually made of a hard plastic. We have currently chosen this method to achieve the nickel and copper finished versions of the grinder.\nAs discussed in the Risks and challenges, if this process does not live up to our standards and survive our thorough strength and durability tests, we will explore other methods to achieve the results we are looking for, including possibly die-casting the parts out of full metal.\nConical Burrs\nThe burrs are 38mm conical burr mills made from densely sintered Alumina ceramic which has high strength and hardness, temperature stability, and high wear resistance and corrosion resistance. We are continuing to experiment with material composition, the treatment process for the ceramic, and mechanical design aspects such as the angle and sharpness of the teeth. We will keep everyone updated on our progress with the burrs.\nStainless steel components\nThe main vertical axle and all screws and washers that will be in contact with the beans will be made from 300 grade stainless steel that you typically see in pans and other cookery tools.\nStainless steel is non-porous, it resists bacteria and germs more effectively than wood or plastic surfaces. It also is one of the most hygienic surfaces available, so any foods that come into contact with the surface or material do not attract dirt or germs. Stainless steel also does not react with coffee or other drink/food products.\nGrind Levels\n\nThe finest micron level for the grinder is currently set at 100 microns, increasing at 125 micron intervals. We are testing this range and even considering reducing the micron intervals for the first few steps at the finer range so that you can really hone in on your favorite espresso fine grind.\n\nDesign: Joaquin Herlein\nVideo Production, Editing & Sound: Alexis Morrell\nSourcing: Don Craig & BriteHub\nPrototyping: Shapeways & Quickparts\nVideo Contributions: Slayer Espresso & Cold Bruer\nBrewing Device Icons: Eric Ellis", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile manufacturing a product has become increasingly easier in today's well-connected world, there are always unforeseen challenges in bringing a brand new product into production. To best prepare for these challenges, we've been consulting with both successful Kickstarter inventors and coffee industry experts.\n\nWe've partnered with a sourcing company that has 25 years experience working with factories around the world. They employ professionals both locally in the US and internationally in Asia. Because of their experience working with top-quality factories in Asia, we are confident that we will be able to manufacture a high quality product from this region. We have already completed a round of factory tours and have selected the manufacturers that are most capable of building this product.\n\nThe next step of development is the consultation of a professional engineering firm to help conduct stress & longevity analysis. We will be integrating their feedback into our final design for manufacturing and then proceed with the factory that we choose to build the tooling for plastic injection molding. We will be actively involved with the tooling and validation, and plan to travel to the factories in order to inspect and test the initial production pieces before shipment.\n\nAs of right now, we see the greatest possible challenges in the areas below:\n\nCoffee Wood Knob: It has been our goal to source the wood for the knob from actual coffee trees from a coffee farm in Central/South America. Coffee wood is rarely, if ever, used to make physical products but our research shows that it has a very high tensile strength. Right now, we have found a large farm in Costa Rica that is going through a major renovation of their farming plot and will have thousands of old coffee shrubs available for our use. The problem that remains is finding a professional wood-shop that is located within a reasonable distance of the farm and capable of mass producing the wood knobs fast enough to then be shipped to our factory for assembly before we ship worldwide, in addition to conducting further tests on strength and durability. This is an ambitious goal that received high interest from Team Handground when we presented the idea months ago. It was clear that everyone loves the idea but that we can do without it, if it raises the cost of production too high.\n\nThe wood knob you see now on the prototype is called wengy wood. This is currently our first choice for wood because it is much easier to source than coffee wood. It\u2019s only downside is that it is fairly expensive, although absolutely beautiful. If we are unable to source a large quantity of coffee wood or wengy wood at a reasonable price, then we may have to consider a different type of wood that will achieve a similar look and feel.\n\nElectroplating is a process that uses electric current to reduce dissolved metals so that they form a coherent metal coating on another surface. In other words, science enables us to coat almost any material (including plastic) with metal to achieve a real metal surface that looks and feels like metal because it is metal, to increase the strength of the plastic substantially without adding a ton of weight to the product. This is a common practice used in home appliances like the sink faucets and handles and in the auto industry. These products look and feel metal because they are coated in actual metal, but if you were to break one in half (which is very hard) you would see that the inside is actually made of a hard plastic. We have currently chosen this method to achieve the nickel and copper finished versions of the grinder.\n\nThe prototype shown in this Kickstarter has a brushed nickel-like finish. Very thin black lines give the appearance that the product has been brushed. Brushed electroplating achieves this look by physically brushing the plastic parts with a plating solution. Brush electroplating has several advantages over \u201ctank plating\u201d, including portability, ability to plate items that for some reason cannot be tank plated, low or no masking requirements, and comparatively low plating solution volume requirements. Disadvantage compared to tank plating includes greater operator involvement, which can substantially increase the cost of production. We will be able to calculate the cost of production better once we know the initial demand for the grinder through Kickstarter. If the cost for brushed electroplating is too high, or if backers as a part of Team Handground decide they like a different finish better, we can choose from one of many other metal finishes for the grinder, such as a smooth matte finish, to a shiny reflective finish, that don\u2019t require brushed electroplating.\n\nWith that said, high quality and strength are our major goals, and even though electroplating is strong on paper, if it does not live up to our standards and survive our thorough strength and durability tests, we will explore other methods to achieve the results we are looking for, including possibly die-casting the parts out of full metal.\n\n\nGear material choice: We are currently using brass miter gears to transfer power from the side-mounted handle to the vertical shaft that drives the ceramic burr grinding mechanism. Our initial goal was to use two different sized gears to achieve a higher spin ratio (2:1) so that one turn of the arm corresponded to 2 turns of the burr grinder. This greatly increases the difficulty in turning the handle and we have decided not to use two different sized gears. We are now using brass miter gears that are high in strength. These gears are strong enough but we are continuing to experiment with gears made of other materials, including, but not limited to, stainless steel and delrin, a self-lubricating high strength plastic.\n\nThat is all! We will keep you informed with regular updates as our product gets closer to production, and we'll be doing everything possible to stay on schedule and deliver you a high quality and beautiful product. As we\u2019ve done since day one, we will keep everyone involved and be 100% transparent throughout the process. We will turn to you as a backer to help us make decisions as they arise throughout this process, from Kickstarter to your front door.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "New Burr Mounting System - Upgrade Kits Are Available!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Copper Grinders Are Finished and Now Shipping!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Production of the Copper Grinders is Underway!", "update_content": "We are happy to report that the copper grinders are finally ready for production.

If you discover the game after the project ends, you can order the retail version of the game (it\u2019s the same version you see here with all stretch goals) on the Stonemaier Games website.\nThe creators of Viticulture and Euphoria bring you Between Two Cities, a partnership-driven, tile-drafting, competitive city-building game that 1-7 players can play in 20-25 minutes.\nDesigned by Ben Rosset and Matthew O'Malley and developed by Jamey Stegmaier, Between Two Cities caught the attention of Stonemaier Games thanks to the unique intersection between cooperative play (build cities with 2 partners) and competitive play (only 1 winner).\nYou can experience the way Between Two Cities blends the gameplay of 7 Wonders, Carcassonne, Alhambra, and Among the Stars by checking out the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files.\nThe 6 tile types in the game: Shop, Park, House, Office, Tavern, and Factory.\nBetween Two Cities is a complete game with a full set of linen-embossed tiles and custom wooden tokens, but we have some stretch goals to help make the game experience even better!\nAll stretch goals are fully playtested (see photos of some of our amazing playtesters below) and will be included in every copy of Between Two Cities (Kickstarter and retail).\nClick here for the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files. Between Two Cities has been playtested by over 250 people and is almost production-ready.\nFind all media mentions and reviews of Between Two Cities on our website and join the discussion about the game on BoardGameGeek.\nBoard Game Quest preview\nGeekDad review\nTheology of Games review\nBoard Gamers Anonymous review (podcast and written review)\nFather Geek review\nE&E's Spellenmolen (Dutch review)\nNVS Gameplays\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don't like Between Two Cities within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it for a full pledge refund. We'll even pay for shipping.\nLimited Availability: We don't do Kickstarter exclusive items, but we'll only print a limited number of the special edition as based on the final pledge totals.\nMake It Better for Everyone: The more stretch goals we reach, the more enhanced and beautiful the game will be! \nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators--we truly value your input as we put the finishing touches on the game, and we promptly address all questions and ideas.\nLocalized Shipping: Our shipping fees for Kickstarted games are so low because we send games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world. This is your chance to lock in the lowest possible shipping rate.\nBackers Come First: You'll get your copy of Between Two Cities well before it enters traditional distribution channels. Remember that retailers can be backers too!\nWe Need You: We've covered the cost of graphic design, art, and development for Between Two Cities, but we can't manufacture and ship the game without your support.\nA few of the 250+ playtesters who helped us along the way.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to eliminate customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total copies per pledge, as that's the number that can fit inside a shipping carton with proper packaging. For additional copies, you can pledge under a different Kickstarter account.\nBetween Two Cities is played in three rounds. In each round, you'll start with a fresh hand of tiles. Select two of those tiles, passing the rest to the player on your left or right (depends on the round). Place one of those tiles in the city on your left and one in the city on your right, then pick up the hand that was passed to you and repeat the process.\nThe middle round actually involves drawing 3 rectangular \"duplex\" tiles (two building tiles side by side in a vertical or horizontal configuration) and selecting 2 of them--there is no drafting in this round.\nAfter all three rounds, you will have built a 4x4 city on your left and a 4x4 city on your right. Add up the scores for all cities, but only compare your lowest scoring city to each other player's lowest-scoring city to determine the winner.\nEach of the tiles (art shown below) scores in the following way. The final tiles have scoring reminders below the art:\nShop (yellow): The more shops you have in a row or column, the higher the score.\nPark (green): Each group of adjacent parks score an ascending amount of points based on the number park tiles in the group.\nHouse (brown): Each house scores a point for each other tile type in the city (they want variety).\nOffice (blue): The more offices, the better. If they're next to at least 1 Tavern, they score a bonus point.\nTavern (red): There are 4 types of taverns (different icons)--you want to get as many sets of different tavern types as possible.\nFactory (gray): The cities with the most factories score more points per factory than other cities.\nThe game includes a head-to-head 2-player variant that removes the partnership mechanism but increases the impact of the tiles you choose to pass (or not pass) to your opponent. \nClick here for the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files.\nThe special edition of Between Two Cities features a limited-run version of the game. The game itself is the same, but the box will be embossed in gold foil highlights and will be stamped with a number unique to your copy of the game (e.g., \"1287 / 4000\"). The special edition also includes rules in French and German (in addition to English rules).\nThe special edition will also include 7 additional pairs of city tokens. When we were designing the city tokens, we designed 14 of them and had e-newsletter subscribers vote on their favorites. The top 7 were selected for the retail game, but we liked the other 7 so much that we decided to include them in the special edition for extra flavor. They do not expand the game past 7 players or impact the gameplay in any way.\nIn addition to the standard city tokens, the special edition also includes the Arc de Triomphe, US Capitol, Brandenburg Gate, St. Basil's, Big Ben, the White House, and the Forbidden City. Each token in the final version will be a unique color.\nOne of the exciting aspects of designing a complete core game is you generate a lot of ideas for expansions. We look forward to discussing these possibilities with backers during and after the Kickstarter campaign to see the types of expansions they're the most excited about. These are the two styles of expansions we're considering:\nVertical: These would expand upon the base game, allowing players to develop their cities through the ages by adding more rounds and new tile types.\nHorizontal: These would take the core mechanisms of the game and translate them to other themes, like Between Two Castles, Planets, Dystopias, etc.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of our game to retailers during the campaign.

Thanks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween Two Cities is a first for us in that it's the first game published by Stonemaier Games that wasn't designed by Jamey Stegmaier--rather, it's from designers Ben Rosset and Matthew O'Malley. Jamey served as the game's developer, honing it, balancing it, and trying to make sure that every decision is fun and interesting. This process was made easy by the designers' willingness to hear and test new ideas.\n\nDuring the evolution of Stonemaier Games, we've learned the importance of blind playtesting (having people learn the game from the rulebook and test the game away from the designers). We've been fortunate to have hundreds of Stonemaier Ambassadors and their friends volunteer to playtest our games so as to make them as good as possible for the first print run. We've also learned the value of having checks and balances at every step in the production process, but when we do mess up, we go above and beyond to remedy the error.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisers to point us in the right direction. We also work with Panda Game Manufacturing to produce the game, a company with a wealth of knowledge and experience.\n\nStonemaier Games has delivered all of our Kickstarter rewards from 4 projects within a few months of the estimated delivery date, sometimes even early. However, we seek to continue to improve that process to keep shipping rates low, deliver quickly, and ensure that the games arrive in perfect condition. We've learned that shipments sent from China to Australia need fumigation certificates for wooden components and that products shipped anywhere need \"Made in China\" clearly listed on the exterior of every product for them to clear customs. In short, we've made mistakes, and not only have we learned from them, we've shared them transparently with backers and on our blog to help other creators.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 100+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Between Two Cities: Capitals Release Day!", "update_content": "Today is a special day.

On 27 August 1883, the volcano on the island of Krakatoa erupted in a massive explosion, throwing large quantities of ash and dust high into the atmosphere, producing spectacular sunsets and afterglows around the world. Volcanic dust also has a more serious impact on the world\u2019s climate. Because it blocks a proportion of the incoming solar radiation, temperatures on the Earth\u2019s surface are reduced. After the Krakatoa eruption, several years of cold summers and harsh winters followed as a result of this effect. Ascroft recorded optical phenomena attributed to the after-effects of the eruption until 1886. \nJoli Quentin Kansil is the inventor of 36 games. The most prominent is Bridgette, a two-player bridge game that he designed while in high school. The game was first marketed in 1970 and was sold continuously for 40 years. It is one of only 25 games in the Games Magazine Hall of Fame. Other popular games of his include \u2018What\u2019s My Word?\u2019 \u2014 a classic word game; \u2018Indochine \u2013 2000\u2019 \u2014 now sold as \u2018Solitaire for Two\u2019; \u2018Marrakesh\u2019 \u2014 a board game that was called \u2018Game of the Year\u2019 in 1980 by the editor of Games Magazine; and \u2018Krakatoa\u2019. In 1992, he was honored as Game Inventor of the Year in Essen, Germany.\nBesides game designing, Joli Quentin Kansil was formerly a teacher in Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore \u2014 and Hawaii, where he was briefly a teacher of President Barack Obama at Punahou School. He has traveled extensively in some 230 countries and colonies, including Mongolia, Bhutan, the Marquesa Islands, Pitcairn, and Antarctica. He now lives in Makati in the Philippines.\nThe E\u2022G\u2022G Series is a brand new series of small box (5.75\" by 4.25\") games being published by Eagle-Gryphon Games (E\u2022G\u2022G).\nEggs and Empires is our first title in the new E\u2022G\u2022G series, designed by the talented Fleet duo of Matt Riddle and Ben Pinchback.

Mortimer's second published game, the first small game by LudiCreations, and one for which we have done a lot of work to bring to you.\nHere is what it brings to the table:\nIn addition, Pocket Imperium is language-independent and can be explained in 5 minutes.\nDuring a game of Pocket Imperium 2-4 players* will Expand (get more ships), Explore (move fleets) and Exterminate (conquer planets). At the end of each round, they will Exploit (sustain their fleets) and earn points.\nTiming is everything, as the choices that each player makes has consequences! If more than one neighboring player chooses the same action, then they both have to make do with less.\nA further layer of gameplay rests on the way players move their fleets on the map. The constantly changing power dynamics lead to temporary alliances - which may have unintended consequences, as players seek an edge.\nFinally, choosing what sectors of space to receive points from is yet another strategic choice. Combined with the constant struggle to control (or deny the control of) Tri-Prime, which gives an often-significant bonus, players must choose wisely where they draw their points from.\nNow, every backer also gets:\n(click here to read the rules of this promo tile)\nThe following things are different than the GoodLitttleGames PnP version of the game:\nThe game is now for 2-4 players, rather than 3.\nHex tiles (2mm cardboard) instead of cards.\nFully symmetrical sectors, for easier & more variable setup.\nDouble-sided sectors, allowing for even more variety.\nCustom-shaped spaceships, instead of self-supplied tokens.\nVP tokens.\nAdditional illustrations & improvements in graphic design\nStreamlined rulebook with additional clarifications & variants.\nProfessionally produced, in a compact cardboard box.\nNEW: Mech Worlds promo tile.\nSizes:\nBox: 82 x 124 x 25 mm (7.16 x 4.88 x 0.98 in)\nSector tiles: polyhexagons, 90 mm (3.54 in) edge-to-edge\nCards: 56 x 87 mm (2.20 x 3.42 in)\nVP tiles: hexagons, 15 mm (0.59 in) edge-to-edge\nSpaceships: 11-15 x 21-27 mm (0.43-0.59 x 0.82-1.06 in)\nTo find out more, download the rules, watch the videos, read the reviews below, and join us for a live Vassal game!\n* See \"The Future\" section below.\nEven though the game has been developed since its PnP days to include much more in gameplay and components, Pocket Imperium remains very simple, befitting its microgame origins.\nFor more detail on the components and mechanisms of Pocket Imperium, download the rulebook here (1.5 MB, right click and Save as...). Please download this file, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not display properly. This file is the low-resolution version of the rules document. The rules will be translated in French & German as well.\nIf you would like to skip reading the rules, here's how to play:\n1. Plan your actions\nPlanning actions is as simple as choosing which of your 3 cards to play 1st, 2nd and 3rd. That's it!\n2. Expand, Explore, Exterminate\n3. Exploit\nPlayers sustain their fleets, using the resources to support from 1 (empty space) to 4 (Tri-Prime) ships per hex. Then the players score a sector of space.\nFurther down this page you can see a video of a full game being played on Vassal. You can also check out Rahdo's runthrough, to see how it feels to play the game.\nPocket Imperium is available as a Vassal module, so that you may play before you back. You may download the module here, and enjoy all the benefits of Print 'n' Play without any of the printing, cutting and glueing. You can get the latest version of Vassal here.\nWe are also running live games on Vassal, every day at 5pm ET. To find out your local time, please click here. To sign up, simply message us via a KS message with your Skype name.\nThe games will be for up to 4 players, first-come, first serve. Here's a screencast of a recent game, which will also help you see how the game plays:\nNote that games in Vassal take longer than games with the real-life components.\nTo download a PnP version of the game, click here. Some graphics may be a bit out of date. You will need 48 wooden tokens in 4 colors.\nPocket Imperium is a small game - our first. However, it is not a cheap one to make. To give you an idea, we have already paid 1920 EUR (~2500 USD at the time) for the tools to make the custom spaceships.\nFurthermore, because we have the games produced in Europe, and because we make no discounts in quality, we need to make this campaign count.\nHowever, we always ask only what we need to make the game happen, and this is why the game is offered at such a low level, despite the costs.\nA Kickstarter campaign is not a financial windfall for us, and we will seek to be profitable through traditional distribution, which also ensures a stable future for the game.\nTherefore, we only have a limited amount of discounted copies to give as rewards. Once we have what we need, and the campaign is funded, the game is essentially for sale. We will still offer the game at discount while the campaign runs, but as we have done before, these pledge levels will be locked down if/when we add free content (see below) to each backer's reward.\nWe will be selling the game for at least 25 EUR (~30 USD) at Essen & from our website, and normal shipping costs are between 5 EUR (~6 USD) and 17 EUR (~20 USD), depending on location.\nThe total post-campaign cost could be as high as 42 USD, not including any content that is free for backers but that we will sell separately afterwards, as we have done before. For example, a promo or a small expansion may be given to backers for free, and then sold afterwards.\n- - - - - - - - - - -\nUPDATE 26 JANUARY 2015:\nAs stated above, every backer will now receive Mech Worlds for free (later to be sold for 5 EUR (~6 USD) and used as a convention promo).\n- - - - - - - - - - -\nAlthough Pocket Imperium is likely to see US distribution, it will be months after we ship backer rewards, and as before, it will be in limited quantities.\nA short explanation of the pledge levels:\n$20 - Funding level, available until the campaign goal is reached. $5 shipping to selected countries.\n$20 - Registered letter level, limited to 100. $20 shipping via registered letter anywhere.\n$25 - Post-funding level, available until we add something more to every backer's reward. $5 shipping to selected countries.\n$30 - Generous-backer level, available until we add something more to every backer's reward. If it gets to this, the value of the rewards will still be greater than MSRP. $5 shipping to selected countries.\nWe expect to fulfill all the rewards ourselves, from Finland. EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nTracking is only offered through the registered letter level, and only to certain countries (see below).\nThere is a possibility that we will be able to fulfill USA-bound rewards from within the USA, as we have done with our previous campaigns, if it will improve the speed & quality of the delivery.\nShipments to non-EU backers will have 17 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 19 USD / 24 CAD / 24 AUD / 17 CHF / 2264 JPY, and should be under the threshold that triggers customs duties in most countries.\nFor the first time ever, we are offering a separate pledge level, for up to 100 backers that wish to receive their reward via registered letter (click here for more details). Tracking is available in Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. We make no guarantees that tracking will work, as reporting from the destination country is often spotty. Delivery to some countries is only available via this pledge level. This method does not guarantee quicker delivery, it only means a more secure way to ship the game.\n What You See Is What You Get - this is our doctrine, and we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that offering add-ons and/or introducing stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We intend to print with the highest quality materials anyway and we will not cut any corners.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels, that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals to get excited about. Therefore, raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nFurthermore, because the games are made in Europe, and because we do small print runs, we do not benefit by economies of scale by producing more copies of the game.\nIf we do offer additional content, we will lock past pledge levels to reward those that supported us early without the promise of the extra content. That's it - you do not need to pay more, or like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter or be a fan on BGG - although all of those things are nice of you if you do them, we want you to do them if you want to, not because of a carrot we dangle in front of you.\nWe do not do add-ons (not even our other games), because we want to keep our operations simple, and deliver efficiently. We are in this for the long run, so it does not help us to squeeze a few more dollars from a few backers, if we disappoint *all* backers.\nWe also have a maximum number of copies we can feasibly print and ship during this campaign. Therefore it is possible - as we have done previously in one of our campaigns - that we might lock the maximum number of pledges available across all pledge levels.\nDavid has designed a number of expansions and promo items for Pocket Imperium, and has even more in development. If the campaign is successful, we would like to publish them. If that is decided during the campaign, we will give this material to the backers for free, and lock down previous pledge levels.\nMore importantly, we would like to make Pocket Imperium playable for more than 4 players. Due to the development work done during the past year and a half, it is possible to do so. Some playtesting needs to be done, and if this campaign is successful, we will seek to implement this.\nThe goal is to publish a \"Volume II\", with 4 new shapes and colors, so that it can be combined with this edition for games of up to 8 players. In theory, it is possible to play Pocket Imperium with up to 16 players.\nGame design: David J. Mortimer\nIllustration & Graphic design: Todd Sanders\nVisual identity & rules development: Brett J.

Blue Player has a total of 8 Victory Points, 5 from colonized planets and 3 from his/her Empire Level.\nThe Control Card and the Dice\nA level 1 Empire starts with 4 dice. You get 1 free re-roll (as many dice as you'd like) every turn. Still don't like your roll? Spend Energy; 1 Energy for each additional re-roll.\nPlanet Cards - Acquiring & Conquering\nAcquiring Resources is based on what kind of Planet Cards your Ships are on. The Blue Player has a Ship on both an Energy Planet Card and a Culture Planet Card.\nYou can download the prototype rules below.

Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nAll rewards for this project will be shipped from the US.\nDelivering Your Reward\nMy number one goal, and responsibility, is to deliver the rewards that you pledge for. I'm proud to say that I have achieved this with every project that I have run, but not without learning from mistakes. \nI was burned on unexpected increases to shipping costs with Tiny Epic Defenders, and quickly learned that I have to be more responsible in accounting for that risk.\nTo do this, I must adjust my shipping discounts. Shipping is a volatile cost that I cannot undermine. I simply cannot commit to shipping methods or discounts that would price me out of fulfilling my responsibility and promise to you. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to me, regardless of location, there are just certain realities in shipping costs that we all have to face. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, I have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but US shipping is not free. Shipping discounts, as well as game discounts, get even deeper at higher quantity packs, making 6 and 10 packs great group pledges!\nRegarding customs; because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 or 2 copies, should not get hit with customs or import fees. We shipped thousands of copies of Tiny Epic Kingdoms to international backers and I've only heard of a couple of incidents where a backer (of 1 or 2 copies) was hit with any sort of fees.\nAlso please keep this in mind; the base game will retail with a $25 MSRP. So international backers who get the base game ($16 for the game + $12 for international shipping) are only paying $3 more than a future gamer who picks the game up off the shelf in the US! AND, if you are getting the deluxe version, you're getting an even better deal! The total cost (not including effort) to acquire and \"assemble\" a deluxe copy after the Kickstarter will be at least $35 BEFORE shipping. I say assemble because you will not be able to buy it all in one place, you'll have to pay for shipping twice. This is assuming that the BGG store picks up the deluxe content, which they have not committed to at this time. \n\"Tiny Epic\" is a series of games designed by Scott Almes and published by Gamelyn Games. Each game in this series must strictly adhere to TWO core values: Tiny and Epic! Tiny meaning small (pocket-sized) box with simple and easy to understand rules. Epic meaning gratifying gameplay with lots of strategy and replay-ability. Over the course of numerous games, the series will explore many unique genres and themes.\nCurrently the line features a 4X/Civ game called Tiny Epic Kingdoms and a cooperative Tower Defense game called Tiny Epic Defenders.\nTiny Epic Galaxies, a dice driven/engine building game is the third installment in the smash-hit-series!\nThe \"Tiny Epic\" series began at exactly this time LAST year with its flagship game Tiny Epic Kingdoms! Which has since been fulfilled and backers are LOVING IT!! \nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Kingdoms' Kickstarter page\nThe second game in the series is a thematic sequel to Tiny Epic Kingdoms called Tiny Epic Defenders.\nClick to visit the Tiny Epic Defenders' Kickstarter page\nAfter Tiny Epic Galaxies, gamers can expect to see more Tiny Epic games in the near future! Stay tuned by joining the Gamelyn Games newsletter (right side column) here: http://www.gamelyngames.com/cms/\nAll Add-Ons for this project are included in the reward tiers and/or will be handled AFTER the project within PledgeManager. There are no separate Add-Ons during the project.\nIf you'd like to add additional copies of Tiny Epic Galaxies to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, you may do so within PledgeManager.\nTiny Epic Kingdoms and Tiny Epic Defenders WILL be available to add onto your pledge within PledgeManager. There will be deluxe copies available in limited quantity and on a first come, first serve basis. \nWhy YOU should back Tiny Epic Galaxies on Kickstarter:\nBesides it being an epic good time, without Kickstarter, and more importantly YOU, the game would not be produced.

It is prone to many mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully fulfilling board game projects.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 75% completed.

Gather resources to add buildings with new actions and launch ships to go whaling. Go out longest for the best choice, but wait too long and the whales become harder to catch. And don't forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.\nA bit more detail: Over twelve rounds players take turns placing their two workers. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, constructing buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.\nMost buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.\nYou need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common - an historical reflection of the toll that whaling had on the environment. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the \"lay\") must be paid in order to keep the whales selected.\nCustom wooden ship meeples\nAfter twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money.\nGen Con 2014 - New Bedford Prototype Demo\n Unpub LIVE PLAY of New Bedford\nNew Bedford will offer the same hallmark replay value as other Dice Hate Me Games titles, with high-quality components, thick punchboard bits, and lots and lots of wood. Here's a list of what you'll find inside the box:\n1 punchboard Town board\n4 punchboard player boards\n1 punchboard Whaling board\n8 wooden Worker meeples\n8 wooden Ships (four with two-tone colored sails)\n1 wooden Ships Wheel (Start Player) token\n1 wooden Anchor (Round Marker) token\n4 punchboard sperm whale tokens\n20 punchboard bowhead whale tokens\n36 punchboard right whale tokens\n16 punchboard empty sea tokens\n20 punchboard town Building tiles\n50 punchboard Coins\n25 wooden Wood tokens\n30 wooden Food tokens\n20 wooden Brick cubes\n1 canvas whale token bag\nNew Bedford will come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Rooster\"-sized box - the same size as Compounded and VivaJava Dice. What's this crazy talk? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nNew Bedford is a game for 2-4 players, ages 12 and up, and designed by Nat Levan. New Bedford is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\n If you'd like to know more about the design process behind New Bedford, designer Nat Levan has extensively chronicled the game's development on the Oakleaf Games blog, which you can read right here. Nat also sat down with the Dice Hate Me crew on episode 74 of The State of Games podcast to talk about the game. You can listen to that right over here; the New Bedford portion begins at the 25 minute mark.\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into New Bedford, you can download the print-and-play version of the game right here. You can also check out the rules for the game in the PnP download files.\nThe print-and-play includes all the buildings, whales, the town board, the player boards and the whaling board. You'll need to provide bits to represent the wood, food, brick, meeples, ships, and money (cubes, coins, toy boats - whatever you'd like).\nBy 1848 New Bedford, Massachusetts had become the most powerful city in the whaling industry and, soon, one of the richest cities in the world. Whale oil exported from New Bedford helped to fuel the world and, eventually, usher in the Industrial Revolution; it would eventually be referred to as \"the city that lit the world\".\nin 1841, Herman Melville sailed out from New Bedford working as a whaler on the ship Acushnet. His experiences in whaling eventually lead him to write the novel Moby-Dick. It was published in 1851, and New Bedford is the initial setting for the novel.\nAchieving our base funding goal ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish New Bedford with the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of New Bedford is priced according to our initial funding goal; however, if we exceed that funding goal we will be able to add more to the game, like possibly a card inspansion, improvements to the turn and first player markers, and maybe even a microgame!\nHere are a couple of sneak peeks into what we have planned for stretch goals!\nFirst off, we want to upgrade the wooden ship tokens - or, shipeeples, if you prefer. We\u2019ve priced out a token upgrade that has two parts - the main body of the ship, and the sails which are attached. The ship body is wider than the sails which gives it great stability and a more realistic, constructed look. If we can push this campaign beyond our funding goal, we\u2019d love to upgrade to these!\nNext up - more buildings! These expansion buildings would be included as a Kickstarter promotional outside the box, not immediately available for retail sale after Kickstarter backers receive their copies. This is one of the most exciting things we had planned for stretching out the campaign, so if this excites you all, as well, let\u2019s put some wind in these sails!\nPlease help spread the word of New Bedford to family, friends and anyone else you think would enjoy the game so that we can reach our funding goal and roll out those stretch goals!\n\"The theme is wonderful and absolutely fitting. It\u2019s well integrated and unique... The bottom line... New Bedford is a town worth visiting.\" - John Moller, Cartrunk Entertainment (click to read his full review)\n\u201cBefore I even had the chance to crack open New Bedford, the game caught my attention because someone had mentioned that it was like a more concise and elegant version of Le Havre. While I\u2019ll agree that the two games do share some similarities, saying that New Bedford is essentially Le Havre light does it a great disservice. New Bedford offers its own unique experience that feels fresh and not borrowed.\u201d - Kyle Chivers, Euro Board Game Blog (click to read his full review) \n\"New Bedford does a lot of things right - but the best thing about the game is that it is one of those games that is easy to both learn and teach, but will surprise you with its depth after you dive in for subsequent plays.\" - James Flemming, Board Game Reviews by Josh (click to read his full review) \n\u201cBeyond the theme, I like New Bedford for several game-play reasons.  I am reminded of Puerto Rico from the standpoint that players can score through the staple process of whaling as well as from buying buildings to augment the town of New Bedford.  Likewise, New Bedford includes the worker-placement-building quality of Le Havre with buildings that facilitate collecting materials, constructing buildings, or sending out whaling ships.  I actually find New Bedford cleaner and more elegant than Le Havre.\u201d - Paul Owen, Man Overboard (click to see more comments)\n\u201cSolid worker placement game. The two different elements to the game, building the village and the whaling, complement each other nicely. I got to play this at Grand Con at an Unpub event. Multiple victory paths and some interesting combos can be made with some of the village tiles. Can't wait for this one to come out.\u201d - David Taylor, To the Table\n\u201cWhen I played New Bedford when it was printer paper and glue I fell in love with the concept and game play.  Now that I see the final product the game has been brought to life in a whole new way and still sits in my top five to play as two player with my hubby or with a group of friends!\u201d - Lesley Louder, The Chalkboard Gamer\n\"New Bedford has all the strategizing of a game like Agricola without the stress. It wonderfully meshes worker placement, town building, and tile drawing in such a way that it plays fast without comprising any depth.\u201d  - Scott King, game photographer and blogger\n\"Such a smooth, engaging gaming experience. New Bedford is a great low-cost-of-entry euro that has enough game for game night, but is still completely accessible for my family.\" - Matt Riddle, co-designer of Fleet and person of no consequence\n\"When I played this game at an Unpub over a year ago, I was unsure if I would like a game about whaling.  That was quickly proven wrong, and I told Nat when he was done with New Bedford I wanted a copy of it.\"  - Derrick Vidal, Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\n\u201cFrom the moment I sat down with New Bedford and took my first turn, I knew that I was seeing something special. While I\u2019ve had the privilege of playing several games in the Unpub program, only a few of them make me want to drop money on the spot. New Bedford was exactly that. The cool thing is, I\u2019ve only seen it get even better! Take my money now!\u201d - Greg Miller, Baked Fresh Daily Games\n\"One of those rare occasions where everyone at the table was lost in the world and loving every minute.\" - Josh Mills, game designer\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, Dice Hate Me Games would not be able to bring quality games to market. To show our respect and appreciation, DHMG promises that backer copies of New Bedford will be shipped out before copies are available for purchase at retailers or conventions. DHMG also pledges to keep all backers informed at every step in the development, printing and delivery processes. We love staying in touch with all of our supporters, so please never hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.\nNew Bedford\u2019s design was influenced by a time when whaling was a part of daily life - and that eventually lead to a modern crisis for many species of whales. To make it clear, we don\u2019t condone modern whaling. But we think that the history of New Bedford and the whaling industry is an important subject. Just like our chemistry game, Compounded, we believe that games designed for entertainment can also be educational - and, in this case, foster discussion about a controversial topic. For more information on modern whaling and conservation efforts, please check out the overview from the World Wildlife Fund.\nWe knew that the theme of historic whaling could be considered a bit controversial by some, but we believe in New Bedford and in the theme. As Herman Melville once wrote about his novel, Moby-Dick, \"To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.\" We think New Bedford is a mighty little game, and we are proud to present it to all of you. \nThanks, as always, for the continued support for Dice Hate Me Games from our Kickstarter family. You continue to amaze and humble us.\nLet's keep sailing,\nChris & Nat", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with our overseas manufacturer and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and have worked through - and learned from - any kinks encountered in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. Sometimes even personal life events can blindside you. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dice Hate Me Games\n20 created \u00b7 2 backed\nDice Hate Me Games, LLC is a division of Greater Than Games, LLC, committed to bringing entertaining, innovative, and challenging games to...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "We're Back and Even Better!", "update_content": "Greetings Historical Gamers,\nWe're proud to announce that we've launched a new campaign for New Bedford!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Ship's Log: Postmortem", "update_content": "Greetings historical gamers,\nAs most of you have no doubt noticed by now, the campaign for New Bedford has been cancelled.

It's a new type of gaming experience that combines the tangible and social pleasure of a board game with the interactive and adaptable mechanics of a video game. The game is for 2 to 4 players and features a Large, two part, high quality board that represents the minutely detailed world of Yo-Ho. At the same time, a free downloadable app turns your smartphone into a ship. Simply place your phone on the board and set sail for adventure!\nBecome the most famous pirate of Yo-Ho, a parallel world teeming with intelligent animals, lost islands and wild magic! The call to adventure echoes throughout this land, and although life on the high seas is a dangerous game, for those that truly embrace the pirate spirit the promise of glory is worth any risk. Will you sink...or will you sail?\nClassic: It\u2019s a free-for-all! Be the first player to reach a certain number of Swag points (aka victory points).\nCampaign:  Take part in the first chapter of the World of Yo-Ho saga : War of the Orchids. Each session is tied into a plot that will immerse you in the Yo-Ho universe.\nSingle Phone/Tablet: If you don't have enough devices for all the players, you can also play World of Yo-Ho with only one device, or even a tablet. In this case, cardboard tokens that represent ships and captains are included in the box version. The device is not on the map but is passed from player to player, and each player is responsible for updating his ship's position when he moves.\nCruise: This single player mode allows you to sail the seas of Yo-Ho, learning all about this magical world. It is also a quick way to understand how the devices move around the board.\nPorts are temporary hideouts where you can resupply, regroup and prepare your strategy. Being in a port allows you to:\nBuy weapons and items for use in combat\nPurchase upgrades for your captain and your ship\nAccept a large variety of missions\nRepair your ship\nCheck on how well the other players are doing and if someone is close to victory!\nBehold a selection of some of the fine weaponry you'll be able to unleash upon your ennemies! Are you more of a broadsides or cutlass kind of corsair?\nThat scallywag swagger may impress the girls back home but you're going to need a lot more flair then that if you want to make it to the top. Luckily these upgrade items will help get your captain and his ship looking suitibly fine!\nWord gets around fast in the World of Yo-Ho, especially if parrots are involved. When you depart from a port, it's not hard for other captains to find out what you did there. So if you don\u2019t want your opponents to know what items you bought or what missions you chose that could interfere with theirs, you\u2019d better lighten your Clams chest and leave the port incognito.  \nThere are many different kinds of missions, ranging from simple cargo transportation to searching for sunken treasure in monster infested seas.\nCompleting missions will not only make you rich but also bring you closer to victory. But beware, if you do not respect your contract, you could find yourself with a bounty on your head, something other players won't hesitate to cash in on!\nMissions are randomly generated for every game and evolve depending on each player's actions.\nAnother way to earn Swag points is to fight your opponents, whether you have a reason to or not!\nYou can attack a player if your devices are on adjacent tiles. Touch the attack button on his phone and the swashbuckling can begin!\nWhen combat begins, both players take their phones and secretly program their actions (with items bought whilst at port).\nThe amount of items you can play depends on the flag that you run up the mast. If either of the participants is flying a white flag then your options are limited. If both ships are flying the Jolly Roger however, you're in for one hell of a fight!\nOnce this is done, players put their phone back on the map, and everyone can witness the results as they are animated on screen!\nIn addition to earning Swag points, the winner can pillage items from his opponent. Talk about rubbing salt in the wound!\nWhile sailing the seas of Yo-Ho, weather conditions can change or a monster may rise from the depths. You could find an old wreck filled with sunken treasure or simply a message in a bottle bobbing along the waves\u2026 \n Smartphone technology allows us to bring the World of Yo-Ho to life. This world remembers, it be good deeds or foul play. Missions and Events are not chosen randomly, criteria such as your position on the board, where others are, whether you are ahead in the game or falling behind, whether you play aggressively or passively, all this information is used to make sure every player has his or her fair share of the adventure! The mission system is procedural, and will generate written descriptions based in the game's setting. By changing variables ( destination, time required, objectives, \u2026 ), every mission will be a new and original challenge. \nThere's is no freeloading either! Some missions will be rarer and have more interesting rewards than others, but no matter the mission, rewards will be proportional to the effort required to complete them : a mission sending you to the other corner of the board will be much more rewarding than one sending you two tiles away from where you are. Think you can earn some quick clams easily without being noticed ? Well, rumours spread fast in the World of Yo-Ho, and unless you bribe your way out of the harbour, other players might learn of your plans, race you for the reward, or even earn some clams by preventing you from doing so ! And don\u2019t think you can go back on a deal either! Some would be all too hasty to call on other players to exact some just vengeance for them!\nMany monsters live in the waters of Yo-ho. Some lairs even span across multiple zones, and they will be more then happy to pop up and disrupt your game should you cross their territory. Some will require a collaborative effort, and multiple rounds of combat to defeat. You can choose to ignore them (not always easy when I giant see serpent is bearing down on you), but every hit will be rewarded with well-earned swag points and recorded by the game, provided you don\u2019t ridicule yourself of course! However, only the player that deals the final blow will get to plunder the beast's horde, so some strategy may be required. A slain monster will of course stay dead until the end of the game. \n This memory can span further than just one game too. In campaign mode, each chapter (game) has multiple endings depending on the choices made by you and your fellow players. As you play through each chapter, your story will continue to grow and evolve, always based on the consequences of your actions! Perhaps an ally you made in a previous game gives you the option to sack a port, removing it from future games. However, another ally that has been with you since you first set sail may disagree with your actions and withdraw their support. This is just one example of how this dynamic world can adapt. You are the hero, it's your story to create! Here's a video to show just how vibrant we have made this world, you'll soon understand how the use of devices can bring so much more life to your tabletop games!\nWhether they rose to power through cunning, strength of arms or just blind luck, the life of a pirate is not known to cultivate the most balanced of individuals! But a few faults here and there isn't that big a deal, after all, nobody's perfect right?\nSome would call nailing a man o' war to the back of a giant swordfish madness. In the world of Yo-Ho it's pretty much par for the course. These giants of the sea have linked their fates to that of their chosen captain, for better or for worse!\nSmartphones are now an everyday object, so why not use them whilst playing a boardgame? Having small but powerful computers on a board can add a lot to your gaming experience. \nWe designed World of Yo-Ho based on the following principles: \nThese devices can calculate where they are on the board and communicate with one another.\nHaving a digital screen on top of the map allows you to bring it to life with animations and sound effects.\nSetting up your game is fast and easy. A few clicks and you're ready to go.\nYour phone can tell if it is being held up and display different information or let you input secret orders.\nYou can pause and resume your game anytime thanks to the game's autosave feature.\nJust like in a board game, random events can occur, however, thanks to the digital element, the game evolves and reacts according to the players actions.\nWorld of Yo-Ho Rules PDF (work in progress)\nMoving the phone on the board\nSo, how do the phones know where they are on the board ?\nThe board is composed of tiles, 6x10 exactly. The game first tells you where to put your phone, and then you can move it from tile to tile. It analyzes in which direction you moved it and understands where it currently is.\nAdding life to a static board\nThe screen displays a representation of the board underneath it and adds several elements as well. Your boat bobs along in the sea, waves are generated by the wind whilst birds and clouds fly across the screen. On top of that, UI elements give you the control of this living map.\nYou'll notice that we take into account the physical size of the screen in order to display the map as if you were looking through it.\nPhone Orientation\nDifferent types of information are displayed whether the phone is on the board or being held by someone.\nWhen your phone is on the board, it displays information regarding the tile it\u2019s on. These details are public and may be of interest to other players (to help them complete a mission for example).\nWhen you hold your phone up it shows private information relevant to your captain and ship. Only you can see its screen, so you can secretly consult your ship's hold or your active missions in order to prepare your strategy.\nYou think you know everything about pirates? Ah, the impertinence of youth... Make yourself useful, pour me another and I will tell you a tale of the Nine Seas\u2026\nYo-Ho is not only a world, it\u2019s a dimension folded into a single piece of worn parchment. Is its withered surface paper or human flesh? Nobody knows for sure but this is a minor conundrum compared to the secrets sealed inside this faded map. Legends say that the demon known as Davy Jones crafted it or maybe, that it was somehow\u2026 part of him. Who knows how old it is? It's impossible to retrace its history as it has spent the centuries being passed, stolen or traded from one persons hoard to another.\nThen \"she\" came to Yo-Ho. Her name was Hortense. She was, as she put it, \u201cHuman\u201d. She claimed : \u201cYo-Ho is a magical map, and I am the pirate who found it. I came here to be Queen of the high-seas\u201d. At the time we were only animals. Eating, sleeping, going on with our simple lives. Then Hortense shared her secrets with a parrot, and the parrot, in turn, shared them with us. We started talking, using our paws, paddles, and eating Koko. We took a liking to the pirate life. Hortense created the Sisterhoods and leaders arose. All around us armies were raised and nations were born. We learnt fast. We were restless. We hungered for glory.\nIn Yo-Ho, Pirates are as much a part of their boats, as their boats are part of them. We call this unity Biots. Massive colossus roam these seas, whales, giant jellyfish, and ancient turtles, and we learnt to communicate with them. We pitched our might against each other, brother against sister, in a perpetual fight to win the heart of our unique Goddess, Hortense in her beautiful regalia of flowers, these mysterious orchids she was so fond of. We made this place a heaven for feathered felons and scaly scallywags. It was our world to make and in it we saw only glory, fame and precious clams.\nWe became more than human. Better: we became pirates.\nBut today, as I write these words, Hortense is dead. Nobody knows who killed her. Her lieutenants found her on her island, executed on a golden beach, clutching one last orchid in her delicate hand.\nNow everything is changing. New chieftains are rising from our ranks. Silent forces are working in the shades of twisted palm trees, where mutant birds scream in the canopy. A foul wind is blowing in from the north. Its nefarious aura can be felt by all, from hardy deck hands to sea sick greenhorns. Dark portents manifest throughout the oceans: in the breaking of the waves, in the clouded skies, and among the many perils that lie just off the shore. A tide of darkness is rising in this world.\nDo you hear the roars from under the sea ? Do you see our skies torn apart by strange lights, to the pulse that is the lifeblood of this land ? Something is waking up. Something Hortense was shielding us from. What will we do once it awakens?\nAll backers will receive a free upgrade to their game board with a limited edition Kickstarter design!\n *Le Dernier Bar Avant la Fin du Monde is Paris most popular social spot for geek culture.

Please note: Transport is not included in this pledge.\nCaptain Figureheads - UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach $55k we'll add figureheads for the 4 original captains plus any others unlocked during the campaign. These allow you to easily distinguish each player's device and character whilst on the board as well as adding some more light hearted fun to the game! These are small, Silicone models that attach to your device via a suction cup. They will be included in the boxed version of the game (captain pledge level and upwards).\nShip Figureheads - UNLOCKED!\nNote: Example using a similar product.\nJust like for the captains, if we reach $60k we will add figureheads for the 4 original vessels plus any unlocked during the campaign! They will be included in the boxed version of the game (captain pledge level and upwards).\n$60,000 - New Captain and Ship\n Our first digital stretch goal will unlock a brand new Captain AND Ship for the game, each with their own unique ability. Plus we have so many ideas for them we thought we'd let YOU decide what you'd prefer. After the campaign we will send out a survey and you guys can vote on your favourite idea! This is an upgrade for the App and will therefore be available to all pledge levels. Models and figureheads will of course be produced for these newcomers if the stretch goals are met.\n$65,000 - Boat models   \nThis stretch goal will add plastic models representing the ships in the game as well as a detatchable sail to represent each of the captains. These are a fantastic addition for those of you wanting to play in single device mode. These models will replace the cardboard silhouettes present in the box set (so captain pledge levels and upwards). Here's a quick example of what we have planned. The models will be about 5cm tall and 6cm long. They will be supplied unpainted.\n$70,000 - Captain Models  \nAs with the previous pledge level, this will add plastic models representing the captains to box set (so captain level pledge and upwards).

We didn't want to launch a Kickstarter campaign before we were sure we could build our idea into a working project. The biggest challenge was bringing our vision of a boardgame with digital support to life. How would it play? How could it make a board game better? Would it ultimately enhance the player's gaming experience and immersion? We are now sufficiently advanced on the project to know it works, and it is fun. So though technically we are not starting the game and we have an advanced working prototype, now is the time to try and make it real thanks to Crowdfunding on Kickstarter by appealing to the extraordinary community of this wonderful site.\niOS\niPod Touch 3rd generation or higher\niPhone 3GS or higher\niPad 2 or higher (only in single device mode)\niOS 5.1.1 or higher\nAndroid\nbetween 3.5 inch and 5.0 screen\nAndroid 2.3 or higher\nAccelerometer\nTablet (only in single device mode)\nCommon\nWifi connexion (one of the phones can be a hotspot)\nThe device must pysically fit within a 5.7\" x 3\" zone for optimum performance.\nExamples\nTHE PUBLISHER \nIELLO is an international game and toy publisher and distributor founded in 2004 in Nancy, France.

Check it out - http://geek-craft.com/wordpress/?p=1391 Thanks to the good folks at Geek-Craft for their kind words!\nHere is a video overview/preview we did with Eric Martin from BGG News! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQg1TMEywmc\nHere is a nice podcast from the folks at All Us Geeks - http://www.allusgeeks.com/2014/01/aug-the-game-of-crowd-funding-01-07-2014/  Thanks to some of our backers for helping on this one!\nA cool little interview with Mr. B. about Spurs - http://www.indiecardboard.com/spurs Thanks to Jason for the support.\nThanks to the good folks at the Boardgame Pirate Podcast for having me on the show. Super cool guys and a fun time! http://www.boardgamepirates.com/episodes/Episode16.mp3\nThe Wood Bullets will be a LIMITED RELEASE available only via Kickstarter, and Mr. B. Games (at cons, our website, and pre-order incentives if quantities remain) in 2015, but may be part of a future expansion later if demand warrants. If ever part of a future expansion, the other parts of that expansion will always be made available to our previous backers, so pledge with confidence, and don't take a chance that we might have them later. Those of you who have backed our projects before can tell you that not all of our products are easy to find after Kickstarter, and those were not LIMITED RELEASES like these Wood Bullets will be! Enough Bullets for 6 players!\nThis is a GREAT bundle for folks who are new to Spurs and want to experience the game with Wood Bullets! 25% off of expected MSRP!\nThe KITCHEN SINK bundle for folks who are new to Spurs and want the entire experience plus the Wood Bullets! 27% off of expected MSRP!\nBuy 3 and SAVE! Ideal for game groups or retail stores! Bundle Pricing when you buy 3! That is 29% off of expected MSRP! If you are a retail store, consider pledging the RETAILER level for added savings!\n For this expansion, we really could think of only 1 goal, so here it is...\nStretch Goal Announced - Status: UNLOCKED\nWith your support, we hit 150+ Total Backers, so all 84 Wood Bullets will now be custom Wood Bullet Meeples (or was that mullets?).\nAvailable to all backers GUNSLINGER and above.\nOur friends at Geek-Craft have offered to make custom embroidered Spurs Bags for those serious DIEHARDS out there. You can order as few as 1 or as many as 6. We will post pictures and details once we know more, and may offer this as an add-on after the campaign. You know Ole and I will be ordering them...who's with us?\nWe are looking into the logistics of offering extra Bullets Sets and/or Gambler Expansions for those who only are interested in Bullets. We hope to have some info soon, or possibly post campaign.\nAll Pledge Levels include shipping. Rewards will be sent from the USA except when noted otherwise in the pledge levels.\nWe have tried 2 different companies overseas now, are on our 3rd, and can currently only guarantee a safe, reliable, affordable delivery from the USA to most Worldwide destinations. We are no longer able to offer rewards to Russia, or South America due to postage regulation changes, and lost package claims.\nWe have teamed up this time with the folks at Ship Naked to provide the best, safest, most reliable and proven method we can find for shipping. Our prices include a subsidy off of their already super low prices.\nWe based shipping for The Bullet Expansion off of our previous shipping data/weights and the Shipping Rates at Ship Naked. Ship Naked rounds all weights up so our prices are based off of the next highest tier with a subsidy to each pledge level, to make those prices a little easier on all of you.\nI PROMISE YOU there is no cheaper option out there that I have found who is not subsidizing their shipping or sending full containers overseas. We are simply too small right now to do containers overseas, but hope someday to be able to. I will continue my quest to find a cheaper option, but so far in the past 12 months, Ship Naked is the lowest price I can find, and the best I can do is offer a subsidy to help reduce their costs for all our backers. Lots of companies are using this great service and offering subsidies, so back with confidence that your pledge rewards will arrive safe, fast and VAT free in the EU. Your countries tax fees may still apply.\nFor backers outside the USA who are only backing the Bullets, we will try sending them to you in a first class padded envelope which should ensure little to no VAT on your end, while helping keep costs low. We may end up sending them to the UK first, but we might send them directly from the USA. I want to explore all options to continue to provide low shipping fees.\n5th Street Productions has announced SPURS -- a new Western Series -- is now in development, and their very own project is coming to Kickstarter VERY SOON!!I will post more info here as soon as I know more!!\nSPURS \u2013 A Legendary Saga in the Old West, but with a new twist!

Lanterns: The Harvest Festival is a tile-placement game set in imperial China. Players act as artisans decorating the palace lake with floating lanterns. The artisan who earns the most honor before the festival arrives wins the game.\nOn your turn, you can take these three actions one time each:\nPlace a lake tile, which gives every player (even your opponents!) a lantern card based on the orientation of the tile. (It also could give the active player bonus lantern cards or favor tokens, depending on the placement.)\nSpend favor tokens to trade one lantern card for another.\nDedicate sets of lantern cards to gain the honor you need to win the game.\nFor more details, you can download and read a draft version of the full rulebook. (Translation: French.)\nIf you want to play Lanterns to see if it's a good fit for you, you can use our print-and-play (PnP) files to make a prototype. It requires only 4 sheets of card stock if you have Ticket to Ride, 8 sheets if you do not.\nKen Grazier, Geek Craft\n\"Lanterns is an amazing game. It's simple, fun, and thematic. ...

A big thumbs up from me.\" (link)\nRyan LaFlamme, Cardboard Republic \"Lanterns hits that sweet spot of a short game \u2013 quick to grasp on the first playthrough but with enough depth to make you want to play it again. ... Lanterns is easy to play and even easier to learn. It doesn\u2019t seem at first like you\u2019ll have to make many calculated choices, but as the points go up and the number of available tiles goes down, suddenly those tiles feel a lot heavier.\" (link)\nJ.

This gives them a more impressive, durable feel.\nAt $15,685, we started the artwork for three new platforms. Instead of 11 platform tiles with flowers, the game now includes only 2 flower platforms plus 3 tiles each of the new backer-voted platforms: koi fish platforms, dragon platforms, and panda platforms. (View Update #4 for details.)\nAt $19,685, we upgraded the box in a number of ways. (View Update #4 for details.)\nOriginal box cover sketch\nAt $23,885, we will upgrade the cardboard favor tokens to wooden favor tokens in every copy of the game. (These will have the same imperial seal from the cardboard tokens screen-printed on them.)\nAt $29,885, we included a custom starting-player token in the shape of a Chinese fishing boat.\nFor the ARTISAN pledge level (one copy of the game), we contribute $7 towards shipping costs for all backers. For backers in the United States, China, and Hong Kong, this covers all shipping costs. Backers in other countries must add an additional amount to their pledge.\nFor more than one copy of the game, backers should use the DOUBLE ARTISAN pledge level. Backers in the United States, China, and Hong Kong add +$20/copy to their ARTISAN pledge, while backers everywhere else should add +$25/copy to their ARTISAN pledge.

It could have been the Summertime Blues, something we did wrong in the campaign, or the post Gencon Hangover of games. We are not sure, but one thing we do know is, a Re-Launch is not a failure, but a chance to fine tune the campaign, and make it even better. We have worked very hard to re-vamp the project, and to listen to ideas from previous backers. We are happy you are here (either returning, or first time visitors) and we hope that this time we have a presented a better campaign and will reach the promise land together! We are not ready to give up on this wonderful worker placement game, and hope you are not ready to either. Please consider pledging to help today!\nWe learned a TON from the last campaign, and the new campaign has some changes to help make the game even better! Thanks everyone for believing in this game as much as we do this second time around! We have added some new content, Social Goals, reworked our funding goal, reworked our shipping fees, and added some limited edition cards. We hope you will consider helping us find our way to the promise land the second time around!\nClockwork Kingdom has been in development for quite some time now. In that time we have tirelessly playtested the game to ensure it is mechanically sound, thematically accurate, and most importantly, FUN! We are very excited at this opportunity to take the final steps towards publishing Clockwork Kingdom, but we need your help!\nBrandon brought me the game late last year and it was immediately apparent that he had done a lot of work on it. We both feel it is one of the best worker placement games either of us has ever played. Our plan is to deliver the best possible game we can, but need Kickstarter to help gauge demand, and help offset the large costs associated with making a big box game. We look at running a Kickstarter for Clockwork Kingdom like a blueprint. We know what we want to do, but we need some help and feedback to refine the plan into the final product. If you would like to help be a part of Clockwork Kingdom, we would love to have you, and love to hear your comments and ideas during the campaign. Please note that some things may differ slightly in the final production copies, but this will always be for the good of the game. You always get a great deal backing our games early!\nWho knows what we might be able to do together with Clockwork Kingdom?\nPlease stay tuned to our updates for info about Clockwork Kingdom post Kickstarter.\nHere is a link to the current rules for Clockwork Kingdom. We are always open to comments, and suggested edits/typo corrections in the process, so if you see something, let us know via the comments section. PLEASE NOTE: We have recently worked out rules for 2 that are not in these current rules. We are finalizing them, and will likely update them after the campaign is finished. Rules do not change for adding a 5th player. You asked, we listened, and now Clockwork Kingdom will be possible to play with 2-5 players!\nWe also have some cool previews lined up. First is by Nick at Boardgame Brawl. We really love this video, and hope you will too! Thanks for mentioning us on Boardgame Breakfast too, we appreciate it!\nWe are lucky enough to have our good friends at Geek-Craft around who have done a fantastic little overview video on how to play the game. Check it out!\nHere is a cool little bit we were on from the Dice Tower for the Summer Preview. Clockwork Kingdom Starts at 1:45 if you want to skip ahead.

It is just under 10min but very helpful!\n It took me a few days to figure out how to shoot this but all in all, I think it came out pretty good. If you listen closely, you can hear the part where I edited out the fighter jets flying over my house! Still not sure how to take all that out or reset the time/date feature on my camera either... lol...someday...\nBelow are our Pledge Level Offerings. Please consider pledging today, so we can make Clockwork Kingdom a reality for tomorrow!\nBelow are our refined ideas to make Clockwork Kingdom better.\nPlease Note: all unlocked Goals may differ slightly in the final production.

It helps us spread awareness for the game, and gets us all another card! While your there, consider thumbing the Limited Edition 4 pack image as well!\nAll Pledge Levels include shipping. Rewards will be sent from the USA except when noted otherwise in the pledge levels.\nWe have tried 2 different companies overseas now, are on our 3rd, and can currently only guarantee a safe, reliable, affordable delivery from the USA to most Worldwide destinations. We are no longer able to offer rewards to Russia, or South America due to postage regulation changes, and lost package claims.\nWe have teamed up this time with the folks at Ship Naked to provide the best, safest, most reliable and proven method we can find for shipping. Our prices include a subsidy off of their already super low prices.\nWe based shipping for Clockwork Kingdom off of our previous shipping data/weights and the Shipping Rates at Ship Naked. Ship Naked rounds all weights up so our prices are based off of the next highest tier with a subsidy to each pledge level, to make those prices a little easier on all of you.\nI PROMISE YOU there is no cheaper option out there that I have found who is not subsidizing their shipping or sending full containers overseas. We are simply too small right now to do containers overseas, but hope someday to be able to. I will continue my quest to find a cheaper option, but so far in the past 12 months, Ship Naked is the lowest price I can find, and the best I can do is offer a subsidy to help reduce their costs for all our backers. Lots of companies are using this great service and offering subsidies, so back with confidence that your pledge rewards will arrive safe, fast and VAT free in the EU. Your countries tax fees may still apply.\nIf you have made it down this far, GREAT, I hope we may have convinced you to help us.

You must carefully manage the crew you already have and outbid your opposing captains to acquire the sailors you need.  You will also need to seize opportunities to play action cards where they will secure the greatest advantage at the auction block and outwit your fellow captains.  Be the first to replenish your crew and put back out to sea with a shout of 'ALL HANDS ON DECK!'.\n International Talk Like a Pirate Day video - We couldn't very well launch the campaign on 'International Talk Like a Pirate Day' and not talk like a pirate somewhere could we?  In celebration of this great annual event, here is a short video explaining the theme of the game in one of the worst pirate voices you will ever hear.

What are all of these other components?\"\nAll Hands on Deck! is composed of 108 cards.  There are two different types of cards: Pirate Crew cards and Action cards.\nA Deckful of Pirate Booty\nPirate Crew Cards - These cards represent the remnants of three derelict crews (suits) that have limped back to port in ships too damaged to return to sea. There is the crew of the Stormsail, the crew of the Sea Sabre, and the crew of the Black Viper.\n\nWithin each crew, there are ten pirate ranks (numbers 1 - 10) representing the different jobs the sailors specialize in on a seafaring crew. These cards' numeric values represents the number of gold doubloons needed to buy potential crew members' loyalty and make them a part of the ship\u2019s company.\n\nThere are also three of each pirate rank represented in each of the three crews. For example, there are three \u2018First Mate\u2019 rank cards from the crew of the \u2018Stormsail\u2019 in the deck.\nThe First Mate of the Stormsail Crew\nThe Quartermaster of the Sea Sabre\nThe Boatswain of the Black Viper\nThe Navigator of the Sea Sabre\n Action Cards \u2014 These are special cards that allow your Captain to influence the auction process. These cards are aimed at creating an advantage or causing problems for the other Captains. All Action Cards are played as bid cards. There are 18 total Action cards in the deck.\nThe Deadly 'Mermaid'\nThe 'Pirate King' Action Card\nCaptain Josh says, \"You'll not be telling me how to sail me own ship, but if ye want to grab a bucket and a mop and get to work, I may listen to yer tales.\"\nThe goal of the game is to build a winning hand containing a suitable crew of pirates for your ship.  A winning hand can be formed in one of two ways: a captain can have a run of seven ranks in one crew, or a run of three ranks in all three of the crews.\nThe game begins with a first dealer being chosen who then deals out five cards to every player.  Each turn thereafter, the dealer gives each pirate captain one new card at the beginning of each turn. The next card in the deck is then turned over and revealed.  This card is now up for auction and each of the captains places as many of their own cards as desired face down in a blind bid for the card being auctioned.\n\nAfter all of the captains have placed a bid or passed, all cards that have been bid are revealed. If there are any action cards in the bid, they are each resolved individually according to the description on the card itself.  These are resolved in turn order starting at the dealer's left until they have all been resolved and removed from the table.  \nAfter resolving the action cards, the value of each captains bid is added up.  This is the total value of all pirate crew cards that are laid down as part of their bid (action cards are worth zero to the bid value).  The captain with the highest score  is awarded the card up for auction. The deal is then passed to the next captain on the left and a new turn begins.\nPlay continues until a pirate captain forms a winning hand and shouts \"All hands on deck!\"  \nCaptain Josh says, \"Rules ain't for pirates!\"\nCare to have a look at the fine print before you back? Here is a link to a printer-friendly black and white version of the game's rulebook.\n\nPrinter Friendly Rulebook -\n http://www.salamandergames.com/images/rulebook/ahod_rulebook_light.pdf\nBlack and White Printer Friendly PnP File -\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/4dq7q7zm1e1vg56/AllHandsOnDeck_BW_PnP.pdf?dl=0\nIf you would like to give the game a try before pledging, the links above will get you the rules and the cards.  Print them up, sleeve them, put on an eyepatch and you are ready!\n\nThe \"print and play\" offered as a pledge reward is the full-color version of both the rulebook and the cards - everything you need to play!  Well okay, you will need a fair amount of printer ink, some paper, and a small crew of pirates to play with also. \nCaptain Josh says, \"Me ship be full of booty, and here be how I will be bringin' it to port.\"\nWe want to make it as easy as possible for people all over the world to get a chance to play All Hands on Deck!  To that end, we have partnered with a fulfillment solution that will allow us to ship from within the European Union, meaning that there will not be any additional VAT taxes for anyone ordering from the EU.\nSo, shipping for the basic game pledge level breaks down as follows:\nShipping to the US - INCLUDED WITH YOUR PLEDGE!\nShipping to the rest of the world - ONLY $11 EXTRA WITH YOUR PLEDGE!\nINTERESTED RETAILERS:  Rather than set a predetermined number of games as a pledge level, we decided to handle any interested retailers individually.  Drop us a message and we'll work up a package that suits your needs!\nCaptain Josh says, \"There be bits of treasure in the most unlikely of places.\"\n$20 - Additional Game - You will receive another copy of 'All Hands on Deck'. Just in case you can't get enough, or you have a friend you think might enjoy it as well.\n$6 - Custom Salamander Dice - You will receive five of our custom six-sided dice with our favorite amphibian emblazoned upon it!  Created by Chessex, these dice look and feel amazing!  Currently, the design is available in red/gold and purple/white.\n$15 - Summonaria - You will receive a copy of our first game, Summonaria. Summonaria is a game of tactical fantasy combat and resource management that pits players and their magical armies against each other as they try to seize control of five island strongholds.  This will ship separately to you as soon as the campaign closes.  More information about Summonaria can be found at http://www.salamandergames.com/index.php/products/summonaria\nOutside the US, please add an additional $15 for shipping.\nHere are just a couple of stretch goals we have lined up for the project.  We will finalize the levels for each as the campaign gets underway; this is simply meant to give you a peak at what we have in mind.\nUNLOCKED!!  400 LIKES = Upgrade the Deck - The quality of the cardstock will be improved to the more professional quality higher gsm cardstock to give a better overall feel to the game.  The cards will have a better snap and that helps in making shuffling and fanning easier!\n100% CAMPAIGN FUNDING = Dealer Doubloon - A custom metal dealer token will be created for you to move around the table to mark the current dealer. A mold has already been created by the fantastic craftsmen at Campaign Coins based upon an original pirate gold design illustrated by Darren Calvert.  \nThis piece of pirate treasure won't curse you to an existence as the undead, but it will ensure you know whose deal it is at all times!  While not absolutely required for the game, we did have several people ask about a dealer marker since the deal moves around the table.  We reached into the ol' treasure chest and pulled this forth!\nWe are just a couple of gamer geeks from Oklahoma City. We both stay pretty busy with work, family, and trying to raise some young pirates of our own. In our free time, we make time for gaming, be it playing something with the kiddos, getting together with the gaming group, or sitting around creating something new. We truly believe that this hobby is unlike any other and want to contribute something meaningful to it in our own way.

For further updates on digital Boss Monster, visit BrotherwiseGames.com or follow us on Facebook.\nBoss Monster is a dungeon-building card game that challenges players to become the ultimate villains: video game bosses. Thousands of players around the world have enjoyed the paper version of the game, but now Brotherwise Games is partnering with video game developer Plain Concepts, creators of Wave Engine, to bring Boss Monster from the tabletop to the digital world!\nA little under two years ago, we started Brotherwise Games with the launch of Boss Monster on Kickstarter. That successful campaign ignited a spark and Boss Monster has gone on to continued success in game and hobby stores across North America.\nOne thing we have heard over and over from fans of the game is, \"give us a video game version of Boss Monster!\" Maybe you'd like to play the game solo against a computer AI, or maybe you'd like to be able to find opponents at anytime online? Whatever your reason, if you're a Boss Monster fan, old or new, we hope you'll help make this version of the game a reality.\nWhat is Boss Monster?\nIf you've ever wanted to stomp on an upstart plumber or send your goblins and ghosts out to haunt some heroes, then Boss Monster is the game for you. Sporting beautiful retro-inspired pixel art, and paying homage to classic video games and geeky pop culture, Boss Monster immerses you in the role of the video game boss as you use Room Cards to build a dungeon which must entice worthy heroes, then slay them. \nIf you've never played Boss Monster, a good place to start is by watching this video from the magnificent team at Watch it Played!\nIf you're looking for a quicker overview of the game, check out Boss Monster in 60 Seconds.\nWhat Will the Digital Version Be Like?\nThis successful campaign allows us to build a digital version of Boss Monster for PC, Kindle, iPad & Android tablets. Digital Boss Monster will mimic all the gameplay available in the tabletop version while also taking advantage of the digital format to enhance your play experience.\nWhat are some of the features you'll see?\nPlay against up to three AI opponents in solo play.\nChallenge other human opponents via pass and play or online through Steam, Apple Game Center or Google Play.\nExplore new \"digitally-enhanced\" cards: four rooms, three new Bosses, and a new spell that all take advantage of the digital platform, allowing stats and treasure values to change as you play.\nTop-notch music and retro-inspired sound effects by Power Up Audio.\n  Play with ALL of the bosses, rooms, and spells available in the base game, and let the app do the math for you as you take advantage of rapid readout treasure counts in your and your opponents' dungeons.\nHere's a closer look at the current interface for the app. This is just a prototype, but already does a great job of showing how the final game will play.\nStretch Goals!\nOur campaign is now fully funded, and we've achieved all our stretch goals for this campaign!\nACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED! All backers will receive a downloadable pack of DRM-free digital goodies including wallpapers, an MP3 soundtrack, a 50-page PDF Strategy Guide, and a Print-and-Play Card Creation Kit with PDF and Photoshop card templates!

This is a great last-minute bonus thanks to our dedicated backers!\nChoose Your Pledge Level\nIf you're ready for tactical dungeon-building fun at your fingertips, get ready to choose your pledge level!\nWith a successful campaign, you'll get your KEY TO THE DUNGEON. Receive one PC, iPad, Kindle Fire or Android tablet app key for the base version of Digital Boss Monster for less than your friends will have to pay after the app launches.

(Each device you add requires an additional app key. See \"Add-Ons\" below for details.)\nEver hear of those Kickstarter Boss Monster Promo cards that are now impossible to get? Well, upgrade to the PLAYER'S CHOICE and you'll get an 11-card digital mini-expansion that includes seven Boss cards, three challenging Epic Heroes, and a game-changing Spell.

The Player's Choice level will also get you access to exclusive downloads during the campaign, including print-and-play preview cards from Boss Monster 2!\nFor less than ten dollars you'll get everything from the Player's Choice pledge level AND early access to the POWER-UP PACK, a second digital mini-expansion of 12 cards.

In addition to your app rewards, you will be shipped a physical pack of 14 cards: two copies of four Room cards, three Boss cards, one Epic Hero, and one Spell.

Shipping is free in the U.S. *Note that Canadian backers should use \"The Canadian Version\" to avoid shipping charges.\nWhat, you've never played Boss Monster? Don't worry, PRESS START TO PLAY and we'll give you everything from the Paper and Pixels pledge level PLUS a copy of the original tabletop version of the game at a considerable cost savings to buying the game elsewhere.

You will receive TWO copies of everything included in the Paper & Pixels pledge level, allowing you to share the digital Boss Monster experience with a friend.

Due to Apple restrictions, the iPad version of this level is limited to 90 backers.\nAll Gone! For years a quiet group of mysterious heroes has labored in the shadows of Arcadia's dungeons. They've taken the quests others wouldn't take, slain the most terrifying monsters, braved the most gruesome traps.

As one of these candidates for the throne, you will use your power and cunning to lay your claim. With your army of loyal steam-powered automatons to do your bidding, you will compete for resources, power, and influence. However, you will have more at your disposal than simple automatons. Throughout the course of the contest, you will also recruit Alchemists, Professors, and Artificers to your cadre of loyal vassals, each with their own unique abilities.\nChoose wisely when deciding where to send your servants, whether to get supplies from the market, build useful contraptions in the workshop, or even attempt to acquire powerful alchemy stones, all the while you will be warring with your rivals in a number of battlefields in an attempt to control the kingdom by force. To claim the clockwork throne, you must make difficult decisions to outwit your opponents in an attempt to gather resources, obtain workers, manufacture contraptions, and dominate battlefields.

We are very excited at this opportunity to take the final steps towards publishing Clockwork Kingdom, but we need your help!\nBrandon brought me the game late last year and it was immediately apparent that he had done a lot of work on it. We both feel it is one of the best worker placement games either of us has ever played. Our plan is to deliver the best possible game we can, but need Kickstarter to help gauge demand, and help offset the large costs associated with making a big box game. We look at running a Kickstarter for Clockwork Kingdom like a blueprint. We know what we want to do, but we need some help and feedback to refine the plan into the final product. If you would like to help be a part of Clockwork Kingdom, we would love to have you, and love to hear your comments and ideas during the campaign.

Sadly, the Great Alien Council never considered this possibility. Looks like you are going to have to use your wits and every means at your disposal to escape. \u201cGet me off this planet!\u201d can be heard echoing in the core. \nLift Off! Get me off this Planet has a casual space theme and never takes itself too seriously. My goal was to make an easy to learn, fast-paced game, where everyone feels engaged and \"in it\" until someone has won or the planet explodes! \nThe objective of Lift Off! Get me off this Planet is to be the first player to get their Aliens off the planet using resource cards, action cards\u201a and phases of the moon to escape. If the planet explodes before everyone escapes\u201a the player with the most saved Aliens wins.\nWhat\u2019s special about Lift Off! Get me off this Planet is that Lift Off Point board pieces (such as the Rocket Ship, Satellite, U.F.O etc) are all different and often require multiple players to work together to take off. For example, the Rocket Ship takes a lot of resources (6 Fuel and 6 Screws) and can carry 6 aliens from various players. This creates a great dynamic of semi-co-operative play that can turn real competitive, real fast; initially all players work together to get the first half of their aliens off the planet. Once the population starts thinning, people become more competitive and tricky, using action cards to manipulate the moon, terraform the board, create tornadoes, and more.\nSince the game board is modular, each Lift Off Point board piece creates a different configuration and scenario in the game.  Every session is a new experience with new play dynamics!\nLift Off! Get me off this Planet is a fresh, lightweight take on unit placement and resource management. The cooperative-to-competitive dynamic and imminent doom creates strong tension and drama at the end of the game.\n*Box will also contain an insert to hold the game pieces. **Game contains 5 Turn Cards.\nPlease see Rule Book (downloadable below) for more details, but here are some details on Play actions on your turn\nPLAY: A player starts their turn by drawing two cards and can do any of the following actions in any order:\n> Move (2x): The player can take two movement actions - moving a more desperate alien twice or two panic stricken aliens once. As one movement, the aliens can flee through an exit point at the core to the not-so-stable surface. Then rushing across each segment of the surface (Lift Off and Exit Points) takes one movement point.\n\n> Play Action Cards: The player can play any number of action cards in any order (whether they have a plan or not).\n\n> Pay Placement / Lift Off Costs: If a Lift Off Point is blissfully not full, the player may pay the Lift Off Placement cost in order to place their Alien on the black-and-yellow striped launch platform getting one step closer to safety! The player may also pay a Lift Off action cost at any time.\n\n> Trade 2 Cards for 1: The player may bravely discard two cards of their choice from their hand to draw 1 additional card. This can be done as many times as desired as long as their nerves hold out!\n\nTo end their turn, players move the Moon counter-clockwise one spot on the Moon track around the surface of the moon, as the final, inevitable doom draws closer...\n TheOneTar - Tiffany Preview & Reviews\nUndead Viking Videos\n Weaponsgrade Videos\nThe Dice Tower / Gamer's Remorse Video\nGeekDad.com (Full Review Here)\n\"Lift Off! Get me off this Planet is a sharp-looking game, and has a lot of fun elements to it. Some of the mechanics seem pretty familiar, like moving around, playing action cards, and spending resources. But the phases of the moon is a new one\u2014it can be a little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's very cool.\nWhile Lift Off! Get me off this Planet is not as deeply strategic as some games, there are still some really fascinating dynamics to it, and I think it will be a good one for both kids and adults.

Get me off this Planet is extremely well tested (over the last 2 years) and balanced. The art and graphic design is complete pending a few cleanup tasks in preparation for print and depending on how successful the Kickstarter is a few extra components. We have been working closely with Panda GM - who is known for their high quality manufacturing. Also, in order to deliver on time, I've made sure to buffer the schedule sufficiently to manage hiccups, if any occur.\n\nThere are inherent risks whenever undertaking a project as complex and large as producing and distributing a board game, but I have been making complex projects with countless moving parts and large budgets most of my career (video games). Admittedly, this is my first board game and Kickstarter. That's why I've gone out of my way to surround myself with experienced board game developers, distributers, and people who have run and launched successful Kickstarters. This team of friends has been exceedingly helpful and I'm sure will help as we hit any upcoming bumps in the road.\n\nMost importantly, if something does go wrong, I will keep everyone in the loop as the project moves forward and comes to market.

In those times, it was not the warheads and the tanks that would have made the difference - it was the intel - about where those warheads and tanks were, and what they could do.\nG.I. Joe was right - knowing is half the battle. And knowing before your opponent knows... well, this is what [redacted] is all about.\nIn the 45-60 minutes of [redacted], each player must take actions, use items, and interact with other players while in the hunt for intel. Each agent has one or more partners, and must find them - while outwitting the enemy agents.\nOn a player's turn, an agent may move from room to room of an embassy, while a gala reception is taking place, looking for the intel that the ambassador is trying to sell. Once found, it must be extracted safely. Failing that, an agent must stop the enemy from doing the same.\nFor security reasons, the true loyalty of each player is hidden, even from their teammate. Players will have to obtain information the hard way, interrogating or hacking each other, in addition to using items and their surroundings to gain the upper hand.\nInspired in its mechanisms by such great games as Battlestar Galactica, Bang, Saboteur and A Study in Emerald, and in its theme by TV shows and movies like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Mission: Impossible, the Bond films, Archer and more, [redacted] is for those who like mystery - and action - in their games.\nTo find out more, download the rules, watch the videos, read the reviews below, and join us for a live Vassal playthrough!\nFor more detail on the components and mechanisms of [redacted], download the rulebook here (2.5 MB, right click and Save as...).\nPlease download this file, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not display properly.

Any extra players may observe, or join another time. Here's a screencast of a recent game, which should also help you see how the game plays:\nWith [redacted], our campaign goal is to determine the size of the print run - this is why the goal is so low, we have already paid a lot of money for the art.\nWe will be selling the game for \u20ac40 / $55 at Essen & from our website, and shipping costs are between \u20ac10 / $15 (EU) and \u20ac15 / $20 (US & worldwide). The total post-campaign cost could be as high as $75.\nNote that the rewards list on the right may not display properly for Chrome users - it is optimized for viewing with Firefox.\nCustom-illustrated material ($125-$195 levels) is *not* part of the game - it is provided separately, outside of the box, to those backers that backed for them.\nQ: All pledge levels are sold out - what gives?\nA: In the attempt to deliver on what our backers expect of us, we have limited the amount of pledge rewards to 1000 copies of the game. For more information, please check out Backer Update #2 and Backer Update #4, as well as the comments posted there. To know about future campaigns, please sign up for our newsletter at http://ludicreations.com/newsletter.\n[redacted]: Mercenaries is the first expansion to the game. We are planning to produce it at the same time as the base game, and we would love to know exactly how many to make.\nThis expansion adds a whole another layer to [redacted], making it much more of a gamer's game, and increasing play time by about 25-50%. It contains 40 new cards, including some new items. It will be later sold for \u20ac10 / $14.\nIn Mercenaries, agents do not have any loyalty other than to themselves. They each tasked to achieve several missions by their employers, and compete with each other to be the most successful mercenary.\nFor each mission, players have a partner, although not usually the same one for every mission - which leads to temporary and shifting alliances of convenience in the race to win the most money.\nAs previously indicated, [redacted]: Mercenaries will now be given to all backers, for free. Please read the relevant backer update for more details, to see some representative art, and to download the rules.\nIf you intend to attend Spiel 2014 in Essen, you may via the backer survey, choose to pick your game up at the fair, along with 5 EUR in cash.\nBacker rewards will be shipped from Germany. Our primary shipping provider is Deutsche Post/DHL. EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nAs some our our past USA backers know, we've had trouble finding a reliable partner for local fulfillment, and we are still considering our options. If we do find a company that can provide that, we will hire them.\nShipments to worldwide backers will have 35 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 51.32 CAD / 50.46 AUD / 42.37 CHF / 4821 JPY, and should be under the threshold that triggers customs duties in most countries.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - this is our doctrine, and we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that offering add-ons and/or introducing stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We intend to print with the highest quality materials anyway and we will not cut any corners.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels, that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals to get excited about. Therefore, raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nFurthermore, because the games are made in Europe, and because we do small print runs, we do not benefit by economies of scale by producing more copies of the game.\nIf we do offer additional content, we will lock past pledge levels. That's it - you do not need to pay more, or like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter or be a fan on BGG - although all of those things are nice of you if you do them, we want you to do them if you want to, not because of a carrot we dangle in front of you.\nWe do not do add-ons (not even our other games), because we want to keep our operations simple, and deliver efficiently. We are in this for the long run, so it does not help us to squeeze a few more dollars from a few backers, if we disappoint *all* backers.\nGame design:  Mih\u00e1ly Vincze, D\u00e1vid Turczi, Katalin Nimmerfroh\nIllustration: Katalin Nimmerfroh, Mihajlo Dimitrievski\nGraphic design: Todd Sanders\nVassal module: Mindy Getch\nKS Video: David & Karl & LudiCreations\nZone: Danger\nNutella: Necessary", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll previous campaigns except Town Center 4th edition, Town Center: London / Hong Kong and ESSEN have been fulfilled.

Since 2000, I've refined my craft of designing highly approachable strategy games. Some of my board game designs include Long Shot (Z-Man Games) and Cinque Terre (Rio Grande Games). In 2007, I launched GatePlay.com, a board game retail site focused on 'Gateway Games' and new gamers.\nOver the last year, I've developed a series of easily portable card-based strategy games in a gum-sized tuck box with a variety of mechanics, complexity, and theme. Each game has been carefully play-tested and revised to create the best possible gaming experience, with the least amount of size, money, and effort. The results have truly surprised me, as I've spent countless hours watching people enjoy these games, and they're not even published yet!  \nSpeaking as a gamer, I've seen these games impact my own gaming habits and playing opportunities in a way that no other game has.

Thank You!\nSee Update #12 for more info!\nUnlocked: Everyone who pledged $19+ gets a FREE Print and Play of \"Santa's Summer Break\", the kids game by Jason Kotarski that inspired Fidelitas.\nSee update #10 for more info!\nUnlocked: The $32K funding level every backer who pledged at the $19+ levels will get 2 new promos!\n This time, we're adding a couple Missio cards, new goals to add some variety by transforming the Tavern locations into opportunities for scoring! The Barkeep isn't a part of a Guild so there is no Virtus Card for this character. But crafty folks in the city can gain his trust by keeping his bar stool filled with thirsty patrons. And you can hold sway over the Tavern by making sure it's standing room only!\nLike the other promos, these cards will initially only be made available through this Kickstarter until a future time when they may become available at conventions or through other outlets. But before all that, they are for you first! Let's make the last few days count! Please keep sharing the project far and wide!\nSee update #8 for more info!\nUnlocked: The Party Pack Promos will now include 5 cards with two new versions of The Chiseler and The Herald with art by Jaqcui Davis! And the photo cards will still be included, too!\nThe Bloody Butcher removes 3 cards to the discard pile and will probably give you nightmares! The Chiseler looks vaguely familiar and will chisel away at other player's hands. And The Heralds? They must be some sort of messengers, gathering lots of folks at the Tavern to share the latest news and get new information flowing. The one on the right sure is handsome!\nLike the Candlestick Maker Promos, these promo cards will not be included in the retail version and will initially will only be made available to Kickstarter backers. To be clear, this is not a Kickstarter Exclusive as these cards may be made available in the future at conventions or through other channels but not for a while.\nSee Update #6 for more info!\nUnlocked! All backers at the $19+ tiers will receive the Candlestick Maker Promo Cards; a new Virtus Card and a new Missio Card! \nThese promo cards will not be included in the retail version and will initially will only be made available to Kickstarter backers. To be clear, this is not a Kickstarter Exclusive as these cards may be made available in the future at conventions or through other channels but not for a while.\nSee update #5 for more info!\nUnlocked- Every copy of the production version of the game will come with a Wooden Start Player marker. \nWhile we don't have the final art yet, it will look a little something like that grey shield pictured above. This marker will be given to the first player so that when ever the game end is triggered all others players are given one more turn to prove their worthiness in the cause against the corrupt crown!\nUnlocked- We have great playtesters and backers and we heard your request loud and clear! Some of the Virtus Cards refer to the \"Castle\" and \"Harbor\" locations which are indicated on the locations cards by small signs pointing to the space next to the play area. For some people these signs were difficult to see and keep track of so we've decided to add two new cards to Fidelitas that can be placed to help these locations to be more clear. While players won't actually play to these locations but rather at locations next to these cards, we thought it would be helpful to make them stand out a bit more than they do in the current format. See the variant possible with these new cards herehttp://www.phantasiogames.net/2014/08/fidelitas-stretch-goal-2.html. This goal is unlocked and every copy of the game will include these cards right in the box!\n\nUnlocked- Meet the Brute, the Commander, the Scribe, and the Monk! Manu Forti is Latin for \"with a strong hand\" and these cards add new actions, new missions, new members of the least represented Guilds, and new ways to score. These new Virtus Cards can be played as an action or scored by gathering specific types of cards into your hand! These advanced cards provide an added layer that sows confusion and mistrust while providing another route to gain points that pave the way to victory as the leader of the revolution! This goal is unlocked and every copy of the game will include this expansion right in the box!\nIn Fidelitas, players take on the role of faithful citizens in a medieval city exerting influence in order to gain the credibility needed to lead the charge against the corrupt crown. Players play character cards to various locations that make up the city in order to meet conditions of hidden objectives. Each type of character card is associated with a unique action that manipulates cards in the game; use the Butcher to bully other characters to new locations, use the Student to gain more cards, use the Soldier to keep the peasants from loitering too long.\nIn this game where keen maneuvering is key, attentiveness to the opposition may uncover hidden motives that seek to foil your bid for power. The first player to gain a certain number points depending on the number of players is determined worthy to lead the revolt, and also wins the game.\nFidelitas is a game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up and plays in 20-30 minutes. The game is designed by Jason Kotarski (The Great Heartland Hauling Co.) and Philip duBarry (Revolution!, Courtier, Canalis, Kingdom of Solomon).\nWatch Rahdo's Gameplay Runthrough here:\nWelcome to Fidelitas! In a city you\u2019ve never heard of that\u2019s far too difficult to locate on a map, during a time long before you or anyone you know were born, a cohort of faithful citizens gathered to put plans in motion to take the power back from the political elite whose so-called \u201cleadership\u201d led to nothing more than inequity and discontent among the people. But instead of formulating a plan for revolution, they drank too much ale and forgot what they were gathering for in the first place.\nBut thanks to their digression, now it\u2019s your turn to pick up where they left off\u2026before the over-indulgence, of course!\nPhoto by Scott King (ScottKing.info)\nFidelitas is a card game with a small footprint that packs a big punch!\nFidelitas will include:\n50 Virtus Cards (characters)\n20 Missio Cards (hidden goals)\n5 Location Cards \nFull-color rulesheet with illustrations and examples\nAll this will fit in a small, rigid two-part box for maximum portability!

They thought it would be cool to work on a game together. Neither of these stand-up-fellas had ever designed a game in collaboration with another designer before. And even though it can be difficult to give up some control in order work with another human being, it seemed like a good idea at the time. They probably learned something in the process. It may have even been kinda fun. Fidelitas is the result of more than a year of emailing, developing, and playtesting. They'd love it if you'd pledge your support for the fruit of their labors.\nJaqui Davis is an illustrator from the U.K. who's done beautiful work in the tabletop game space that includes contributions to: Belle of the Ball, Euphoria, Epic Resort, and Skyway Robbery.\nDarrell Louder is a graphic designer living in Delaware.

This Kickstarter campaign has been created to bring that expansion to your lab table, as well as allow us to bring the second edition of the base game of Compounded to all those who have yet to experience the joy of science!\nThe Geiger Expansion gives experienced scientists even more to consider in the lab with the introduction of radioactive elements and compounds. Scientists will have to keep a close eye on the Geiger counter, because as productivity in the lab increases, so does the chance for radioactivity levels to soar dangerously high.\nThe Geiger Expansion introduces a new, interactive paradigm to the base game of Compounded, as players will now sometimes have to work together to eliminate or reduce the threat of radioactivity. Of course, those players with a propensity for causing chaos will have even more methods at their disposal, ensuring that each game will be exciting and dynamic.\nThe Geiger Expansion will be chock full of new things to add to the level of fun - and danger - in your lab.\nFirst off, there are three new elements that will affect the game in different ways. \nRadium is a rare element that is pulled from the elements bag like the six base elements. It can be stored on a scientist's work bench and used to complete radioactive compounds, or processed into Lead that is used in completing other valuable compounds. Finally, Polonium is an extremely radioactive element that, when pulled from the element bag, increases the radioactivity levels in the lab. More Polonium is added to the bag as scientists make progress in completing elements moving along the score track. \nNext, the Geiger counter is used to track the lab's radioactivity levels. As the levels progress, elements are tainted by the radioactivity every round and a few are removed from the elements bag. When radioactivity reaches a certain level, lab fires break out \u2013 and if radioactivity levels grow too high, it is too dangerous for scientists to work and the lab is shut down. Scientists may work together during the game to help manage the radioactivity levels, or create a bit of mayhem by selectively completing compounds that raise the radioactivity.\nThe Geiger Expansion also includes new compounds that may grant scientists additional tools - like Calcium Hydride and Ethenone - or require Radium and Lead to complete - like Radium Nitride or Lead Sulfide. Stay tuned for project updates that will show off new cards with new Chemical Reactions and new abilities!\nFinally, scientists will receive a work bench extension with room to store the new tools they may acquire during the game. Scientists can track the decay chain of any Radium that they are decaying into Lead. At one point in the process Helium is released, which scientists may use as a Wild Element during the game. \nWhat's included:\n- 47 new Compound Cards\n- Thick punchboard Geiger counter\n- 12 Helium tokens\n- 8 Radiation tokens\n- 2 new Lab Tools (total of 8 new punchboard tokens)\n- 25 Elements (12 Radium, 8 Lead, 5 Polonium)\n- 5 Work Bench extensions\nAnd, yes, everything inside the Geiger Expansion will fit inside the main Compounded box!\nIn case you're not familiar with the original base game of Compounded, it was successfully funded on Kickstarter in February of 2013. Because of the help of wonderful Kickstarter backers, we at Dice Hate Me Games were able to produce 5,000 units. Compounded was released for retail sale in November of 2013, and sold out in April of 2014 (except for a few personal copies which are available in the ALL THE THINGS RIGHT NOW pledge level). With your help and support of this Kickstarter campaign, we can afford to print a second edition of the game, ensuring that even more gamers will be able to bring Compounded to their lab table.\nCompounded is a game about building chemical compounds through careful management of elements, a fair bit of social play and trading, and just a bit of luck. In Compounded, players take on the roles of lab managers, hastily competing to complete the most compounds before they are completed by others \u2013 or destroyed in an explosion. Some compounds are flammable and will grow more and more volatile over time; take too long to gather the necessary elements for those compounds and a lot of hard work will soon be scattered across the lab.\nAlthough Compounded does involve a fair share of press-your-luck tension and certainly some strategic planning, the most successful scientists will often be those who strike a good trade with their fellow lab mates. Players are able to freely trade elements, laboratory tools and even favors \u2013 if there is truly honor among chemists!\nIf you'd like to know more about Compounded you can check out a gameplay video, rules and more at dicehatemegames.com.\nThis mini-expansion for Compounded that introduced a bit more chaotic fun to the lab was a promotional for backers of the original Compounded Kickstarter project. We have since sold or given them away as convention promos, and recently made the mini-expansion available for purchase online. For every pledge that includes a copy of the base game of Compounded, we'll include a copy of Chemical Chaos, as well!\nAchieving our base funding goal now ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish the Geiger Expansion and the second edition of Compounded with the quality that we all have come to expect. Now that we've exceed that goal, we can bring out stretch goals!\nStretch goal number one has been passed! We'll now add 10 wooden Flame Cubes to every Geiger Expansion box! A lot of you were clamoring for a flame token upgrade in the first campaign, and it was always our intent to revisit the idea. But with so many other great stretch goals we never managed to find the time for these cubes to come back around. \nFlame Cubes were in the very first prototype for Compounded, and they\u2019ve always been a bit of a sentimental component for us. By putting them in the Geiger box it will allow us to upgrade components for the base game for both old and new owners of Compounded. \nWe've reached stretch goal #2! Since we've reached $55K, we'll make sure the wooden Flame Cubes have a companion piece - wooden Radiation Tokens! \n These tokens are used to mark radioactive compounds when they get a hot spike, much like when volatile compounds are exposed to a lab fire. Unlike when volatile compounds explode, when radioactive compounds get two Radiation Tokens, they are flipped upside down to create \"dead zones\" in the Research Field, limiting the amount of compounds that are available for completion. \nIn addition to the Radiation Tokens, we'll also add one new compound to the Geiger Expansion - Calcium Nitride. \n It's a tough little compound to complete, but when you do you receive 7 points and activate the Magnet Chemical Reaction which allows you to select any available tool from the tool section on the scoreboard. It can prove to be a pretty powerful and flexible reaction after you invest all that Calcium.\nWe've also reached our next milestone! \nSince we reached $65K, we can kick Radium and Polonium up a notch. How? Well, since they\u2019re radioactive, it\u2019s only fitting that they would glow in the dark! That\u2019s right, we\u2019ve checked with our manufacturer, Panda Games, and they can make those gems truly radioactive. It doesn\u2019t exactly add to gameplay, but it sure does pour on the theme.\nWe've reached our next stretch goal of $70K! We can now give every backer that pledges for GEIGER and above the promotional Methamphetamine Lab Partner card. This might explain our mysterious reference to something Heisenbergian in our stretch goal teasers.\nThis card will be a Kickstarter promotional that each backer may opt to receive as an extra, in addition to the expansion and game. That means that gamers who would rather not include Methamphetamine in their pledges will be asked if they\u2019d like to receive it in the survey that will be sent out after funding. This card will NOT be included in the base game or the Geiger Expansion - it is simply a promotional item for those that would like it.\nOur next stretch goal is super cool - and we've reached it! We can now create a Geiger counter with fully-movable dial!\nThe Geiger counter will now be comprised of four parts - the main Geiger counter punchboard, a dial made of punchboard, and a plastic connector that snaps the punchboard parts together. Scientists will now be able to move the dial instead of a token whenever the radiation levels rise in the lab! This is something we always wished we could add, and with this new stretch goal, we can finally do it.\nWe're pretty excited for our next stretch goal, as we have been toying with the idea of this since the Kickstarter campaign for the base game last year. We have always wanted to highlight some of the chemistry heroes throughout history, so since we reached $90K, we'll produce a pack of 5 Scientist cards for the Geiger Expansion box! These cards will be the same size as the Lab Partners cards, only oriented vertically. \nIn this variant, each player will randomly receive a scientist at the beginning of the game. Each scientist has a special ability that will benefit that particular player, as well as a global ability that affects the entire lab. We've shown you two of the scientists and their abilities above, and we'll be highlighting the other scientists over the next few days in updates. For the time being, we'll just tease to the other scientists in the expansion: Michael Faraday (invented the Bunsen Burner), Joseph Priestley (credited with the discovery of Oxygen), and John Dalton (pioneer of atomic theory and chemical reactions). Feel free to speculate on their powers and global abilities in the comments! Also, please bear in mind that the portrait art above is just placeholder art, for now. If we pass the stretch goal, we'll be contracting an artist for custom portraits of the scientists.\nSince we posted the last stretch goal, everyone has been super excited about the Scientist cards, and clamoring for more. We aim to please; If we pass $100K by the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll give everyone five more scientists! \nIn addition to Geiger and Mendeleev above, we\u2019ll also include cards for Rosalind Franklin (discovered molecular structures of DNA and viruses), George Washington Carver (revolutionized agricultural chemistry), and Emil Erlenmeyer (contributor to theory of structure and inventor of the Erlenmeyer flask). We\u2019ve enjoyed reading everyone\u2019s speculations as to the powers of the last scientists, so feel free to discuss what you think these other three might contribute to the game!\nWe have more stretch goals planned so keep spreading the news and let\u2019s keep the lab growing!\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a complex game. You don\u2019t need to know anything about chemistry to play it, at all. And I think it really fits a niche in which there are not enough games being put out there\u2026 This is a good game. I very much recommend it.\u201d - Tom Vasel (The Dice Tower)\n\u201cI love it! I haven\u2019t thought positively about chemistry since\u2026 high school.\u201d Eric Dow, Critical Plays (Crits Happen)\n\u201cYes, kids, high school chemistry can be fun\u2026 we like Compounded so much we\u2019re ranking it all the way up to the #2 spot (on their Top Ten Games list).\u201d Emily Duhigg (Getting Higgy With It)\n\"Compounded is a medium weight game full of scientific brilliance. The tag line on the box, \"Better gaming through Chemistry,\" sums it up beautifully. I couldn't have said it better myself. This game is fun for scientist of almost every age. I highly recommend it.\"Gaming Bits \n\"This has to be one of the most thematic games I have ever played. You really feel like a scientist gathering elements and creating compounds to complete experiments.\"J. Chris Miller\n\"The end result is a game that appeals to fans of lightweight resource management, families looking for a new game night addition, or even a game to potentially assist in educating students about science in a fun way. It focuses less on deeply complex moves and more on showing that Euros can be thematically rich with widespread appeal. (Especially if that focus is on something as awesome as science.)\" Cardboard Republic\nWell, here we are again - at the precipice of another great adventure together. I am so excited to present the first, official, \"big box\" expansion for one of our Dice Hate Me Games titles. Especially so since Compounded has been so well-received since its general release late last year. \nThe past three years with everyone on Kickstarter and in the board gaming hobby have been absolutely amazing, and there is so much more in store as long as you all continue to come along for the ride. The Geiger Expansion not only expands on a great game \u2013 it also expands on the dream that is Dice Hate Me Games in so many ways, and I cannot wait to share it all with you. It has been an incredible journey because of all of our wonderful backers, and I appreciate each and every one of you, both old and new.\nLet's go make some magic - or science. I'm good either way.\nAll the best,\nChris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with three of our overseas manufacturers and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies.\n\nWe won't lie, though - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Compounded and Geiger are shipping!", "update_content": "Hey, chemistry fans!\nWe have some really exciting news for you.

I\u2019ve been holding off on updating until I received confirmation that everything is solid - the good news is, we\u2019ve worked it all out. The bad news is that, because the file issue went unresolved until factories closed for Chinese New Years, things have fallen behind.

(r\u00e8gles et composants)\nIn Clockwork Wars, 2-4 players command a unique race of creatures in a brisk, tense war game set in a alternate universe where magic and steam-era technology collide. Take control of the calculating Purebreeds, the industrious Troglodytes, the mighty Rhinochs, or the proud Mongrels. Your goal is to vanquish your foes and accumulate the most victory points through seven turns of play. You earn points by fighting for control of territories that contain valuable natural resources. To win these battles, you need manpower gained by seizing villages and developing them into cities. Invest in research and discover astonishing new technologies, like Golems, Submersibles, and Analytical Engines. Position your troops, research powerful discoveries, employ espionage, and conquer your enemies to win the game!\nClockwork Wars features:\nA modular map composed of hexagonal tiles and nine territory types (including manufactories, sorcerer's towers, and citadels) that allows for infinite replayability.\nFour different races to choose from, each with its own unique units.\nHidden and simultaneous unit deployment that provides constant tension.\nShort turns packed with tough decisions.\nSimple, diceless combat resolution.\nA card-based espionage system.\nA unique \"technology tree\" that is different for every game. Research discoveries in one of three different disciplines: Sorcery, Science, and Religion.\nLight civilization-building mechanisms, as players upgrade villages into cities and research discoveries through three successive, historical ages.\nRules for either a \"free-for-all\" game or a 2 vs. 2 team game, where you and your ally combine forces and victory points.\nClockwork Wars Website\nGame Designer Video:\nDesigner Walk-through:\nComplete 3 player Game:\nReviews & Interviews:\nBGG mini-review by Troy\nDesigner Interview with iSlaytheDragon\nNote: Please keep in mind Clockwork Wars is a WIP (Work in Progress). We are actively working on and finishing up graphics for the game components, so don't assume anything is in its final form at this point.\nClockwork Wars Component Pictures\n\u2022 4 sets of colored wooden discs (red, green, white, blue; 32 each)\n\u2022 3 types of influence tokens (Religion, Science, & Sorcery)\n\u2022 4 score markers\n\u2022 6 spymaster action plaques\n\u2022 6 unique unit tokens (1 Hunter, 2 Crashers, 1 Operative, & 2 Engineers)\n\u2022 1 turn marker\n\u2022 1 first player token\n\u2022 40 hex tiles, representing different territories (4 Capitals, 7 Villages, 5 Forests, 4 Lakes, 4 Towers, 4 Manufactories, 4 Shrines, 4 Citadels, 4 Barrens)\n\u2022 3 court tiles/cards\n\u2022 4 screens\n\u2022 3 general miniatures and cards: the Leviathan, Steamtank, & Guardian\n\u2022 45 discovery cards & matching tokens\n\u2022 15 espionage cards\n\u2022 1 game-board\n\u2022 1 deployment-orders pad\n\u2022 1 rulebook (Graphics still being laid out for final copy)\nEnglish Rules\nDeutsch-Regeln\nlivret de r\u00e8gles\nDual Sided Map:\nThe hex tiles in Clockwork Wars are nice and large, measuring 3.75 x 3.25 inches.  We also wanted to give players a choice in artistic style.  One side of each hex features beautiful, \"realistic\" artwork (from  a bird's eye perspective) of each territory type.  The flip side of the hex features a highly functional graphic design that emphasizes the color and icon associated with each territory type.  We leave it up to you to decide which side you want to use when you create your maps!\nMiniatures:  the Generals\nDescription: Each base game will come packaged with 3 gray PVC (polyvinyl chloride) miniatures representing the all-powerful Generals. Shown below are concept art images for the 3 miniatures, as well as our current factory molds that will be used to generate the final minis. As such, don't view these as identical to what you'll get in the box! The final plastics will be even better looking.\nNote: Mini's will be free standing, without the bases you see pictured.\nPurebreeds: Centuries ago, human scientists created the hybrid races through a combination of genetic engineering and arcane wizardry. Outraged by this act of hubris, many civilians flocked to the priests who pronounced all hybrids an affront to God. The \u201cPurebreeds\u201d are dogmatic and militaristic humans who devoutly believe in their own genetic superiority, and they want nothing more than to conquer the hybrids and suppress their rebellion. The Purebreeds\u2019 unique unit is the Operative \u2013 a master of nefarious, black operations.\nTroglodytes (Trogs): Trogs are human-chimpanzee hybrids. They are bright, curious, and resourceful \u2013 interested in experimentation and the development of new technology. Due to infighting and distractibility, Troglodyte society tends to be volatile, and their villages are little more than junkyards. But in war, Trogs attack in overwhelming numbers and possess extraordinary cunning and tactical ability. The Trogs\u2019 unique unit is the Engineer \u2013 a brilliant researcher, adept in sorcery, science, and mysticism.\n\nRhinochs: Rhinochs are human-rhinoceros hybrids. Originally engineered by humans to serve as slaves for all forms of physical labor, the Rhinochs possess a deep hatred for the Purebreeds. They are fierce warriors, capable of valor and heroism in the face of insurmountable odds.Their unique unit is the Crasher \u2013 a humongous berserk Rhinoch who acts as a devastating siege engine.\nMongrels: Mongrels are human-dog hybrids. Their fierce loyalty and sociality has led to a strong, interdependent society where discipline and dignity guide cultural progress.They are skilled spies and assassins, while in battle their savage instincts and lightning reflexes make them formidable enemies. Their unique unit is the Hunter \u2013 a lone commando unit seemingly capable of appearing and disappearing at will.\nSentience is an expansion for Clockwork Wars. It adds a number of new Discovery and Espionage cards, many more hexagonal tiles to make even larger and more varied maps, a new Court, two new Territory types (the Observatory and Nexus), and a fifth race: the Inventions. This allows for 5-player games.\nEnglish Rules (Sentience)\nDeutsch-Regeln (Sentience)\nLivret de r\u00e8gles (Sentience)\nInventions: The Inventions are autonomous, animate thinking machines.No one knows precisely how they arose, but some suspect the first Invention was created by Sir Erasmus Paniscus, the famous Troglodyte engineer. They have rapidly multiplied since their origin and are now a powerful army in the clockwork wars. The Inventions are gifted engineers, capable of building new Inventions in their astonishing magical workshops.Inventions often mimic the form of various natural species, especially insects and spiders. They are young, full of energy and naivety, but recognize that they must defend themselves in this time of war if they wish to survive as a free race.\n  More Information about the Sentience Expansion\nIn Clockwork Wars we've recruited artists from over 10 different countries to illustrate over 80+ original pieces of art for the game!  The Digital Art Book will collect these illustrations, and show you how they evolved from rough sketch to final image.  As all the art for the game has yet to be finished, the Digital Art Book is also still a work in progress. \nAll posters included in each pledge level will come folded inside the box unless purchased separately (at the $15 level).\nAll posters included in each pledge level will come folded inside the box unless purchased separately at the $10 pledge level.\n Add-On #1 --\n1x custom \"Discovery Card Mat\" on which to place and organize your discovery cards for easy viewing (this item is not included in the game).

Gryphon Games has been fortunate enough to publish several of Alf's best known titles such as Fantastiqa, The Road to Canterbury, and Cubist (co-designed with Steven Poelzing).\nHere is how Alf describes Mus\u00e9e: \"In this fast-paced card game, you collect impossibly valuable works of art and put them on display in your own personal art museum, the Mus\u00e9e. The only problem is that your opponents are doing the very same thing! Each gallery must be organized properly by exhibit number, but to succeed you must balance your passion for order with the need for public acclaim. Impress visitors by tastefully positioning works of art side-by-side showing similar themes. Make sure you don\u2019t get too greedy for applause, though \u2014 doing so might disorganize your collection and keep you from displaying any more paintings! The first player to complete each separate gallery will open the exhibition early and receive extra recognition. The player who displays the most compelling combination of artworks in the most artistic manner is the winner. Mus\u00e9e includes sixty unique fine art images from artists ranging from the fifteenth to the early twentieth centuries, all licensed through Bridgeman Art Library.\"\nMus\u00e9e is for 2-4 players, ages 8 and up.

This travel-sized version of the game is #5 in the original Gryphon Bookshelf Series. Tuck box components are shown here with big box. The tuck box will be smaller.\n More about the Gryphon book shelf games\nWith your help in supporting this Kickstarter, Mus\u00e9e will become the 16th and latest addition to the Gryphon Bookshelf Series. Other recent additions have been Lords and Ladies by the brother/sister team of Jason and Jen Corace, Wyatt Earp by the very talented design team of Mike Fitzgerald and Richard Borg, and Sleuth by the legendary Sid Sackson.  More can be found about each of these titles below and on www.boardgamegeek.com.\nThe entire line up of the 16 games in the Gryphon Bookshelf Series is seen above.\nInitiated by Gryphon Games in 2007, this series contains some of the best-known and most-loved fast, family fun games ever produced.  Very noteworthy titles in the series include Roll Through the Ages, For Sale and Incan Gold.  Several of the titles in this series have sold over 100,000 copies.  The games' designers are some of the best known in the world, including Stefan Dorra, Bruno Faiduti, Reiner Knizia, Matt Leacock, and Alan R. Moon.

Please send us a message or email to reserve your copy! \nWe are very proud to announce the next four games coming to the Gryphon Games Bookshelf Series!\n\nLords and Ladies is a first design by brother and sister artists Jason and Jen Corace. \nLords and Ladies is a card game where you control a turn of the 20th Century noble family and their servants. Your goal is to raise your family's status through careful marriages, hiring servants and having children all the while destroying rival families through gossip, backstabbing, and using superior wit!\nLords and Ladies is a game for 2-5 players ages 10+ and plays in about an hour! Lords and Ladies is currently on a ship bound from China to the US and will be arriving in August! \nCOMPONENTS are listed on the back of the box below.\nFull Rules for Lords and Ladies!\nWyatt Earp was first produced by Alea Games in 2001. The Gryphon Games edition (currently being produced in China), updates the graphics but retains the original rules (one change was made by the designers) and flavor of the game!  \nThe Wild West! Tough times and tough characters! Bandits, desperados,rustlers and thieves are everywhere... Take the roles of the brave sheriffs riding on the heels of legendary Outlaws. Capture Jesse James! Hunt Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid! Rich rewards await those brave and daring enough. Just be careful not to let them slip away...\nThe game is played over several hands. In each hand, the players try to earn as much reward money as possible by participating in the capture of the Outlaws \u2013 and with as little help from the other players as possible. The greater a player\u2019s part in the capture of an Outlaw, the greater will be his reward: a player may earn the entire reward, a large or small portion of it, or nothing at all! All this depends on his level of participation and that of the others. By playing their cards, the players come closer and closer to capturing the Outlaws. Also, the more cards played, the higher the reward grows. Players must play both competitively and cooperatively. The player who best plays the cards he draws will win!\nComponents\n29 Sheriff cards (with stars)\n7 Photo cards (1 in each color)\n7 Wyatt Earp cards\n4 Bank Robbery cards\n3 Fastest Gun cards\n3 Most Wanted! cards\n3 Hideout cards\n2 Stagecoach Robbery cards\n49 Outlaw cards (7 of each Outlaw)\n60 reward tokens ($1,000)\n18 reward tokens ($5,000)\n4 summary cards\n7 reward posters\nWyatt Earp is a game for 2 to 4 players from ages 8+ and takes 30-45 minutes to play.\nFull Rules for Wyatt Earp!\nSleuth is a fascinating detective game for 3 to 7 players. This Classic Game was designed by the Dean of American Gaming, Sid Sackson, and was first published in 1971!  Since then it has sold well more than 100,000 copies. Gryphon Games is proud to give it a permanent home in the Gryphon Bookshelf Series! Through skillful questioning of his opponents, each player gathers evidence and then, using his powers of deduction and logic, attempts to discover the identity of the missing gem! \nThe Dealer shuffles the Gem Deck and removes one card, placing it where no player may accidentally see it. This becomes the Missing Gem. The remaining cards are then dealt secretly to each player to form their hands. The players then record the information from their private cards on their personal information sheets.\n Each Gem Card has three elements\u2014gem (diamond, pearl, or opal), color (red, yellow, blue, or green), and type (solitaire, pair, or cluster). Players use Search Cards to try to determine what cards the other players hold in their hands.\nPlay continues around the table with each player using one search card per turn until one player believes they have solved the mystery. They make a note of their guess on their information sheet and check the missing gem. If correct, the player reveals the card by turning it face up for all players to see and wins the game!\nComponents\n36 Gem Cards\n54 Search Cards\n1 Pad of Information Sheets\nSleuth is a game for 3 to 7 players ages 10+ with a play time of about 30 minutes.\nFull Rules for Sleuth!\n\n Any Game from the Gryphon Games Bookshelf Series may be added to your pledge. \nUse the table below to determine add-on amounts.
