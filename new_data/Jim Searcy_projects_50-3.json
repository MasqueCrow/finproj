Here's their playthrough of the short adventure from the base game:\nRob's Gaming Table has been doing live-streamed playthroughs of several adventures. Here's the short adventure from The Forest of No Return:\nExtended interview with designer Christian Lonsing on our Ulisses Worlds Twitch show. Christian talks about the origins of the Aventuria card game right up through his design thoughts for this current wave of expansions:\n\nThis Kickstarter is a great way to get started! Be sure to check out the New to Aventuria reward level, as well as the playthrough videos above!\nAventuria is not a trading card game! Players have a fixed deck, which is only changed and expanded within a limited framework for certain game modes.\n\nHow to play\nIn Aventuria each player takes the role of a hero from Aventuria. Those heroes come with their own card decks, that offer a unique style of play. The deck can be changed only in limited ways. \nAventuria can be enjoyed in two different game modes:\nIn Duel Mode, heroes fight against each other, while in the cooperative Adventure Mode, heroes join together as a party and go on exciting adventures. \nWhether battling against each other or standing united against a terrifying foe, players draw action cards every round which constantly improve their abilities. But beware, for each round brings new challenges, and you must always watch for surprise attacks from your enemies!\nRegardless of the mode you are playing, you will power up your hero with equipment, skills, and spells, and then use your abilities to attack your foes. On your turn, you may play up to two cards as endurance cards, which are then used to pay for the tools you will need for your adventure. Since you can (almost) never get any cards back into your hand, much of the strategy involves selecting the right cards to keep and the right cards to add to your endurance pool.\nIn Aventuria, nothing is ever certain. Many of your attacks and spells require skill rolls, and your foe may still have the chance to dodge or use armor to reduce the damage you do. When fortune is against you, Fate Points can help turn the tide.\nLearn more about the game on our website!\nWe are Ulisses Spiele, the German based and internationally renowned publisher of games like The Dark Eye, Torg Eternity, Fading Suns, HeXXen 1733 and of course Aventuria \u2013 Adventure Card Game.

Conceived by Alan Bahr, the GallantVerse is a near-future setting, where superheroes have recently come into being.\nThe GallantVerse is a setting focused on heroic and exciting heroes, with a slight science fiction bent and a focus on hope and optimistic heroism! All your favorite comic book angles are here, from mystical occultists, to mutants, to paragons of science and technology, and massive cosmic threats! We're hitting all the notes!\nThis book provides the first major expansion to the world of the GallantVerse. \nOur goal is to fund a hardcover edition of the book to put into retail. We've already had it edited, laid-out and proofed. We just need to recoup our costs, as well as fund the print run.\nThe final book will be 130, full-color, illustrated and professionally printed pages!\nAdditionally, the writing on the GallantVerse is being handled by top industry talent. We're set on paying all our contributors well, and our goal reflects our commitment to an ethical pay rate for our writers, artists, and team members.\nArt by Nicolas Giacondino\nWritten by a slew of award-winning industry writers, such as Alan Bahr, Elizabeth Chaipraditkul, Shawn Carman, Jack Norris, and Darren Pearce, with art by GallantVerse artist Nicolas Giacondino (who also served as a consultant on the South American portions of the GallantVerse), The GallantVerse Campaign Guide is the first major expansion to Tiny Supers, and features:\nThree new archetypes: The Brute, the Stalker, and the Trickster. \nTeamwork focused Hero and Villain Point Mechanics\nNew Traits, such as: Signature Weapon, Improvement Traits, Customization Traits, Affiliation Traits, as well as new Power Traits, featuring powers such as: Astral Projection, Damage Field, Danger Sense, Fate Manipulation, Genius Level Intellect and more!\nTwo new actions to better model super heroic combat: Slam and Set-Up. \nNarrative-focused rules for Bases & Hide-outs. \nArt by Nicolas Giacondino\nThe book also features expansions to the GallantVerse, dealing with Europe, South America, and the archvillain Thule's empire of Atlantis. \nScience, Spells & Superheroes!\nFrance, Germany and England feature in this section, and you'll find out more about Cabinet 13, England's mystical and magical companion agency to the A.C.T.I.O.N. and Sentry Force Dark, Grosse Verdammte Helden, Germany's cybernetic techno-magic heroes, and  the mystic-dimension hopping Department des Dimensions Alternative, France's secret science division attached to CERN.\nCelestial Mantles & Eternal Heroes\nLong before the resurgence of Supers there were heroes summoned forth by the collective will of the people in various regions of South America. These heroes were ordinary people blessed with the power of celestial forces granted by a mantle, which eventually became part of them. As the power of the Mantles grew so did these superpowered heroes, becoming greater than their original purpose and forces unto themselves.\nToday the Mantles have awoken to protect their people. Together with normal Supers they strive to find a way forward in a new world. The way isn\u2019t easy however, as Mantles clash with Supers on the best way to protect South America and what shape the future will take.\nSunken Empires & Alternate Dimensions\nRuled by the dreaded techno-sorcerous despot, Thule, Atlantis exists in a pocket dimension accessible through various fixed points on Earth. The Atlanteans are generally ambivalent to the affairs of humanity, but the same cannot be said for their  leader, who frequently embroils the kingdom in his schemes of domination and revenge. \nTiny Supers is the award-winning, minimalist and bestselling TinyD6 superhero roleplaying game.\nTiny Supers allows you to play superheroes of all types, from paragons and exemplars, to super-science heroes of the future or past, to cosmic guardians defending the far-reaches of the galactic civilizations from untold threats!\nCharacter creation is simple, fast, and exciting. You pick your character archetype based on the exciting stories your Game Master is going to tell, you pick a few Traits or Powers that each grant a single benefit, and you're done!\nTiny Supers uses a simple, fast, and dynamic ruleset to handle actions. The game uses up to three six-sided dice as part of action resolution.\nIf you roll a \"5\" or \"6\" on a die, your check succeeds. Most checks are made with two dice. However, if you are deemed to have \"advantage\" on a roll, you gain a third die to roll. If you have disadvantage, you lose a dice (rolling only a single die).\nCharacters are made quickly and easily. You will select a superheroic archetype (such as Paragon, Gadgeteer, Defender, Mastermind or more), three traits or powers, and write down some basic information and you are ready to play!\nGallant Knight Games is a tabletop gaming company dedicated to high-quality roleplaying games and card and board games.\nFounded in 2016 by Alan and Erin Bahr, and focused on affordable, accessible and exciting tabletop games, Gallant Knight Games produces the award-winning and bestselling TinyD6 line of games, with titles such as Tiny Dungeon 2e, Tiny Supers, Tiny Frontiers: Revised and many more. \nGallant Knight Games also produces many other bestselling titles, such as: Cold Shadows, the Venerable Knight Classic line, as well as supporting a wide range of rulesets. \nGallant Knight Games also serves as a publishing partner for bestselling indie publishers, such as Old Skull Publishing, Barrel Rider Games, and many more, helping to bring their games to larger audiences!\nAlan Bahr is the award-winning lead designer and founder of Gallant Knight Games.\n\nPlease note: the below shipping costs are estimates based on current shipping prices. Some changes or fluctuation is possible (and likely)!\nUSA Shipping\nBased on our experience shipping in the USA, we've worked to establish a new shipping rate on Kickstarters (this is the debut of that hard work!):\nFor book-only pledges, we charge a flat $8 shipping charge (media mail + packaging and handling costs) for USA addresses. This does include tracking delivered to your email.\nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), we have to increase the cost to $15 (priority mail + packaging and handling costs).\nWe do our best to keep shipping affordable by doing our own fulfillment, so we can ensure it's done right. \nEU Shipping\nFor orders in the EU, our friends at Angry Hamster Publishing are handling our Kickstarter fulfillment!\nFor book-only pledges, we charge a flat \u20ac10 shipping charge (the shipping costs + packaging and handling costs) for EU addresses. (We're still exploring tracking and we'll firm up those details.)\nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), we have to increase the cost to \u20ac25 (a larger package + packaging and handling costs). These packages are tracked. \nHowever, because they're shipping inside the EU, VAT and Customs fees will not apply!\nUK Shipping\nFor book-only pledges, we use Royal Mail, which is relatively inexpensive. Unfortunately, we can't give a firm price as price increases are due to rise on April 1st in the UK. \nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), unfortunately, we can't give a firm price as price increases are due to rise on April 1st in the UK.  Parcelforce would be the service used. \nOur fulfillment team should have updated numbers soon and we'll post those as soon as we can. \nHowever, by the time the pledge manager rolls out \nThe Rest of the World\nFor anyone else, shipping can get very expensive. We do our best, but we'd recommend you look into the options below with print-on-demand.\nIf you still want an offset book, you're welcome to back at the appropriate level, but we can't offer refunds on your pledge because shipping was more than you thought. It can get very expensive (please be aware.)\nIf you need an estimate, don't hesitate to reach out to shipping@gallantknightgames.com\nIf You're Concerned About Shipping Costs...\nHowever, we do always have a Print-On-Demand pledge for our international fans and backers and we do always put our books in Print-On-Demand on DriveThruRPG, so don't hesitate to just get the PDF and you can get the book later! (Any extra offset print run is sold via our webstore, and you can always get it there, but the high shipping concerns still exist!)\nAll of our digital rewards (and our print on demand rewards) are being handled by our fulfillment partners at DriveThruRPG!\n\nREMEMBER: the above shipping costs are estimates based on current shipping prices.

All Gallant Knight Games projects have delivered their digital rewards, and currently two projects have physical fulfillment underway and will be completed before this campaign ends. This project will not impact those. This is a straight-forward project with some nuances, but we're prepared to handle them, and we're shooting for the same exceptional success we've already had!\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished?\nA: Not a risk. It's all done!\n\nQ: What if the complexity of the project overwhelms GKG?\nA: We have straight forward pledge levels to make it easy to manage, and we've budgeted our stretch goals up to our cap. In order to keep the project manageable for our small team, we've elected to minimize our stretch goals to text increases, and we've set a finite limit of page count.\n\nQ: What about delays in art?\nA: It's all done!\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs?\nA: Shipping costs constantly rise, and while we've projected them to the best of our abilities, there's not a lot we can do if they change. However, due to the limitations on the size of our product, we're confident this won't be an issue.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals?\nA: If something were to happen to Alan, or another writer on the project, we've identified our backups, and our team is spread all over the world. It'd take a really big asteroid, zombie apocalypse or alien invasion to wipe us all out. The files and plans have been communicated to the whole team, and a new project lead (who has been identified) will step up.\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\nWe hold rewards for a year from fulfillment start date, before we can no longer promise that we'll be able to fulfill your rewards. We're a small company with limited space, and while we've never had an issue, it's better to be clear about our practices so you're aware. Once we start shipping, if your reward gets returned, or your fulfillment info wasn't provided, we'll give you a full calendar year and ship that reward for you.

You will see a reduction in shipping per unit but it's impossible to give a single answer on what that will be - it's based on where the order is being shipped, what the total weight & size of the order is, etc.\nRestricted Delivery:\nDue to the increasing frequency of Kickstarter Rewards failing to clear customs or being lost or stolen during delivery AEG now ships only to the following countries:\nUnited States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union+ (Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), Australia, New Zealand, China (including Hong Kong), Japan, Singapore, South Korea & Taiwan.\nAll other backers must arrange to have their reward received in one of those countries and freight-forwarded, at backer expense, to their final delivery address. We will cancel and refund orders from countries we do not ship prior to fulfillment if other arrangements have not been made.\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com\nAre you a retailer that wants to jump on the Meeples and Monsters train?

All card counts are approximate and are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change and is not finalized. Rules are subject to change.\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group has been in the publishing business for more than 20 years. We are experienced at producing games in China and distributing them worldwide. Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays\n* Shipping delays\n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is March 2022, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 10% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. AEG is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of your rewards. If you believe that your reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your reward if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email kickstarter@alderac.com for further information.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "Hero Pledge: Game and Upgrades!", "descp": "A copy of Meeples & Monsters and all upgrades.\nINCLUDES:\nMeeples & Monsters Game\nMeeples upgraded to printed\n4 Towers Expansion\nSolo game rules and components", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["3,733 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Production Update and an Important Heads Up", "update_content": "Production Update\nShort version: Things are going really smoothly.

This addition is primarily designed for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons, but also functions as a huge collection of inspiring rooms, characters and more! \nEach of these taverns can be enjoyed by any adventurer, and can be scattered across any setting! Ranging from the grim and seedy dealings in the Bloated Bounty to the world shaping Wildaback Tavern, the diversity of each tavern and inn\u2019s culture is a spectacle of its own.\nThese taverns come populated with a slew of characters, some of which can be found at any location. In addition, these buildings house a wide array of monstrous foes, magic items of varying power, and new mechanics!\nThis book is more than it seems. These taverns are laced with their own secrets, hidden histories and locked doors. But more than internal stories, the book itself serves as a guide to the hidden lore of its most prevalent characters. If you\u2019re interested in code cracking, treasure hunting and deep lore, this book is for you!\nFor the most secrets included, it\u2019s suggested you get at least the Tavern Keeper tier, but the main puzzle can be unravelled by anyone with the hardcover! \nOne of our taverns simply can\u2019t be contained inside the pages. Because it changes shape every time you visit! Using dozens of room tiles and a table with descriptions, have your players run through a potentially endless maze of rooms. If you add the arcane haze variant, filling every guest's mind with rage, you can potentially use this tavern as a standalone roguelike board game! \nIf you grab our custom card deck, you can fully immerse yourself in a newly designed game for standard playing cards. Pick your character from the court members, or the joker, and race your opponents on your own trail to victory!\nAdd-ons are a great way to get an extra item or two from a higher pledge, or previous campaign at a Kickstarter rate! All backers will have access to addons, all you have to do is back a tier of this campaign to be invited. Once the Kickstarter is complete, we'll reach out to you and ask you to confirm through the survey which addons you would like to purchase. Shipping costs for addons will be determined after the Kickstarter along with the survey. Addons from this campaign will ship along with pledges. However, backers who select any addon from Stibbles\u2019 Codex (list below) will have the option to receive these select addons earlier - estimated delivery in April 2021.

There are now Print + PDF \u201cone-click\u201d reward levels for those who want physical books along with your digital rewards that are paired up with the existing four PDF-only pledge levels.\nI\u2019ve added a retail tier that is five copies each of physical books only, no cards or counters.\nFinally, there are two tiers for those who are looking to go big. The first one assumes you have the books from both previous Perilous Journeys campaigns, and the original counter and card sets from Five Perilous Journeys...but want to catch up with everything that\u2019s new since then. The second is for those who want everything GB has done for TFT in one click.\nWhat about the CC4 through CC6 stretch goals? As they fall, these products will be added to the appropriate reward levels at no change in reward price.\nThe New to TFT! pledge reward also benefits: As CC4 through CC6 are unlocked, you get those as well in Print and PDF!\nIf you\u2019ve already pledged to a digital level, but the campaign ends before you can come back to adjust...don\u2019t worry: You can switch freely in the Backerkit phase!\nWith that...read on! \nYour session of The Fantasy Trip is in full swing.\nTired and starving, you have nearly reached your goal: You're ready to rescue the dragon and defeat the vile prince. Suddenly, it's time for a fight! The player-characters are ambushed by \"2d bandits, of 30-33 points.\"\nStop playing while you make 2\u201312 opponents? Perhaps make a single bandit, and the players wind up fighting a half-dozen identical foes?\nThe first disrupts the flow of the evening; the second is unsatisfying: People aren't clones.\nThat's why the Character Collections exist.\nReady-to-play characters built as individuals: Each has a brief story, describing something of their past, motivations, and salient details that make them individuals. They're not all combat monsters: Some must resort to duplicity, cunning, seduction, and guile to get by. Others are more \"Thog smash!\" and prefer to handle things with something blunt and heavy.\n(See What is The Fantasy Trip below for more details!)\nGaming Ballistic proudly presents, at a minimum, the first three volumes in the Character Collectionseries, offering up more third-party support for Steve Jackson Games' classic: The Fantasy Trip. These books provide ready-to-play, rules-compliant characters for use as hirelings, rivals, extras, or even pre-generated characters. They're definitely useful for when an adventure or encounter calls for opposition you haven't prepared in advance...or when the GM needs a little creative inspiration.\nMinimum? The campaign begins with volumes 1\u20133...but as the backer-count stretch goals are met, the value of your pledge increases as the campaign adds volumes 4, 5, and 6 to your reward package!\nCharacter Collection 1: Experienced Adventurers provides 20 ready-to-use adventurers of various point values. It's short (only 8 pages), and does not include custom character art in the Print/PDF books.\n\nThe second volume in the Character Collection series contains 40 starting characters, each of 30\u201333 points. Grab them as hirelings for powerful adventurers, people met by chance on the road, or as ready-to-go starting characters.\nRookies features custom-created art for each character - an improvement on the first volume, and the model for all that follow! Character Collection 2 is 12 pages. \n\nThe third volume in the Character Collection series provides 72 bandits, outlaws, untrustworthy, or desperate people from 30\u201338 points. They're probably not your friends.\nAs with Rookies, a custom-drawn image is provided for each character. Character Collection 3 is 20 pages. \n\nThe Character Collection series starts at three volumes: Experienced Adventurers, Rookies, and Bandits and Outlaws. Unlocking the 350-backer goal gave additional add-on content for Experienced Adventurers.

Its first element was released in 1977: the combat game Melee (still available FREE from Steve Jackson Games!). That was followed by the magic game Wizard and a full roleplaying rulebook: In the Labyrinth.\nThe Fantasy Trip is more \u201ccinematic\u201d than \u201csimulationist\u201d \u2014 speed and ease of play are the goal, not an exact representation of every swing and every defense. The background is unabashedly swords and sorcery. Elves are noble, dragons are greedy, and gunpowder weapons exist...but might blow up in your face!\nTFT was off the market for more than 35 years, until 2017 when Steve Jackson regained the rights to his work and set about creating a new edition. The Legacy Edition was officially released in 2019 . . . and Gaming Ballistic is pleased to provide support under official license from Steve Jackson Games for that amazing deluxe edition.\nIf you're new to The Fantasy Trip . . . there's a pledge level just for you! Check out the New to TFT Starter Pack for the core rulebook in hardcover, plus additional support materials (this pledge level only ships to the USA).\n\nThe pledge levels have been expanded to allow easier, one-click selection of a variety of print and PDF rewards.

It is also limited to the USA, due to out of control international shipping. Gaming Ballistic cannot offer the In the Labyrinth book in PDF format.\nIf you want individual books, card decks, or counter sheets...add to your pledge based on the guidelines below!\nAs stretch goals are unlocked for Character Collections, additional books, card decks, and counter sheets will be made available. \nThe \"Five Perilous Journeys\" campaign featured a deck of 63 cards, done in the style of SJGames Decks of Destiny. They were pretty popular.\nGaming Ballistic is thrilled to offer both the original Five Perilous Journeys deck...as well as decks for More Perilous Journeys and each of the Character Collections volumes as stretch goals are unlocked!\nThese physical add-ons will ship from the USA: They might be expensive for international delivery. \nDecks available at this point in the campaign:\n Five Perilous Journeys: 63 cards, $20\n More Perilous Journeys (Dark Lord's Doom and Dragon Hunt) Deck: 72 cards, $25\n More Perilous Journeys (Roc of Sages and Catacombs) Deck: 62 cards, $20\n More Perilous Journeys (The Sunken Library): 62 cards, $20\n Character Collection 1 (Experienced Adventurers): 20 cards, $10\n Character Collections 2 (Rookies): 40 cards, $15\n Character Collections 3 (Bandits and Outlaws): 72 cards, $25\nAs stretch goals are unlocked, more decks become available. \nFor those who like moving physical bits around on their tactical maps, the character artwork is also available as physical counters, printed on cardboard. All of the counters for this project - including the Five Perilous Journeys counters - will be 1\" square and be greyscale printed on a white background.\nDue to issues with manufacturing and shipping, they will not be shipped outside the USA.\n Five Perilous Journeys Set: $50 (5 sheets; greyscale)\n More Perilous Journeys Set: $50 (5 sheets)\n Character Collections 2 - Rookies: $10 (1 sheet)\n Character collections 3 - Bandits and Outlaws: $20 (2 sheets)\nMore sheets will be added as stretch goals are opened. If all goals are met, there will be five additional sheets, making 18 total...over 700 counters. \nBox 'em Up ($5)\nThis project may produce up to 18 different counter sheets. I'm going to offer a custom-printed box for storage. I'm still working the design! But here's a mockup showing the dimensions and box style. The box will arrive folded flat.\nThe pledge levels cover PDFs. \nIf you want to order physical books as well, the prices of individual books as add-ons are shown below. \nPrevious campaigns produced ten adventures to provide hours of solo or group play without having to do all the work yourself. Each of the following add-ons provides you physical copies of the books listed. Match the add-on with the PDF reward level to get both!\n Solo Adventures Physical Books ($40)\nVampire Hunter Belladonna, Dragon Hunt!, and Dark Lord's Doom\nDavid Pulver wrote three solo/programmed adventures for the two Perilous Journeys campaigns.

(Choose the Character Collections + All Perilous PDFs pledge level to get PDFs of each of these 10 adventures).\nMany countries treat \"books\" and \"stuff\" differently in terms of mail postage rates as well as tax status.\nBooks\nFor books, the price you see is the price you pay, with shipping charges a pass-through for postage, materials, and labor. With the exception of the TFT Hardback, books ship to the whole world.\nStuff\nFor \"not-the-USA,\" the contribution to the cost for VAT cannot be ignored: It tends to be closer to 20-25%. This \"plus-up\" for VAT is not included in the prices of the add-ons, and will be added to the shipping charges for these items. Shipping charges are also subject to VAT.\nCARD DECKS ship to the entire world. COUNTER SETS ship to the US only for now.\nCustoms, Duties, DDP, DAP\nWherever possible and practical, Gaming Ballistic will try and ship goods Delivery Duty Prepaid (DDP) and include the cost of customs, duties, and taxes in the shipping fees. \nThat may not be possible for all countries. For those exceptions, the courier or carrier may present you with a customs bill in order to claim your goods. That sucks. But Gaming Ballistic can't control it.\n Fair warning: the only alternative to this sort of cost allocation is to avoid international shipping all together. I'd rather not do that...but these are horrible times for international shipping, and that's the reality in front of all of us.\n\nA project isn't a project without a timeline.\nCampaign Launch: Friday, February 19, 2020 (10am Central Time)\nCampaign End: Tuesday, March 9 (5pm Central Time)\nBackerkit Phase: April, 2021\nProduction: May, 2021\nPDF Distribution: June 2021\nPrinting and Physical Good Manufacture: August 2021\nShipping, Fulfillment, and Delivery: September-October 2021\nEvery effort will be made to beat these times.\nTo help manage post-campaign add-ons, as well as the distribution of the final product(s) to backers, Gaming Ballistic will be using Backerkit to conduct the post-Kickstarter surveys and fulfillment.\nBackerkit is a company whose purpose is to help creators manage these details, including add-ons and shipping costs. When the campaign ends, you will be invited to fill out a Backerkit survey to confirm shipping details, and choose any add-ons you might like to purchase. If you've pledged more than your reward total, this will show as a credit on your account.\nThe Backerkit phase will last between 10-14 days. \nThe Backerkit survey is vitally important for those wanting physical goods. Get your surveys done early, and choose your Add-Ons at this time - and ALL physical goods are add-ons!\n \"Ships to Whole World\" is not Free Shipping! \nShipping is charged in Backerkit,  and not included in pledges. For international customers, taxes are also assessed along with shipping, where appropriate.\nInternational shipping OF BOOKS prints in the UK at Mixam, and Kixto will handle fulfillmen via Royal Mail. This is probably more costly than it  has been in the past.\nCard decks and counter sheets ship from the USA; Counter Sets will not be available internationally. The whole world is also laboring under the effects of COVID-19, which complicates staffing on the shippers' side as well. For the third time: International Shipping of this complicated project (PDF, decks, books) is going to be expensive and challenging. Be prepared.\nGaming Ballistic produces materials aimed at three product lines: The Fantasy Trip, the Dungeon Fantasy RPG (Powered by GURPS), and various versions of the original fantasy RPG. Below you can find a guide to the three product lines, and a quick summary and pricing for each.\n Vampire Hunter Belladonna ($16/$8 PDF): Take the role of Belladonna of Ironskull Castle in this solo adventure. Vampires plague the land, and she's going to deal with them.\n Dragon Hunt! ($19.50/$10): With the Baron and his armies off in a foreign adventure, the dragons grow reckless. This very challenging programmed adventure requires several characters to ensure victory.\n Dark Lord's Doom ($15/$7.50): The Dark Lord Saethor aims to conquer the lands; he's already recruited the orcs and subjugated the elves. He must be stopped! This programmed adventure features a squad of four soldiers. Run it solo, as a group, or with a GM!\n Ironskull Castle ($12/$6): Lady Raell Ironskull is the sorcerous leader of a band of mercenaries with some very unusual help. This mini setting presents her home, Ironskull Castle, and the secrets it keeps.\n Citadel of Ice ($12/$6): An iceberg holds a group of humans, yeti, treasure...and the required dark secrets. Can you raid the rapidly melting citadel before the loot disappears forever, and maybe rescue the stranded people as well?\n Crown of Eternity ($12/$6): The first of the five-book Jok Sevantes campaign. You are hired by the Indhyna League to find the arcane archeologist Jok Sevantes, recover the object he was searching for, and return.\n Curse of the Pirate King ($12/$6): Sevantes leads the way to Costora, home of the long-dead (or IS HE?) Pirate King, and resting place of a fabled artifact. And now the center of a hidden threat. \n Roc of Sages ($12/$6): Sevantes needs the party to help him get parts from the aggressive Viridian Rocs to further his mysterious plans. Plus a few stops along the way.\n Catacombs of Living Death ($13/$6.50): Jok's plans begin to crescendo as the group heads into the plague-ridden land of Athan in search of the Helm of Baat, buried in the Catacombs of Eulogia...which is now under new management.\n The Sunken Library ($19/$9.50): The series climax! Jok is ready to take his collection of artifacts to the Sunken Library of Hrel...and those who oppose him start to take stronger steps.\nGaming Ballistic also provides support for SJGames' Dungeon Fantasy RPG.\nFinally, for players of Fifth Edition, the OSR, or even a bit of the Pathfinder RPG, find out what happens when a GURPS fan takes the OGL, 30 years with GURPS, a bunch of Vikings, and has a lot of fun. Plus: Dungeon Grappling - \"grappling rules that don't suck.\" ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe primary risk to backers is the timing of delivery.\n\nThe writing for the first three Character Collections is complete. The layout template is in place and proven; for some of the books the layout is already finished, which includes editing. For others, even the artwork is complete.\n\nThere is a lot of art required to also provide the counter-size graphics present for every character presented in the books. Add-ons are physical goods that require manufacturing and distribution. Given the state of the world right now, this definitely represents a timing risk.\n\nShipping, whether international or domestic, is very challenging. And expensive. Shipping rates and delivery dates are both extremely unpredictable. Most add-ons are not books, meaning they are subject to VAT, customs, and even more delays. Some of these duties and fees may be collected on delivery. Gaming Ballistic has no control over international postage fees and methods. GB doesn't control or influence domestic rates either, but at least they're more predictable.\n\nThere are very few things that would disrupt the project other than mild schedule slips \u2013 though of course things can always go pear-shaped. Gaming Ballistic provides regular updates as to the project\u2019s progress, and do everything possible to deliver the final PDF on or ahead of schedule.\n\nFor manufacturing timing, the book printer chosen operates in both the USA and UK and provides high quality identical printing at both sites. This eliminates a huge variable in timing: the need to ship from a far-flung location, split shipments, and then do fulfillment. For cards and counters, manufacture and distribution is more complicated, and definitely not local for international customers. Lead and manufacturing times are currently unpredictable; we'll do the best we can.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Follow the Campaign", "descp": "Follow along, get updates, but not receive any rewards.

Your mercenaries will be able to pick up tickets that will see them engage in counterinsurgencies, strike operations, train resistance fighters in the wilds, police unruly populations, and take on the heaviest warfighting jobs available.\nEverything is provided in the set for you to do this, from the initial creation of the mercenary unit to the building of tickets for your Travellers to attempt, with specialised units and equipment enhance a unit's capabilities, and enough adventuring material to kickstart any new campaign.\nWhat is Inside?\nThe Mercenary set will initially contain three books in a box set, but stretch goals will unlock additional hardbacks and adventures to expand the mercenary experience, covering new tickets, equipment and rival units.\nBook 1: Mercenaries in the Far Future\nBook 2: Running a Mercenary Force\nBook 3: In the Field\nWipeable Unit Roster Card\nThe writing for the Mercenary box set is complete and you can download the first book included in the set, Mercenaries in the Far Future, right HERE.\n\nMercenaries in the Far Future: A full guide on using mercenary units in Traveller, detailing how they operate and fight across a range of environments and Tech Levels, along with rules on how to resolve missions and related incidents in the life of mercenaries. It also deals with larger-scale conflicts and how the focus can shift from a high-level picture of a theatre of war to a crisis point involving a handful of mercenaries. In short, this volume is all about what an existing mercenary unit does.\nRunning a Mercenary Force: This book shows you how a mercenary force is recruited, maintained, expanded and subdivided if necessary. Four key resources are necessary to this process: Personnel, Credits, Materiel and Influence.\nIn the Field: The tickets presented in this volume are intended for use in any Traveller campaign, and are independent of Charted Space and the Third Imperium universe. Some are standalone incidents which can be placed in any suitable location, whilst others form part of a wider conflict or confrontation. In addition to the tickets presented here these situations provide a backdrop for further mercenary operations and adventures.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe Mercenary box set brings a new style of campaign to Traveller and contains all the core rules needed to make warfighting a way of life for your group. However, there is no one set way to build a new mercenary unit and each is as unique as the group of Travellers behind it. Clearly, there is an immense amount of ground that can be covered, from new 'toys' to equip your soldiers with to specialist mercenary units and fully fleshed out tickets to kick your campaigns off. Kickstarter gives us the very best opportunity to explore these avenues while constantly getting your feedback on how to present them.\n\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels (Virtual Mercenary, Mercenary Soldier, Mercenary Officer) in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you most and we will soon have Mercenary in your hands.\nThe Field Commander's Pack\nProspective recruits will be able to purchase a special orientation pack to get them grounded in mercenary life and on their way to earning a fortune - and now you can too, simply by choosing to pledge at the Mercenary Officer level!\nIn the Field Commander's Pack, you will find:\nA pad of blank Mercenary Unit Roster sheets, ready for your new unit\nSix Mercenary pencils, perfect for your Travellers\nOne Mercenary Officer's pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Enemy Vehicle Recognition Pack, 24 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the most dangerous vehicles you are likely to meet on the battlefield - and should be on your unit's shopping list\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Mercenary dice\nThe Premium Weapons Guide, a 16 page addition to the Field Catalogue featuring items made available only to the finest of mercenary units\nAll in an official and attractive presentation pack (if you are a Traveller collector, you will not want to miss this one!)\n\nStretch Goals\nWe have lots planned for your Mercenary campaign and, with your kind help and support, we hope we can give you a lot more bang for your pledge!\n\n\n\n\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill the gaps in their collections. The Traveller range is growing quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for Mercenary to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level. After the Kickstarter is complete, you will receive a survey asking you to confirm which packages you added, and we will send you these books within the next four weeks, along with their PDFs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have always delivered on our Kickstarter projects and if you were to ask one of our previous backers of previous Traveller projects such as The Great Rift, the Element Class Cruiser Blueprints or Deepnight Revelation, we believe you would hear that the quality of our Kickstarter projects is always worth it, and you tend to end up with more than you originally pledged for!\n\nThat said, we have taken steps to ensure Mercenary does not overrun its projected completion date.\n\nFor a start, much of the work has already been done on the box set, and the first book has already entered the art and layout process - you can freely download what has been completed thus far for free using the link in the description above.\n\nSecond, we have brought in fan favourite Martin J Dougherty, to pen the set.

Players take the role of fantasy heroes seeking adventure, fame, and fortune in the world of Golarion. \nWhat's Savage Worlds?\nSavage Worlds is a versatile roleplaying game system, first published in 2003 by Pinnacle Entertainment Group. Savage Worlds can be used with any genre or setting from four-color supers, to gritty sci-fi, to gothic horror, to high fantasy.\nWhat's an Adventure Path?\nAdventure Paths are in-depth stories for the Pathfinder RPG that tell an epic tale over a series of connected adventures. Players will see their characters grow in power from lowly beginnings until they become mighty heroes. \nSo why convert these Adventure Paths to Savage Worlds? \nSimply put, because we love them. Pathfinder fits right into the types of worlds we love to play in, like the Weird Wild West of Deadlands, college horror and hijinks in East Texas University, the monstrous Victorian pulp world of Rippers, the far-flung future of The Last Parsec, the comic-strip heroism of Flash Gordon, or any of the other settings we\u2019re known for.\nSo why not give Savage Worlds fans official rules to stop the insidious Skinsaw cult in Rise of the Runelords, defeat Baba Yaga in Reign of Winter, or explore the scorching deserts of Osiron in Mummy\u2019s Mask? \nThat was our proposition, and we feel honored our Paizo friends have trusted us to re-present their original work for our system. It\u2019s truly an honor and a privilege, and one of the greatest projects we\u2019ve ever worked on.\nWhat are some of the Big Rule Changes from regular Savage Worlds?\nFirst, Savage Pathfinder has Class Edges that give you one or more special abilities that balance out to the traditional Edge cost. Each one is unique and reinforces the class-based tropes of Pathfinder. And of course these serve as Requirements for higher Rank Edges that reflect Pathfinder's high-level abilities.\nSavage Pathfinder also uses our dynamic, flexible power system. Certain Arcane Backgrounds have features that reflect the nuances of Pathfinder magic. For example, sorcerers and wizards have Armor Limitations that inflict penalties on their arcane skills if they wear inhibiting armor, and the rules for resting and recovering Power Points have been tweaked to best reflect the world of Golarion.\nWe've also added new powers and advanced Power Modifiers modeled (but adjusted) from the \"Exalted Powers\" created for Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds. These allow your bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard to fully realize their power at higher Ranks!\n If you want to pick and choose from the items in the boxed set, or if you require duplicates of particular pieces for your players, you will be able to select from the following Add-Ons once the pledge manager opens at the end of the campaign.    \nAdventurers love loot! As the campaign progresses, we'll add \"Stretch Goals\" to make your pledge even greater.

The more you share, the more extras we all get! (Hey, we play too! A LOT!)\nRemember that we give all backers the VTT Basics for free (our first Stretch Goal).\nRemember that we give all backers the VTT Basics for free (our first Stretch Goal).\nRemember that we give all backers the VTT Basics for free (our first Stretch Goal).\nWow! You're gonna need a Bag of Holding for all these INCREDIBLE rewards you've helped us unlock! Thanks, Pathfinders! We'll be seeing you soon!\n It's hard for a small company like ours to get the word out about our game and our worlds. If you care to champion the cause, you can do so using the following channels.\nPathfinder for Savage Worlds is written and in playtesting at the time of this writing (Feb 2021). Your support allows us to create the extras and to help boost the signal to other fans\u2014by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours.\nWe deliver the first PDF a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website and DriveThruRPG.com.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you to include additional Pinnacle products with your order. Want to add an additional copy of the Savage Worlds rules, Deadlands: The Weird West, or Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds? Those will all be available. \nWe'll charge for shipping there in the pledge manager. \nBelow is a table estimating how much the shipping will be. We know this is a painful part of the process, so our goal is to fill each reward level with an amazing amount of high-quality books and accessories which will more than make up for these additional costs (especially once we finalize any additional Stretch Goals!).\nWe also pay for some of the shipping costs ourselves to keep the overall rates as low as possible. No matter what happens between now and the time the packages ship, we won't charge you any more than what's listed below.\nClick to see as larger image. Shipping will be collected after the Kickstarter.\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in Italy is 4%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping.\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your friends pledge for your whole adventuring party, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package, while you pledge for a digital reward tier. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail Info@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com.\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead our \"Retailers Benefit in the Pathfinder for Savage Worlds Kickstarter\" newsletter here for details on how to participate in this project!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter products before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle products with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time). Customers of Savage Retailers may request complimentary PDFs of books purchased by emailing Info@peginc.com.\nAny Questions? Email Pinnacle customer service at Info@peginc.com\n But...How Does Pathfinder for Savage Worlds Play?\nCheck out these playtests which aired during the Kickstarter.  First we have 5 episodes of our Premiere Playtest for Hollow's Last Hope!\nBefore that, we aired the \"PEG Playtest\" with GM and co-developer Karl Keesler:\nWe also previewed the Quick Chase Deck (still playtesting, folks...)during the Kickstarter!\nAnd talked with Paizo Inc.'s Jason Bulmahn:\nWe brought all the GMs together who ran Hollow's Last Hope to playtest Savage Pathfinder:\nAnd we had the cool opportunity to talk game design with Pathfinder: Kingmaker developers Owlcat Games!\nPlus other Q&A's and discussion about design. Enjoy!\nRemember that PEG Playtest Karl Keesler ran? Here's the first version, which meant further playtesting...\nAnd the LAST Chance Q&A, with pretty much all of Pinnacle on screen!

They wander our roads and cities, mingling with the teeming masses of humanity. Characters in Scion Second Edition begin as humans touched by fate, heirs to great powers and incredible destinies. In the core setting for Scion, characters discover they are the children of Gods, inheriting mantles, accomplishing great deeds, and deciding their own destinies. It\u2019s a game about divinity and humanity, and everything in between \u2014 and now, with these two expansions, everything beyond as well. Scion: Dragon and Scion: Masks of the Mythos open new pathways, new origins, and new secrets for Scion Second Edition.\nBut which of these two pathways will you wander down?\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nPerhaps you aren't the descendant of an ancient deity, but instead have been chosen by a Dragon. The myths about Dragons are true, but not the whole truth. Dragons went into hiding after too many of their numbers were slain for their deeds, and have waited for centuries until they could reclaim The World as their own. They blame the Gods and Titans, along with their worshippers, for their downfall. And they will gain power from the Titanomachy between God and Titan, but from the shadows, without showing their claws.\nYou carry inside you a dragon, something you don\u2019t fully understand, but need to in order to control. To claim your heritage, you must seek out clues to the truth, embrace the memory your draconic ancestor bestows upon you, and perform missions you might not understand. You are tasked to be the Dragon\u2019s operative in The World, but you set your own destiny.\nDiscover your heritage, embrace the dragon, and claim your inheritance.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nOr perhaps you've been touched by something different, something alien and ancient. The Mythos is older than humanity, Gods, and Titans, with an unknowable otherness that can shatter them all. This slumbering horror lurks in the shadows, carrying out its cold machinations with little regard for those beneath it until it requires pawns.\nThose that touch the Mythos are forever awakened. The World explodes into full view for them, empowered by these alien beings that alter their very essence, the ability to break Fate and leave the walls of reality weaker in their wake. These human embodiments of the Mythos are not good or evil; such easily definable morality is for lesser beings.\nWhat does one do when their power comes with a cost?\nScion: Masks of the Mythos and Scion: Dragon are two new entries in the Scion Second Edition RPG line, building on Scion: Origin and Scion: Hero. Each of these books adds entirely new elements to the setting, and explores new territory within the World.\nFind your true destiny. Live these secret myths. Embrace your new fate.\nCover design subject to change.\nScion: Dragon builds on the foundation of Scion: Origin, taking the game to the in-between spaces kept dark as the bright light of divinity shines elsewhere. It is a game about playing both sides against the middle as you desperately try to find a foothold in the World, all the while discovering who you are and what you want.\nPlay as long-lost descendants of Dragons, called Heirs, who act as agents and operatives enacting their ancestors\u2019 will as they delve into draconic history and memory. The World knows Dragons primarily through the mythology told to them by pantheons. Some of this is true; some is what Dragons would call propaganda. An Heir may descend from Dragons, but she knows just as little about dragon kind as any other mortal. The truth about Dragons is steeped in mystery, and they prefer it that way. Better to keep hidden than to risk getting wrapped up in the Fate of the pantheons. Better to wait until the Gods and Titans wear one another down than to join the fight directly. Better to amass power for a decisive strike than to play your hand too soon. As the Heir becomes more embroiled in her Dragon patron\u2019s schemes, she learns more of the truth, and must choose if she wants to be a player in their game, or forge her own path.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nScion: Dragon details the stories of Heirs, those chosen by Dragons to act within The World as their agents. It is the story of discovering history, subverting enemies, and espionage. Your Draconic patron seeks to embroil you in millennia old plots and ancient grudges as shadowy manipulators. All the while, you must learn their secrets, and either embrace the Dragon\u2019s goals for you or make your own.\nThe Scion: Dragon is a standalone game in the World of Scion, and is meant for use with Scion: Origin. Inside, you will find:\nCharacter creation system for Heirs; those chosen by Dragons to enact their plots in The World.\nKnacks, Spells, and all the draconic magic wielded by Heirs, powered by the Storypath System.\nSix Flights: Draq, Joka, Lindwurm, Long, Naga, and Serpent Dragons, all suitable for patronage of your Heirs.\nInformation about The World from the Dragon\u2019s perspective, complete with plots and hooks to get your characters deep into draconic intrigue.\nCover design subject to change.\nMasks of the Mythos is a sourcebook for Scion: Origin and Scion: Hero. While the majority of Scion focuses on real-world mythologies and religions, Masks of the Mythos is a step off that path into a more fictitious World. The material presented here is as canonical to an ongoing Scion campaign as every individual Storyguide and group wish it to be.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nThe book includes the information needed to create Mythos Scions and dive into the dread-soaked cursed towns that thrive under the insidious nature of the Mythos. It\u2019s possible for Scions of other deities to fall under the sway of the Mythos and serve their alien needs. The threats and encounters in this book have been balanced to challenge those seeking Demigod-hood, and the Mythos Scions themselves seeking transcendence.\nSome highlights of Masks of the Mythos include:\nAn entire new pantheon: the Mythos\nA trove of new Callings and relics\nExpanded investigation rules\nA detailed tour of the Miskatonic Hollow, including Arkham and Innsmouth\nAn introductory scenario for a new band of Scions\nThe goal of this project is a little different than previous Onyx Path kickstarter campaigns. Instead of funding the development of a single core book or supplement, this campaign is designed to develop two new divergent projects at the same time. Both books are designed to take the Scion Second Edition roleplaying game in new directions and explore previously uncharted areas. With this campaign, we're hoping to fund the development and production of Scion: Masks of the Mythos and Scion: Dragon and open up even more storytelling possibilities in the World of Scion. You can choose a reward tier that focuses on either of these books (or both!), but all support will go towards both projects, which will be worked on in tandem. \nYour support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for these books. We hope to not only deliver beautiful books to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run for each to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the forgotten world of Scion: Dragon and the alien world of Scion: Masks of the Mythos, possibly creating additional content in the form of multi-part Companion books, including additional antagonists and challenges, expanding pantheons, new dragon Flights, setting and system expansions, and more. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore these thrilling worlds.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to new worlds; new settings for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of expanding this game into new directions \u2014 and like our protagonists, forging our destinies. When you back this project, you join our pantheon as we create our story together.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($35,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nWith two different main rewards, and different options for adding Scion Second Edition core books to your list of rewards, the pledge options can become quite complicated. To try to help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core rewards and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nClick to load a PDF of the Reward Tier Chart\nPick Your Path: Are you primarily interested in the hidden history of Scion: Dragon, and looking to uncover this secret third faction stuck in the middle of the war between Titans and Gods? Are you ready to embrace the unknown and alien, using Scion: Masks of the Mythos to add a bizarre new pantheon to your game? Or are you hoping to add both new options to your Scion Second Edition game, opening new paths for your story to explore?\nThe Reward Tier Chart divides the rewards by path. Check out the DRAGON pledge tiers if you're only interested in Scion: Dragon. Look at the MYTHOS pledge tiers if you only want Scion: Masks of the Mythos. Or follow the DUAL PATH pledge tiers if you want both books included in your rewards list.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nDecide Your Destiny: do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version, or go all in with the hardcover rulebook? Are you interested in the new book created by this campaign, or looking to add on the relevant Scion Second Edition core book(s) as well? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nImmortalize Yourself: A few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including an option to act as a Art Model, as well as a chance to name an NPC included in a supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions and the FAQs at the bottom of this page for more details.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nMerchant Options: We love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Scion Second Edition new books campaign, we have created two special Reward Tiers just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the MYTHOS + DRAGON RETAIL Reward Tier level will get 5 copies each of the Scion: Masks of the Mythos and Scion: Dragon hardcover books (as well as the PDF versions) at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store. Similarly, any retailer who pledges at the mighty MYTHOS + DRAGON RETAIL SUITE Reward Tier level will get 5 copies of both books (Dragon, Masks of the Mythos), as well as 5 copies of the related Scion Second Edition rulebooks (Origin, Hero).\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscripts for Scion: Dragon and Scion: Masks of the Mythos. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nSCION: DRAGON BACKER PDF VERSION - The digital version of Scion: Dragon, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. \nSCION: MASKS OF THE MYTHOS BACKER PDF VERSION - The digital version of Scion: Dragon, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. \nBACKER PDF VERSIONS - Kickstarter backers will receive a redemption links for an early versions of these books, before they go on sale to the public. These initial \"Backer Versions\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When they have been updated to the final versions, they will be automatically added to your DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nSCION: DRAGON HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of this book. \nSCION: MASKS OF THE MYTHOS HARDCOVER VERSION - The other main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of this book. \nHARDCOVER BOOKS: Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover versions also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nSCION: ORIGIN PDF and HARDCOVER - Scion is a game about Gods and humanity, and everything in between. It\u2019s a game about mythic Deeds and the reasons people talk about those mythic Deeds. Scion: Origin details the Scions when they\u2019re still (mostly) human, before the Visitation that introduces them to the divine World \u2014 they\u2019re exceptional humans, perhaps, blessed with luck and skill or cursed with ill fortune and strange trials in their lives, but humans nonetheless.\nSCION: HERO PDF and HARDCOVER - Scion: Hero details the children of the Gods when they have been touched by the divine, awakening to the miraculous power their parents wield. But this great power comes with grave responsibility. The Scions must negotiate both the human World and the divine one, acting as intermediaries and shielding the worshippers of their parents from harm. Can they struggle to fulfill their Fate and still remain tied to what they care for most? Note this is not a stand-alone rulebook. Scion: Origin has the necessary core rules for the game.\nSCION SECOND EDITION REFERENCE SCREEN - A sturdy three-panel screen featuring beautiful art from Scion 2nd Edition on the outer side, and on the inside there's a selection of charts and other info to make referencing a little bit easier.  Limited stock remaining from the first Scion Second Edition kickstarter campaign.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nOPTIONAL DISCOUNTED PoD VERSION \u2013  For this Scion: Dragon and Scion: Masks of the Mythos campaign, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG.com\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy of the PDF books included in your list of rewards directly from their PoD partners at discounted cost (as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping; this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the books have gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the books from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply include the necessary Add On amount indicated to the Bonus Support portion of your Pledge \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\n PHYSICAL REWARDS \nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional books, etc.) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of either the Scion: Dragon or Scion: Masks of the Mythos (Reward Tiers of $50+).

Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list for backers of the relevant Stretch Goal path. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\n[ALL BACKERS] At $146,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Dragon VTT Tokens \u2013 Digital assets for the signature characters and key antagonists from Scion: Dragon will be created and added to the rewards list for all backers.\n[DRAGON] At $152,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Dragon Companion \u2013 Spells and Transformations \u2013 Expanded rules for spells and transformations will be added to the Scion: Dragon Companion PDF.\n[MYTHOS] At $158,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Masks of the Mythos Companion \u2013 Additional Mythos Creatures \u2013 A trio of unusual antagonists will be created and detailed in the Scion: Masks of the Mythos Companion PDF.\n[ALL BACKERS] At $161,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Masks of the Mythos VTT Tokens \u2013 Digital assets for the signature characters and key antagonists from Scion: Masks of the Mythos will be created and added to the rewards list for all backers.\n[MYTHOS] At $167,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Masks of the Mythos Companion - Demigod Tier Play \u2013  A section on playing Scions of the Mythos at Demigod level, and enemies to oppose Scions of Demigod tiers, such as Dagon and Masks of the Old Ones, will be created and added to the Scion: Masks of the Mythos Companion PDF.\n [DRAGON] At $173,000 funding \u2013 Scion: Dragon Scenario \u2013 A new scenario for Scion: Dragon will be created added to the Scion: Dragon Companion PDF.\n\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\nWhen you pledge to a reward tier that includes a physical item (the Scion: Dragon or Scion: Masks of the Mythos hardcover book), Kickstarter will automatically calculate additional shipping costs based on your location.\nUnfortunately, international shipping has become increasing expensive and is often prohibitive to non-US backers. Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at $30+ reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nWait and buy the hardcover book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nPledge to the campaign at the Scion Supporter reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.\nContact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill, and then encourage them to back at one of the the Retailer Tiers for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nArtwork from Scion: Dragon\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nArtwork from Scion: Masks of the Mythos\n\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed nearly 50 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Scion: Dragon and Scion: Masks of the Mythos is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support":

Your support helps us create the additional materials we think will add to the entire Deadlands experience!\nArchetype Cards\nOur Archetype Cards allow players to jump into Blood Drive or any other Deadlands game quickly.

They come with Booster Rewards built-in rather than Stretch Goals. We're definitely going to print them on our own no matter what and want you to know that up front, but are asking for your backing so we can order the right amount and most importantly, create the extras that add to the entire experience for all of us\u2014like maps, pawns, and additional Archetype Cards. We play too, and we want all these goodies as much as we hope you do!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nPinnacle is very fortunate and grateful to have a loyal and established group of friends and fans who enjoy playing our games, but it's sometimes very hard to get our products to you. We love game stores and sell to them through our fulfillment partners at Studio2 and through traditional distribution, but we also know many of you don't have a store in your neighborhood, or your local store just doesn't carry our games.\nFor those that do, great! Retailers who want in on our Kickstarters get discounted versions of the rewards including Stretch Goals for them and their customers. If you're a retailer, just sign up to our newsletter for all the details. (And gamers, please feel free to let your local store know!) Retailers also get their rewards when backer orders go out, usually several weeks before they show up in the traditional distribution chain.\nIn sum...\nIf you want Blood Drive and the extras we're offering with it, back this Kickstarter Booster.\nIf you want Blood Drive but prefer to support your local store, GREAT! You can pledge for the Digital reward level here if you like, get the Booster Rewards, then order the print version of the book from your store later next year. (But be sure to tell them or they might not order it on their own!)\nDeadlands is the premier Weird Western setting. You can download the free Test Drive, here to see what it's all about.\nIf you missed the Deadlands: the Weird West Kickstarter, you can still get in on the action through the pledge manager, which is still open. Anything you add through that pledge manager will be delivered as soon as it arrives in our warehouse in early 2021.\nYou'll be able to add these items to your Blood Drive order in the Pledge Manager.\nYou can also add on our other Deadlands products once we launch the Blood Drive pledge manager (available sometime after this Kickstarter Booster closes and funds). There you'll be able to add on extras like the Deadlands core boxed set, pawns, the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign, town maps, Action Cards, Bennies, and more!\nSpread the word!\nIt's hard for a small company like ours to get the word out about our game and our worlds. If you care to help boost the signal, you can do so using the following channels. Much obliged, amigo!\nBlood Drive is written and in layout. Your support allows us to create the extras and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the book and cards a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website  first, then through DriveThruRPG.com.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. \nWe'll charge for shipping after the Kickstarter through the pledge manager, but below is a table estimating how much the shipping will be. It's possible these prices may go down as we continue to seek out different options, but we won't charge you any more than what's listed below.\n*Prices exclusive of VAT/GST, shown in USD. We will collect and pay customs in the pledge manager. USA backers pay no additional shipping on Add Ons!\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your friends pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail Info@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box, but the Book Only tier will likely ship in a padded envelope).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead our \"Welcome, Retailer!\" Newsletter here for the basics we recommend for your store!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter products before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle products with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time).

Opportunity arises when the aging bard Dradoki Bronzeleaf hires the party to escort him to the Broadreach Horizon. The perilous voyage takes the group through titanspawn infested lands, but should they survive, they arrive at the last bastion of uncorrupted wood in the Hornsaw Forest. There they meet the clans of the Broadreach elves and a century of hollow legionnaires dispatched to the Forest of Blood to offer aid and friendship.\nBut a dark shadow looms over the accursed wood. The necromancers of Glivid-Autel sew corruption and death throughout the Hornsaw Forest. Legionnaires, elves, and dwarves go missing. A horrific infection appears, seemingly targeting the legionnaires. The adventurers are called on to stand against these foul machinations that threaten peace, prosperity, and life itself across central Ghelspad. They may find allies in the Broadreach Horizon, the Gleaming Valley, and perhaps even the bloody canopies of the Hornsaw Forest, if they are brave enough to answer the call to adventure!\nDead Man\u2019s Rust is a mega-adventure for fifth edition fantasy, set in Onyx Path's Scarred Lands setting! This book contains:\nA complete campaign taking characters from level 1 to 10\nDetailed write-ups of four major locations in central Ghelspad: the Broadreach Horizon, The Gleaming Valley, the Hornsaw Forest, and the necromancer\u2019s stronghold of Glivid-Autel.\nNew playable options including races, subraces, and subclasses\nNew monsters, magic items, and more!\nThe Dead Man's Rust Kickstarter campaign is designed to enable Onyx Path to create a  hardcover setting supplement  that will sit proudly alongside your existing Scarred Lands 5th Edition books, including the Scarred Lands Player's Guide and the Scarred Lands Creature Collection. The book will be approximately 180 full-color pages featuring  evocative fantasy artwork. Exception funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including virtual tools to aid online play and possibly more character options and location details! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nDead Man's Rust provides a complete mega-campaign, with deadly new threats, interesting and lively locations, and many potential new allies and enemies. This book includes:\n Chapter One: Twilight of the Bard - In Leoni, an elderly dwarven bard asks for help travelling to the Broadreach Horizon, where he wants to spend his final days. The journey is dangerous, introduces suspicious enemies, and presents the potential to uncover a threat that can harm all of the Scarred Lands.\n Chapter Two: The Broadreach Horizon - Arriving at the Broadreach Horizon puts the heroes face to face with elusive dwarves and elf clans, with their own relationships to each other. Rewards await those who help the clans deal with some of their current challenges.\n Chapter Three: The Hornsaw Forest - The party ventures into the forest, seeking a missing squad of Hollow Legionnaires. They will face dangerous threats including titan-worshipping cults, wildlife that has been twisted by Mormo\u2019s blood, and titanspawn that make their home in the wretched woods. The investigation produces rusted remains of legionnaires, providing more questions than answers.\n Chapter Four: The Gleaming Valley - The adventurers deliver the rusted remains of the lost legionnaires to the Gleaming Valley. Investigation reveals that the fallen legionnaires died of a strong disease, originating from a True Ritual. As plans are formed to combat this disease, Glivid-Autel mounts a siege on Citadel, meaning to spread Legionnaires\u2019 Rust deeper into the lands of the hollow knights and hollow legionnaires.\n Chapter Five: Glivid-Autel - The party must infiltrate Glivid-Autel and get inside the Sanctum of Lucian Daine, the foul necromancer known as the Gray Messiah. There they must recover the secrets of Legionnaires\u2019 Rust without joining the necromancer\u2019s undead servants.\n Chapter Six: Peace in the Valley - With the notes on Legionnaires\u2019 Rust secured the party must return to the Golden Citadel and help develop a cure, while repelling attackers from Glivid-Autel.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Scarred Lands: Dead Man's Rust that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of the Scarred Lands, possibly creating additional content in the form of digital assets, scenarios, creatures, and other game options. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore this thrilling world.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world \u2014 and like our fantasy characters, this goal gives us a common cause. When you back this project, you join our party as we create our story together.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($15,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core rewards and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nClick to load a PDF version of this chart\nPick A Path: do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version, or go all in with the hardcover book? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Centurion of the Valley tier, which offers 2 copies of the book (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Dead Man's Rust campaign, we have created two special Reward Tiers just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Merchant Retailer Reward Tier level will get 5 copies of the Dead Man's Rust hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions) at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store. Similarly, any retail who pledges at the epic Mercantile Master Retailer Reward Tier will get 5 copies of each of the three Scarred Lands 5th Edition hardcover rulebooks (Scarred Lands Player's Guide, Creature Collection, and Dead Man's Rust).\nSeveral Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from the ability to name an NPC included in the Dead Man's Rust adventure, an option to act as an interior illustration Art Model, as well as a chance to participate in an online Scarred Lands game session! We've even got a few slots that include will have Onyx Path's own Scarred Lands developer, Travis Legge, act as a coach, helping you develop, write, and release a supplement as part of the Slarecian Vault Community Content program. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions and the FAQs at the bottom of this page for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Dead Man's Rust. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nSCARRED LANDS: DEAD MAN'S RUST PDF VERSION - The digital version of Dead Man's Rust, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive a redemption link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nSCARRED LANDS: DEAD MAN'S RUST HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover version of this book. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nSCARRED LANDS 5E PLAYER'S GUIDE - Available as an Add On reward, the Scarred Lands Player's Guide provides you with all of the basic information you'll need to run a campaign on Ghelspad, the most populous continent of Scarn. Including historical and religious details, class and culture game information, character archetypes and backgrounds, new equipment and enchantments, this book can take your Fifth Edition fantasy game into bold new directions.\nSCARRED LANDS 5E CREATURE COLLECTION - Available as an Add On reward, the Scarred Lands Creature Collection presents more than 175 creatures from the Scarred Lands setting, though they can easily enhance any 5E setting or campaign. Also featuring a host of tools to help you find the perfect monster for any encounter you\u2019re building, appendices of battle maps, encounter seeds and a Challenge Rating index.\nOPTIONAL DISCOUNTED PoD VERSION \u2013  For Dead Man's Rust, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG.com\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at a discounted cost plus shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. On the desktop, you can select Add Ons after you've chosen your pledge tier. If using the Kickstarter mobile app, simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nThe Scarred Lands 5E Supplement PDF bundle includes Wise & The Wicked, The Blood Sea, and the Spiragos Saga!\n\n PHYSICAL REWARDS \nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional books, etc.) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of Dead Man's Rust (Reward Tiers of $55+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when Dead Man's Rust becomes available.\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\nUNLOCKED! - At $16,000 in funding \u2013 VTT Tokens & Map Pack: Journey to Broadreach Horizon \u2013 Digital assets will be created to support online play for 1-2 encounters in Dead Man\u2019s Rust, including location maps and necessary character and creature tokens.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at Hollow Knight reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nWait and buy the hardcover book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nPledge to the campaign at the  Adventurer reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.\nContact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill, and then encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Merchant or Mercantile Master) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed nearly 50 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Dead Man's Rust is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects before the estimate, and some of our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive access to the Backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2021"}], "stat": ["27 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Hollow Legionnaire", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Dead Man's Rust.\nINCLUDES:\nDead Man's Rust PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2022"}], "stat": ["157 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Hollow Knight", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Dead Man's Rust.\nINCLUDES:\nDead Man's Rust PDF\nDiscounted Print-on-Demand option: Dead Man's Rust\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2022"}], "stat": ["58 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Hero of the Hornsaw", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover version of Dead Man's Rust.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nDead Man's Rust Hardcover Book\nDead Man's Rust PDF\nDiscounted Print-on-Demand option: Dead Man's Rust\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2023"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["224 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Centurion of the Valley", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive TWO (2) copies of the PDF and the hardcover version of Dead Man's Rust.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Dead Man's Rust Hardcover Book\n2\u00d7 Dead Man's Rust PDF\nDiscounted Print-on-Demand option: Dead Man's Rust\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2023"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 155 or more", "title": "Merchant **Retail Reward Tier**", "descp": "** For Qualified Retailers Only ** Contact RichT@theonyxpath.com to confirm your retailer status.\nAs thanks for your support, you'll receive FIVE (5) copies of the PDF and FIVE (5) copies of the hardcover version of Dead Man's Rust.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Dead Man's Rust Hardcover Book\n5\u00d7 Dead Man's Rust PDF\nDiscounted Print-on-Demand option: Dead Man's Rust\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates\nParticipation in Post-Campaign Pledge Manager", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2023"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "Scribe of Legend", "descp": "As a special reward, you will submit a name that will be used for a Non-player Character (NPC) which will be incorporated into the Scarred Lands setting (via supplemental PDF if necessary).

Do not read its contents. Walk away, live your simple life, and keep these creatures of darkness in the shadows where they belong.\nOpening your eyes to this horrible world, where demons possess dolls, the undead stalk the night, the Devil walks among us, and mummies march from their tombs, is an act of incredible bravery, or perhaps, complete foolishness. Turn away now, before it\u2019s too late\u2026\nNo? Well, in that case, I introduce you to a little game we can play, called \nThey Came from Beyond the Grave! is a dramatic, hammy, and horrifying tabletop roleplaying game encompassing the shock, terror, eroticism, and humor of 1970s horror. This game allows you to play with all the magnificent content from the movies of Hammer, Amicus, and Roger Corman, and promises fun and thrills of the horror movie genre!\nIn They Came from Beyond the Grave! you play humans faced with the horrors of the supernatural. You\u2019ll find yourself pitted against vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and constructed critters, along with demons, slashers, and THE DEVIL HIMSELF. Adventures range from the one-shot exploration of a haunted house, to the multi-era play across the 19th century and 1970s.\nArtwork by Ken Meyer Jr.\nThey Came from Beyond the Grave! contains a mix of serious threat, unmitigated ham, and nonsensical farce. We never tell you what is amusing and what is not, but we do provide you with the tools to make a seriously fun game incorporating all the elements of 1970s horror movies. This game provides rules for funny quips and amusing cinematics for incorporation in a story, along with dozens of special powers and story devices.\nThey Came from Beyond the Grave! uses the Storypath System, provided in full in the pages of this book!\nThis They Came from Beyond the Grave!  Kickstarter campaign is designed to enable Onyx Path to create a hardcover rulebook, a print-and-play PDF of Quip and Cinematic cards, and a Director screen to aid play. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including more scenarios and additional threats! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nDesign not final, still in progress.\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover rulebook with a dynamic cover and full-color interior art. We estimate the book will be more than 200+ pages and will be traditionally printed on high quality paper stock. In addition, we want to create a print-and-play PDF with more than 120 Quip and Cinematic cards to use in-game.\nArtwork by Brian Leblanc\n Chapter One: Archetypes - This is where you\u2019ll meet this game\u2019s playable Archetypes. The Dupe, the Hunter, the the Mystic, the Professor, and the Raconteur each occupy different roles popular in the horror movies listed previously.\n Chapter Two: Character Creation - If you\u2019ve chosen the Archetype that appeals to you and already have the kernel of a character concept in mind, here\u2019s where you go to flesh that character out in full.\n Chapter Three: Skills and Attributes - Your selection of abilities is an important, defining aspect of your character, which is why Skills and Attributes get their own chapter where they\u2019re all detailed for your pleasure.\n Chapter Four: System - The Director will want to read this chapter to get a handle on how to run and play They Came from Beyond the Grave! This chapter breaks down the basics of dice rolling all the way through to Complications on actions, Conditions for characters, and scenes involving clue-solving, drama, and death. The players should scan through this chapter after creating characters just to discover the basics.\n Chapter Five: Cinematic Powers - Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll find some of the best powers and tools for your horror games. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to insert a missing reel to escape peril, produce copious amounts of blood to fake your own death, score points for coming up with a cutting one-liner at just the right moment, or explode with amazing Stunts when you succeed spectacularly, this is going to be a fun read.\n Chapter Six: Monsters - What is a horror movie without a monster? Oh, some of them are human and fragile enough, but this chapter contains everything from Stalking Killers to Dracula, and Possessed Dolls to Abaddon, the Locust King. You\u2019ll find no shortage of enemies to incorporate into stories and base entire plots around right here.\n Chapter Seven: The Director\u2019s Chair - All the advice an aspiring Director could need to run a game to hit a certain tone or mood, including a dissection of the different kinds of horror movies you might wish to emulate. This chapter goes into full detail of what a Director should and shouldn\u2019t do to really get that 1970s horror movie feel across.\n Chapter Eight: This Horrible World - Maybe this is your first RPG, or perhaps you\u2019re struggling to come up with sets, events, and plots for your game of They Came from Beyond the Grave! Whatever the case, this chapter contains everything you need to start the flow of ideas. Both the 1970s and the 19th century, as they appear in films, are detailed lovingly for your use.\n Chapter Nine: Scenarios - Two full scenarios, one involving the machinations of THE DEVIL HIMSELF, another embracing the characters, stories, and mysteries of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s trove of stories, each ready to run directly from the book.\n Appendix One - Here we have the list of Quips present in the Cinematic Powers chapter, but easily locatable near the back of the book. This appendix is especially useful for players lacking a deck of Quip cards.\n Appendix Two - Here you\u2019ll find a helpful list of Stunts and Cinematics, stating their names and costs.\nArtwork by Aaron Riley\nThey Came from Beyond the Grave! is powered by Onyx Path's Storypath system, and includes all the rules you need to play as a brave (or foolhardy) hero dealing with supernatural threats, including rules for creating characters with a mix of options to customize your Archetype. It also has ready-to-play scenarios, along with information on the cinematic version of the 19th century and 1970s that you can incorporate into your game with a new spooky atmosphere. And, finally, dozens of antagonists, including a chaotic assembly of horrific haunts that create a host of locations and events for players and Directors to explore.\nThe Storypath system is Onyx Path's rules set designed specifically to allow the sort of rules scaling necessary to seamlessly enable players to play ordinary people as well as mystics and monster hunters.\nThe basics of the Storypath system should be familiar to anyone who has played many other Onyx Path games of action-adventure or heroic exploits, as it is a 10-sided dice pool system, where in order to resolve an action you basically roll a number of dice equal to the character's Skill + Attribute and must roll an 8 or better a certain number of times in order to succeed in the action.\nThat is the very basic resolution system, but we expand on that to further enhance how your gaming group can build their stories. Failing to hit your number of successes, or having more successes than your required amount, are built-in options in the rules. Here is a handy graphic that illustrates what we mean:\nTo further explain the basics of the Storypath system, here is a small PDF download that goes into more detail: SYSTEM PREVIEW PDF.\nHere's a video of THEY CAME from BEYOND the GRAVE! in action...\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of They Came from Beyond the Grave! that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of They Came from Beyond the Grave!, possibly creating additional content in the form of scenarios, threats, and ready-made characters. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore this thrilling world.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world \u2014 and like our protagonists, this mission binds us with common purpose. When you back this project, you join our amazing cast of characters as we create our adventure together.\nArtwork by Brian Leblanc\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($20,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick this image to summon forth a larger version of this chart... from places beyond!\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nKey Decision: do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version, or go all in with the hardcover rulebook? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nArtwork by Luis Sanz\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Evil Twins Reward Tier, which offer copies of the rulebook (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this They Came from Beyond the Grave! campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (\"Dark House of Blood and Shadows\") will get 5 copies of the hardcover rulebook (as well as the PDF versions) at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nArtwork by Brian Leblanc\nSeveral Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a Signed Book Insert (autographed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle), an option to act as a Art Model, as well as a chance to name an NPC included in the They Came from Beyond the Grave!  rulebook or a possible supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for They Came from Beyond the Grave!

Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For They Came from Beyond the Grave!, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG.com\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nArtwork by Aaron Riley\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at The Physical Manifestation of Suffering reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nWait and buy the hardcover book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nPledge to the campaign at the The Living Dead reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.\nContact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill, and then encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Dark House of Blood and Shadows) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nArtwork by Luis Sanz\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nArtwork by Aaron Riley\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for They Came from Beyond the Grave! is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "The Living Dead", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["38 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Gremlin in the Walls", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive a PDF copy of They Came from Beyond the Grave!\nINCLUDES:\nThey Came from Beyond the Grave!

Despite societal backlash and anti-Chinese laws, they have turned a profit and their quality of life has recently improved.\nNight, however, brings a new terror.\nPlayers take on the roles of members of the Chinese family (mostly from Guangdong province), spanning three generations, who face threats of jiangshi (hopping vampires) at night and racism by day. It has players balancing the responsibility of maintaining their family business with protecting themselves and their community from the dreaded Jiangshi. This is primarily a game about storytelling. Combat is limited, but horror, drama and sometimes comedy are the primary vehicles for driving the game forward.\nJiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall is a tabletop roleplaying game which combines elements of RPGs with those of traditional board games. The game can be played as a \"mini-series\" or a one-shot.\nEach game takes place over a number of days (usually five), alternating between day and night scenes where the roleplaying scenes take place.  Day and night have different threats - in the daytime, the restaurant may experience racism or gang violence, while in the night time, Jiangshi are seeking warm bodies. During the day characters complete assigned restaurant tasks in order to keep the family business running. \nEvery morning, the Game Moderator deals out a tableau of Restaurant cards that the family will need to complete before diners start to arrive. Each Restaurant card needs from 1 hour to 3 hours to complete. Usually, the oldest member of the family takes charge and starts delegating the tasks to specific players. Each player uses their Resilience slots to complete tasks, indicated by the time and energy they have available to do it.\nOnce the tasks have been completed to the best of the family\u2019s abilities, the GM takes any Restaurant cards that were left undone and places them on the central Restaurant board, rotating them such that the consequences face the players and cover the restaurant\u2019s slots.\nRestaurant Board\nPrior to starting the morning scenes, the first thing each character must do is see how they\u2019re feeling from the trials and tribulations of the previous day. Each player rolls 1D4 and receives that many Mung cards from the GM which represent the dreams and nightmares of the characters. \nSome of the Mung cards are in color which represent good dreams. Other Mung are in black and white, which represents bad dreams. When a player receives a bad Mung card, they place it in one of the card slots on their Character sheet, covering a trait (Item, Skill, Facet, etc.), in numerical order. While covered, a trait cannot be used. To rid themselves of a bad Mung, a character needs to talk about the bad Mung card with another player character during the afternoon or evening scenes. Once they\u2019ve talked about it, they can discard the card.\nArtwork by Sadia Bies\nAfter receiving their Mung cards, players take turns explaining their dreams to each other and the GM. \nDescribe the dream or nightmare based on the image on the cards\nWhat are these visions like and what do they mean, if anything?\nOn subsequent mornings, any remaining Mung cards from previous rounds are kept as recurring nightmares that continue to plague the player character. They will roll the 1D4 as usual for more Mung cards, but instead of adding that number of cards to their character sheet, the result indicates the maximum number of Mung cards that the player character has to deal with this day.\nCharacter Sheet\nThe Character Sheet has several details about the player character that a player can fill out. During the game, Resilience slots may get covered up by Mung cards or Jiangshi cards. A character takes a Jiangshi card when they take stress or physical damage. When a Resilience slot gets covered by a Jiangshi card or a Mung card, that detail about the PC gets removed from play until they are healed. If a PC gets a Jiangshi card on a slot that already has a Mung card, they will remove the Mung card and replace it with the new Jiangshi card.\nOnce they have all 8 slots filled with Jiangshi cards, the player will then become a Jiangshi and they would flip over all the Jiangshi cards to reveal their new Skills. Though this fate can be terrifying, these cards can be healed and removed through game play. \nArtwork by Steven Wu\nPlayers can create Spirit Papers by taking a slip of paper and writing a short phrase or sentence on it that captures how the family of characters stays strong and together. Spirit Papers can only be used once during the night time phases.\nThe GM must count to ten in secret while the family is thinking of their word or sentence. If the time expires and the family has not yet agreed upon what to write on the Spirit Paper, the Spirit Paper will not work.\nIf the Spirit Paper works (i.e. a meaningful phrase or sentence was written with the 10-second time limit), the Jiangshi has been immobilized and players can move onto healing their family member or evading the Jiangshi they\u2019re faced with.\nThe whole group of non-GM players starts with a Family pool of six eight-sided dice (6D8) on the first day. As they progress through the days, player characters start feeling the stress the hauntings levy on the family, reducing their pool of dice available. These dice are used to overcome challenges, or to help council and care for the emotional health of the family, removing Mung cards from their character sheets.\nWhen a player is determining the outcome of a challenge they are engaged with, they roll all the dice in the Family pool at once and take the highest single value from one of the dice that they rolled as their outcome. Once per scene, a character can use one of their skills to reroll the dice pool to try to achieve a better result. \nTo determine the highest single value from a roll, complete the following steps:\n Clean house! Check for 4\u2019s in the pool: For every die that is showing a 4 in the pool, cancel out a die from the pool that is showing the highest value in the pool along with the die showing the 4, placing them back on the Day/Night Tracker.\n   Check for highest valued D8 in pool: The higher the die roll, the better the outcome.\nMing is rolling the Family pool to cook a feast for visiting dignitaries on Day 1. Ming\u2019s first roll results in the following: 1 2 2 3 4 4 - their highest result is a 2 as the two 4s cancel out the 3 and one of the 2s, respectively! Wanting to impress their guests, Ming uses their Cooking Skill and rerolls the Family pool, ending up with the following result: 1 3 3 4 7 8. Their highest result is 7 because the 8 is cancelled out by the 4. Wiping their brow, Ming's character breathes a sigh of relief and serves a gorgeous noodle dish to the members of the San Francisco city council.\nArtwork by Steven Wu\n\nThis game rewards player characters for failing, because it makes for a more interesting story! When a failure happens, the player who rolled receives an Individual die. The GM will also give player characters a die towards their Individual Pool when something occurs that makes their character happy or hopeful towards their Hopes and Dreams (labeled on their character sheet).\nWhile the main use of Individual dice is to assist other players, a player character may add any number of their Individual dice to their own Challenge rolls. If they do this, ALL of the dice they use in this way are returned to the GM once the Challenge roll is resolved.\nPlaying a Chinese Character\nThis game isn\u2019t just for Asian-Americans - this game can be played by anyone! Just remember that the topics deal with some very real history and politics (Jiangshi aside).\n\nHere are some tips on how to play:\nAvoid using accents\nAvoid exoticizing the culture - mysticism sometimes paints a culture in a very flat and two-dimensional way, so try to stay away from fortune cookies\nTreating the characters with respect is very important, so try to stay away from stereotypes. Not every Asian knows kung-fu, for example. In fact, Martial Arts is a Skill that only some player characters might have chosen for their character sheet.\nDo a little bit of research before playing. You don\u2019t have to have a degree in Asian studies, but just know what you\u2019re getting into.

With each one we have learned more about the industry and best practices. We are entering this project with the project almost completely designed, and developed, with only our final quantities left to nail down before sending to production. With the things we learned from previous projects, we are confident we can handle this project. Game and a Curry brings a wealth of knowledge to this partnership as well, and we know we'll be able to make this project as good as it can possibly be.\n\nQ: How much of the books are already finished?\nA: The game is pretty much complete and ready to send to production. The text potentially added by stretch goals is not written yet, but the writers will be able to complete their portions quickly. Many of these adventure stretch goals are to be digital goals, potentially collected into another volume later, and will have no impact on the delivery of the main product.\n\nQ: Have you produced all these items before?\nA: Between Wet Ink Games, Game and a Curry, and our production partners, all of these components have been made before and are well within our capabilities to produce using industry best practices.\n\nQ: What if shipping costs increase?\nA: Shipping costs are well beyond our control. We\u2019ve made our best projections and those shipping fees will be collected through Backer Kit. Once that money is in hand, we\u2019ll send the items, even it we end up eating a cost increase.

This manual will dive you into a dark world full of terror and despair. The Undeads come back from the afterlife, and eternal beings crave the nullification of reality. You will face ancient horrors, but you will also come to know superstition and occultism, and you will learn to follow the Moon as the only guide in this nocturnal world.\nIn this ruthless setting, players will play night explorers, resilient survivors who adapted to the Lunar Age, an era where the sun is dead, and life still endures only thanks to the last Primordial beings.\nEmbrace the darkness!\n\u201cThou wilt tip the balance since, on thy conduct, fate lies for what is left of us all. Be steady in front of darkness, do not let thy heart cede, and may the Moon lead thee through the silent lands of the continent.\u201d\nNightfell will be published both in Italian and English.\n If the project is successful, we will consider localization in other languages!\nNightfell takes place in the Known Lands of I\u00f9rmen, during the dark times known as The Lunar Age.\nThe World you are going to face is cold and desolate. There are few inhabited settlements, and most races are now extinct. Nights are gloomy, but days show no sun nor Moon and are even more terrifying. Life in these lands persists only thanks to the faint breath of life left to the Primes, deities who are intrinsic to nature and still stand uncorrupted by the dark beings who have breached the Material Plane.\nThe prophecy of the Fourth Truth is now fulfilled, and the dark dimension of \u00c8nferun now corrupts the World. Adventurers in the World of I\u00f9rmen are usually those embracing the power of darkness to use it against the creatures of the night, or rising as a source of faith and hope for survivors. They will face a hostile environment and try not to let themselves be overwhelmed by entities that will try to enslave their spirit. Eventually, they will have to find a way to counter the destruction of reality.\nYou will face ancient deadly forests and grimdark forgotten territories.\nDuring your night travels in the land of I\u00f9rmen, you will find a lot of abandoned villages from the previous Era.\nThe Moon, called Mirithlen, is a goddess who bestowed her radiance on the pale satellite, lighting the nights up without any aid from the sun (the fallen god, Hollon). You will learn to fear and respect her since she will influence many aspects of your journey. She can give you power and courage, assist you in exorcisms, or you can invoke her name through Lunar Divination to ask her for a blessing. Beware, though, since such blessings can also benefit the monstrous creatures that await in the darkness. Some are even more ruthless during some Lunar Phases and appear only during other ones, giving life to a monster-hunting system hinged on the superstition that concerns them.\nLearn how to survive in a world populated by terrible creatures.\nThe use of magic has radically changed over the ages. In the Lunar Age, the sources of eldritch power by which spellcasters thrive are now corrupted by darkness, and usage of magic is now a dangerous practice. The arcane balances scholars of magic used to study are vanishing, and the real power of magic can quickly wear out the souls of practitioners.\nThe use of spells will cost you the very shards of your soul, making spellcasting a priceless resource. The greater your powers, the more dangerous to handle.\nDecades of darkness and death drew the Material Plane closer to the Black Reflection from a morphological and a climatic perspective. The sun no longer warms beaches, mountains, valleys, and green plains are infrequent. Most woods died or became spectral, cloaked by mist and silence. The presence of the last Primes still grants some life, the cultivation of the most resistant plants, and the persistence of some woods and meadows.\nEverything changed, and there is nothing more to smile about, if not the bright aurora that lights up the skies in those rare nights.\nNightfell is a brand new setting for 5th ed. We'll produce a Corebook and a Bestiary!\nAll mock-ups are temporary and the final product may undergo some changes.\nThe manuals will consist of about 200 pages each. A Bestiary with almost 100 new creatures, with monsters dedicated to lore and others inspired by Italian folklore, each and everyone painstakingly adjusted to fit the setting and its dreadful atmosphere. The corebook will contains rich original lore, entire chapters about the background and the history of I\u00f9rmen, religions, and cultures, and description of iconic places for your campaigns. Along with these contents, there will also be a broad study on ethnic groups, including new original alphabets.\nOne of the new alphabets in the book.\nThe Explored Lands of I\u00f9rmen. Dive into this decaying world!\nThe game will encompass several new, dark fantasy flavored playable races, along with new archetypes for the classes of the most famous role-playing game in the World, new backgrounds for your characters, and three new original classes!\nCreate characters who can face the horrors of Enferun!\nHere some of the new options:\n- Lunar Cultist: Soldiers devoted to the worship of Mirithlen, experts in Lunar Divination, and in averting the perils of the night. You will be able to choose which Lunar Phase to be bound to, to gain powerful gameplay benefits.\n- Master of Tradition: These scholars of the arcane and esotericism are masters of knowledge about creatures and legends, coming as invaluable members to parties of night adventurers.\n- Tefillin: Characters who wish to have a closer connection to the Dark World can choose to let themselves be possessed voluntarily by a ghost, becoming Tefillin. Learn how to use your ghost's powers to increase your abilities.\nThere will be also a lot of new archetypes for existing 5e classes.\nThe Nightfell manual comprehends a first \u201dCorebook\u201d, useful for players and masters. Also, we will present 80 new spells dedicated to moon magic, new items and relics are just waiting to be discovered and inspected in the search for their hidden power, and several new game mechanics that will make Nightfell a one of its kind supplement!\nLots of unique items and relics are there to be found in your adventures.\nHere some of the new mechanics:\n Grim Weapons: as you bring down creatures of the night, your weapons absorb their dark essence. When a weapon reaches its Grim Threshold, it will become formidable in fighting abominable creatures, yet a heavy burden to carry, slowly wearing out your soul.\nYour weapons will deteriorate and acquire a will of their own. Grim Weapons are deadly to the creatures of the night, but they are not for anyone to wield.\n Soul Points: In addition to Hit Points, your characters will also have some degree of spiritual sanity to keep in check. When the horrors become too many to bear, when the strain of the night and the assaults of dark enemies will drop your Soul Points to 0, you will be easy prey to shadows and wraiths trying to take over your own body.\n   Influence of the Moon: learn to practice Lunar Divination and learn about the many ways in which the Lunar Phases will affect your game, starting from the mood and powers of your characters, up to the peculiar characteristics of some creatures.\nNew POSSESSED condition for characters and NPCs.\n You can listen an exhaustive interview with Andrea Back, our Game Designer, talking about lore and our New Mechanics here:\n https://comicsclericsandcontrollers.podbean.com/e/s35e5-asking-about-nightfell-with-andrea/?fbclid=IwAR1X5FeSxOHlg3l5_oSd7KB5jsYguzBYzVlUKCSq-PVqNE4lK85j_QwMhto \nHere are some additions to the product:\n  We'll also produce a Deluxe Edition: The Tome of Shadows!\nThe Tome of Shadows will gather together the Nightfell Corebook and Bestiary, a massive 400+ pages book with a black faux leather cover, black foil design, and black book edges.\nEmbrace the Darkness with Nightfell Tome of Shadows!\n- We have dedicated a stretch goal to the production of the lunar dice. This d8 can be used in your sessions to determine the moon phase, practice the Divination, or even in the creation phase of the character when choosing the birth moon!\nWe are ambitious.

Please note that if you select some add-ons starting from a PDF-only pledge, you'll be charged for shipping fees.\nIn general, you should be able to select an add-on by doing the following:\n 1. Click the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page.\n 2. Increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the add-on(s).\n 3. Save your pledge. Do not change the tier that you originally pledged at.\nYou will choose your add-ons in the pledge manager after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. You will also be able to change your selection later in the pledge manager. You will receive a BackerKit survey to your Kickstarter mail that will introduce you to the pledge manager.\nThe Funding Goal of the Campaign intents to cover the production costs, including (mainly) illustrations, graphics, game design, translations, and printing.\nWe decided to use any other funds to improve your gaming experience, upgrading the contents, and creating new adventures!

I started as an illustrator for a lot of companies, growing up both as artist and author and now I'm putting all my efforts in Nightfell, to design the best product I can! I've always been a Game Master and I design fantasy worlds since I was a child. Now it's time to gather my experience and try something huge: To build an entirely brand new fantasy setting and a new IP! We already have the lore and the settings, we designed the game features that are right now on playtest, and we created most of the graphics, producing some artworks. We need you to fund Nightfell to upgrade the number of the artworks in the book, to translate and to print it. Our only goal is to improve as more as possible the quality of the project, and the experience of the gamers! We are going to make the best that we can, in order to create something new, something dark, something crazy! We intend to respect the commitment made with you in terms of timing and quality.

Lost to history, this time is remembered in the echoes of myth and legend. The land was once besieged by the Horrors, foul creatures from the depths of astral space that seek to feed on and destroy all that is living and good.\nTheir time -- the time of the Scourge -- has passed. The people of the world have returned to the surface reclaiming the lands that were once their home. Brave heroes band together to explore the wilds of Barsaive, fighting the Horrors that remain and protecting their loved ones from those who would dominate and enslave them.\nEarthdawn is a fantasy role-playing game currently in its fourth edition. After more than 25 years it continues to deliver a setting tinged with a compelling mix of high magic and horror flavored with a dash of post-apocalypse and a generous sprinkling of hope.\nWe have released several products for the Earthdawn line in the past five years: Four core rulebooks (Player's Guide, Gamemaster's Guide, Companion, and Mystic Paths), four sourcebooks (Travar: The Merchant City, Elven Nations, Questors, and Iopos: Lair of Deceit), a GM Screen, Quick Start Guide, and several entries in our ongoing Legends of Barsaive adventure series.\nThe next sourcebook is ready to go.

This book details five specific moments and includes setting information, adventure frameworks, and a look into how these events shape their world. With this book, gamemasters can have their players infiltrate an Iopan spy-ring, become involved in the City of Ash's revolution, negotiate a peace in southwest Barsaive, and determine whether or not the City of Thieves is worth saving. Above it all, the dragons and their children look on to determine the actions that must be taken to prepare Barsaive for the future.\nWhile each of these events could potentially serve as a stand-alone campaign, they can also be linked together in an epic-style campaign designed to take characters across western Barsaive and progress them from Fifth to Ninth circle. Empty Thrones provides information you need to set your own adventures in four locales: Councilor Plaza, a district in Iopos's Clansward; the citadels of occupied Jerris; the fishing village of Freewater on the border of Cara Fahd; and Kratas's port-city of Daiche. With adventures hooks, frameworks, and villains designed to threaten tables of Journeyman and Warden tier, this book provides gamemasters with ample resources to support hours of play. \nThe Malachite Seat of Iopos\nCompilation of Adventures\nOver the past few years, we've released a steady stream of interwoven adventures under the Legends of Barsaive banner. These adventures take place in Haven and explore the complex political situation of this self-governed town outside Parlainth. The secrets  hidden in this lost Theran ruin have gathered the attention of both the Kingdom of Throal and the Empire of Thera, while Haven hosts frequent envoys from Blood Wood. In addition to these external forces, a number of Adventuring Companies have been founded and seek to extend their influence in pursuit of individual goals. Players must both navigate these powers and gather allies in Haven if they hope to influence the future of this outpost.\nWe've reached the mid-point of this series and have decided to make a stand-alone product encompassing everything that has been released so far. Legends of Barsaive: Haven Volume 1 is a 400+ page adventure book that will include the eight modules previously only available in ashcan-style paperback booklets. This product will include an expanded version of the Haven guidebook specifically created for this product, which includes setting specific details for the campaign series. This version of the guidebook is currently planned to only be available in this compendium product.\nFor those who have purchased these adventures individually, we thank you for your support! It is only due to your continued interest that we were able to compile this collection. The adventures contained in this collection are reprinted forms of the first eight booklets. As we move forward, all Legends of Barsaive adventures will continue to be released as booklets.\nWork In Progress Cover Art for Haven Volume 1\nRewards and Add-Ons\nBack this Kickstarter, and you get access to the pre-art draft of the manuscript (it will be linked in a backers-only post shortly after the campaign closes). We offer this to show that the text is complete--the  book just needs to make its way through the rest of the production  process. You'll also get early access to what's inside, and will be able to start using it in your game right away!\nWe're offering the new books in PDF and physical versions. We have reward tiers that include previously released books in case you missed our earlier Kickstarters or still weren't aware the game had returned. All the available books are in print and in stock, so there's no additional wait for delivery.\nFor those looking to fill in holes in their collection that an existing pledge bundle doesn't satisfy, we are also offer single-book add-on options. Prices (and additional shipping charges) are as follows:  \nAdd-On Prices\nIndividual add-on books include the PDF version at no additional  charge. If you are adding physical product to a PDF-only tier, the first  book is $10 shipping (even if it is noted as free shipping above), with added costs based on additional books ordered. The reward tiers include standard (softcover) editions. If you want to upgrade any books in a tier from standard to deluxe, add $40 per book.\nFor all add-ons, please include the amount of the add-on in your pledge. You will be able to indicate specific add-on choices as part of  the survey at the end of the campaign. You can adjust your pledge amount  (or change your chosen reward tier) at any point before the campaign  ends.\nUhl Denairastas, First Minister of Iopos by James Austin\nStretch Goals\n**ACHIEVED!** If we reach $10,000 we will produce an 18\" x 24\" poster of the Empty Thrones cover, with a special addition by our Art Director James Austin. The art is already done, we just need to put it into production. Adding on a flat folded version of the poster will be $4 for backers. By popular request, we will also offer a rolled version of the poster shipped separately in tube packaging for $20.\n**ACHIEVED!** If we reach $20,000 we will produce a set of 46 \"personality cards\". These accessories will feature the prominent (and maybe a few not-so-prominent) characters involved in the events of Empty Thrones. Printed on durable cardstock, they will feature a portrait of the character on one side, and a few key pieces of information about them on the other. Great for showing your players what the person they're dealing with looks like.\n**ACHIEVED!** At $25,000 we will finish up work on the digital version of the Barsaive province map as depicted in the Gamemaster's Guide (and available as a poster-size add-on). This has been on the to-do list for a while but back burnered... and this will devote resources to finishing it up and making it available! All backers will get it as a thank-you bonus at no extra charge.\nAt $30,000 our Art Director will create a map of Iopos. This was not included in the sourcebook (to the disappointment of many fans), but we have heard you. This will be a digital release only for now. A physical version will be considered as a goal of a later campaign. \nNew to Earthdawn?\nOriginally released in 1993, Earthdawn was  named one of \"The Millennium's Most Underrated Games\" by Pyramid  magazine in 1999, and 24th in Arcane magazine's 1996 reader poll of the  50 most popular role-playing games of all time. The game delivers a  richly developed setting flavored with high fantasy, post-apocalypse,  and horror. In 2014 a successful Kickstarter brought the fourth edition  to life.\nLong ago the world was alive with magic, giving rise to strange  creatures and exotic races only remembered today in the echoes of myth  and legend. The level of magic rises and falls over thousands of years.  At its height, foul creatures from the depths of the  Netherworlds--called Horrors--breach the barrier between their native plane and ours, leading to a centuries-long time of destruction called the Scourge.\nEarthdawn is set in the aftermath of the most recent Scourge. The player characters are adepts, heroes  who draw on magical powers to explore the world, recover knowledge lost  to the Scourge, and fight those that who threaten the lives of  innocents--including the remaining Horrors. Each adept follows a Discipline,  defining that defines the focus and scope of their magical abilities.  Some adepts hone their combat skills, some enhance their mental and  social abilities, while others learn and cast spells.\nThe core game engine of Earthdawn is the  Step System. As your character gains power and advances along the path  of their Discipline you roll progressively larger dice, with open-ended  rolls allowing for potentially legendary results. Adepts can further  enhance their magical abilities through the use of karma, adding  additional dice to your rolls.\nThe Earthdawn Quick Start Guide (available free at our web shop or on Drive-Thru RPG)  provides a great overview of the game system, examples of the magical  powers available, and includes sample characters and a brief  introductory adventure.  \nA Denairastas Banner by Reece Firman\nReturning to Earthdawn?\nIf you've been away from Earthdawn for a  while, the new edition should be familiar, but a few things have changed  to open up new design space and incorporate lessons learned over the  years.\nThe core game engine remains largely the same. The specific dice used  in a few places have been tweaked to smooth out some bumps in the  underlying probability curves, but still uses all the common  polyhedrals.\nThe game no longer uses the success level table from previous  editions. Instead, every five points over the target number scores an  additional success. This new mechanic has been incorporated into most of  the game's talents, skills, and spells so that--in general--better  rolls mean better results.\nFourth edition keeps the \"talent option\" approach to Disciplines  introduced in third edition, but has refined the required talents to be  more broadly useful, and improves the choices available at each tier to  allow for better customization options.\nSpellcasting includes the concept of extra threads, allowing  magicians to enhance their spells as they cast them. This gives  lower-Circle spells a longer life and more utility over the course of  the character's career.\nThe timeline has been advanced. It is a few years after the Second  Theran War, with a new status quo in Barsaive. In the wake of the war,  the dwarfs of Throal has have a new royal family on the throne and  withdrawn from provincial affairs. In that void, other political powers  expand their influence... including the Denairastas clan of Iopos.\nThis is a great time to get back into the game, and this project  gives you access to the books we've released so far at a discount. Why  not journey back to Barsaive, and build some new legends?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver this product. The text is written, it only needs to make its way through the rest of the production pipeline. We have already completed and released eight books for the Earthdawn Fourth Edition line along with several smaller products.\n\nOf course, any project includes risk. Unforeseen production delays or other issues may crop up that push the release of the final product beyond the currently anticipated date, but we have already factored some wiggle room into our delivery estimates.\n\nWe have learned many lessons from our previous successful kickstarters. While more books are planned and in development, they will not appear as stretch goals for this project so that we can focus on closing out this campaign and delivering all promised rewards in a timely manner.\n\nWhile there may be concerns given the Covid-19 pandemic, our plans should not be overly affected. Our books are printed and bound in the United States, and as of the launch of this campaign our printer is still operating.

Her loss has taken a very heavy toll on her family-- including her FASA family.

I am trying to get back to things here, with the hope that things get back on track. I know some of you probably need responses about things.

(That is not a dirty word! Get your mind out of the gutter, Troubleshooter!)\n The R&D Mission Book: 128 pages giving a busy GM two missions that start the first ever (we think) Paranoia campaign! You also get the Top 10 Best R&D Experiments (filled with three-act structured mission hooks) and advice on adding a trip to R&D into every Troubleshooter mission.

Back in older editions of Paranoia, a trip to R&D for some rather questionable gear was a standard part of Troubleshooter missions. After the briefing, Troubleshooters went to R&D whether they wanted to or not. (Oh, but they wanted to, at least more than they wanted to be terminated.) In the previous edition, this was expanded to become a Service where Troubleshooters did minor but stressful jobs for any of the eight service groups.\nWe grew up playing Paranoia, and have fond memories of all kinds of R&D devices going boom, ping! and sometimes POW BANG POP WHAM WHIZZ CLICK WHIRR, and then boom! To be honest, we missed that! So when we sat down to think of the next expansion for Paranoia, this immediately came to mind. And it would not leave, no matter what we ingested.\nBy launching a Kickstarter for the R&D sourcebox, we can provide unique offers (like designer notes and create-a-device) while offering all-new ways to torment players. (Err, their characters.) As with our Acute Paranoia Kickstarter, all of the sourcebox content (books and cards) has already been written, edited and made ready for citizens everywhere.\nIt also allows us to explore a first for Paranoia: An actual campaign. How is that possible when most Troubleshooter teams have the shelf life of raw soylent? We extended one plot over four different missions. You can keep characters between missions or create new ones, as players will remember what is going on. And yes, this is all centred on an R&D experiment named Project Infinite Hole.\nPledge Levels\nWe have put together a multitude of ways you can demonstrate your loyalty to The Computer, and eagerness to aid R&D with their critical mission to enhance and improve the already perfect Alpha Complex.\nThe R&D Testing Fun Pack!\nR&D is so much fun that we wanted to offer a big reward: The R&D Testing Fun Pack. (Is the testing fun? Are we testing fun? Is the pack full of tests and fun? Yes.) In this commemorative pack, those backing at Green or higher will receive:\n6 Green Pencils for Troubleshooters that say \u2018Fuel Rod (mini)\u2019.\n1 GM Pen that says \u2018Knowing Rules is Treason\u2019.\nSafety Poster Card with real (read: fake) R&D lab warnings such as \u2018Inhaling Particulates is Theft DO NOT BREATHE\u2019 and \u2018If Alarm Sounds, Push People Down and Run Away\u2019.\nPad of R&D Experimental Equipment Release Forms, ready to inflict on your players.\n25 \u2018Heroes of R&D\u2019 trading cards featuring the most important and/or dangerous people, locations and experiments that are part of this fine service group. Also containing rules for dropping them into missions.\nExclusive short mission, never to be found elsewhere: \u2018Smocks!\u2019. An experiment in armour technology goes missing while the Communists fight the Communists for control of the Communists. Guess who gets to fix both problems?\nAll in a special presentation pack!\nThese items are exclusive to the R&D Testing Fun Pack, and will never be available anywhere else!\nStretch Goals\nR&D is all about getting wonderful, cutting-edge devices to Troubleshooters so they can justify budget expenditures. (Also, fight traitors sometimes.) So why not offer our most loyal citizens some cutting-edge stretch goals? They are rather nifty...\n Anyone backing at the Red level or higher will get all unlocked stretch goals as PDFs! Praise Friend Computer!\nPackage Deals\nIn our Traveller Kickstarters, backers could purchase packages to fill out their collections. This proved such a hit that we are now offering Paranoia Package Deals! You can pick any or all of these, and simply add their cost to your pledge level - we will be in touch after the Kickstarter to finalise which packages you pledged for. We will even ship them out as soon as the Kickstarter is over and all your details have been collated (typically within a month of the Kickstarter completing) so there is no waiting!\n\u00a335 The Card Package: Keep your players\u2019 hands full with four card decks: More [REDACTED] Societies, Mutant Explosion, the RAM Deck, and Perfectly Safe Gear.\n\u00a350 The Mission Package: Run your Troubleshooters through completely safe and relaxing missions: Implausible Deniability, Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues, and Truth or Dare.\n\u00a370 The Box Package: Do you really like boxes? Do you also like Paranoia? Then get this package and receive both the Starter box set and the Acute Paranoia expansion box.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of our Kickstarter projects have succeeded and backers received their rewards. That said, we know there is always room for improvement and we continue to learn how to do this better. For example, we are adding more value to pledge levels by offering all stretch goals to anyone backing at Red level or higher. \n\nAs with our previous Paranoia Kickstarter, everything in the sourcebox (including the 120-card R&D Deck) has already been designed, written, and tested on live gamers. (Only a few gamers were hurt in the making of this sourcebox but, in our defence, they kept using their phones at the table.) This lowers the risk since you do not have to wait and hope somebody in the UK writes this thing. (Note: The first four stretch goals are complete, with art and layout complete, and ready for final proofing and printing. We are waiting to see what else gets unlocked before panicking and screaming at freelancers, \u2018THIS OTHER STUFF NEEDS TO BE DONE NAOW!\u2019) \n\nThe coronavirus continues to plague the world, but we have ensured its effects will be minimal as the majority of the actual development of Project Infinite Hole is already done, and we have several different printers alerted on different continents (China, Eastern Europe and North America) so we can select the best choice if and when the virus flares up once more.\n\nLead designer WJ MacGuffin is keeping a suspicious eye on things here on the Kickstarter page, and he will be answering your questions as fast as his old brain can handle. (He is still running Cerebral Coretech 10.15 Minx, so it might take a little while.)\n\nR&D stands for Rebar & Dust. \nR&D stands for Riots & Destruction.\nR&D stands for whatever you want.

We played a lot of board games, card games and tons of RPGs and wanted to create an easy to learn game that relies on a universal language (uses just symbols and icons for all actions - which are easy to learn). The game is also full of tactics and options and demands a mastering of the possibilities and choices as it can be a game of cooperation, individual play, or backstabbing while you play as the Sandman\u2019s undercover ally.\nEasy to learn and easy to dive in mechanics even for inexperienced players\n  Card use easy to learn and accessible symbols\n  A dynamic, fast, and intense system\n  The game is for 2-4 players\nHOW TO PLAY SLEEP TIGHT\nSleep Tight is a 10-20 minute game that is dynamic and fast-paced in terms of decisions and actions. Sometimes you\u2019re lucky and get a large hand of cards you can choose from, and sometimes you have to micromanage and get the best out of a small hand. It\u2019s a game where your luck can change suddenly when the Sandman lashes out, testing your intuition and skills. Will you hide and wait for the attack to blow over, or will you actively attack and escape by the skin of your teeth?\nIn Sleep Tight you need to constantly be alert and think few steps ahead, as you will need to guess the other players\u2019 next move or even worse, the Sandman\u2019s!\n\n A video of the gameplay can be seen here: \nWHY KICKSTARTING A PRINT TO PLAY VERSION\nThis is a sort of a pre-campaign; we would like to polish the rules to their perfection and what better community to do that than the Kickstarter gaming army?

See your players battle dragons, fight to stop an evil overlord, and discover wonders and horrors as a shadowy patron leads you in pursuit of powerful magical artifacts. These exciting  adventures are already written: The funds pay for editing, layout, art, maps, and a high-quality print run.\nEach softcover adventure will sport a unique color cover, and contain black and white interiors on high-quality paper. The binding will be saddle-stitched (stapled).\nThere are three GM'd adventures designed to be played with a referee and a group of your friends. Two are programmed adventures (solos) that can be played with a small group with GM support . . . or played by yourself on the off chance you're asked to spend months alone with little social contact.\nThe Fantasy Trip is an \u201cold school\u201d RPG created by Steve Jackson. Its first element was released in 1977: the combat game Melee (available FREE from Steve Jackson Games!). That was followed by the magic game Wizard and a full roleplaying rulebook: In the Labyrinth.\nThe Fantasy Trip is more \u201ccinematic\u201d than \u201csimulationist\u201d \u2014 speed and ease of play are the goal, not an exact representation of every swing and every defense. The background is unabashedly swords and sorcery. Elves are noble, dragons are greedy, and gunpowder weapons exist but are very likely to blow up in your face!\nTFT was off the market for more than 35 years, until 2017 when Steve Jackson regained the rights to his work and set about creating a new edition. The Legacy Edition came out in 2018 . . . and More Perilous Journeys supports that amazing deluxe edition.\nThe campaign features five new adventures. Three expect you to run with a GM at the helm; the other two are solo adventures.\nRoc of Sages (Christopher R. Rice and J. Edward Tremlett). Beset by Collectors - assassins from the Indhyna League - the party must journey to the Isle of Greater Zosi to collect items for the semi-corporeal Jok Sevantes. Of course, there are several dangerous stops along the way. Roc of Sages is designed for 4-6 characters of 34-36 points.\nCatacombs of Living Death (Christopher R. Rice and J. Edward Tremlett). Following the events of Roc of Sages, Jok Sevantes again calls the party to aid him. They must venture forth through a plague-stricken land, and enter the Catacombs of Eulogia to recover the Helm of Baat. Simple enough . . . but things are not always as they appear. Catacombs of Living Death is designed for 4-6 characters of 36-38 points.\nThe Sunken Library (Christopher R. Rice and J. Edward Tremlett). Set immediately following Catacombs, the players flee the plague-ridden landscape beset by numerous foes. Sevantes' plans reach their climax as his partners must bring all of the previously found artifacts beneath the depths of a lake in Meloria. There, a lost tome sits in the sunken Great Library of Meloria, and matters become treacherously clear. The Sunken Library  is designed for 4-6 characters of 36-38 points.\nDragon Hunt! (David Pulver). Baron Gwalathar's armies marched off to war. Without its defenders, the dragons of the wild sensed weakness, ravaging the realm. The young Baroness Tanith Gwalathar calls for heroes: It\u2019s time for a dragon hunt! This is a solo/programmed adventure for one 37-39 point character or two 35-36 point characters. It can optionally also be run with a GM.\nDark Lord's Doom (David Pulver). Another Dark Lord is on the march, threatening to bring death and destruction to all who oppose, and maybe a few who don't. This solo/programmed adventure features a squad of soldiers fighting in an all-out war to defeat the evil Lord Saethor and his allies before it's too late. Will the Dark Lord's doom fall upon the party, or on the villain himself?  Dark Lord's Doom is designed for 4 characters of 33-36 points each. \nThe writing team have all written for The Fantasy Trip before . . . among a great number of other projects.\nDavid Pulver is the author of the TFT adventures Fire in the Temple and Red Crypt, and several articles for Hexagram, as well as such varied works as Transhuman Space, GURPS 4th edition, and Big Eyes, Small Mouth. He has written over 100 articles for Pyramid Magazine including adventures for GURPS Dungeon Fantasy and The Fantasy Trip. David is a veteran TFT player and GM dating back to 1978 when he first played Melee. He wrote Citadel of Ice, Ironskull Castle, and the programmed adventure Vampire Hunter Belladonna for the Four Perilous Journeys campaign.\nThe writing team of Christopher R. Rice and J. Edward Tremlett co-wrote The Crown of Eternity and Curse of the Pirate King from the last campaign. Christopher has the distinction of being the most-frequently published freelancer in Pyramid Vol 3, as well as being the author of GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 19: Incantation Magic and Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game: Traps. J. Edward Tremlett wrote The Groom of the Spider Princess, The Tome of the Black Island, and Where the Snow Bleeds, and co-wrote Al-Phasmaq: The City of Ships with Christopher R. Rice.\nGaming Ballistic, LLC is publishing these five new TFT adventures as part of the current More Perilous Journeys campaign, supplementing the five already published as part of the Four (Five!) Perilous Journeys effort. Gaming Ballistic is proud to be a license holder for both The Fantasy Trip and The Dungeon Fantasy RPG, and seeks to provide a steady stream of high-quality material to the fans of both games. GB has also published for That Other Game, and you can find those products under Add-ons.\n\nThe campaign is to fund the art, layout, and editing of the books. This includes the cover art, interior art, maps, and of course the look and flow of text.\nHere are some work-in-progress images of the books with what I have done, to give you examples of what you'll be getting. When the campaign funds, Updates will show progress and art as it happens!\nThe Covers\nThe covers for the five new books utilize the same template as those from Five Perilous Journeys. Inspired by the iconic Megahex tiles of The Fantasy Trip, here are two example of the cover layouts. Of course, the images will be added later!\nKsenia Kozhovnikova is hard at work on the covers, and has provided me with this WIP for Dragon Hunt! As the others come in, I'll update them. Her next cover is Dark Lord's Doom, as I already had art direction for that one.\nKsenia did such a great job on Dragon Hunt she's doing all five covers for me.\nMy interior art team is pretty consistent from project to project, though I'm always looking for outstanding new talent. Here's the cover of Citadel of Ice, done by Rick Troula for the last campaign. \nArt, Maps, and Layout\nLayout and editing are underway, and will continue as the campaign progresses. Here's a screen capture from Roc of Sages, which is substantially complete in layout, needing only more fine-tuning of the language. It is representative of both the prior books, and the format of the upcoming products. The maps (see below) will be replaced by Glynn with something more than a rough sketch!\n\nTFT is a tactical battle game, and a roleplaying game. But good maps make for good fights. Fortunately, I've good good help. Glynn Seal, the ENnie Gold Medal cartographer in 2018 for his work on his Midderlands setting, has once again agreed to provide the maps for these five new books.\nHere's an example of his B/W work from Vampire Hunter Belladonna, featuring a tactical hex-map.\nOne more spread! This one from Citadel of Ice, showing a topographical map of the titular Citadel on the rapidly disintegrating iceberg, as well as a tracker who has clearly made a very poor 3/IQ roll.\nI hope that, despite the art and maps being mostly pending, these images give you a feel for what the team shall provide.\nAll the books will be printed by Mixam, who offers outstanding print quality at lightning-fast speed. They will be \"saddle-stitched,\" or stapled, with color covers and black and white interiors. They will feature 100-lb interior paper (150gsm), and 130-lb cover stock (350gsm).\nMixam has printing factories all over the world. Books meant to be shipped to the USA are printed locally; books destined for \"Rest of World\" are printed in the UK, and shipped by Royal Mail.\nWhile shipping is not free (see below!) and will be added during the post-campaign Backerkit phase, local printing and shipping allows Gaming Ballistic to serve the entire world at less-painful shipping rates.\nLESS painful. International shipping is still rough sailing.\nWhile the adventures contain \"print your own\" counters, die-cut counters and NPC/Monster cards will be produced in a separate campaign.\n\"Books\" are easy. Well, easier. They are usually tax-free, the supply chain is simple and well understood, and the chosen vendor is operational during a time of global pandemic. I know with certainty I can deliver the product, how it will happen, and - to the extent one can - the timing involved.\n\"Stuff,\" which includes die-cut counters and the lovely Decks-of-Destiny-compatible cards featured in the last campaign (as well as, of course Decks of Destiny itself!) is more complex. Many plants are shut down, and combining VAT/Tax-eligible \"stuff\" with usually-tax-free \"books\" makes shipping unpredictable. \nSo while there will be counter-type images in each adventure, the full-color counters and cards have to wait until the uncertainty around them is lower. If this campaign is successful, we'll make sure that a future one brings the accessories to life!\nThe More Perilous Journeys campaign is offering the following reward levels.\nAll the New Stuff\nThere are two reward levels that get you all five of the new adventures being offered during the More Perilous Journeys campaign.\n$25 - ALL FIVE NEW PDFs\nPDFs of all five of the new adventures from this campaign.

So, if that's what you want, here you go!\n$20 - JUST THE SOLOS IN PDF FORMAT\nYou want solos? Portable, no-shelf-space-required solos? You got 'em. All three of David's solo/programmed adventures that Gaming Ballistic has produced, and ONLY the solo/programmed adventures, in PDF format.

Both of the new adventures can be run as group adventures with or without a GM.\nPick and Choose\nSometimes, you just want what you want. Based on backer feedback (and no small amount of discussion with Backerkit), Gaming Ballistic is pleased to offer some a la carte pledge levels.\nAfter choosing one of these levels, during the Backerkit phase of the project, you will select from the ten available TFT adventures from Gaming Ballistic.\nThe following reward levels are PDF-ONLY.\n$6 - Choose any ONE PDF\n$12 - Choose any TWO PDFs\n$18 - Choose any THREE PDFs\nThe following reward levels are PRINT-ONLY. No PDF is included with these pledge levels!\n$12 - Choose any ONE softcover print adventure\n$22 - Choose any TWO  softcover print adventures\n $33 - Choose any THREE  softcover print adventures \nThere are no stretch goals for this campaign, which is deliberately being kept simple to prevent scope creep. Scope creep leads schedule slip, and schedule slip leads to suffering, as Yoda said (I believe Yoda said that. Or something like it.)\nThat being said: surpassing the goal does help! As the backer count climbs above 500 backers, the authors get paid more. Happy authors write more TFT books for Gaming Ballistic. Everyone wins.\nA project isn't a project without a timeline.\nCampaign Launch: May 19, 2020\nCampaign End: June 13, 2020\nBackerkit Phase: July, 2020\nProduction: September, 2020\nPDF Distribution: October 2020\nPrinting and Delivery: November 2020\nGaming Ballistic will do everything possible to meet or beat the projected dates.  As always, backers will be kept informed of any progress with regular updates.\n Backers have the opportunity to put any of Gaming Ballistic's products in their cart at the end of the campaign, during the Backerkit phase. You can also \"plus-up\" your pledge to cover the cost of the items in advance, which helps the campaign fund.\nExample: You decide that you want the \"More Perilous Print+PDF\" level, which is a $90 pledge. You are intrigued with The Citadel at Nordvorn, so you select the More Perilous Print+PDF ($44) pledge level and manually enter $134 for the pledged amount. When the Backerkit Survey comes around after the campaign ends, you see the More Perilous Print+PDF in your \"cart,\" and a $44 credit. You add the Nordvorn Print+PDF bundle, which brings your credit balance to zero.\nIf after that, you continue to shop, your will show a balance. As you shop, shipping costs are assessed on the complete order, and then at the end, you pay the balance, which is shipping plus any add-ons you decide to purchase that go beyond the $44 you added with your pledge.\nEach of the books in the campaign can also be had as add-ons. You can also get individual copies of the already published adventures from Five Perilous Journeys if you have some, but not all, of the existing books.\n Roc of Sages.

It consists of three major settlements, many small villages, a ruin, and two primary adventuring zones: The Hunted Lands to the northwest of The Palisade, and the Endalaus Forest, to the north and east of Audreyn's Wall.\nIt is intended for starting Dungeon Fantasy RPG characters of 250 points.\nPDF: $17\nPrint: $35\nPrint+PDF Bundle: $44 \nFar beyond the safety of Audreyn\u2019s Wall, the ambitious noble Dalmar, his wife Freythor, and their lifetime friend and lieutenant Tobias carved a new settlement out of the dragonkin-infested wilderness.

Dalmar will offer up the Konungsgj\u00f6f and petition to be named Jarl of Sk\u00f3gurenda: Lord of Forest\u2019s End.\nSk\u00f3gurenda is in peril and does not know it.

He hopes to ascend, becoming an Elder Dragon. They ruled the world for countless thousands of years. He believes he has found the way to do it.

When the campaign ends, you will be invited to fill out a Backerkit survey to confirm shipping details, and choose any add-ons you might like to purchase. If you've pledged more than your reward total, this will show as a credit on your account.\nThe Backerkit phase will only last between 7-10 days. The survey have two or three questions in it: shipping address, and reward selection. It is important to get the shipping address question answered promptly if you order physical product.\n \"Ships to Whole World\" is not Free Shipping! \nAn important point: the project will ship to the entire world.\nShipping in the USA of physical product will use the USPS media mail, and shipping will be added to your pledge total during the Backerkit phase.\nInternational shipping will try and keep costs down by printing in the EU (Latvia, specifically) and drop-shipping the books to Kixto, in the UK. International orders will thus ship from there via Royal Mail. The rest of the books will be sent to Studio 2 in Tennessee, and US fulfillment will take place from there.\nEither way, I don't control shipping costs, and there's no way around it: International shipping is very expensive, and time-consuming to boot. If you have purchased multiple physical products, Gaming Ballistic will do everything possible to group them into a single shipment to reduce costs, but that might not be possible. Certain countries (such as Brazil) are ridiculously expensive to ship to, and those costs will be passed on during the Backerkit phase.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe primary risk to backers is the timing of delivery.\n\nThe writing is complete. The layout template is in place and proven; some of the books the layout is already finished, which includes editing.\n\nThese adventures are all new. New art. New monsters. New maps. That means that it's possible one or more of those things could be delayed.\n\nThere is a lot of art required to also provide the counter-size graphics in the back of each adventure. Given the state of the world right now, this represents a timing risk.\n\nThere are very few things that would disrupt the project other than mild schedule slips \u2013 though of course things can always go pear-shaped. Gaming Ballistic provides regular updates as to the project\u2019s progress, and do everything possible to deliver the final PDF on or ahead of schedule.\n\nOne usual source of delay for projects has been eliminated: The printer chosen operates in both the USA and UK and provides high quality identical printing at both sites. This eliminates a huge variable in timing: the need to ship from a far-flung location, split shipments, and then do fulfillment.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Follow the Campaign", "descp": "It's dangerous to stow away with adventurers!

As science and technology draw humanity closer than ever before, certain factions within the masses display gross negligence, undermining the union's work and endangering the world for short-sighted gains. Despite global telecommunications, new frontiers in virtually every field of study, and an understanding of the universe only dreamed of by earlier generations, humanity faces threats on all sides. \nCan you save it?\nClimate change threatens to destroy life as we know it. Religious fundamentalism breeds terror around the globe. Diseases, once eradicated from the developed world through vaccination, have returned due to anti-vaxxer movements. Totalitarian nationalist governments rise, as the masses succumb to fear of the other.\nThe world stands on the brink of destruction, and it is up to the agents and operatives of the Technocratic Union to save it or be its ultimate downfall.  \nTechnocracy Reloaded peels back the curtain and examines the role of the Technocracy in Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. The various future fates presented in Mage 20 are examined, and this book introduces a few of its own.  \nWithin this book you will also find a detailed look at life within the Technocracy; expanded information on the conventions; a wealth of equipment, adjustments, and procedures; a breakdown of the various shadow conspiracies and factions within the Technocratic Union; and tips for running your own Technocracy chronicle. \nArtwork by Michael Gaydos\nTechnocracy Reloaded brings the final playable faction of the Ascension War into Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. The Technocratic Union has historically been presented in various ways. Its members have been shown as the villains of the Ascension War, misguided willworkers seeking to keep humanity safe through control and manipulation, shadowy masters of modern reality, and as heroes forming the only line of defense against unspeakable horrors that seek to destroy all that is. Each of these perspectives is true, from a certain point of view. \nArtwork by Aaron Acevedo\nTechnocracy Reloaded gives the Storyteller all the tools needed to explore these viewpoints and more while incorporating the Technocratic Union into their Mage 20 game. Technocracy Reloaded provides tools and resources to equip and portray the Technocratic Union as antagonists in a Mage 20 game, or to allow the players to step into the role of Technocrats, with the full support of the Union and its immeasurable resources at their fingertips.\nThis Technocracy Reloaded Kickstarter campaign is designed to enable us to create a deluxe hardcover edition of this supplement, designed to match the look and feel of our other 20th Anniversary Editions, and specifically the Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. \nWe want to create a deluxe edition with a leatherette cover featuring the title of the book on the spine, 200+ full color interior pages, and a silk ribbon bookmark. The cover will featured an embossed image of the Technocracy symbol. Exceptional funding will allow us to further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play.\nDesign Not Final\nThe Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary rulebook is required to make full use of the rules and options presented in Technocracy Reloaded.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nTechnocracy Reloaded features all of the rules options necessary to create and play a Technocratic Union operative within the Mage 20 world. The final book will contain the following chapters:\nUnit 1: The Operative's Handbook provides a detailed overview of life in the Technocratic Union, describing the organization of the Union, the Conventions, and the roles that sympathizers, extraordinary citizens, and Enlightened Operatives play in the overall structure of the Technocracy.\nUnit 2: Targets, Assets, Tactics, and Plans provides a thorough exploration of the operational procedures and standard models used by the Technocracy around the globe and beyond in order to protect the consensus, contain and eliminate Reality Deviance, and bring the world closer to the Union's ultimate goal of Ascension.\nUnit 3: Theaters of Operation examines current Technocratic initiatives on the Front Lines. New initiatives are introduced, old procedures are expanded and clarified, and the Union's global goals are parsed out in localized segments, giving the Storyteller the tools to craft Technocratic tales anywhere in the world.\nUnit 4: Internal Matters provides a detailed view of every aspect of life among the Technocracy. Operatives at all levels of indoctrination and from every imaginable origin are discussed. From Enlightenment, to marriage and child-rearing, to interactions with one's old life, every element of a Technocrat's daily existence is granted meticulous attention. Factions within the Union are also discussed here, including secret cabals with ulterior motives, cross-convention initiatives working together to build a better world, and the Conventions themselves all receive detailed and updated write-ups in this chapter.\nUnit 5: Q Division details the devices, procedures, and hypertech used by the Technocratic Union in all operations great and small. New cutting edge equipment is introduced and old favorites are modernized for compatibility with Mage 20. The Enlightened Science behind these various gadgets and gizmos is also revealed, allowing operatives to apply similar effects in the field, if they have sufficient understanding of the principles that allow these gadgets to function.\nUnit 6: Human Resources provides a comprehensive roster of Extraordinary citizens, cyborgs, operatives, progenitor creations, and allies to populate a Technocracy Reloaded Chronicle.\nUnit 7: Mission Control is a complete guide to Storytelling for the Technocratic Union. A number of story seeds, tips and tricks are provided to ensure that the Storyteller can capture the feel of the Technocracy.\nUnit 8:The Parallax View takes a deep dive into metaplot options, discussing every significant Future Fate that affects the Technocratic Union. Options are provided for incorporating, ignoring, or subverting these metaplot options, and entire new metaplot options are introduced. The tools in this chapter permit the Storyteller and players to shape the Union to their own vision, giving you everything you need to carry your Technocracy Reloaded game into the past, present, or future.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\n\nThe manuscript is written, awesome artists are being contracted, and layout templates are being built. An amazing digital PDF product will be created with this material. With your help we will be able to take it a step further and produce a deluxe hardcover version of Technocracy Reloaded for Mage 20 fans and collectors. The main goal and primary focus of this Kickstarter campaign is the creation of this limited-edition book.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of the Technocracy, possibly expanding into Storyteller and player tools and accessories, as well as a possible rules companion. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our own secret cabal.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target, then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick here to summon a larger version of this chart\n\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nFirst decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Extraordinary Citizen and Operative Reward Tiers), or go all in with the deluxe hardcover (Agent Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nArtwork by Aaron Acevedo\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Supervisor Reward Tier, which offers 2 copies as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Technocracy Reloaded campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Manager) will get 5 copies of the Technocracy Reloaded deluxe hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.\nArtwork by Michael Gaydos\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Technocracy Reloaded setting or a possible future supplement. We also have a limited supply of deluxe hardcover copies of the Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition included in our Deluxe Archivist reward tier. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Technocracy Reloaded.

Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nMAGE: THE ASCENSION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION - A limited number of copies remain of this deluxe edition, funded by a Kickstarter camapign 6 years ago.

All physical rewards will be delivered in one shipment, when the final Technocracy Reloaded deluxe hardcover is completed and distributed to backers.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Technocracy Reloaded, you will have the option of using StorytellersVault.com\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from StorytellersVault.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nNote - these PDF files are the current versions offered by DTRPG.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $35 OPERATIVE or $60 DIGITAL ARCHIVIST reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from Storytellers Vault once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 SYMPATHIZER reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.\nContact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill, and then encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (MANAGER) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Technocracy Reloaded is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path.

Charlie Foxtrot will contain five one-shot adventures for Battlelords, including pre-generated characters. In addition, there are several short fiction stories to help flesh out the Battlelords' universe. It will also include a small planetary atlas detailing the worlds and locations where these adventures and stories take place. As a whole, Charlie Foxtrot fleshes out this little corner of the Battlelord's universe, creating a sandbox for you to play in... before you blow it up with your shenanigans.  \n*Don't have the Battlelords rulebook? It's included in many of our pledge levels or as an Add-On. Available in PDF or hardcopy. Link to free Quick Start Rules below.  \nThough Charlie Foxtrot is written for Battlelords of the 23rd Century, the adventures, maps, and diagrams presented within can be repurposed for any science-fiction roleplaying game.  \nCharlie Foxtrot Cover (Work-in-Progress)\nWhat is Battlelords?\nBattlelords of the 23rd Century (aka Battlelords) is a military science-fiction tabletop roleplaying game, with a 30 year history in the game industry.   Set in a galaxy of war, an alliance of 15 different alien species desperately attempts to repel the Aknar-Ryn (aka The Arachnids) invasion and root out the nanoswarms of the Atlanteans hiding within their ranks.  Play as corporate mercenaries, soldiers, spies, pirates, or any other occupation you can think of in this expansive setting.  \nBattlelords of the 23rd Century (Kickstarter Edition) Cover Art\nThe newest edition of Battlelords is a beautifully illustrated, hardcover, 540 page book that we successfully launched right here on Kickstarter.  If features: \n15 different highly detailed species to choose from as a character.\nAn expansive, galaxy spanning setting, with limitless potential.\nDetailed setting information for running a campaign for Alliance soldiers, mercenaries, pirates, spies, and corporate espionage agents\nArmor ranges from light body armor, to mechanized battle armor, to the massive walking tanks called Ultra Armor.\nEach suit of armor is highly customizable, with over a 150 options to choose from.\nOver a dozen weapon systems, and hundreds of weapons to equip your character. Arm yourself with lasers, disintegrators, pulse weapons, grav sheers, grenade launchers, frost guns, and Omega weapons, just to name a few.\nDownload the FREE Battlelords Quick Start rules here:   Battlelords Quick Start Rules (PDF)  \nDownload a FREE PDF highlighting the art  in the Battlelords core rulebook here:  Battlelords Rulebook Interior Art Preview     \nOR, if you prefer video the flip through is here:  Video Flip Through of Battlelords of the 23rd Century (Kickstarter Edition) \nWhy is it called Charlie Foxtrot?\nWe cover the etymology of the term Charlie Foxtrot in the intro of the book, but what you need to know is a Charlie Foxtrot is a synonym for a major screwup.  Players participating in the scenarios included in Charlie Foxtrot will make bad decisions, screw up, flub die rolls, and generally make a mess of things. It\u2019s ok. It\u2019s what Battlelord\u2019s players do. Just roll with the bad die results (no pun intended) and worse plans, and let the dark humor of the game come through. Embrace your inner miscreant and relish in your Charlie Foxtrots. \nA Charlie Foxtrot in progress\nThe statement that \u201cNo plan survives first contact with the enemy\u201d is just as true in Battlelords as with real world military operations. It\u2019s probably more true for Battlelords of the 23rd Century.\nWhat's Inside Charlie Foxtrot?\nInside this book you\u2019ll find five scenarios complete with pre-generated characters for Battlelords of the 23rd Century. The scenarios span the gamut of experience from fresh recruit to experienced soldiers, and range from corporate espionage, to military actions against the Arachnids, to flat out piracy. There\u2019s something in here for everybody.  These are scenarios that we've run successfully for years at gaming conventions, and each is designed to be completed in roughly 4 hours of play. \nIn addition, the scenarios can be tweaked to by an aspiring GM to adjust them for the experience of occupation their players. In between several of the scenarios are short fiction pieces that we think help sets the tone for the following scenario, as well as giving the players and GM alike some deeper insights into the Battlelords universe.\nThe Scenarios include: \n Last Resort on the Space Resort - An adventure for starting characters who are just trying to find out what's bugging (and eating) the clientele at a luxury space resort. The resort was built on the skeleton of an antiquated orbital ore processing platform to save costs. The parts of the station off limits to guest are a warren of dark, pipe tunnels, with no surveillance.  What's that growling noise?  This version of \"Last Resort\" is the full version of the scenario provided in our Quick Start Rules (QSR). The version in the QSR has been shortened and includes different pre-generated characters.  This version includes the final act, the main antagonists, and is designed for a different level of character experience than the version in the QSR. It also features an additional map! \n Space Pirates - \u201cI got the access codes from a disgruntled maintenance worker. \u2018Could disable the entire alarm system, he said. Just a bunch of rich, snobby, Alliance big-wigs in their luxury space resort. Just floating around that remote, picturesque nebula, taking in the view\u2026 ripe for the pickings. How hard could it be?\u201d  The Space Pirates scenario is the Last Resort scenario played from the other side, where the characters take on the roles of the antagonists in Last Resort.\n Extract and Deliver - Your mission to extract infamous genius Edvard Bohiggens from his office on a privately owned planet, where Balshrom mega-corp tests weapons. Bohiggens is a former engineer for nihilistic genius \"Uncle Ernie\" Freilberg.  To say Bohiggens has some mental issues is an understatement, but your employer wants access to the genius that Balshrom is currently exploiting to create super-weapons. \n Express Train to Hades - Not all missions in the Battlelords' Universe are \"above board.\"  Your team has been hired to jail break Orion crime lord Rohar McCain from the prison train on the penitentiary planet, Hades.  Hades is an inhospitable hell hole of acid lakes, jagged rocks, and a corrosive atmosphere.  To make matters worse, someone on your team is a traitor. Try not to melt under the pressure. \n Routine Inspection - You and your crew are an Alliance Colony Assistance and Relief Team (ACART), more commonly called \"Colony Inspectors.\" Your job is to fly a circuit between colonies in a given sector.  When you arrive at colony world you verify that the colony is productive and self-sustaining. Your team is trained to provide medical aid, give advice on engineering and agricultural matters, and repair devices that are beyond colonists' ability to fix. Most colonies love your visits and welcome you with open arms and celebrations. The colonists on Colony RB7-1A (aka Transit) don't want you around for some reason.\n Hold the Line - What could be more glorious than being a grunt in the Galactic Army on the front lines during an Arachnid invasion of colony planet?  You thought your job was to \"Hold the Line\" against the Arachnids at the edge of the colony\u2019s main city to allow the civvies time to reach the escape shuttles. That was before your commanding officer gave you orders to leave the position on the line and provide security to a bunch of Galactic X agents who want to go on a treasure hunt in the city.\n\"Routine Inspection\" (Redacted to avoid spoilers)\n\"Extract & Deliver\" (Redacted to avoid spoilers)\nThe short fiction pieces are as follows:\n The Battlelord Arrives - What makes a Battlelord worthy of the title? What sacrifices must they make to uphold their oaths to protect the Alliance? How does the public in general perceive them?  Find out when Battlelord Siti Kurniasari risks it all to help retired Colonel Mika Sorayama defend her small colony world against an Arachnid expeditionary force. \n Final Report - Matrix Controllers possess the ability manipulate energy, minds, and living tissue.  Like everyone else in the Alliance, most are good people. What happens when you push a good person too far and they break? What happens when that person can sculpt flesh and snap bones with a touch?  Trapped on a remote mining facility on a small planetoid in the ass end of the galaxy, security chief Jabori Chukwumereije is about to find out. \n The Rebels - Encountering an Atlantean face-to-face is a life changing event that will make you re-evaluate your priorities. Particularly if it eats the face of your best mate.  Listen as Commander Chen explains how he and his crew of corporate espionage experts decided to join the rebels after an unexpected surprise during a routine snatch & grab mission. \nScreen capture from \"Last Resort\" in page layout\nWhat's in the Pledge Levels? \nIn addition to your choice of Charlie Foxtrot in PDF or PDF & Print, you can also add a copy of the core rules for Battlelords of the 23rd Century.  Some pledge levels also have Battlelords themed dog tags and t-shirts!  When we run Battlelords at conventions, all our players get a double-sided Battlelords dog tag that we designed for that year's events.  The dog tags for the Kickstarter are unique and have never been available before.  At the Colonel and General pledge ranks you'll get an exclusive digital camo Battlelords t-shirt like our convention staff wears.*\n* Final design for T-shirts and dog tags in development and subject to change.  \nAdd-Ons*\nWe have a ton of Add-Ons, so don't despair if you don't see what you want in your pledge level.  In addition to our standard t-shirts and dog tags, we also have out-of-print books (both PDF & Hardcopy) from the prior editions of Battlelords, mega-corp logo coaster sets, and limited edition t-shirts.\nLastly, we also have our coveted Battlelords toe tags. When we're feeling particularly mischievous at Battlelords games, we have been known to hand out Battlelords themed toe-tags to players whose characters died during the game. Now you can obtain one of these rare Battlelords toe tags as an Add-On. Use it to decorate your game bag or if you're the Game Master, hand it out to a player whose character has made a valiant last stand.\nAll of our non-book pledge rewards and Add-Ons were created by Ray Hedman at Phoenix Design Screen Printing and Embroidery. You can find out more about them here:  https://www.facebook.com/phoenixmuncie/   *Final designs for T-shirts, dog tags, and toe-tags in development and subject to change. \nStretch Goals\n$6,750 (UNLOCKED!)- Each backer who orders a print copy of Charlie Foxtrot (Sergeant or higher pledge level) will be able to select a free copy of any prior edition PDF for Battlelords of the 23rd Century. \n$8,000 (UNLOCKED!)- Each backer who orders a print copy of Charlie Foxtrot (Sergeant or higher pledge level) will receive a Battlelords dog tag.

An event called \"The Reckoning\" awakened an ancient evil, and you'd best hope the howls you hear on the High Plains are just a pack of ravenous wolves...\n \"The Year is 1876, but the history is not our own...\"\nThese words introduced Deadlands to the world back in 1996, spawning decades of amazing tales and memorable monsters. Now the granddaddy of Horror Western games is back with a brand new edition. \nThe cover that started it all, the original Deadlands, by Brom!\nIt's now 1884 in the official timeline. The Civil War ended in 1871 at the Battle of Washington, an epic conflagration of steam and steel. The Great Rail Wars are over as well, finishing not with a whimper but the bang of  Dr. Darius Hellstromme's ghostfire bombs at the gates of Lost Angels.\nEven the Servitors, the Reckoners' chosen champions on Earth, have been defeated\u2014at least for a while. Reverend Grimme vanished in a massive flood that destroyed his city, Raven's Last Sons were defeated by the Great Summoning, Stone was foiled in the barren expanse of Death Valley, and Dr. Hellstromme's latest scheme to open the gates of Hell proved fruitless.\nWe told the tale of the Servitors in four Plot Point Campaigns, still available and ready to play with just a little tinkering for this edition on our website!\nIn response, the Reckoners have turned their blasphemous gaze back to the grassroots of evil. They've given life to dark desires and horrible abominations that live in the shadows of the isolated frontier, far away from the attention garnered by the overt plans of their Servitors.\nThe heroes of the Weird West join with the secretive Twilight Legion in the distant outposts, chaotic boomtowns, and lonely settlements of the West to fight evil and quell the fear that gives the Reckoners their power.\nSo gather your posse of heroes and hit the trail, from the frozen north to the arid deserts of the Southwest, from the industrial East to the fractured canyons of California's \"Great Maze.\" \nThe Weird West awaits with adventure, mystery, and more monsters than you can shake a Peacemaker at.\nThink these Mojave rattlers look nasty? You should see the rest of it!\nDeadlands is the long-awaited return to Pinnacle's oldest and most popular setting. First published in 1996, the original \"Deadlands Classic\" system won countless awards and its bold, bright orange books are still a striking and valuable addition to gaming shelves the world over. \nFor those who want the whole experience, Deadlands has a rich and varied history to explore!\nDeadlands has told some epic tales since it first burst onto the scene in 1996, but you don't need to be steeped in its storied past to join in the hootin' and hollerin'. If you're an old hand, we think you'll find it both familiar and refreshing.  If you're new to the world or setting, this is the perfect time to join the wagon train (and if you've lapsed, we forgive you for that, partner). We've recapped and summarized the monumental events of the last 24 years so you can catch up.\nThis new edition is the biggest revamp of the game's background and rules since the Reloaded edition from 2005. It's been revised, rewritten, and refocused by both Deadlands Line Editor Matthew Cutter and original creator Shane Hensley.\nBack in the Saddle, by Aaron Riley!\nAll the rules have been updated and adapted to the latest version of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition. You'll need that book to play. You can add it to your pledge as an Add On if you don't already have it, or you can check out the PDF now.\nArcane Backgrounds are tightened up. Those nasty Harrowed had the same overhaul we gave them in Lost Colony (including letting the Devil out!). There are new and streamlined rules for dueling. And of course a passel of new Edges, gear, infernal devices, and powers to blast the tarnation out of the creepy crawlies coming to do your party in.\nFor you Marshals (that's what we call our Game Masters), there's a comprehensive overview of the Weird West after the events of the Servitor Plot Point Campaigns, including new plots, perils, and intrigue for cowtowns, boomtowns, and old favorites like Lost Angels, Tombstone, Deadwood, Dodge, the City o\u2019 Gloom, and a few new locales we might surprise you with! And of course this handsome tome also includes enough rascals, varmints, and critters to keep a posse busy 'til doomsday.\nThis is more than just a rules update--it's a world update! And check out that gorgeous new graphic design by Karl Keesler, with art by some of the best in the business!\nNow that the tales of the Servitors have been told in their individual Plot Point Campaigns, Deadlands is returning to its roots with more local yarns of dread, terror, and violent action. The new edition and supplements to follow turn their baleful eyes from the world-shaking events of the Reckoning to isolated frontier towns or sinister machinations in the few larger settlements. The Twilight Legion must root out the evil that lurks in all-too-human souls, the lonesome hills nearby, or the dark woods at the edge of town.\nTo showcase the return to more personal tales of horror and adventure, we've created the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign set!\nThe campaign features a single county in Wyoming and the terrors that lurk in a booming mining town and environs. Your heroes roam about the map, interacting with the locals, solving mysteries, fighting abominations, and\u2014with luck and a steady shootin' iron\u2014eventually lower the \"Fear Level.\" That's how you defeat the Reckoners' terrorforming, amigos, and Horror at Headstone Hill showcases it front and center.\nThe Horror at Headstone Hill Campaign Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands: Horror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains an introductory booklet on the region for the players with notes from Tombstone Epitaph reporter Lacy O'Malley and the Twilight Legion, a Marshal's guide detailing all the locations on the map and a full sandbox-oriented Plot Point Campaign, a poster-sized map of the county, and a selection of player handouts to drive this incredible tale of six-guns and sorcery to its bloodstained conclusion!\n Something happened at Devil's Tower recently. Something terrible. A being called the Cackler raised a powerful sorceress of legend, Morgan Le Fay, sending ripples through the many worlds of Deadlands. From the Dark Ages to the far future planet of Banshee in Lost Colony, the \"Morgana Effect\" has caused subtle changes from the world we knew before.\nThe Cackler and his unholy posse ride the range in this world-changing graphic novel by Shane Lacy Hensley!\n The Morgana Effect is a big story that ripples (quietly for now) through all the settings of Deadlands\u2014including the upcoming Deadlands: Dark Ages, the Weird West, Noir, Hell on Earth, and already released Lost Colony. It's also a story-based reason to change the rules and some parts of the setting we've been hankerin' to adjust for a while. You can read more about the latter here, but we think even those of you who have been with us since '96 will welcome the changes once you take 'er for a test ride.\nOver the years we've seen some amazing gaming setups, but collecting and painting a comprehensive collection of cowpokes and critters can be both time consuming and expensive. That's where the Deadlands Pawns come in. \nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains over 100 Deadlands characters and critters printed on thick punchboard!\nWe've created a selection of heroes, villains, and monsters in thick punchboard (the sturdy stuff board game tokens are made from) to represent some of the most common and iconic encounters in the Weird West. These figures are even die-cut to the contour of the character image to make each pose as dynamic and striking as possible.\nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard, containing over 100 pawns to bring the Weird West alive on your tabletop. If the set does well, we will expand the line to include additional Deadlands sets and pawn sets for our other lines. \nThat's enough jawin'. Now let's talk about what's really important...what you get for helping us bring the Weird West to life!\nWe've set up the reward tiers to be as simple as possible while still covering the most popular combinations you sidewinders always ask for. We've done 21 of these Kickstarters now, so we have a pretty good handle on things. But if you don't see the particular combination you want, just pledge for the book and add on anything else in the pledge manager we'll launch sometime after the campaign closes.\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nThe core book for Deadlands: The Weird West is a 192-page hardcover book, in our usual \"graphic novel\" size, and glorious, bloody, full-color throughout. That amazing cover is by Aaron Riley, a fan favorite of the entire Savage Worlds line!\nDeadlands Boxed Set contains the hardcover core rulebook, brand new poster map of the Weird West, GM Screen + Adventure, Set of 25 Bennies, Set of 7 dice, and a set of 12 Archetype Cards, along with Power Cards, Adventure Cards, and Infernal Device Cards\u2014all housed in a sturdy and attractive box to match your Deadlands: Lost Colony Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands the Weird West Core Boxed Set includes a copy of the hardcover rules as well as a brand new poster map of the Weird West by the phenomenal Cheyenne Wright, a set of 25 Bennies, a set of custom-colored dice and Wild Die, and a Game Master's screen and introductory adventure, Double Down at Sundown, by Rob Wieland!\nWant to see the new screen? Here it is, partner! The tri-fold screen is our usual landscape format with gorgeous art on one side and all the charts and tables the Marshal needs on the other!\nThe new GM Screen for Deadlands: the Weird West! Click here to view Federico Musetti's gorgeous art as a larger image.\nHorror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains a Player's Guide booklet, a Marshal's book with a full Plot Point Campaign, a poster map or Uinta County, and several pages of player aids and handouts. Art not final.\nDeadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard containing stunning full color miniatures die-cut to give you over 100 miniatures for use in your Deadlands games. Art not final.\nAfter the Kickstarter is over you'll be invited to a pledge manager so you can add any additional Pinnacle products you want to your order. Want the Rippers Resurrected Expedition Amazon supplement or Deadlands: Lost Colony or Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds Boxed Set? These will all be available to ship with your order.\nIf you want those existing items right now, partner, just head over to www.peginc.com and order, but please realize you'll have to pay shipping on that separately.\nIf you want to order everything at once in the pledge manager (to combine shipping with your Deadlands rewards) everything will be delivered toward the end of 2020. \nAdd-Ons require pledging for a physical reward level. \nAnd if you want to budget or add Deadlands-specific Add-Ons to your Kickstarter pledge now, here are the prices. Thanks as always for your support of our little company!\nWe always like to sweeten the pot. Help us reach our funding goals and we'll add a passel of digital and physical rewards. The first is a set of the cool new Harrowed \"Dominion Cards\" by Cheyenne Wright! If we reach that Stretch Goal, a set of cards will be added to every Deadlands Core Boxed Set. (You can order them as an Add-On as well.)\nWant to hear more from Sounds Like Crowes? Check out their website here.\nLearn more about the Wildcards and Saving Throw by clicking here!\nCheck back frequently to see where we're at, and tell your friends to check out our project\u2014every pledge means more for everyone!\nHelp us unlock more stretch goals by sharing the project! Here's where you can find us on social media:\nDeadlands and Horror at Headstone Hill are both written and in layout. Your help allows us to create all the extras we want to make and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the core rules a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website and DriveThruRPG.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. You will pay for shipping after the Kickstarter using the pledge manager. \nClick here to view larger image\nAll prices in USD and based on estimates calculated April 2020.\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know that international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your amigos pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail site.admin@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter product before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle product with their order.

Lost to history, this time is remembered in the echoes of myth and legend. The land was once besieged by the Horrors, foul creatures from the depths of astral space that seek to feed on and destroy all that is living and good.\nTheir time -- the time of the Scourge -- has passed. The people of the world have returned to the surface reclaiming the lands that were once their home. Brave heroes band together to explore the wilds of Barsaive, fighting the Horrors that remain and protecting their loved ones from those who would dominate and enslave them.\nEarthdawn is a fantasy role-playing game currently in its fourth edition. After more than 25 years it continues to deliver a setting tinged with a compelling mix of high magic and horror flavored with a dash of post-apocalypse and a generous sprinkling of hope.\nA group of Adepts preparing for battle\nSecrets of the Denairastas\nWe have released several products for the Earthdawn line in the past five years: Four core rulebooks (Player's Guide, Gamemaster's Guide, Companion, and Mystic Paths), three sourcebooks (Travar: The Merchant City, Elven Nations, and Questors), a GM Screen, Quick Start Guide, and several entries in our ongoing Legends of Barsaive adventure series.\nThe next sourcebook is ready to go. The full text is written and through preliminary layout. This campaign is to help cover production costs of paying the freelancers (writers, artists, and other production staff) who contributed to the book, and pay for printing and physical production.\nIopos: Lair of Deceit is a 256-page sourcebook that lays bare the intricacies of Barsaive\u2019s most secretive city and family. It presents the surviving history of Iopos, secrets of the Holders of Trust\u2014the Copper, Silver, Gold, Orichalcum, and newly revealed Malachite Branches\u2014and the current state of Jerris, their most recent acquisition. Even some of the darkest places in Iopos, such as the Thricewoven Flesh Forges and the abominations crafted within.\nPlayers will find invaluable information for infiltrating this city as agents of external powers, and descriptions of daily life for Iopan characters. Gamemasters will uncover the layers of deception in a city that is always watching, plot hooks to bring characters to the lair of the Denairastas, and ideas for groups who join the Holders of Trust and execute their masters\u2019 plan to conquer Barsaive. All of this plus new creatures, Horror constructs, opponents, masks, thread items, and revelations about the Oath of Affirmation.\nRewards and Add-Ons \nBack this Kickstarter, and you get access to the pre-art draft of the manuscript (it will be linked in a backers-only post shortly after the campaign closes). We offer this to show that the text is complete--the book just needs to make its way through the rest of the production process. You'll also get early access to what's inside, and will be able to start using it in your game right away!\nWe're offering the new book in PDF and physical versions. We have reward tiers that include previously released books in case you missed our earlier Kickstarters or weren't aware the game had returned. All the available books are in print and in stock, so there's no additional wait for delivery.\nFor those looking to fill in holes in their collection that an existing pledge bundle doesn't satisfy, we are also offer single-book add-on options. Prices (and additional shipping charges) are as follows: \nAdd-On Prices\nIndividual add-on books include the PDF version at no additional charge. If you are adding physical product to a PDF-only tier, the first book is $8 shipping (even if it is noted as free shipping above), with added costs based on additional books ordered. The reward tiers include standard (softcover) editions. If you want to upgrade any books in a tier from standard to deluxe, add $40 per book.\nFor all add-ons, please include the amount of the add-on in your pledge. You will be able to indicate specific add-on choices as part of the survey at the end of the campaign. You can adjust your pledge amount (or change your chosen reward tier) at any point before the campaign ends. \nEarthdawn (Standard Edition) Core Book Covers\nStretch Goals\nIf we reach $10,000, we will produce a fortieth anniversary FASA pin. These will be produced alongside the books and will ship with your other physical product. Adding on the pin will be $4 for backers and will ship with physical product for no additional charge.\nBecause of the current global pandemic, we understand that finances might be tight and life a little uncertain for our fans. As a result, we've decided to hold off on any additional stretch goals for this campaign. We have ideas, but have decided to push them off until a later campaign.\nNew to Earthdawn?\nOriginally released in 1993, Earthdawn was named one of \"The Millennium's Most Underrated Games\" by Pyramid magazine in 1999, and 24th in Arcane magazine's 1996 reader poll of the 50 most popular role-playing games of all time. The game delivers a richly developed setting flavored with high fantasy, post-apocalypse, and horror. In 2014 a successful Kickstarter brought the fourth edition to life.\nLong ago the world was alive with magic, giving rise to strange creatures and exotic races only remembered today in the echoes of myth and legend. The level of magic rises and falls over thousands of years. At its height, foul creatures from the depths of the Netherworlds--called Horrors--breach the barrier between their native plane and ours, leading to a centuries-long time of destruction called the Scourge.\nEarthdawn is set in the aftermath of the most recent Scourge. The player characters are adepts, heroes who draw on magical powers to explore the world, recover knowledge lost to the Scourge, and fight those that who threaten the lives of innocents--including the remaining Horrors. Each adept follows a Discipline, defining that defines the focus and scope of their magical abilities. Some adepts hone their combat skills, some enhance their mental and social abilities, while others learn and cast spells.\nThe core game engine of Earthdawn is the Step System. As your character gains power and advances along the path of their Discipline you roll progressively larger dice, with open-ended rolls allowing for potentially legendary results. Adepts can further enhance their magical abilities through the use of karma, adding additional dice to your rolls.\nThe Earthdawn Quick Start Guide (available free at our web shop or on Drive-Thru RPG) provides a great overview of the game system, examples of the magical powers available, and includes sample characters and a brief introductory adventure.\nNamegivers of Barsaive\nReturning to Earthdawn?\nIf you've been away from Earthdawn for a while, the new edition should be familiar, but a few things have changed to open up new design space and incorporate lessons learned over the years.\nThe core game engine remains largely the same. The specific dice used in a few places have been tweaked to smooth out some bumps in the underlying probability curves, but still uses all the common polyhedrals.\nThe game no longer uses the success level table from previous editions. Instead, every five points over the target number scores an additional success. This new mechanic has been incorporated into most of the game's talents, skills, and spells so that--in general--better rolls mean better results.\nFourth edition keeps the \"talent option\" approach to Disciplines introduced in third edition, but has refined the required talents to be more broadly useful, and improves the choices available at each tier to allow for better customization options.\nSpellcasting includes the concept of extra threads, allowing magicians to enhance their spells as they cast them. This gives lower-Circle spells a longer life and more utility over the course of the character's career.\nThe timeline has been advanced. It is a few years after the Second Theran War, with a new status quo in Barsaive. In the wake of the war, the dwarfs of Throal has have a new royal family on the throne and withdrawn from provincial affairs. In that void, other political powers expand their influence... including the Denairastas clan of Iopos.\nThis is a great time to get back into the game, and this project gives you access to the books we've released so far at a discount. Why not journey back to Barsaive, and build some new legends? \nA t'skrang boatman sailing the Serpent River", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver this product. The text is written, it only needs to make its way through the rest of the production pipeline. We have already completed and released seven books for the Earthdawn Fourth Edition line along with several smaller products.\n\nOf course, any project includes risk. Unforeseen production delays or other issues may crop up that push the release of the final product beyond the currently anticipated date, but we have already factored some wiggle room into our delivery estimates.\n\nWe have learned many lessons from our previous successful kickstarters. While more books are planned and in development, they will not appear as stretch goals for this project so that we can focus on closing out this campaign and delivering all promised rewards in a timely manner.\n\nWhile there may be concerns given the Covid-19 pandemic, our plans should not be overly affected. Our books are printed and bound in the United States, and as of the launch of this campaign our printer is still operating.

The portal, called a Crossing, took you to a world you thought only existed in novels and films: a magical land where dragons roam the skies, orcs and hobgoblins terrorize weary travelers, and unicorns prance through the forest. It is a world where humans join other peoples such as elves, trolls, dwarves, changelings, and the dreaded creatures who steal the night. It is a world of fantasy \u2014 of imagination.\nIt is the Realm. \nIt is Legendlore. \nDrawn from The Realm and Legendlore comics, the Legendlore RPG will whisk characters from our world to a magical fantasy realm filled with dragons, orcs, unicorns, and hobgoblins. With over 60 comics published covering three volume runs, The Realm and Legendlore combined became one of Caliber Comics' most critically acclaimed series.\nIn the Legendlore RPG, players can choose to play as themselves or create a new character employing the 5th Edition Fantasy Rules System.\nAre you ready for a magical adventure?\nArt by Gong Studios\nLegendlore was originally a comic called The Realm, first published by Arrow Comics in 1986 and since procured by Caliber Comics, about four people who fall through a Crossing into the Realm. The Realm is home to fantasy creatures from elves to dragons, and the characters discover they too have \u2018fantasy powers\u2019 \u2013 the jock becomes a Fighter, while the bookish one becomes a Wizard, and so on. They go on adventures and some of them eventually find their way back to Earth.\nThis is the basic premise of the Legendlore RPG. You Cross into the Realm, where you become a hairfoot Bard, or maybe an elven Sorcerer. You can change any characteristics you like. For example if you have hay fever and glasses, you choose if your Legendlore self keeps or drops those. Your identity might not always match your outward physique, but your Legendlore character does. We've also updated the 1980s setting so Realmborn characters represent all ethnicities, genders, and sexualities. No one in the Realm will bat an eyelash at your agender panromantic self.\nYou are not the first from Earth to encounter the nations of the Realm. The Realm has had Visitors before, and each time these Visitors left something with the Realm: whether it be a new word, or even accidental technology. Some Visitors became stranded and formed their own communities out of an immediate need for survival. These communities can still be found in the Realm, though they tend to be pockets of isolation and have their own customs and concerns even if they are within the boundaries of other nations. Sharp-eyed Visitors may recognize aspects of their world turned into phenomena: in the depths of a forest, they may encounter a glider plane abandoned with vines anchoring it to the soil, its metal rusting, its markings faded under a strange sun its paint was never meant to withstand. These phenomena are considered Strange Things throughout the Realm.\nJust as Earth had impacts on the Realm, the Realm can change a Visitor from Earth. Legends are the destinies Visitors may have when Crossing into the Realm: it is part of their Crossing, part of their destiny.\nEach character has their own Legend, which affects the story and is built up through relatively minor actions as well as through more obviously weighty choices. Legends are things like \u201cAvatar of Peace\u201d or \u201cRegent of Dragons\u201d or \u201cHeir to the Mountain\u201d: they represent the destiny of You (your character) and mechanically can resemble backgrounds. Perhaps the You you want to be in the Realm is trying to not spread any more violence than absolutely necessary for self-defense. As a Player, you might want their destiny to reflect that commitment to peaceful solutions and to avoid continuing cycles of revenge and violence: thus the \u201cAvatar of Peace\u201d Legend. The seeds of that legend are there, but how does that affect You throughout Your adventures in the Realm?\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed in four color gloss, with  more than 250 full-color pages and endpapers on high-quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play, We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nThe Legendlore RPG uses rules based on the 5th Edition of the world's most popular fantasy tabletop RPG system, and comprises three sections (Player, Setting, Game Master) spread across 14 chapters.\nChapter One: Welcome to the Realm \nChapter Two: Crossing \nChapter Three: People of East Azoth \nChapter Four: Classes \nChapter Five: Backgrounds and Feats \nChapter Six: Magic, Spells, and Rituals \nChapter Seven: East Azoth \nChapter Eight: Nations of East Azoth \nChapter Nine: Dangerous Places \nChapter Ten: Allies and Adversaries \nChapter Eleven: Running the Game \nChapter Twelve: Creatures of East Azoth \nChapter Thirteen: Magic Items and Strange Things \nChapter Fourteen: Voices from Afar  \nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Legendlore RPG manuscript as backer-only updates.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of the Legendlore RPG possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that main goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Legendlore, possibly expanding into rules companions and other Game Master and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our fantasy family.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($20,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to summon a larger version of this chart\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Digital Traveler and First time Traveler Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (Traveler to the Realm Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Purveyor of Books and Librarian of Isliadril Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Legendlore RPG campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Olardellian Trader) will get 5 copies of the Legendlore RPG rulebook (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Legendlore setting or a possible future supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for the Legendlore RPG. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nPDF VERSION - The digital version of the Legendlore RPG, fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive a reception link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DrivethruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nHARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For the Legendlore RPG, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-on-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\n For only +$20, Add On an additional PDF copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list.\nFor only +$10, Add On a PDF copy of the Scarred Lands Player's Guide (5E) to your rewards list.\nLegendlore started as a comic book, and now our partners at Caliber Comics have made the graphic novels available to the Legendlore RPG kickstarter backers as Add On rewards, to be fulfilled by DriveThruComics.com. \nLegendlore V1 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 1-5; 153 pages.\nLegendlore V2 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 6-7, and the Tales of the Realm mini-series that depicted Lord Darkoth\u2019s assault on the Rainbow Elf Kingdom; 180 pages.\nLegendlore V3 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 8-11; 138 pages.\n PHYSICAL REWARDS\n  All physical items that will require shipping (additional books) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of the Legendlore RPG (Reward Tiers of $50+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when the book becomes available.\nFor only +$45, add an additional hardcover copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list. U.S. Residents only.\n For only +$65, add an additional hardcover copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list. Non-U.S. Residents only.\nFor only +$30, Add On a hardcover copy of the Scarred Lands Player's Guide (5E) to your rewards list. This reward will be sent at alongside your Legendlore RPG hardcover when that reward is complete and ready to go. To add this option on to your rewards list, your reward tier must include a hardcover copy (and, therefore, any additional shipping charges) of the Legendlore RPG (so, reward tiers of $50+).\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement\n\nWhen you pledge to a reward tier that includes a physical item (the Legendlore RPG hardcover rulebook), Kickstarter will automatically calculate additional shipping costs based on your location.\nUnfortunately, international shipping has become increasing expensive and is often prohibitive to non-US backers. Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to  keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $30 First time Traveler reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 Good Friend reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, buy the physical book via your local game store when it hits distribution.\nWait and buy the physical book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. You can even encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Olardellian Trader) for this campaign.\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\n  After the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for the LegendLore RPG is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Richard Thomas\n46 created \u00b7 147 backed\nIn 1986 I became the Art Director of White Wolf Magazine, responsible for the visuals that are such an integral part of our White Wolf...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Good Friend", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Digital Traveler", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of the Legendlore RPG.\nINCLUDES:\nLEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["77 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "First time Traveler", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of the Legendlore RPG.\nINCLUDES:\nLEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: LEGENDLORE RPG\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["24 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Traveler to the Realm", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of the Legendlore RPG.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nLEGENDLORE RPG Hardcover Book\nLEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: LEGENDLORE RPG\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["106 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 95 or more", "title": "Purveyor of Books", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive TWO (2) copies of the PDF and TWO (2) copies of the hardcover version of the Legendlore RPG.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG Hardcover Book\n2\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\n2\u00d7 \"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: LEGENDLORE RPG\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Experienced Traveler", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of the Legendlore RPG, as well as a BOOK PLATE signed by members of the creative team.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nSPECIAL: Signed Book Plate\nLEGENDLORE RPG Hardcover Book\nLEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: LEGENDLORE RPG\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 180 or more", "title": "Olardellian Trader **Retail Tier**", "descp": "** For Qualified Retailers Only ** Contact RichT@theonyxpath.com to confirm your retailer status.\nAs thanks for your support, you'll receive FIVE (5) copies of the PDF and FIVE (5) copies of the hardcover version of the Legendlore RPG.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG Hardcover Book\n5\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 230 or more", "title": "Librarian of Isliadril", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive FIVE (5) copies of the PDF and FIVE (5) copies of the hardcover version of the Legendlore RPG.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG Hardcover Book\n5\u00d7 LEGENDLORE RPG PDF Version\n5\u00d7 \"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: LEGENDLORE RPG\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Seasoned Traveler", "descp": "As a special reward, you will submit a name that will be used for a Non-player Character (NPC) which will be incorporated into the Legendlore setting (via supplemental PDF if necessary).

With Norse Grimoire you can improve your Journey To Ragnarok sessions and setting, but you can also power up characters or worlds from any setting you like.\nOur goal is to enhance both the Adventurers and the Players' experience, adding game options and trying to transmit an ancient culture that we love.\nGaldrakver and Samtiningur grimoires\nTo better understand Icelandic staves and the Runes, we decided to focus our research on ancient sources. Poetic and Prose Edda, along with Runic Poems, led our way on the path shaped by Odhinn in his journey through the Nine Worlds. For Icelandic symbols, we browsed through the pages of authentic grimoires filled with cryptic runes and staves, whose Norse echoes, sometimes bounded to continental magic, Middle Age esoteric or alchemical doctrine, unveiling a meaningful world permeated by magic.\nHuld Manuscript\nNorse Sagas and Runic Stones were also valuable sources for our research, revealing a world full of deep meanings and filled with magic.\nNorse Grimoire is born from the collaboration between: \n Michele Paroli, author of Journey To Ragnarok and Historia 5th edition projects, founder and lead designer of Mana Project Studio.\n Marco B Bucci, author of the fantasy comic book series Magna Veritas for Soleil and Nomen Omen for Panini Comics and Image Comics, designer for the board game Dogs of War for CMON Limited and author of the Memento Mori roleplaying game for Raven Distribution. \n Mila Fois, author of many mythologic novels and the Meet Myths book series.\n Andrea Guardino, concept artist and illustrator for Journey To Ragnarok.\nYou can find the full team of this project in the campaign section.\nBooks form the Meet Myths series at conventions.\n\nJourney To Ragnarok Reprint\nSince the Journey To Ragnarok Kickstarter delivery, we received many requests for the campaign exclusives, like the D24 RuneDice, the English edition of the Game Master Screen, and the high-quality hardback prints of Journey to Ragnarok - Adventure and Setting, as only a few hundreds of items were manufactured during the campaign.\nNow we need your help to be able to bring a large-scale retail edition to life, taking the chance to correct a few typos and mistakes, with new editing by the award-winning author and translator Jason R. Forbus (also the founder and director of Ali Ribelli Edizioni | https://www.aliribelli.com/).\nLanguages\nWe are going to produce all the books and items of this campaign in English and Italian language.

We work hard to keep these costs as low as possible.\nAn add-on is an optional item that can be added to a Kickstarter pledge without changing pledge levels. Please note that if you select some add-ons starting from a PDF-only pledge, you'll be charged for shipping fees.\nExample:\nA backer, who has already pledged 44\u20ac for the Norse Grimoire Hardcover + D24 Die + PDf reward tier, would then need to add 20\u20ac to their pledge to claim an additional Game Master Screen. The total would now be 64\u20ac.\nIn general, you should be able to select an add-on by doing the following:\n 1. Click the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page.\n 2. Increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the add-on(s).\n 3. Save your pledge. Do not change the tier that you originally pledged at.\nYou will choose your add-ons in the pledge manager after the end of the Kickstarter campaign.

But is there more truth to the story than she knows?\nFor those who are new to Myth or who missed the Myth Limited Edition rulebook, this book still includes much of the fantastic world-building from that previous volume, such as:\nLore overviews for every hero class introduced so far\nGuidance for solo play, including multi-class deck construction\nThe Art of Myth\nA full bestiary, including brand-new information about the Lucanines\nWhether you are a veteran hero or are just beginning your journey into Myth, The World of Myth has many wonderful new things to discover. \nThis is a small, straightforward campaign, so we\u2019ve kept our reward levels to a minimum.

Myth is a cooperative miniatures adventure game created by Brian Shotton, Kenny Sims, and Keith Lowe. \nUlisses Spiele purchased Myth in 2018, bringing Brian and Keith along to ensure that all future development would stay faithful to the game\u2019s spirit as we develop new stories. Ulisses is helping to keep the promises of the past while building for the future. \nWe are in the process of completing the remaining goals from the Journeyman Kickstarter, and we are offering World of Myth because we know that many of you wanted a leatherbound book of your own. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, we are getting ready to bring Myth back in a huge way. Be sure to follow the Ulisses Spiele Facebook page and sign up for our mailing list so that you can get the news as soon as it\u2019s available!\nWe are trying to keep the shipping costs down as much as possible by making all the packages simple and identical, but the realities of international shipping do require us to charge enough to compensate for those costs.

It's not like, a really small Cthulhu, but a Lovecraftian RPG powered by a minimalist ruleset! \nUsing the rules in this book, you'll be able to play investigators, doomed heroes, and classic cosmic horror characters of all types, from scientists and librarians, to WWI veterans, to mysterious guardians defending the world from the dark powers of cthonic entities!\nCover Mockup: Art by Tom Brown, Logo by Robert Denton\nCharacter creation is simple, fast, and exciting. You pick your character archetype based on the exciting stories your Game Master is going to tell, you pick a few Traits that each grant a single benefit, and you're done!\nTiny Cthulhu features a myrid of settings set throughout the world and history, ranging from prehistory to the Bronze Age,  Age of Sail, World War 1, modern day, as well as fantasy, superheroes and the science fiction future!\nYou can survive cosmic horror in any time or place! (Lucky you!)\nAdditionally, each setting will have appendices that details how you can integrate other TinyD6 books like Tiny Dungeon 2e, Tiny Supers, and Tiny Frontiers: Revised with Tiny Cthulhu to create robust and unique experiences. \nInterior art by Nicolas Giacondino\nSometimes as the GM, you don't have time to plot lengthy, detailed worlds, but you want that experience. Well, we've got your back, and that support comes in the form of micro-settings!\nMicro-settings are short settings filled with adventure hooks, and designed to put your adventures and campaigns right into the thick of it, with as little work on the GM's part as necessary. \nOur goal is to fund a softcover edition, a limited number of hardcover collector\u2019s editions, and the Tiny Cthulhu dice. We\u2019ve planned several stretch goals which will increase page count, add more art, add more special rules but all of our goals will provide you with more fun and engaging cosmic horror tabletop content (is fun even the right word?)!\nThe interior art is filled with gorgeous black and white art from the very talented Nicol\u00e1s Giacondino, and the cover of the standard edition has been done by Tom Brown! \nAdditionally, the writing on the Tiny Cthulhu is being handled by top industry talent. We're set on paying all our contributors well, and our goal reflects our commitment to an ethical pay rate for our writers, artists, and team members.\n\nThe Illumination of Aldebaran Cover Mockup! Art by Tom Brown\nTiny Cthulhu uses a simple, fast, and dynamic rule-set to handle actions. The game uses up to three six-sided dice as part of action resolution.\nIf you roll a \"5\" or \"6\" on a die, your check succeeds. Most checks are made with two dice. However, if you are deemed to have \"advantage\" on a roll, you gain a third die to roll. If you have disadvantage, you lose a dice (rolling only a single die).\nCharacters are made quickly and easily. You will select an archetype (such as Investigator, Scientist, Veteran, Socialite or more), three traits, and write down some basic information and you are ready to play!\nInterior art by Nicolas Giacondino\nIf you're familiar with the TinyD6 ruleset, you're probably wanting to know what's new in the game! Well, Tiny Cthulhu features the following:\nMinimalist Corruption rules focused on aiding storytelling. The Corruption rules in Tiny Cthulhu focus on showcasing how having your reality undermined by unimaginable horrors affects the character, and how individuals must commit every fiber of their being when trying to overcome cosmic horrors like these! \nNew enemies, new Environment Traits to aid the otherworldly storytelling, and new rules for magic and tomes!\nSupport for Pulp-style storytelling! A chapter titled Tiny Pulp will feature in this book, having unique rules for pulp and two-fisted action heroism! \nSupport for Noir-style storytelling! Integral to the Cthulhu mythos, Tiny Cthulhu will have a Tiny Noir chapter with minimalist investigation rules, details and help for constructing your own investigations. \nGadgets, Steampunk themes and more are integrated into Tiny Cthulhu!\nOur goal is to give you the most useful genre-book for Lovecraftian horror that we can!\n Micro-settings are unique, small settings that are specifically designed to be used as a tool, resource, or spring-board for your own campaigns. They're light on specific and deep details, but contain adventure hooks, overarching themes and plots, and the sort of building platform you need as a GM to get going!\nThey're short, 4-8 page high-level settings, designed to provide an evocative framework for each GM to launch their own variation and home campaign from.\nAll of the micro-settings come with some story that is designed to be unique to that particular micro-setting.\nOur micro-setting authors are a mix of industry veterans and new voices, each bringing a unique aspect to Tiny Cthulhu . Micro-settings are unlocked by stretch goals, and you can find out more further down the page.\nInterior art by Nicolas Giacondino\nThe book will be 5.5 x 8.5 in dimensions. If we unlock all the stretch goals, the book will be over 150 pages. Without, it'll be closer to 40.\nIf you want to add an extra softcover of Tiny Cthulhu you can increase your pledge by $20 USD. (No extra cost for shipping if you have a physical pledge already!)\nThe custom dice are pictured below. They'll be manufactured by our friends at Black Oak Workshop! They are an ivory color and a larger 19mm size, and best of all, they also glow in the dark!\nIf you want to add an extra set of dice (they come as sets of three), you'll want to increase your pledge by $10 USD. (No extra cost for shipping if you have a physical pledge)\nThe Tiny Cthulhu dice from Black Oak Workshop! (Yes, they glow in the dark!)\n The GM screen is 5x7, trifold, matte GM Screens (they'll be card-stock and light-weight, to fit the minimalist style of the game).\nIf you want more than one GM screen, you can add more for $2 USD each! (No extra cost for shipping if you have a physical pledge!)\nThe handcrafted dice-bags on the deluxe level look like the picture below. As a hand made item, there is always variation and inconsistencies in the fabric, coloring or pattern, but never the quality! These  project specific dicebags (and the accompanying hardcovers) are Kickstarter exclusives and are never sold retail after the Kickstarter is over.\nPrototype Bag!\nOur previous games are all available on DriveThruRPG! We'll also offer copies of them through the BackerKit if you want to combine shipping on any items!\nThe Decks!\nYou might be looking at our stretch goals and wondering what these decks of cards are! We've unlocked 4 decks.\nThe goal of the decks is to provide tools for players and GMs to keep track of rules and objects at the table. As a designer, I'm a big fan of cards as an optional tool to help ease game play, especially when you need to reference items that aren't always on your character sheet.\n Every backer who is getting a PDF of Tiny Cthulhu will get a PDF of any unlocked decks of cards. It's that easy. The stretch goal covers the digital reward for everyone! Yay! More madness!\n But we also want to do print versions. So, any backer can add $10 per deck of cards to get a physical version in their pledge. All you have to do is go to the Manage My Pledge button up top, and increase your pledge by $10 for each deck you want (including multiples if you want.)\nAnd yes, you can add-on for decks that we haven't unlocked yet, as it'll help us unlock them!\nThe cards will be printed using the DriveThruCards service unless we can get 500 orders for them, after which we can print them with a two-piece box in an off-set run from a card printer! We're also exploring other options!\n Mythos Spells deck provides specific spells on cards that anyone with the Spell-Touched Trait can use. Each of these spells also can be used by an investigator that doesn't have the Spell-Touched Trait, but at a higher corruption cost to themselves.\n MythosTomedeck of cards serves a similar purpose, but focused on occult books, scrolls, folios, tomes and more! Each contains a book, a brief description of some potential history, and it's in game effects (generally providing Advantage at a corruption cost to a general topic of Mythos lore, but sometime they have more...esoteric impacts.)\n Mythos Bestiary deck consists of a collection of non-human enemies and beasts that you can interact with, summon, fight and more! These will be similar to our Tiny Dungeon 2e Enemy Deck, but with improvements over what we learned when we made that three years ago.\n Mythos Location deck consists of two parts. One portion of the deck is reference cards for locations throughout the Mythos. These are prebuilt locations that state the collection of traits that define that location. The second half of the Mythos Location deck is a series of cards that have a single Environmental Trait on them. These cards all share an identical back, so if you want to randomly generate traits for a new location, you can!  You can just shuffle them up and deal them out. They also work great as detailed references for that card's listed Trait rules as they'll be printed on the card.\n Cults deck preview coming!\nUp Next!\n We're a small company, and we do our own fulfillment, so we can ensure it's done right. This does lead to high international costs, due to customs and the generally high price of shipping.\nShipping is charged in our post-crowdfunding pledge manager (we use CrowdOx.) \nWe do offer international shipping of course, but we can't offer refunds on your pledge because shipping was more than you thought. It can get very expensive (please be aware.) \nHowever, we do always put our books in Print-On-Demand on DriveThruRPG, so don't hesitate to just get the PDF and you can get the book later!\nIf you need shipping estimates, feel free to reach out to  shipping@gallantknightgames.com.\nAll of our digital rewards (and our print on demand rewards) are being handled by our fulfillment partners at DriveThruRPG!\n Gallant Knight Games is a indie game company ran by Alan and Erin Bahr. This is our 14th GKG Kickstarter!\nSome of our previous TinyD6 Kickstarters (Tiny Frontiers and Tiny Frontiers: Mecha & Monsters) delivered early to backers (4 months in the case of Tiny Frontiers), and Tiny Dungeon 2e was on time! We've hit some hiccups in the last two years by taking on too much, but we've committed to slowing down and delivering great, on time content. \nOur micro-settings are written by some of the most talented freelancers in the RPG business!\nTiny Cthulhu has been in development since 2017 and been in play-testing for over a year! The art is all in and paid for (with the exception of any stetch goals). The goal of this Kickstarter is to pay for the print run and unlock our stretch goals, making this a truly gorgeous book.\nClick the image above to join the GKG Discord!\nYou can click the image above to join our Facebook Group!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Can Gallant Knight Games handle this project?\nThis is Gallant Knight Games' fourteenth Kickstarter, and we learned a lot from our previous ones. We have one late project that's are not out to backers yet, but it's nearing completion (digital rewards are already out) and Tiny Cthulhu will not impact that project. This is a straight-forward project with some nuances, but we're prepared to handle them, and we're shooting for the same exceptional success we've always had! This is our bread and butter and we've gotten very good at our TinyD6 line and delivery!\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished?\nA: The draft text of all the rules is 100% done. All the art that isn't tied to stretch goals is in and done. The only text we're waiting on is the \"micro-verses\" and our stretch goals, and as we depend on the backers to determine what needs to be written, those will come throughout and after the Kickstarter.\n\nQ: What if the complexity of the project overwhelms GKG?\nA: We have straight forward pledge levels to make it easy to manage, and we've budgeted our stretch goals up to our cap. In order to keep the project manageable for our small team, we've elected to minimize our stretch goals to text increases, and we've set a finite limit of page count.\n\nQ: What about delays in art?\nA: We've already contracted and finished the core art for the game. Isn't it great? We're really happy with our artists. We've got some stretch goals for more art, but our artists are professionals. If there's a delay on the art, we have back-up artists we've already done test runs and are ready to work with.\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs?\nA: Shipping costs constantly rise, and while we've projected them to the best of our abilities, there's not a lot we can do if they change. However, due to the limitations on the size of our product, we're confident this won't be an issue.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals?\nA: If something were to happen to Alan, or another writer on the project, we've identified our backups, and our team is spread all over the world. It'd take a really big asteroid, zombie apocalypse or alien invasion to wipe us all out. The files and plans have been communicated to the whole team, and a new project lead (who has been identified) will step up.\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\nWe hold rewards for a year from fulfillment start date, after which, we can no longer promise that we'll be able to fulfill your rewards. We're a small company with limited space, and while we've never had an issue, it's better to be clear about our practices so you're aware. Once we start shipping, if your reward gets returned, or your fulfillment info wasn't provided, we'll give you a full calendar year and ship that reward for you. If it's after that year, we might not have it, or we might have to ask you to pay new shipping charges (shipping goes up a lot!)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Random Cosmic Horror!", "descp": "You get 3 of the Tiny Supers d6 dice!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign, in our pledge manager, and we ship all packages from the US.

A fire is lit \u2014 is it a lamp perched over the inscription on an ancient blade or a roaring conflagration consuming the house in which the howling fiends wait? Things will never be the same after this. You\u2019ve set forth on a damning path. Carry the Vigil. Fight back the shadows.\nIn Hunter: The Vigil, you play out stories following a core cast of characters as they fight their way through the Chronicles of Darkness, a version of our own everyday world filled with monsters. It\u2019s a lot like a TV drama, something like The Walking Dead or The X-Files. Individual gaming sessions, generally running two-to-four hours, are like weekly episodes. Secrets will be revealed, relationships will be tested, and blood will be spilled.\nArtwork by Aaron Acevedo\nWhen you create a character, you choose between three tiers of gameplay. At tier one, your characters will fight monsters with little to no support. They may find allies along the way, but they\u2019re on their own. At tier two, you play hunters backed by a compact that typically operates on a regional level. Your hunters have more guns and gear to fight the darkness. At tier three, you play cogs in a global conspiracy that has plenty of resources \u2014 and politics to boot. Conspiracies have more information about the supernatural than they let on, but even then...it\u2019s unclear if the lore they\u2019ve acquired is accurate or not.\nThree to five players are recommended to play Hunter, but the game can be played with two people. Each player slips into the role of a hunter. You\u2019ll make decisions for your hunter \u2014 when their best friend betrays them, you plot a scheme for revenge. When another hunter picks a fight, you decide whether your character runs or negotiates with them. Perhaps most importantly, you\u2019ll tell the story of how your hunters, even though they\u2019re terrified, stand up to monsters to uphold the Vigil.\nArtwork by Leo Albiero\nHunter: The Vigil first hit shelves in 2008. It was a popular game line that presented a new take for mortal protagonists compared to the core Chronicles of Darkness rulebook from 2004. It quickly became a fan favorite and spawned several supplements, including Slashers. No longer were ordinary humans going to be swept up in the machinations of the unknown; now it was time for them to take up the torch and fight back against the darkness.\nNow, over 10 years later, Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition is designed with a new premise: There are more monsters today than ever before. The rules found in this book are designed to give players and Storytellers new, flexible tools to identify, hunt, and capture monsters while enhancing the definition of what is means to be a hunter.\nArtwork by Tilen Javornik\nHunter: The Vigil Second Edition is a standalone game that can be played by new or existing players. The lore has been updated to not only reflect the uptick in monsters, but also the fact that hunting monsters is not exclusive to a location, group of people, or time period. There may be more monsters than ever before, but now there are more ways to fight them, too.\nIn Hunter: The Vigil, anyone can be a hunter \u2014 provided you are committed to the hunt. It is a game of personal horror and sacrifice that tests relationships and encourages teamwork within a cell, compact, or conspiracy.\nWill you heed the call? Will you uphold the Vigil?\nThis Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a hardcover edition designed to match the look and feel of our other Chronicles of Darkness core rulebooks such as Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, and Changeling: The Lost.\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed on a metallic under layer, and featuring an emboss/deboss of the logo. We estimate the book to be more than 250 pages, with a two-color interior and endpapers on high-quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play, including...! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nArtwork and design subject to change.\nHunter: The Vigil Second Edition includes all the rules you need to play a hunter in a tier-one, -two, or -three chronicle.\n Chapter One: Flickering Candles provides an overview of a hunter\u2019s world; the history of the hunt; the types of hunters you can play; and three, separate types of gameplay included in this book: tiers one, two, and three.\n Chapter Two: Compacts and Conspiracies are specialized hunter organizations that may be used for tier-two or -three games. In this chapter, you\u2019ll read more about Hunter lore and the history of the compacts and conspiracies, find write-ups for six compacts and six conspiracies, along with rules for tier-three Endowments and how to make them.\n Chapter Three: Character Creation allows you to build and customize a character. You\u2019ll learn how hunters retain one foot in an unsuspecting world and another in the Vigil. Plus, you\u2019ll discover more about the Code and how it shapes hunters\u2019 core identities and beliefs.\n Chapter Four: Rules of the Hunt dives into the rules for gameplay. It also offers rules for specific aspects of Hunter that includes investigation and socializing along with teamwork and Tactics.\n Chapter Five: Monsters Around the World offers a taste of the strange and unusual monsters hunters may come across during the hunt. Sample monsters are presented according to the type of terrain from which they originate along with notes for how these creatures may be modified. Additionally, monster-creation rules, ephemeral-entity rules, and Dread Powers are found in this chapter.\n Chapter Six: Mysterious Places takes another look at the Hunter setting by introducing where monsters live, locations the supernatural has tainted, and which places are actually monsters themselves. It offers new rules to handle each type of location, along with several examples.\n Chapter Seven: The Slasher Chronicle is a sample chronicle setting. Yanked from the slasher-movie genre, the Slasher Chronicle is a horror-movie-themed setting that includes a new slasher-specific compact and conspiracy, rules for building slashers, customized approaches for tier-one, -two, and -three gameplay, new Storyteller characters, and more!\n Chapter Eight: Storytelling offers advice for Storytellers to help build and manage a chronicle while fleshing out rules for Storyteller characters. Additional content includes advice for creating player-facing compacts and conspiracies.\nThe Appendices provide Equipment, Conditions, and Tilts likely to come into play in Hunter. \nArtwork by Sam Araya\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition manuscript as backer-only updates.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition, possibly expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of the Vigil.\nArtwork by Tilen Javornik\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($25,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to access a larger version of this Reward Tier chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Tier-One Hunter and Tier-Two Hunter Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (Tier-Three Hunter Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nArtwork by Leo Albiero\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Vigil Compact and Vigil Conspiracy Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Rare Relic Dealer) will get 5 copies of the Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition Core rulebook (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.\nArtwork by Tilen Javornick\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Hunter setting or a possible future supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nPDF VERSION - The digital version of Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition, fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive a reception link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DrivethruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nHARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nArtwork by Sam Araya\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nFor +$5, add the Hurt Locker PDF to your rewards list.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to  keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $30 Tier-Two Hunter reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 Conspiracy Theorist reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, buy the physical book via your local game store when it hits distribution.\nWait and buy the physical book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. You can even encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Rare Relic Dealer) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Hunter: The Vigil Second Edition is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "CONSPIRACY THEORIST", "descp": "You've heard whispers and rumors, and now you're starting to collect data and put the pieces together.\nAs thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "TIER-ONE HUNTER", "descp": "You're self-sufficient.

Where the heroes help guide the world into a brave new era of promise or peril.\nWhat makes Age of Ambition different?\nWe\u2019re at a moment where fantasy, as a literary genre, has realized that societies change, grow and evolve. Fantasy gaming, however, has unfortunately lagged behind, mired in static worlds with no significant technological, magical or social progress.\nAge of Ambition changes that. It presents a world in a state of rapid flux, where magical and technological advancements are challenging the long-standing social order. It\u2019s a world that\u2019s grown beyond medieval fantasy to become something new.\nFurthermore, Age of Ambition casts the heroes as agents of social change. They are inventors and agitators, spies and civic leaders, who help guide the world into a brave and uncertain future.\nAge of Ambition will be a hardcover full-color book estimated at about 280 pages. Its features include:\nA lifepath-style character creation system, including birth omens, life events and careers that connect each character to the changing world.\nA fully-realized fantasy setting, including social dynamics, history, magic, politics and plot hooks galore! Discover a world rapidly leaving the medieval behind and entering a new era of hope and trepidation.\nSupport for a wide spectrum of power and influence, from peasant revolutionaries to the leaders of nations.\nSystems for personal ambitions, social change, inventions, trading goods, leading organizations, magic, combat, social status and more!\nWe have a proven track record of delivering Kickstarter rewards on time or early. The core rulebook is 100% written and it has received extensive playtesting, including several rounds of open playtests. \nAge of Ambition is inspired by a variety of fantasy fiction, including: Joe Abercrombie's First Law series, Terry Pratchett's Discworld, Scott Lynch's Gentleman Bastard series and Brian McClellan's Powder Mage trilogies. \nIt takes place in the fantasy world of Trystell, home to a number of different peoples\u2014from humans and minotaurs, to ogres and gnomes. It is also the moon of a gas giant, with a hostile sister moon that once tried to colonize the world.\nSocially and culturally, Trystell is rapidly advancing from its equivalent of Earth\u2019s Middle Ages, into what might be called the Early Modern era. This is giving rise to new ways of thinking, and to advances in both magic and technology.\nMost of all, Trystell is a world that\u2019s facing its future. It\u2019s beholden to shades of gray and intrigue. No one knows what this new era will bring, but with it comes great peril and great promise.\nSo strap on your breastplate and pick up your pistol. There are discoveries to make, wrongs to right, tyrants to overthrow and new social orders to trial. \n\u201cLove the Saga Machine system... Going to adapt the system to other RPGs!\u201d\n                                                       \u2014James C., DriveThruRPG\nAge of Ambition is a new take on the fantasy genre. The core system, Saga Machine, has been in use for over a decade, including publication in our other roleplaying games, Shadows Over Sol, Against the Dark Yogi and Dime Adventures. \nThis version of the rules has been entirely revised and streamlined. In the playtest and elsewhere it has received widespread praise. We have 4.9 out of 5 stars on DriveThruRPG!\nWant to know more?\nAll backers can access the complete draft text of Age of Ambition today! Even a $1 pledge gets you access to the text.

In The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Edition, they are all that stands between civilization and the unimaginable dangers just beyond the wild\u2026\nThe game is written, the art is done, the editing is finished and layout is done! The PDF has already been uploaded to DriveThruRPG, and proof copies ordered!\nThis game is ready to go. We just need your help to get the word out about it, and help make sure everyone gets paid!  Gallant Knight Games has already paid for the art, layout, and editing, but making games is more expensive than that. \nThe long term success of a game can often depend on retail stores, gaming groups and more. The goal of our project is to run a focused, tight campaign that will allow us to make a high-quality offset print run of the corebook in both softcover and hardcover. We believe James has created a work of art here, and we want to show case that with the best print run we can do. \nThe day the funds are delivered to Gallant Knight Games you'll get your PDF and we'll put the game to print. This will be a very fast turn around and a very tightly focused project. We're producing one book, and everything else is digital. \nThe Publisher: The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Edition is being published through a collaboration between Gallant Knight Games and Barrel Rider Games. Gallant Knight Games is an independent publisher lead by Alan & Erin Bahr and is most well known for its Mithral-selling Tiny Dungeon, Second Edition roleplaying game and many Tiny D6 RPGs. Barrel Rider Games is an independent publisher lead by James M. Spahn and is most well known for its Swords & Wizardry: White Box-based products, including the first edition of The Hero\u2019s Journey, White Box Omnibus, and White Star: White Box Science Fiction Roleplaying.\n The Author: James M. Spahn is a veteran table top game designer and freelance author within the RPG industry. He has written several independent role-playing games, including White Star: White Box Science Fiction Roleplaying, White Star: Galaxy Edition, Untold Adventures Minimalist Fantasy Roleplaying, and 2017 Three Castles Award nominated first edition of The Hero\u2019s Journey. He has served as a freelance author for a myriad of product lines and publishers in the industry, including Cubicle 7 Entertainment\u2019s The One Ring Roleplaying Game and Adventures in Middle-earth. He has contributed to ENnine and Origins Award winning products on both of those product lines. He also contributed to Fantasy Flight Games\u2019 Star Wars and Legend of the Five Rings product lines, as well as several adventures for Frog God Games.\nThe Editor: Carol Darnell has edited roleplaying games for companies like Fantasy Flight, Green Ronin, Angry Hamster Publishing, R. Talsorian, Pinnacle Entertainment Group, Gallant Knight Games and contributed her immense talents to dozens of products more. \nThe Artists: The cover illustration for The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Editionis by twenty year industry veteran Jon Hodgson. Hodgson\u2019s credits include providing illustrations for The BBC, Wizards of the Coast, Chaosium, Games Workshop, Paizo, and Cubicle 7 Entertainment. He currently owns and operates Handiwork Games.\nAll interior art is by Nicolas Giacondino, a veteran comic book artist and illustrator in the role-playing game industry whose credits include a range of products in the TinyD6 line of role-playing games, including Tiny Dungeon, Second Edition, Tiny Wasteland, Tiny Supers, Tiny Gunslingers, and Beach Patrol.\nLayout and title design have been done by Mike Brodu, an experienced industry layout artist with years under his belt on games like Planet Mercenary, Savage Worlds products, and more.\nWhy A Second Edition: It its original edition, The Hero\u2019s Journey Fantasy Roleplaying was explicitly designed to be compatible with Swords & Wizardry: White Box and similar games. While this new edition is still rooted in that classic rules set,extensive changes have been made to almost every element of the game in order to further evoke and emphasize the tone and theme of the game. In addition, more modern elements of game design have been seamless incorporated to keep play fast and simple. Some example changes include, but are not limited to\u2026\nNew Lineages: In addition to traditional fantasy lineages like Humans, Dwarves, and Elves, players will also have the option of playing the strange and obfuscated Changeling: A fey creature left as a replacement for a child stolen at birth and raised among mortals.\nNew Archetypes: The original edition of The Hero\u2019s Journey featured thirteen classes. This edition has been streamlined to keep the focus on classic, folklore-infused fantasy and now features only eight classes: the charming Bard, the clever Burglar, the noble Knight, the rugged Ranger, the swashbuckling Swordsman, the stern Warrior, the enigmatic Wizard, and the stalwart Yeoman.\nNew Monsters: Every single monster in The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Edition has been given a complete overhaul to bring them more in line with folklore, fairy tradition, and classic fantasy literature. For example: Kobolds, commonly known as yipping dog-lizards to many fantasy gamers, are now strange and diminutive elementals that appear old men fading into the stone as they guide and waylay underground travelers. Several new monsters are also introduced, like the savage draconic Lindworm, which craves the taste of flesh and whose wrath can only be undone when its impenetrable scaled armor is peeled away layer by layer. There is no such thing as a \u201cstock\u201d monster in The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Edition.\nNew Spellcasting: The traditional Vancian magic system which previously appeared in The Hero\u2019s Journey has been drastically overhauled. Now Wizards may cast any spell they know and each spell has a myriad of different potential effects! In addition, particularly brave and reckless arcanists may Tap the Essence and sacrifice their own body when they are otherwise unable to cast a spell. Instead of being a stock list of spells found in so many other classic fantasy RPGs, these spells have been modified and re-written to fit the tone and feel of The Hero\u2019s Journey.\nMyth Points and Magic Items: Unlike many traditional fantasy role-playing games, characters in The Hero\u2019s Journey, Second Edition acquire magic items by performing heroic deeds that become inexonerably tied forever to the weapons, armor, and strange trinkets they carry on their adventures. As characters progress and grow, they earn Myth Points, which can be spent to create unique magic items specifically tailored by the player to their individual character instead simply finding a \u201cbetter sword\u201d in the next treasure hoard. Magics grow and develop alongside a character, becoming an important part of their legend.\nFinally, by partnering with Gallant Knight Games, Barrel Rider Games is able to deliver a product with better production values. In addition, the strength of this partnership combined with the success of this crowd funding operation means that future products can be developed to supplement The Hero\u2019s Journey Fantasy Roleplaying, Second Edition, including The Hero\u2019s Journey Companion, Fairie Stories, several new adventures, and other products in development.\nWe're keeping our stretch goals simple and focused around continued support for The Hero's Journey 2e.\nHere it is in a nutshell: every $1,500 we raise over goal, we'll release a new adventure for THJ 2e*. \nThese adventures will be delivered in PDF to backers, and if we unlock enough (3 to 4 depending on the adventure length), we'll also release a POD coupon for a compliled set, using DriveThruRPG's at-cost POD service. (In a nutshell, this means the backer will be responsible for shipping and printing costs of the product, but GKG/BRG won't take any cut of those, so you get them as close to cost as possible from DriveThruRPG's POD service.)\nIf we can raise $8,000 we'll also do a print-on-demand version of a GM screen, that fits the DriveThruRPG screen (landscape format). Again, the cost of printing and shipping (as well as the screen if backers don't have it), will be born by the backer.\nThe GM Screen has been unlocked!\nThat's it! We're keeping it simple, focused and to the point! If we think of any cool stretch goals while the project is running, we'll be sure to add them and tell everyone! \n *We're going to cap this to 8 adventures at the start of the campaign. It might change later!\n Unlocked Adventures!\nThe Curse of Cormac's Hollow: In the dead of night an ancient pact was made with the Fairie Queen of Winter. Now the price of deseprate promises must be paid, and unless a band of brave heroes can discover the secrets of a mad witch, an abandoned castle, and the terrible truth behind a royal consort, a century of frozen winters will be unleashed on the village of Loughwood in a single night.\nGoblin Promises: Long ago, dwarvish miners and kobold stonekeepers promised to honor the hallowed places deep beneath the earth. But new trouble arises from the chambers of Iarainn Beinn as a tribe of goblins has made raucous market in these sacred tunnels. Unless a promise to accomplish the impossible can be upheld a sinister, slumbering monstrosity will destroy it all in a cataclysm of wrath and fire.\nThe Midnight Siege of Loch Fealias: The townsfolk of Loch Fealis rose up against the brutal and bloody baron that drove them to blood and toil for the glory of his coffers. They came with torches and pitchforks in a righteous rage. And they failed. The baron is preparing his terrible horde to lay waste to all that they love insolence. As the village burns and the oppressed cry out for aid, hope for survival lay in a band of noble strangers newly arrived in Loch Fealias.\nThe Boggart's Boy: The merry halflings of Westwick are celebrating their annual High Summer Revels, but when the pranks of a mischievous boy become twisted by the malice of a dark fey, heroes must delve into the twisted depths of the nearby Thicket and rescue that same child. Should they fail, the boy's soul will be lost forever, and the people of Westwick will never again see a Summer Revel in their lands.\nChivalry and Chicanery: While at a tournament of martial prowess held by renowned baroness, the player characters find themselves drawn into political intrigue when they're offered an invitation at her feasting table. Things turn from dashing to deadly when murder most foul is committed and the heroes stand accused unless they can find the true culprits.\nThe Bride and the Bandit: A noble princess, stolen on the eve of her wedding by a masked bandit! But as the player character brave the Banditswood at the king's bidding to rescue her, they discover far more nefarious things are afoot than a forbidden love and political alliances. Indeed, a great evil festers at the heart of the kingdom and needs only this vow to set all the realm under the rule of evil...\nTroll Knoll: A seemingly unkillable troll is rising from beneath its bridge in the strange, fog-shrouded hill of the Northern Wilds. Travelers are being torn limb from limb and brave heroes who have slain the beast only find it rises on the morrow, eager to slay again. Only by braving its ancient burial tomb and setting its wretched soul to rest can the road through the wilds be made safe again. But none have ever gone into the Troll Knoll and returned alive...\nBeyond the Beanstalk: The great giant's castle in the clouds has crumbled and now threatens to tumble from sky and destroy the village. With the the aid of a strange and loyal ogre, the player characters must find a way to climb into the wild blue, and search the rubble in hopes of finding what terrible creature or incantation was strong enough to destroy a Sky Giant and their magnificent palace.\nGallant Knight Games is a small company, and we do our own fulfillment, so we can ensure it's done right. This does lead to high international costs at times, due to customs and the generally high price of shipping.\nWe do offer international shipping of course, but we will not offer refunds on your pledge because shipping was more than you thought, nor do we pay for VAT or customs fees. \nHowever, we do always eventually put our books in Print-On-Demand on DriveThruRPG, so don't hesitate to just get the PDF and you can get the book later!\nShipping will be charged when you pledge for the project (we are aware the pledges say otherwise.

Like all companies, we've had hiccups, but we continually get better, and we always deliver. We have two projects that are not out to backers yet, but one is currently printing and preparing for fulfillment, and the other is exactly on track and this project will not impact that one. This is a straightforward project with no nuances.\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished?\nA: That's done! No worries on that end.\n\nQ: What if the complexity of the project overwhelms GKG?\nA: We deliberately built this project to avoid being complex.\n\nQ: What about delays in art?\nA: All the art is in!\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs?\nA: That's unfortunately a risk, but Gallant Knight Games has lots of experience with international fulfillment and we're prepared to handle that if it comes up.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals?\nA: All that will have to happen is printing and shipping. If the worst occurs, we can easily fulfill the project still.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\nGallant Knight Games only holds onto backer rewards for one year from the shipping date. If anything goes wrong, we'll do our best to sort you out after that date, but we can no longer guarantee rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital Hero!", "descp": "You get the PDF of The Hero's Journey 2e and any digital stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Hero's Journey 2e PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["231 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "International Print on Demand Softcover!", "descp": "You'll receive the digital PDF of The Hero's Journey 2e, as well as an at-cost code to print a softcover copy at DriveThruRPG.\nThe cost of this softcover, as well a shipping will be the responsibility of the backer.\nThis pledge level is restricted to non-US backers only.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Hero's Journey 2e PDF\nThe Hero's Journey Softcover POD At-Cost Code", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["49 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Cunning Hero!", "descp": "You get the softcover of The Hero's Journey 2e and the PDF, as well as any digital stretch goals!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign in our pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Hero's Journey 2e PDF\nThe Hero's Journey 2e Softcover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["165 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge", "descp": "You're a retailer!

The exertion of power over a flock. Satisfying their Hunger and their Beasts. Elevation of the self. Reassurance of the possibility of redemption. A grand plan they forged or that was bestowed upon them by secret masters.\nWhile some vampire cults span the globe hiding in plain sight, others are fringe faiths with morbid practices and ancient conspiracies lasting centuries. Others such as the incestuous Clan of Death and the malignant Church of Set \u2014 arguably the largest vampire cults of all \u2014 believe in a destiny that will enable them to impose their wills on the world of the living and the dead.\nWhether for power, salvation, or transcendence, all Kindred cults wallow in blood. They shed it in sacrifice, demand it of their followers, and exalt in it in unholy baptisms proclaiming their divine glories.\nThese cults dedicated to blood gods are among the most insidious, damning sects of Kindred, and tonight they approach their apex of power.\nArt by Michael Gaydos\nCults of the Blood Gods is a new style of sourcebook for Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition that introduces the pernicious horror of twisted beliefs.Designed for players and Storytellers, this supplement will include:\nAn in-character breakdown of the rise of esoteric beliefs among the ranks of the undead and how faith drives many of the major aspects of vampire culture.\nA host of religions \u2014 from historic theocracies and globe-spanning conspiracies to fringe cults and mortal beliefs arising in the modern nights \u2014 introduced for incorporation into your character backgrounds or as supporting casts and antagonist groups in your chronicles.\nThe history, structure, and ambitions of the Hecata, the vampire group known as the Clan of Death, as well as a chapter dedicated to playing a vampire among the Necromancers, and the ceremonies for their death-defying Discipline: Oblivion\nGuidance on how to use ecclesiastical horror and construct cults in Vampire, making them a vivid backdrop for your own stories, including new coterie styles focused on cult play.\nFaith-based story hooks and a full chronicle centered on the activities of the Hecata, involving walking corpses, ghosts, ready-made characters, and the secrets of the most twisted family in the World of Darkness.\nNew Loresheets, Backgrounds, and Predator Types for inclusion in your chronicles, encouraging player characters to engage fully with the material presented in this book.\nArtwork by Same Araya\nIn all of Vampire: The Masquerade's history, there's never been a book wholly dedicated to the diverse faiths and cults among Kindred, the ways in which they practice, their relationships with each other, and how to utilize religion in your chronicles as a force of hope and destruction. Cults of the Blood Gods is the book you want, if you're interested in incorporating ecclesiastical horror in your games. This book contains everything you need to have each Kindred in your coterie establish a cult, cleave to a unique faith, and establish domains in the name of an ancient methuselah, being of myth, or even the Kindred protagonists themselves. Not only that, it provides the tools necessary to play members of the Clan of Death, once known as the Cappadocians, then the Giovanni, and now the Hecata, as well as new powers for members of a large number of cults, rules for creating your own religions, and an entire story set in Munich with ready-made characters, so you can play immediately upon receipt of the book.\nThis Cults of the Blood Gods Kickstarter is devised to enable us to create a prestige hardcover edition designed to sit proudly alongside Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition core book.\nWe want to create an 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d hardcover with a beautifully designed, full-color cover image featuring some of the most shadow-covered parts of the World of Darkness. We estimate the book to be more than 240+ pages, with a full-color interior and endpapers on high-quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play, including new chronicles, characters, story hooks, and all further exploration relating to the most persecuted and secretive of Kindred faiths! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nCults of the Blood Gods gives you all the rules you need to play a member of Clan Hecata, or a vampire member of any number of faiths, including the Church of Caine, Bahari, Church of Set, and Cult of Mithras, among many others.\nChapter One: Rise of the Methuselah Cult\nChapter Two: Kindred Religions\nChapter Three: The Cult of Death and Undeath\nChapter Four: Mortal Cults\nChapter Five: Cult Construction\nChapter Six: Hecata and Oblivion  \nChapter Seven: Bloodlines and Loresheets\nChapter Eight: Styx and Bones\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting sneak peek previews of sections of the Cults of the Blood Gods manuscript as backer-only updates.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Cults of the Blood Gods possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of the Cults of the Blood Gods, possibly expanding into complete chronicles and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imagination. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our clan.\nArtwork by Amy Wilkins\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($30,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged.

Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nArtwork by Mark Kelly\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Old Anziani Reward Tiers, which offer 2 copies as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Cults of the Blood Gods campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Ancient Premascine) will get 5 copies of the Cults of the Blood Gods hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nArtwork by Ken Meyer Jr\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from an option to act as an art model, as well as a chance to name an SPC or even provide a character to be included in the Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition setting via a future Cults of the Blood Gods supplement. There's an opportunity to help craft an Oblivion Ceremony, decide the fates of familiar characters, or even act as a Consulting Developer, an observer from the shadows, with access to communication channels shared by the developers and writers. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Cults of the Blood Gods.

All backers receiving the Cults of the Blood Gods PDF will automatically have this added to their rewards list.\nArtwork by Amy Wilkins\nWhen you pledge to a reward tier that includes a physical item (the Cults of the Blood Gods hardcover sourcebook), Kickstarter will automatically calculate additional shipping costs based on your location.\nUnfortunately, international shipping has become increasingly expensive and is often prohibitive to non-US backers. Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path has been able to mitigate some of the increased expense by negotiating new partnerships in a desire to keep as many options as possible available to our customers. Despite these efforts, shipping costs will still reflect an increased expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $25 Proxy Kissed reward tier to get the PDF version of the book from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 Hired Muscle reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, buy the physical book via your local game store when it hits distribution.\nWait and buy the physical book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. You can even encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Ancient Premascine) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: The final project may not yet exist, but that's what this Kickstarter campaign is for - to carry this idea over the finish line. The text for Cults of the Blood Gods is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway. In short, if this project is funded, Onyx Path can assure you that everything in their control will be delivered.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "HIRED MUSCLE", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2020"}], "stat": ["104 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "PROXY KISSED", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Cults of the Blood Gods.\nINCLUDES:\nCULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["786 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 47 or more", "title": "LAZARENE", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Cults of the Blood Gods as well as a PDF copy of the Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition core rules.\nINCLUDES:\nCULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) PDF Version\nVampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition Core Rules PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["67 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "FAMILY HEAD", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of Cults of the Blood Gods.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nCULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) Hardcover Book\nCULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,518 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "OLD ANZIANI", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive TWO (2) copies of the PDF and TWO (2) copies of the hardcover version of Cults of the Blood Gods.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 CULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) Hardcover Book\n2\u00d7 CULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["62 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 150 or more", "title": "ANCIENT PREMASCINE >Retailer Tier<", "descp": "** For Qualified Retailers Only **\nContact RichT@theonyxpath.com to confirm your retailer status.\nAs thanks for your support, you'll receive FIVE (5) copies of the PDF and FIVE (5) copies of the hardcover version of Cults of the Blood Gods.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 CULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) Hardcover Book\n5\u00d7 CULTS OF THE BLOOD GODS (V5) PDF Version\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 300 or more", "title": "BLUSH OF LIFE", "descp": "As a special reward, you will submit a name that will be used for a Storyteller-played Character (SPC) which will be added to an upcoming Cults of the Blood Gods supplement (or alternate V5 supplement if necessary).

Originally published by Mayfair Games in 2004, Station Master has long been favored for its high player interaction, clever decisions, and fun gameplay.  We couldn\u2019t think of a better way to continue Calliope Games' 10 year anniversary celebration than by refreshing and publishing one of our favorite games - so we welcome you to the launch of the new and improved Station Master!  \nStation Master is a train-themed card game for 2-6 players.  In the game, players are working at the station, attaching railcars to Locomotives and boarding passengers on trains, trying to score the most Efficiency Points to win!\nWe have restored this timeless train game, creating stunning all-new artwork based on classic locomotives, railcars, and railroad history.  In addition, we have refined and streamlined the rules for modern audiences, as well as adding in upgrades and new material to create the greatest possible Station Master experience!\nPLAY\n\nCalliope Games has used Kickstarter ever since 2012, bringing to life a library of amazing games: Tsuro of the Seas, Roll For It!, Dicey Peaks, The Mansky Caper, Running With The Bulls, Hive Mind, Menu Masters, Ancestree, ShutterBug, Capital City, ShipShape, Everyone Loves A Parade, SpyMaster, and Tsuro: Phoenix Rising!  We love this community and this platform!\nExclusive Deluxe Box and Alternate Passenger Pawns Not Available In Retail Version After The Campaign!\nWe invite you to be the first to board the train and take a ride! Station Master will be available after release through distribution to retailers, but through this Kickstarter campaign, you can pledge for the Executive Class edition of the game, featuring improvements and exclusives not found in the retail version of the game.  The 36 exclusive Passenger pawn shapes and flip-top magnetic-close box in the Executive Class edition of the game will not be available through distribution after this campaign. \nEvery Tuesday and Thursday as we ride the rails through the campaign, we will reveal a FEATURED LOCOMOTIVE POSTCARD that will packaged in with the Executive Class version of the game! These are actual postcards that can be collected or mailed to a train enthusiast you know!  While not a gameplay element, each set of nine postcards is a wonderful free add-on for this beautiful game!\nMan vs Meeple\nNever Bored Gamers\nSAHM Reviews\nThe Dice Tower with Mark & Randy\nWe are offering subsidized shipping costs in order to strike the best balance of value for our backers and actual cost to us. We have strategically partnered with trusted fulfillment partners around the world experienced in shipping Kickstarter rewards.\n10 years ago, Calliope Games began as a collaboration between Dawne Weisman, Jordan Weisman, and Ray Wehrs. All of us are experienced game industry professionals who have worked together since 1999 when we collectively launched WizKids. Calliope Games has been producing and selling quality tabletop games since 2009. Our products are inspired by family for families. To date we have released 24 titles, many of which were brought to life here on Kickstarter!\nAt Calliope Games, we publish fun, affordable, family-style tabletop games for all to enjoy.\nWith gamers in mind, our games make the perfect \"gateway\" or \"filler\" game. They allow you to easily draft your non-gamer friends into your favorite hobby. Calliope games are excellent for starting out game night and are easily played between heavier games. It\u2019s important to point out to our non-gamer friends that we do take a slightly different approach to the games we produce. At Calliope, we focus on entertaining adults; however, the games we produce allow children to compete with their parents without the parents \u201cthrowing\u201d the game. It\u2019s a really a pretty simple concept; instead of having the parents step down into the child\u2019s world, we are inviting the child to step up into the parents' world.\nFor gamers and non-gamers alike, the results of our efforts are games that are accessible by all players regardless of skill level or age, play in under 60 minutes, are affordably priced, and most of all\u2026 are a blast to play!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any venture, there are risks... those that are seen, and those that are unseen. The biggest foreseeable risks we currently face are manufacturing in China and shipping issues from China to our warehouse here in the US.\n\nEach of these risks is greatly minimized with Calliope Games. Our factories have been with us for many years. They know how we work and the quality we expect. In addition, our freight forwarder and fulfillment teams are world class and have over 30 years of expertise to rely upon. If any issues arise, we will know of them far in advance and will be able to overcome them.\n\nNew tariffs may influence costs as well. Typically these are 10%-25% of our total manufacturing cost. Should tariffs affect prices, these will be reflected in the post-campaign shipping and fulfillment cost.\n\nAs far as the unseen risks... we know they are there and we have built a safety margin into our costs of goods sold to prepare us for the unforeseen. To date we've launched more than 20 games under the Calliope brand, many with a good number of reprints, and we have overcome all major production issues in providing our players quality entertainment experiences.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Grand Central (Retailer)", "descp": "FOR VERIFIED BRICK-AND-MORTAR GAME STORES ONLY.

This will be an ideal setting for low-level campaigns, designed in the style of Keep to the Borderlands, et al.\nOur Plan\nRichard and I have been discussing for years the pros and cons of modern book publishing in the fantasy genre. This is about exploration into the realm of design and world-building. Backers have the chance to look behind the curtain of how we make a book while helping us answer key questions on the design. Backers have the opportunity to name NPCs, and place their own characters (or themselves) into the world.\nEventually, backers will be called upon to name the setting (within reason) and answer vital design questions through polling, done once a week during the kickstarter process. \nThe Setting\nEach location in the setting will include information on the building, the NPCs who work/live there, and random charts for seeding the environment with rumors, stories, plots, and so on. A toolbox filled with a plethora of useful goodies.\nThat's right. We said plethora.\nRewards\nFive different tiers allowing backers to select from a simple PDF to a print edition, or involvement in the setting, and everything in between.\nBecause we missed a key stretch goal while creating this page, we had the book unlock at $7500.

Imagine being cradled in the arms of death for years, sometimes decades on end, but all the while knowing you will eventually not only arise again, but possibly awaken to an unfamiliar world. Now imagine that your purpose, your entire existence, is bound within this cycle \u2014 that you are chained to it for eternity. You sleep, you wake, your serve your Judge\u2019s will in the lands of the living, and you return to the death-sleep once more. The ancient culture that empowered you is gone, lost to the sands of time\u2026yet you endure.\nIn Mummy: The Curse Second Edition, you play one of these beings. Those who know they exist, from the cultists who serve them to the dark forces arrayed against them, call them the Deathless. We call them mummies.\nThe Chronicles of Darkness, which debuted in 2004 as the new World of Darkness, drew upon the roots of the original World of Darkness and introduced a new look into a shadowy, dangerous world. Players could step into the everyday shoes of mortals, or they could vie for power and control as a vampire, werewolf, changeling, Sin-Eater, and more.\nLaunched in 2013, Mummy: The Curse was the first new game line from Onyx Path, and the first new Chronicles of Darkness game since 2009. With opening fiction by award-winning author Greg Stolze, Mummy presented a step forward in the evolution of the Storytelling system. That evolution continues with Mummy: The Curse Second Edition.\nIn Mummy: The Curse, players take on the characters of the Arisen, humans who were subjects of the greatest magic ever worked by mortal hands, the Rite of Return, in the long-lost Nameless Empire. As part of the Rite, they underwent ritual death, and their souls were eternally bound to their mortal remains. Consequently, while the Arisen can be killed, they will always return, their bodies reforming anew.\nThis Mummy: The Curse Second Edition Kickstarter is structured to enable us to create a hardcover edition designed to match the look and feel of our other Chronicles of Darkness core rulebooks such as Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, or Changeling: The Lost.\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed on a metallic under layer, and featuring an emboss/deboss of the logo. We estimate the book to be more than 250+ pages, with a two-color interior and endpapers on high-quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play, including new Utterances, expansions to the core systems, enhanced rules for immortals and the minor guilds, and all manner of ghostly antagonists! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nMummy: The Curse Second Edition includes all the rules you need to play as one of the Arisen: Decrees and Pillars that reflect the transformation by the Rite of Return, Utterances and Affinities as the powers you wield and the price you pay for them, magical relics and vessels for use or sacrifice, and all manner of antagonists from immortals to Shuankhsen and others besides.\n Chapter 1: The Arisen explains the guilds, their Decrees, and the Judges they serve for eternity.\n Chapter 2: Life When Deathless delves into Arisen society and history, how mummies function together in a group, or meret, and the manners by which they are called into waking.\n Chapter 3: Creating a Mummy presents character creation in a simple, step-by-step fashion, with an example to follow along. It also presents the game\u2019s Affinities and Utterances, being the godlike powers at a mummy\u2019s disposal.\n Chapter 4: Laws of the Arisen presents all the core rules necessary to run a game of Mummy: The Curse Second Edition, including rules for combat, investigation, and drama.\n Chapter 5: Immortal Foes covers the people and organizations who hunt the Arisen, from the Lifeless and hungry Shaunkhsen and Amkhata to the immortals and blood sorcerers that sometimes work alongside our protagonists.\n Chapter 6: A World for Exploring opens up Mummy: The Curse to a multitude of settings the world over, from Denmark to Johannseburg and Hong Kong to Cuzco.\n Chapter 7: Creating Timeless Tales gives tips on running successful games of Mummy, and explores the game\u2019s niche of playing across multiple eras and utilizing cult troupe play. This chapter also contains a plethora of story hooks.\nThe Appendices provide Conditions and Tilts likely to come into play in Mummy.\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Mummy: The Curse Second Edition manuscript as backer-only updates.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Mummy: The Curse Second Edition possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Mummy: The Curse Second Edition, possibly expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imagination. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our guild.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($25,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to load a larger version of this Reward Tier chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (The Lifeless and The Deathless Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (The Arisen Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Cultist and The Deceived Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Mummy: The Curse Second Edition campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Su-Menent) will get 5 copies of the Mummy: The Curse Second Edition Core rulebook (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Mummy setting or a possible future supplement. There's even an opportunity to act as a CONSULTING DEVELOPER, an observer from the shadows, with access to communication channels shared by the developers and writers. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Mummy: The Curse Second Edition. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nPDF VERSION - The digital version of Mummy: The Curse Second Edition, fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DrivethruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nHARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Mummy: The Curse, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nA bundle of relevant PDFs from the previous edition of Mummy: The Curse, the Scroll of Fading Memory can provide inspiration and ideas for your Mummy: The Curse game.

Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement\nACHIEVED! - At $40,000in funding - NEW ADD ON: Storyteller Screen.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to  keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for import additional duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $30 Deathless reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 Memory reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, buy the physical book via your local game store when it hits distribution.\nWait and buy the physical book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution. \nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. You can even encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Su-Menent) for this campaign! \nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you. \nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.  \nThis is Onyx Path Publishing's 40th Kickstarter, and the company has learned how to maintain focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\n\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Mummy: The Curse Second Edition is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing. \n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "MEMORY", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}], "stat": ["85 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "THE LIFELESS", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition.\nINCLUDES:\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["381 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "THE DEATHLESS", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition\nINCLUDES:\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["104 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "THE ARISEN", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition Hardcover Book\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["622 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 95 or more", "title": "CULTIST", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive TWO (2) copies of the PDF and TWO (2) copies of the hardcover version of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition Hardcover Book\n2\u00d7 Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\n2\u00d7 \"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 125 or more", "title": "MAA-KEP", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition, as well as a BOOK PLATE signed by members of the creative team.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\nSPECIAL: Signed Book Plate\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition Hardcover Book\nMummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 135 or more", "title": "SU-MENENT **Retail Tier**", "descp": "** For Qualified Retailers Only ** Contact RichT@theonyxpath.com to confirm your retailer status.\nAs thanks for your support, you'll receive FIVE (5) copies of the PDF and FIVE (5) copies of the hardcover version of Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition.\nAdditional shipping charges may apply based on your location.\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition Hardcover Book\n5\u00d7 Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "SESHA-HEBSU", "descp": "As a special reward, you will name an NPC which will be incorporated into an upcoming Mummy: The Curse 2nd Edition supplement (either enabled by Stretch Goal, possible unplanned future project, or future Chronicles of Darkness supplement, as necessary).

It takes place in 2097, thirteen years after the Last War in Deadlands Hell on Earth. \nHellstromme Industries created a \u201cTunnel\u201d between Earth and a distant star system later called Faraway. Millions of colonists settled on asteroid mining stations and the only inhabitable planet, Banshee, before the Tunnel collapsed and left them stranded.\nNow the humans must fend for themselves against a rogue military, ruthless pirates, angry anouks, the rise of an evil alien presence, and worst of all, the arrival of the Reckoners\u2014made flesh on Earth and exiled to Banshee!\nHolding things together are the Colonial Rangers, an outgunned, outnumbered force of humans and their anouk allies. They protect settlements from rampaging beasts, battle terrorists and pirates, broker peace between the humans and anouks, and strive to keep Hellstromme Industries and a rogue military from fighting a war certain to devastate all life in the system.\nBut their greatest threat is the return of the \"skinnies.\" Thought defeated by the \"Psychic Legion\" before they were recalled to Earth, these alien things summoned a great \"World Storm\" that ravaged the planet, weakened the humans and anouks who resisted them, and turned desperate souls to their psionic embrace.\n The heroes of Faraway join the Rangers in their quest to save the system. Transmuters \u2014or \"breakers\"\u2014destroy their enemies' weapons of war. Anouk warriors and shamans use Banshee's natural energies like magic to defend its native inhabitants and those who would aid them. Gunslingers and sykers take on feral creatures and ruthless pirates.\nThe undead Harrowed sometimes rise from the alien soil, and rumors say those who serve the living planet, whether human or anouk, might rise as living \"Guardians,\" gaining incredible new abilities in defense of Banshee's fading existence.\nDeadlands Lost Colony is the long-awaited relaunch of a line first published in 2000 for the original \"Deadlands Classic\" system. It's been rewritten from the ground up, reimagined, refocused, and adapted to the latest version of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition.\nWe've also cleaned up and standardized the rules for certain Arcane Backgrounds, like the undead Harrowed, who can now \"Let the Devil Take the Reins\" in exchange for mischief and mayhem!\nThe Plot Point Campaign\nDeadlands Lost Colony includes a full Plot Point Campaign, pitting the heroes against the exiled and weakened Reckoners themselves! We won't say anything more here so we don't spoil it for players, but the Reckoners are vulnerable for the first time\u2014and they aren't going down easy.\nThe core book for Deadlands Lost Colony is a 192 page \"graphic novel\" size hardback and full-color throughout.\nThe tri-fold screen is our usual landscape GM screen with gorgeous art by Konrad Krogull on one side and all the charts and tables you might need during a game on the other. The screen comes with a killer adventure by John Goff that takes place on the space station called the Widowmaker!\nAfter the Kickstarter is over you'll be invited to a pledge manager so that you can add any additional Pinnacle products you want to your order. Want the Rippers Resurrected Expedition Amazon supplement or new Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds boxed set? These will all be available to ship with your order.\nIf you want those existing items now, just head over to www.peginc.com and order. If you wait to order in the pledge manager (to combine shipping with your Lost Colony rewards) it won't ship until 2020.\nAdd Ons require pledging for a physical reward level. If you only want the dice, for example, you'll need to wait until they are for sale on our website after all backers have received their rewards. \nAnd if you want to budget or add Lost Colony specific Add Ons to your Kickstarter pledge now, here are the prices. Thanks as always for your support of our little company!\nMore Archetype Cards were UNLOCKED as Stretch Goals!\nIf we get more funds than we asked for, we'll add some additional digital and physical rewards! The first are cool new Harrowed \"Dominion Cards\" by Cheyenne Wright! Check back frequently to see where we're at, and tell your friends to check out our project\u2014every pledge means more for the rest of us! (Hey, we play too!) \n\n\n\n Help us unlock more stretch goals by sharing the project! Here's where you can find us on social media:\nDeadlands Lost Colony is written and in layout. Your help allows us to create all the extras we want to make and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the core rules after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping.\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website first and later through DriveThruRPG. \nPhysical Rewards\nWe have another Kickstarter running RIGHT NOW, for Wendigo Tales Volume One, in the Fiction category!

Equipped for a twenty-year voyage, she will carry the Travellers on an epic journey from Charted Space to the edge of the Orion Arm. Deepnight Revelation must forge a path through uncharted systems and the territory of unknown alien races. Everything she finds will be new, and if she meets with disaster there will be no rescue.\nDeepnight Revelation\u2019s destination is a mysterious radio source at the mouth of the Great Rift. Described in the ravings of a madwoman as the place beyond everything, Terminus Point holds a terrible secret. Reaching it is only part of the mission; at Terminus Point the Travellers will face a desperate battle to prevent mass extinction on a galactic scale, and literally go further than any Traveller has gone before.\nWhat is Inside?\nThe Deepnight Revelation box set will initially contain four books, a card deck and a huge poster map, but stretch goals will unlock additional hardbacks to expand the campaign, covering new adventures and regions of space that the Deepnight Revelation will travel through.\nDeepnight Legacy - a 32 page adventure that introduces the Travellers to their mammoth task.\nCampaign Guide - a 104 page book that lays out the immense scope of the campaign.\nReferee's Handbook - a 96 page book that guides the referee gently through the herculean task of running the campaign.\nTerminus Point - a 72 page adventure into the most distant and fantastical realms that forms the great finale of the Deepnight Revelation campaign!\nA giant poster map featuring deck plans of the Deepnight Endeavour, along with crew departments, while the reverse has a huge scale map depicting the expected route of the journey along the Great Rift and known points of interest.\nA deck of cards, covering Mission Briefings, Standing Orders, and Mission Roles.\nMost of the writing for the Deepnight Revelation box set is complete and you can download the first adventure included in the set (a work in progress, but fully playable), Deepnight Legacy, right HERE.\nDeepnight Legacy: The deep-rift outpost at Point XF-1402 has gone silent. Sent to investigate, the Travellers come under attack from the shambling remains of the crew. As the nature of the threat becomes apparent the Travellers face a terrible choice. They must ensure an alien entity never reaches an inhabited planet\u2026 even if it means they can never leave.\nCampaign Guide: A complete guide to the exploration cruiser Deepnight Revelation and her mission. The Campaign Guide details the Deepnight Entity and the ten year voyage to its hiding place at Terminus Point, the route of Deepnight Revelation and the regions of space she will pass through, along with incidents and adventures that will befall the intrepid crew.\nReferee's Handbook: The Referee\u2019s Handbook contains all the rules and information the referee needs to run an epic campaign of exploration at this magnitude. Using a resolution cycle developed specifically for this campaign, along with advanced rules for whole-crew endeavours, the Referee\u2019s Handbook makes resolving large scale tasks quick and simple. Whether the Travellers are decoding alien hieroglyphs, putting down a mutiny aboard their ship, or trying to prevent a critical system breakdown, the Referee\u2019s Handbook covers every eventuality.\nTerminus Point: At the mouth of the Great Rift lies Terminus Point. There, on the very edge of the spiral arm, the Travellers confront something that will consume all life in the galaxy. They have only the resources of their battered ship and weary crew; backup is a decade away even if the Travellers could call for help. They will fight with what they have, treading a thin line between extinction and revelation.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nTraveller veterans will be familiar with the massive Pirates of Drinax campaign. When we came up with the idea for Deepnight Revelation, we knew it had vast potential that could be developed into a truly epic gaming experience with multiple side plots and new areas of space - making it perfect for a Kickstarter project.\nThe box set will contain the beginning and ends of the campaign, along with guidance for the referee to run exploration campaigns as the Travellers make their way along the Great Rift. However, Kickstarter gives us a chance to expand this greatly with specific adventures and regions of space to be encountered along the way, turning this into the greatest voyage made outside of Charted Space!\nThe 'Feels'\nWhen we embarked on this project, we knew we wanted to create something truly special. Your Travellers will be going far, far beyond Charted Space and we wanted to get across to them the true, terrible majesty of the universe. They will encounter and interact with black holes, neutron stars, and nebulae, while visiting hellworlds and planets lit dimly by a brown dwarf. This will be a trip like no other, and we wanted to make sure Travellers remembered it for the rest of their gaming lives, something that is far more than a simple episodic 'five year mission' style of game.\nTo that end, we have drawn upon many sources for inspiration, and recommend referees immerse themselves in the likes of the Cosmos TV series (both new and original), and films such as Sunshine and Interstellar. On a big 4k screen with full surround sound.\nThis is what we want your Travellers to experience during this campaign.\nYou can hear writer Martin Dougherty's thoughts on the campaign and contents of the box right here:\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you most and we will soon have Deepnight Revelation in your hands.\nThe Deepnight Revelation Commemorative Pack\nCitizens of the Third Imperium will be able to purchase a special commemorative pack to support the Deepnight Revelation mission - and now you can too, simply by choosing to pledge at the Deepnight Revelation Officer level!\nIn the commemorative pack, you will find:\nThe unique Deepnight Revelation cloth mission patch\nA pad of blank Subsector Maps, ready for your exploration\nSix Deepnight Endeavour pencils, perfect for your players\nOne Deepnight Endeavour pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Deep Space Phenomena Recognition Pack, 24 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the mysteries of the universe\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Deepnight Endeavour dice\nAll in an official and attractive presentation pack (seriously, if you are a Traveller collector, you will not want to miss this one!)\nStretch Goals\nWe have a multitude of star systems and strange phenomena to explore, and we will be bringing you the deep mysteries of the galaxy via hardback books that explore specific regions of deep space and add additional adventures to the campaign.\n The Riftsedge Transit: We have added a new hardback book detailing the first leg of the mission! The Riftsedge Transit is exploration writ large, in which the Travellers will encounter new alien races and discover wonders never seen before. They will stand amid the ruins of a vanished civilisation and perhaps learn its fate, follow clues to the home of a starfaring species and launch a daring rescue to save new friends, then face a mature Deepnight Entity controlling a whole world, and learn the true power of their enemy.\nThe Near Side of Yonder: A hardback covering a region of 15 sectors directly spinward of Terra has been unlocked, in which the Travellers encounter three starfaring races which stand on the brink of war. The way forward is through their territory and helping one race will antagonise the others, perhaps triggering a devastating conflict, but the Travellers need allies and information. They could tread a careful path through local politics or turn the weapons of Deepnight Revelation upon any who oppose them.  Finally, the Travellers learn of a fleet assembling to tackle an enemy super-warship... and that they are the target. The Travellers' actions will determine if they face overwhelming odds or merely a tough fight.\nThe Crossing: A new hardback book that will see the Travellers searching for a way across the bulge where the Great Rift starts to curve rimward has been unlocked! However, the route is dangerous and a single mistake will doom the crew to a slow death in deep space. They must brave the greatest hazards of deep space; flaring stars, gravitational anomalies, and a deathtrap planet. The Travellers find evidence of those who trod this path before and learn more about the mysterious Leviathan, before reaching the distant shore. What appears to be a safe haven turns out to be even more deadly than the crossing, but there can be no turning back now.\nThe Far Side of Nowhere: The fourth expansion for the Deepnight Revelation campaign has been unlocked now we have reached the heady heights of \u00a365,000. By this time Deepnight Revelation is in poor condition and her crew weary. No sign has been seen of starfaring aliens for months, until a small outpost is discovered. The alien operators seem to find the Travellers familiar. Whilst they are puzzling over this, a trade ship arrives at the outpost. The crew are human. The Far Side of Nowhere represents a change of pace in the Deepnight Revelation campaign; a chance to return to some old-fashioned Traveller adventures. However, the stakes are higher than usual \u2013 a mis-step could terminate the expedition or force its abandonment.\nVoidshore: Voidshore has been unlocked! This book begins with a transit from the Far Side of Nowhere but focuses on exploration of the very fringe of the spiral arm. As the Travellers explore the region they become aware of another expedition in the area, leading to a tense encounter with other explorers. Whether these rivals become allies or enemies depends very much on the Travellers\u2019 attitude to them.\nThe overall theme in Voidshore returns to one of exploration and discovery, with the Travellers piecing together clues to find the route of a Droyne expedition. Finally, all preparations made, the Travellers stand on the edge of the spiral arm and plot a jump out into the unknown. Ahead lies Terminus Point and the final destination of their mission.\nExpeditions: If we reach the appropriately astronomical heights of \u00a3100,000, we will add Expeditions, the sixth Deepnight Endeavour hardback expansion. Expeditions (a working title!) is a set of adventures designed to be slotted into any portion of the mission, where the crew of the Deepnight Endeavour meet new civilisations, explore fascinating stellar phenomenon and, maybe, gain a few things that will aid them in their epic voyage.\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill the gaps in their collections. The Traveller range is starting to grow quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for Deepnight Revelation to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level. After the Kickstarter is complete, you will receive a survey asking you to confirm which packages you added, and we will send you these books within the next four weeks, along with their PDFs!

Every story is unique. Every story wildly imaginative.\nWith Slaughter, you will create lovable, fun and ultimately flawed characters\u2026 and then take sinful pleasure in killing them off in ghastly ways.\nYes, this is a game all about the darker side of human - and inhuman - nature. But it also has a sense of humor.\nAfter all, you can\u2019t have Slaughter, without Laughter!\nThe game rules are decidedly simple. Perfect for introducing friends to gaming, or for getting the regular gaming gang together for an evening of murder and mayhem.\nDO YOU LOVE\nhorror movies - with plenty of twists?\nrole-playing games - that are fast & fun\ncreating stories - that surprise at every turn\nIf so, you'll love Slaughter: The Horror Movie-Making Card Game!\nAT A GLANCE\nNumber of Players: 3-6  (One Director and two to five Players) \nRecommended Age: 15+\nAverage Play Time: 90 minute to 3 hours\nHOW DO YOU PLAY?\nIn Slaughter, you use cards to represent the tropes of horror movies.  By mixing and matching these trope cards, you can weave a complex horror movie that will have you guessing right up to the very end credits.\nOut of the box, we provide decks of cards for the two most popular horror movie genres:  slashers and zombie movies. \nOf course, you can mix and match cards and mess with the tropes! Want aliens infecting a space station? Then replace the zombies with xenos terrors, complete with their own special effect tropes, and set them against your poor astronauts!  How about an Aztec vampire hunting people in New York? Make the serial killer have supernatural power and off you go! \nThere are no limits to your the movies your can create.  Just add imagination and off you go!\nYOUR JOB... KILL THE CAST!\nIn most horror games, players spend all their time trying to keep their characters alive.  \nNot in Slaughter!\nThe whole idea is to kill off the movie's cast in gloriously terrible ways!  A unique Death Point mechanic rewards players for killing off their character and cast. And replacing a player's character from the available cast of extras takes less than a minute.  As the movie progresses, and the body count climbs, the surviving cast get more and more desperate and take increasingly bolder risks.\nWHAT'S IN THE KICKSTARTER?\nSlaughter has been in design and production for several years. Now we are ready to manufacture and bring the game to you! \nThis Kickstarter is mainly for the printing and manufacturing of the STARTER EDITION DOUBLE FEATURE BOXED SET. We'll be able to manufacture a collection of amazing expansion decks to go with it.\nBut first, let's explore what's in the STARTER EDITION BOXED SET...\nPrinted rulebook - which is mercifully short. Slaughter has a highly streamlined rule system so play is bloody fast. Most details of how to play the game are on the cards, so there is no need to refer to books of complex rules as you play. You get to stay firmly in the movie at all times!\nBase deck - cards for props, special effects (SFX), injuries, and madness.\n Surviving the Horde deck - cards for running 'zombie' movies, including a wide selection of characters, talents, flaws, hooks, and scenes.\n Death Stalks deck - card for running 'slasher' movies, including a wide selection of characters, talents, flaws, hooks, and scenes.\n10 scenarios to get you started.\nDeath Tokens - to mark each player's progress in the movie and boost characters.\nCharacter Spotlight - heavy card stock mats that let you create a protagonist quickly, and keeps you focused on what matters.\nDirectors' Chair - a foldable mat that lets the Director organise the scenes, monsters and villains. \nCenter Stage - a large foldable mat that organises the cast of extras and cards in play.\nWHAT GAMERS SAY\nSlaughter has been play-tested to perfection.

These are also the best estimates for final shipping costs and we will do everything we can to hold the costs at these levels, or lower. However, we may to adjust based on market costs at the time of shipping.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game has been written, extensively play-tested, the art and cards are laid out. So in terms of 'finishing the game,' it's mostly done and dusted. Zero risk there. In fact, within a few weeks of this Kickstarter closing, we'll deliver the game in PDF form to all backers.\nOur biggest challenge is to print the game, manufacture the box and have it shipped out to distribution points in Europe, Australia and the USA. \nWe've selected a master print house in China for our products since these folks offer the highest-quality we can find. To ensure the quality is up to scratch, we will order a pre-production run - that'll take about 4-6 weeks to get to us. We are mostly checking for print colour saturation at this stage... black and red cards can be tricky to get just right. If all looks good, then we'll give the go head for full-production. If not, we will make adjustments and redo, which may add a few extra weeks to the delivery times. But don't worry, we've assumed we may need a little extra time to get the print just right, and built that into our delivery schedule.\nShipping is another risk. We plan to bulk ship to three markets: USA, Europe and Australia, and then post. In theory, shipping should only take about 3-4 weeks, but in past projects, we've seen this take longer due to storms and other things beyond our control or ability to predict. We will insure the stock against loss and damage during shipping, as well. Just in case. In the worse scenario, we expect shipping may take up to 4 months. That's unlikely: we expect them to be delivered very quickly. We'll keep everyone updated from the moment the game leaves the factory.\nAs noted above, this Kickstarter is run in Australian dollars. That's a demand by Kickstarter since we are an Australian firm. We've listed estimates for the final cost of the game in US$, but there may be some currency fluctuations during the time the Kickstarter program is running. We'll update everyone with the currency impact should this be an issue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "StoryWeaver Games\nFirst created \u00b7 12 backed\nStoryWeaver Games is an Indie Pen and Paper Games Publisher.

We're going to make a full colour, one creature per page, hardcover bestiary for the world\u2019s favourite roleplaying game. \n\n\nIt\u2019s going to be expertly converted, beautifully illustrated, wonderfully laid out, and full to the brim with useful content.\nIf we\u2019re extra successful we\u2019ll also include random encounter tables, drop-in encounters with battle maps, and lots of additional digital content. \nWay back at the beginning of the d20 times, when 3rd Edition was the big noise, gamers had two core manuals with which to play. The Player\u2019s Handbook and Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide were available, but there was a pause before we got the official Monster Manual. Into that gap burst The Creature Collection - the very first bestiary of Third Edition monsters! \nNow we\u2019re bringing the Creature Collection to 5th Edition!\nOur aims and campaign are simple: To see how large a 5th Edition bestiary we can create with your help! \nAt the heart of our campaign is The Scarred Lands Creature Collection for 5th Edition. We want to run a very focused, easy-to-understand campaign, and it\u2019s all about the book.\nThe Creature Collection begins at 160 pages, and will feature roughly 140 monsters. Most occupy a full page, some occupy two, occasionally they\u2019re longer. None are split up across pages - they always occupy at least one full page. We think this is vital feature for ease of usage: We want to give you a good-sized illustration for every adversary, along with a good depth of info and tips on using the creature. We also want the book to be a joy to read and use at the table.\nIf the campaign is successful, the book will grow, with additional monsters added as stretch goals are met. You will still pay the same price you pledged at, so it\u2019s worth getting in early and bringing in as many friends as you can! Together we can get MORE MONSTERS!\nWith this campaign our job is to make a single volume, so we're maxing it out at 256 pages. That way we don't break the bank shipping it to you, nor get delayed in delivery. But fear not, there are plenty of additional rewards we'll unlock should we grow beyond that point!\nEvery creature in the Collection is illustrated in full colour and, of course, is fully statted and described, as you would expect.\nThe book will be ordered alphabetically so that if you know what you\u2019re looking for you\u2019ll be able to quickly find it with maximum simplicity. When we reached out to DMs the thing we heard most was the need to be able to look things up easily. We all agree that we\u2019re frustrated by having monsters grouped by type, so we\u2019re using an A-Z navigation option for those times you know the name of the creature you\u2019re looking up.\nIn addition to this, we\u2019ve designed in a bunch of additional navigation aids to make this book super-useful:\nEvery monster has a tab at the side of the page that shows its CR, and they\u2019re colour-coded into groups. That allows you to very quickly gauge what kind of challenge each monster presents to your party.\nThere\u2019s also a series of tabs lower down the page edge that show in which habitat the creature can be found. \nThese tabs each sit in a fixed, exclusive position on the page edge, so when you flick through, you can easily spot what you're looking for. \nThe book will be fully indexed by monster name, and also by CR.\nThe Creature Collection is also available in PDF format. \nThe PDF will be fully bookmarked and hyperlinked. It will be delivered via DriveThruRPG so you\u2019ll have it in your library.\n Accompanying many of the reward tiers is The Digital Pack.\nThis is a set of digital accessories that complement the Creature Collection. Much of the content will be unlocked via stretch goals, so the more pledges we get, the better the Digital Pack becomes, at no extra cost! \nIt will contain digital poster-sized files of any unlocked battle maps from Encounter Pack stretch goals, along with additional battle maps suited to VTT formats and a VTT-friendly version of the Creature Collection if we do well.\nWe\u2019ll include digital files of art of the creatures to show your players, and we may unlock further accessories like VTT tokens and digital \u201cpaper\u201d miniatures. The Digital Pack will be delivered via DriveThruRPG so you\u2019ll have it in your library.\nFor the true Scarred Lands fan, the limited edition hardcover is a wonderful collector's item. Strictly limited to 100 copies, this tome comes in a leather-effect cover (vegan, not dead animal), embossed with the skull of a Spider Goblin. We'll be giving you more details on this exclusive volume during the campaign.  \nThe original Creature Collection was the genesis of the Scarred Lands setting. Scarn and the Divine War grew out of the Creature Collections to become its own vibrant, unique setting.\n\u201cA world known to its inhabitants as Scarn, the Scarred Lands is a place of dynamic heroism, supreme villainy, and incalculable magic. Torn and twisted by battles between the titans and their children, the young gods \u2014fought largely by monstrous titanspawn pitted against humans, elves, dwarves, and other \u201cdivine races\u201d \u2014 Scarn is a world still wounded deeply by the Divine War that took place less than two centuries ago.\nThe Scarred Lands has been a favored fantasy setting since the release of the Creature Collection in 2000. Over the next several years, over 40 titles were published for the Scarred Lands, making it one of the most fully supported fantasy RPG settings ever and the premiere product line of the former Sword & Sorcery Studios\u201d\nThe great news is that while the Creature Collection is a must-have for 5th edition Scarred Lands players, it works just as well for all 5th Edition games! \nWe want your help to decide which creatures to include. We\u2019ve already gathered choices from the Scarred Lands Corebook Kickstarter, from members of the Scarred Lands team, from our writers and artists, and now we want you to help select the next bunch of adversaries. We\u2019ll be running backer-only polls throughout the campaign where you\u2019ll get to choose which monsters are included in this Creature Collection.\nCreatures will be grouped into teams, and they'll battle, the winner being decided by your votes. Don't worry if your favourite Scarred Lands beast gets knocked out! Each creature gets more than one chance of being included in our tournament system! (and it's intended as a bit of fun. We won't wreck the collection so it includes 100 versions of Creature McCreatureface)\n Throughout the campaign we\u2019ll be sharing previews of our monsters! You can get two free chunks here and here, and then throughout the campaign further weekly previews will be backer-only. So if you\u2019d like to get a bunch of monsters for 5e over the next 4 weeks, jump on board!\n We've moved the stretch goal graphic to the top of the campaign to make it nice and easy to find!\nOur stretch goals add pages to the Collection, handy stuff to the Digital Pack, and Encounter Packs.\nHere's an example of an Encounter Pack: The Temple of the Stars. With some details redacted in case you end up playing it! \nWe\u2019ll also expand the Digital Pack that\u2019s available with selected reward tiers with things like VTT tokens, battle maps and more!\nTo Add-On additional copies of the Scarred Lands Creature Collection for 5e including a PDF and an additional copy of the Digital Pack, add the following:\nFor the US: $60 per copy (includes shipping)\nFor The UK/EU: $60 per copy  (includes shipping)\nFor Brazil: $70 per copy  (includes shipping)\nFor everywhere else: $65 per copy  (includes shipping)\nAs part of our campaign, we\u2019re also offering you the chance to grab previous Scarred Lands titles at a great price!\nWe begin with three adds ons: the 5e Scarred Lands Player's Guide in print, and 2 PDF bundles.\nTo get The 5e Scarred Lands Player's Guide in print,  including shipping, simply up your pledge by $30.\nTo get the The 3e Bundle, simply up your pledge by $15.\n\n                              To get The 5e Bundle, simply up your pledge by $15.\n\n\n                              Here\u2019s the details of each Add-On:\nThe Scarred Lands Player's Guide for 5e is a 312 page full colour guide to this fabulous setting.

This is a world shaped by gods and monsters, and only the greatest of heroes can expect to be counted among them. The most populous continent of Scarn, Ghelspad, plays host to vast unexplored regions, hides unsolved riddles from ancient cultures, and taunts adventures with the promise of undiscovered riches hidden among the ruins of older civilizations.\nYet the myths of the Scarred Lands are relatively recent events.

In this revised edition of The Wise & the Wicked, all the same characters have returned (and we\u2019ve added some new ones, too!), all newly updated to 5th Edition rules, for use with the Scarred Lands Player\u2019s Guide.\nThe Wise & the Wicked introduces a rogue\u2019s gallery of the Scarred Lands\u2019 movers and shakers, characters who carry out the will of the gods or the fallen titans. These non-player characters can be friends, enemies, or simply convenient resources for the player characters in your game.\nHere you\u2019ll find a fascinating compendium of characters from the Scarred Lands, but easily transported into campaigns set elsewhere. In addition, find multiple appendices full of new magic items and artifacts, class archetypes and prestige classes, new feats, new creatures and races, and more.\nWe already have 60 monsters converted, edited, illustrated and laid out, so work is well progressed. Our systems are all in place, and we have an extremely experienced, talented and motivated team ready to complete the project should we fund.  We have more writers and artists in the wings waiting on the green light to start more conversions should we fund. And if we do really well we'll expand that team further.\n  With this Kickstarter we want to get this important and useful traditionally printed book into stores\".  And we\u2019re relying on your help! We're also using this Kickstarter to open up our EU and RoW shipping options.\nWe've worked hard to secure a European shipping option for this campaign, so that we can ship from both the EU and the US, reducing costs to you, and making it viable for our European friends to get in on the action without incurring high shipping fees and import duty!\nThis means this campaign is a little different than others from Onyx Path Publishing. Most of the differences occur backstage, but if it goes well then you may well see more EU-friendly shipping in future.\nThe main difference to you, the backer, is that shipping to the EU and so-called \"Rest of World\" is much cheaper than it has been historically, and books will be dispatched from both the EU and the US.\nThe team producing the Scarred Lands Creature Collection and running this campaign is Handiwork Games. We were approached by Rich Thomas of Onyx Path to lend a hand in creating this whole supplement. We are an extremely experienced team of game producers, writers and artists, led by industry veteran Jon Hodgson, who was formerly creative director at Cubicle Seven, and oversaw all creative production there for 3 years.\nFounded in 2012, Onyx Path Publishing is a Pennsylvania-based company dedicated to the development of exemplary, immersive worlds. Working with a group of amazingly talented creators, we explore print, electronic and other forms of media distribution to make our products available to our fans.\nOnyx Path staff are united in our common background with White Wolf Publishing and we will continue to supplement those famous product settings with new releases, while adding to the industry with brand-new concepts for game play. We are lucky to include ENnie, GAMA and other award-winning creatives as contributors to our upcoming release schedule. Their commitment to quality reflects the goal of Onyx Path and the reason for our existence.\nWith over 20 years of publishing experience from which to draw, we are industry professionals who love the art of the game and plan to continue making meaningful, innovative contributions in the years to come.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween us, we have run or co-run a wide variety of Kickstarter Campaigns. \n\nThe usual risks apply here - if we grow the project beyond the initial scope there may be a short delay on delivery while we make extra material. \n\nIf we encounter sudden delays in converting material for reasons unknown, or the international shipping suddenly changes dramatically we may see some delays while we replan. \n\nBut we won't stop work because of any of these things.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Weekly Preview PDFs", "descp": "You'll get free weekly PDFs during the cmapaign, showing off samples of the creatures found in the Creature Collection.

Someone changed you: on a slab, an operating table, an altar. By luck or by fate, you escaped. Hunted by your creators, they hold all the cards, and it seems they might recapture you. Except, what they don\u2019t understand is they\u2019ve stoked the fires of vengeance; what they did wasn\u2019t right. What they don\u2019t know is that now \u2014 you\u2019re hunting them.\nDeviant: The Renegades presents a game where the victims of experiments band together to bring down the monolithic organizations that twisted and warped them.\nA brand new game is added to the Chronicles of Darkness...\nThe Chronicles of Darkness, which debuted in 2004 as the new World of Darkness, drew upon the roots of the original World of Darkness and introduced a new look into a shadowy, dangerous world. Players could step into the everyday shoes of mortals, or they could vie for power and control as a vampire, werewolf, changeling, Sin-Eater, and more.\nNow, some 15 years later, the Chronicles of Darkness and its supporting lines are flourishing, with each game receiving second editions, starting with the 2013 release of the Chronicles of Darkness rulebook.\nIn Deviant: The Renegades, players take on the characters of the Remade, human beings who have been transformed into something else through the action of human actors. No millennia-old curse, moon-spirit\u2019s favor, or Supernal Watchtower changed the Remade into what they are; their state is the result of chanted spells, long surgeries, experimental treatments, bizarre accidents, or alchemical poisons. Their creators \u2014 Progenitors \u2014 have human faces; they are people who saw what lurks in the shadows of the world and wanted power for themselves. Many Remade \u2014 Devoted \u2014 still serve the conspiracies that changed them. The player characters are Renegades, Remade who have escaped the clutches of their creators\u2026 for now.\nThis Deviant: The Renegades Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a prestige hardcover edition designed to match the look and feel of our other Chronicles of Darkness core rulebooks such as Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, or Changeling: The Lost.\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed on a metallic under layer, and featuring an emboss/deboss of the logo. We estimate the book to be more than 250+ pages, with a two-color interior and endpapers on high quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including new Forms, expansions to the core systems, enhanced rules for Devoted and conspiracies, and additional settings and conspiracies! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nNOT FINAL DESIGN\nDeviant: The Renegades includes all the rules you need to play as one of the Remade: Origins and Clades that reflect the circumstances of your Divergence and the nature of your transformation, Variations and Scars that describe the powers you wield and the price you pay for them, and conspiracy rules that let the whole troupe flesh out the faceless organizations that serve as the game\u2019s main antagonists.\n Chapter 1: Origins and Clades introduces the various ways Deviants become Remade and how the conspiracies classify and divide them.\n Chapter 2: Setting reveals the world in which Deviants live. Here we examine the Divergence\u2019s effects, how the Broken meet their daily needs, and how they take the fight to the conspiracies.\n Chapter 3: Renegades provides rules and game systems to make Remade characters, their powers and the burdens they carry as a result of their Divergences.\n Chapter 4: Storytelling System presents all the core rules necessary to run a game of Deviant: The Renegades, including rules for explosions, radiation, and corrosive substances.\n Chapter 5: Antagonists covers the people and organizations who hunt the transformed, and who the Deviants hunt in return. This chapter provides systems for creating your own conspiracies, and how they react to the actions of the characters.\n Chapter 6: Settings and Sample Conspiracies tours the world, examining several locations in how the conspiracies and Broken struggle against each other, and one another.\n Chapter 7: Storytelling gives tips on running successful games of Deviant, and explores the game\u2019s niche of transformation and revenge.\nThe Appendices provide lists of the equipment, Conditions, and Tilts that are likely to come into play in Deviant.\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Deviant: The Renegades manuscript as backer-only updates.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of the Deviant: The Renegades that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers, but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into the book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Deviant: The Renegades, possibly expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done: build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imagination. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our cohort.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($35,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to see a larger version of this reward tier chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Touchstone and Renegade Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (Devoted Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Manticore Companion and Cohort Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!). \nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Deviant: The Renegades campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Node) will get 5 copies of the Deviant: The Renegades Core rulebook (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Deviant setting or a possible future supplement. There's even an opportunity to act as a CONSULTING DEVELOPER, an observer from the shadows, with access to communication channels shared by the developers and writers. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Deviant: The Renegades. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nPDF VERSION - The digital version of Deviant: The Renegades, fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DrivethruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nPRESTIGE HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Deviant: The Renegades, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com and cards from DriveThruCards.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run.\nFor +$10 EACH, add any of these CHRONICLES OF DARKNESS titles to your digital library:\n +$10 for Chronicles of Darkness Core Rulebook PDF \n +$10 for Vampire: the Requiem 2nd Edition PDF \n +$10 for Werewolf: the Forsaken 2nd Edition PDF \n +$10 for Mage: the Awakening 2nd Edition PDF \n +$10 for Beast: The Primordial PDF \n +$10 for Chronicles of Darkness: Dark Eras PDF \n +$10 for Demon: The Descent PDF \n+$10 for Promethen: The Created 2nd Edition PDF\n\nPHYSICAL REWARDS\nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional books) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of Deviant: The Renegades (Reward Tiers of $50+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when the book becomes available.\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement  \nAchieved! - At $40,000 in funding \u2013  NEW ADD ON: Storyteller Screen. We\u2019ll create a Deviant: The Renegades Storyteller Screen. Can be added on to any reward tier containing a hardcover book for only +$20.\nAchieved!  - At $45,000 in funding \u2013 NEW SUPPLEMENT: The Clades Companion PDF. As Cephalists embrace wildernesses of the imagination, so we will create a new supplement that moves beyond a purely human experience, introducing Forms designed for Storytellers and players who want to introduce Deviants who were not originally human beings (or at least not ones native to Earth). This includes sapient animals, androids, ephemeral entities trapped in human bodies, and exiles from alternate dimensions and timelines. All backers receiving the Deviant: The Renegades PDF as part of their pledge level will automatically have the Clades Companion PDF added to their rewards list.\nAchieved! - At $50,000 in funding \u2013 CELEBRATION OF DARKNESS ADD-ON UPGRADE: We\u2019ll add the Beast: The Primordial PDF to the list of title options, and reduce the price to $12 EACH for this Add On.\nAchieved! - At $56,000 in funding \u2013 SUPPLEMENT EXPANSION: The Clades Companion PDF. As Chimerics are at home with every species of animal, the Clades Companion PDF will be expanded to include a wide assortment of sample animals and Manticores - perfect for Remade with the Manticore Companion Merit or the Animal Transformation Variation.\nAchieved!  - At $59,000 in funding \u2013 KICKSTARTER BACKER T-SHIRT \u2013 Hosted on the redbubble store for a limited time, a Deviant: The Renegades-themed shirt will be priced at a steep discount. All backers will be notified when the shirt becomes available.\nAchieved! - At $62,000 in funding  \u2013 SUPPLEMENT EXPANSION: The Clades Companion PDF. Coactives have connections to worlds not our own, and so The Clades Companion PDF will be expanded to include full ephemeral entities rules, including guidelines for creating new Numina and parallel worlds using Deviant\u2019s toolbox approach, as well as guidance on how these beings interact with Variations such as Otherworldly Connection.\nAchieved! - At $65,000 in funding  \u2013 CELEBRATION OF DARKNESS ADD-ON UPGRADE: We\u2019ll add Chronicles of Darkness: Dark Eras PDF to the list of title options, and reduce the price to $11 EACH for this Add On. \nAchieved! - At $68,000 in funding \u2013 SUPPLEMENT EXPANSION: The Clades Companion PDF. Invasives maximize the effectiveness of every tool that passes into their hands, and so The Clades Companion PDF will be expanded to include more equipment, as well rules for high-tech prototypes and shoddy goods and services.\nAchieved - At $70,000 in funding \u2013 DIGITAL WALLPAPER \u2013 An awesome digital wallpaper for your computer desktop featuring art from Deviant: The Renegades. All backers will have this automatically added to their rewards list.\nAchieved - At $72,000 in funding \u2013 SUPPLEMENT EXPANSION: The Clades Companion PDF. No Clade embodies the strange and dehumanizing effects of Divergence quite the way the Mutant does, and so The Clades Companion PDF will be expanded with new Forms that transcend the singularity of the self and the flesh-and-blood body \u2013 a human consciousness uploaded to a mainframe, a talking mystical item, or an advanced A.I. with a drone for a chassis. Or, introduce Remade who are part of a line of clones or replicants who share memories, such that physical death is little more than an inconvenience; some even have whole wardrobes of new bodies, each one customized to match an urgent practical need (or just the Broken\u2019s current mood).\nAchieved! - At $74,000 in funding \u2013 CELEBRATION OF DARKNESS ADD-ON UPGRADE: We\u2019ll add Demon: The Descent PDF to the list of title options, and reduce the price to $10 EACH for this Add On.\nAchieved! - At $77,000 in funding \u2013 DEVIANT: THE RENEGADES NOVELLA - A short story written to better define the Deviant play experience and the world in which it takes place. All backers receiving the Deviant: The Renegades PDF will have this automatically added to their rewards list.\nAchieved! - At $80,000 in funding \u2013 NEW SUPPLEMENT: The Devoted Companion PDF - We\u2019ll create a new supplement that explores the Devoted in greater depth. This will include new Forms, as well as greatly expanded conspiracy and Devoted rules to give Storytellers and players the tools they need to portray the Renegades\u2019 foils. All backers receiving the Deviant: The Renegades PDF as part of their pledge level will automatically have the Devoted Companion PDF added to their rewards list.\nAchieved! - At $82,000 in funding \u2013 CELEBRATION OF DARKNESS ADD-ON UPGRADE: We\u2019ll add Promethean: The Created 2nd Edition PDF to the list of +$10 Add On title options in the Celebration of Darkness Add On Reward list.\nAt $84,000 in funding \u2013 CELEBRATION OF DARKNESS ADD-ON UPGRADE: We\u2019ll add Changeling: The Lost 2nd Edition PDF to the list of +$10 Add On title options in the Celebration of Darkness Add On Reward list.\nAt $87,500 in funding \u2013 ART BUDGET INCREASE - Additional funds will be allocated to the art budget, adding more evocative art to the Deviant: The Renegades book.\nThis is Onyx Path Publishing's 38th Kickstarter, and the company has learned how to maintain focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Deviant: The Renegades is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com.

If they are lucky they'll get to a tavern the sells their favourite drink!  \nIncluded in the game is an expansion called \"Under the Table.\" where different drinking establishments are visited,  each with their own unique rules of etiquette and different breweries for drinks.\n We need your help to bring Dwarven Beerfest to life! \n\n\nTo purchase an add-on simply increase your pledge amount by the price of the game you want to add on.  \nSupporting our Kickstarter is easy!

In PunkApocalyptic: The Roleplaying Game, based on the wild and irreverent miniatures game of the same name by Bad Roll Games, you and your friends assume the roles of mercenaries who roam the Wasteland. In this bleak and radioactive land, you fight to survive, explore the ruins of what came before, and trade blood, sweat, and tears for the precious bullets that have become the land's currency. Explore the radioactive ruins, fight battle-crazed mutants, negotiate with bizarre cultists, bargain with junkers and scavengers, and unearth fantastic relics from the past. Brutal and filthy, PunkApocalyptic: The RPG offers thrilling adventures steeped in the carnage of a bleak and devastated future.    \n\n As a huge thank you to everyone who has supported so far, all backers of Scavenger and higher get FOUR bonus missions!     \nArt by Matteo Spirito\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG uses a variant of the Demon Lord Engine, introduced first in the horror-fantasy roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord. Designed for a short-burst campaign of eleven adventures, with flexible character development, and no-nonsense, streamlined rules, you can bang out a character in no time and get down to the business of kicking ass.\nYou start the game as a fragile survivor, choosing from a list of eight backgrounds such as Muscle or Face. Once you complete your first mission, you assemble a team, and choose a novice path to guide your character's development. Novice paths include the mutated freaks, killers, and scum. The more missions you complete, the more choices you make, picking up an expert path and eventually a master path.\nPunkApocalyptic: The RPG includes some variations on the Demon Lord Engine, such as using eight attributes instead of four, with Grit as a healing resource, along with a few other changes. If you know how to play Shadow of the Demon Lord, you'll have no trouble playing this game. And if you don't yet know Shadow of the Demon Lord, well, it's easy, using familiar dice rolling conventions to make it easier for folks familiar with some of the other well-known roleplaying games currently being played today. \nArt by Matteo Spirito; This could be you!\nWant to learn more?

Over 600 backers jumped in with $26,000 in funding in March of 2019. That campaign produced another 128-page, Norse-inspired setting book, with three large settlements, sample villages, and a relationship map to tie all the factional strife together. Those books are all in backers' hands.\nThe Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn campaign also produced a second edition of Hall of Judgment\u2014with a glorious sewn, lay-flat binding just like that of The Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn. Running concurrently with the Dungeon Fantasy RPG Monsters 2 and Boxed Set Reprint campaign, it also resulted in Fantastic Dungeon Grappling . . . an eight-page booklet with awesome new ways to get eaten by monsters. Or grapple folks. But mostly get eaten by monsters.\nThree books in a year . . . and now Gaming Ballistic would like to produce three more: two adventure/setting books, and a small character generation supplement detailing new playable races with flavor specific to the Nor\u00f0lond world.\nPlease join Gaming Ballistic to create these new Nor\u00f0lond Sagas, published under a continuing license for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG from Steve Jackson Games. \nThe Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game\u2122, Powered by GURPS \u00ae, GURPS \u00ae, and the names of all products published by Steve Jackson Games Incorporated are trademarks or registered trademarks of Steve Jackson Games Incorporated, and used under license.

All rights reserved.\nThe Dragons of Rosgarth\nThis setting expansion and adventure scenario details the towns of Midgard and Jarngar\u00f0r, and provides a looming threat worthy of a party of seasoned delvers. Targeted at four to six delvers of 300 points or more. Written by Kyle Norton (Dungeons on Automatic).\nThe Ruins of Rosgarth are occupied again, this much is certain. But mining caravans and logging expeditions are being threatened by growing hordes of undead, as well as surging ranks of dragonkin. Wizards and clerics alike are muttering uneasily as they feel magic itself in a state of unrest. The Aesir whisper in the dreams of heroes. Journey into the wilds north of Audreyn's Wall to Rosgarth Ruins. Investigate the source of the danger . . . and defeat it if you can. \nCover work-in-progress. Image is final, but back cover text is still lorem ipsum!\nForest's End \nThe King proclaimed some time ago that for the first time in centuries, the ranks of the nobility would be expanding, with lands available for those bold enough to hold them. The catch? The lands lay beyond Audreyn's Wall, where dragonkin roam, giants dwell, and all manner of creatures make their lairs.\nAnd yet the Dragongrounds, as they are called, are home to countless ruins and dungeons . . . and the boundless and magical wealth of the fallen empire of the Dragon Queens. One thegn, more than bold enough to take up the King's challenge, built a fortified settlement near where the forest meets the sea: Sk\u00f3garenda . . . Forest's End.\nSeveral years have passed, and the settlement has thrived. The thegn is ready to claim his rightful status as lord and jarl. A great feast is planned. What could go wrong?\nForest's End features several threats and three actual dungeons to delve for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG! Written by Merlin Avery. \nSample internal layout with page border and header. Content is from Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn for illustration purposes only.\nNor\u00f0londr F\u00f3lk \n This short supplement brings at least 16 different playable racial templates to supplement those from Dungeon Fantasy Adventurers. Including Nor\u00f0lond-specific versions of elves and dwarves, it also provides ties to other cosmology for the setting: dragon-blooded, children of humans and demons, and other hybrids, such as raven-folk and those who are brothers and sisters to bear and boar. With new traits available for every Dungeon Fantasy RPG race, this book allows you to tie all of the \"usual suspects\" in with the Nor\u00f0lond setting and bring some entirely new abilities to your games. Easily portable to other settings. Written by Kevin Smyth, who was deeply involved with writing and proofing the pre-generated characters from Hall of Judgment.\nDraft cover work-in-progress. Back cover presentation subject to change!\nThere are only three goals for the project: The basic funding goal that we need to get the thing done at all, a level where the printing gets to a higher quality, and a goal where the adventures get some extra page count.\nBasic Funding Goal: $15,000\nAt 15,000 we've secured enough funding to pay the authors, the artists, and get the books printed to the following page counts:\nNor\u00f0londr F\u00f3lk: 16 pages (the full book)\nThe Dragons of Rosgarth: 48 pages\nForest's End: 64 pages\nNo matter what, the books will be 8x10\" format (like all other Dungeon Fantasy RPG products), softcover, and full-color.\nAt this goal level, physical copies will be fulfilled by Print on Demand or short-run digital printing, with manufacturing location optimized for international and domestic fulfillment (that might mean a short run with a PoD printer here in the USA, with international copies by Lightning Source/DriveThru RPG or\u2014if I can find a good deal\u2014someone like CPI Anthony Rowe in the UK).\nHigh-Quality Print Run: 300 Physical Copies\nAt 300 physical copies (and based on past Kickstarters, that's about 450 total backers, and about $22,000 ... but the goal is based on the number of physical orders) it becomes more cost effective to get a high volume print run from the same printers who did Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn and Hall of Judgment (Second Edition).\nAt this level, all three books will feature upgraded paper (130gsm/87#) and a 255gsm (about 10 point) cover. The scenario books will get a sewn, lay-flat binding; the races book will always be saddle-stitched (stapled).\nIncreased Page Count: $29,000\nIf the campaign hits $29,000, then both The Dragons of Rosgarth and Forest's End will each get a 16 page boost. That gives more room for creatures, extra scenarios, and other goodness.\n Add-ons\nAdd-ons are extras that can be placed in your backpack of holding during the campaign. To add these items to your rewards, simply include the listed cost as part of your pledge.\nThe added funds appear as a credit during the Backerkit phase . . . pledging them early helps the project fund! \nNote that some of the products below are not for the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game, but rather for Fifth Edition, Swords & Wizardry, or my own Dragon Heresy.

This book offers detailed information on the denizens of Asgard, the divine realm worshipped by the people of Nor\u00f0lond and its surrounding regions.\nThe book presents additional options and guidelines presented for Clerics who choose to devote themselves to the worship of just one instead of the pantheon as a whole. Also included are more than twenty new Holy Might abilities available for Asgardian Clerics and Holy Warriors to bring the word . . . or the sword . . . to those that need it.\nThe book is 16 pages long, in 8\u00d710 format, in full color. Written by Kevin Smyth.\nThe Hand of Asgard: $10 in print, $5 in PDF; $13 Print+PDF\nExtra Copies of Kickstarter Books\nIf you're a PDF-only backer plus you want another copy of one of the books, or if you want to add books for gifts, or anything else, once you've made a pledge, you can add individual copies of the books later on in the Backerkit phase.\nAs long as you're part of the campaign (pledge at least $1), during the add-on phase you will be able to get the following prices regardless of hitting stretch goals. (If we hit the 'more page count goal' and it's a pre-order, rather than adding on to an existing pledge, it may cost a few dollars more to get the larger books).\nNordlondr Folk: $10 in print, $5 in PDF; $13 Print+PDF\nRosgarth: $18 in print at 48 pages; $9 in PDF, and $23 Print+PDF\nForest's End: $21 in print at 64 pages; $11 as PDF; $26 Print+PDF\nNor\u00f0lond Area Map\nIsfjall, Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn, Midgard, Jarngar\u00f0r, and Sk\u00f3gurenda.

The maps in the various books keep the focus on the local adventuring areas . . . but what if you want the longer view?\nGaming Ballistic is pleased to offer two options for larger-scale maps. The image below is from the Dragon Heresy RPG, and done in that style. The maps will be re-drawn by Glynn Seal to match other Nor\u00f0lond maps presented in Hall of Judgment and Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn.  \nThey come in two flavors.\n$5\u2014Two-Page Paper Map.

These will be printed on 14 point/300gsm card stock with a gloss lamination, in either 16x20\" or A2 format. Be warned: shipping is separate, and may be expensive, since this will certainly be a large format package.\nThe Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn\nThe Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn is a setting for theDungeon Fantasy RPG. It details three major settlements, provides a small village generator, and presents two important adventuring locations: The Hunted Lands to the northwest of The Palisade, and the Endalaus Forest, to the north and east of Audreyn's Wall. It is a setting filled with adventuring possibilities, easily tuned up or down in power level as the GM desires to suit any fantasy campaign!\nGood luck, and may the Fates have a bold destiny in store for you!\n The Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn (PDF): $14 \n The Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn (Print-only): $28 \n The Citadel at Nor\u00f0v\u00f6rn (Print+PDF): $35 \nFantastic Dungeon Grappling\nFantastic Dungeon Grappling takes the \"attack roll, defense roll, damage roll\" basic play of Powered by GURPS and makes it work for grappling as well.

Find the waybridge that will transport you instantly to your destination, or journey overland for weeks through treacherous terrain.\nWhen you get there, will you be able to prove your worth and enter the Lost Hall of Tyr . . . or will a conniving High Lady of the Fae thwart your intentions?\nThe digital version is a 112-page PDF, hyperlinked, bookmarked, and in full color.\nThe Print and PDF bundle is for those that want a tangible copy of the original. Printed perfect-bound on 100# matte white paper, copies in the USA will ship from Gaming Ballistic, while overseas will fulfill through CPI (and are slightly thinner).\n Lost Hall of Tyr (PDF): $15 \n Lost Hall of Tyr (Print Only): $30 \n Lost Hall of Tyr (Print + PDF): $40 \nThe Dragon Heresy Introductory Set\nThe Norse-inspired world of Etera gets a full treatment in this self-contained RPG. All you need to play through Level 1-5, including setting, rules, character creation, and a bestiary featuring over 100 Norse-inspired critters.\nThis 288-page RPG is a stand-alone game based on Fifth Edition, but modified to be significantly more interesting. Wounds are differentiated from vigor, armor has Damage Reduction (DR) rather than making you harder to hit, and shields are just way, way cooler.\nBased on real-world combat research, inspired by Norse mythology, and with speed and fun of play foremost in mind, this is Gaming Ballistic's flagship product to date.\nThe PDF is hyperlinked and cross-referenced. The background, art, and borders can be turned off as layers for toner-saving ease of printing and accessibility for those with vision contrast challenges.\nThe print version got an offset print run, and the book is nearly an inch thick, on 85# matte-paper, with a smyth-sewn binding. This is a beautiful book, and showcases how much more you can do in Nor\u00f0lond (called Torengar in the book).\n Dragon Heresy Introductory Set (PDF): $20 \nDragon Heresy Introductory Set (Print Only): $50\n Dragon Heresy Introductory Set (Print + PDF): $60 \nTo help manage post-campaign add-ons, as well as the distribution of the final products to backers, Gaming Ballistic uses Backerkit to conduct post-Kickstarter surveys and collect shipping. Fulfillment is done through distribution and shipping partners.\nBackerkit is a company whose purpose is to help creators manage these details, including add-ons and shipping costs. When the campaign ends, you will be invited to fill out a Backerkit survey to confirm shipping details, and choose any add-ons you might like to purchase. If you've pledged more than your reward total, this will show as a credit on your account.\nThe Backerkit phase will only last between 14 days. It is important to promptly provide an accurate shipping address if you order physical product.\n \"Ships to Whole World\" is not Free Shipping! \nAn important point: the project will ship to the entire world.\nShipping in the USA of physical product will use the USPS media mail, and shipping is  added to your pledge total during the Backerkit phase. Fulfillment of US books is executed by Studio 2 Publishing. Please do NOT add shipping to your pledge total in advance of the Backerkit phase!\nInternational shipping will use a short digital print run or POD done in the United Kingdom or in the EU in order to control shipping costs unless we hit an offset print run (in which case all books are printed in Latvia). International fulfillment is currently executed through Royal Mail by Kixto, a UK-based partner. Currently, moving books from Latvia to the UK is very easy; that is subject to unpredictable change due to Brexit.\nEither way, I don't control shipping costs, and there's no way around it: International shipping is very expensive, and time-consuming to boot. If you purchase certain add-ons, such as a physical copy of Dragon Heresy or Dungeon Grappling, Gaming Ballistic will do everything possible to group them into a single shipment to reduce costs, but that might not be possible. Certain countries (such as Brazil) are ridiculously expensive to ship to, and those costs will need to be passed on during the Backerkit phase.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe primary risk to backers is the timing of delivery.\n\nThe writing is substantially complete, and will complete during the campaign. The art will be all new, and delays due to timing of completion of writing, art, and maps could occur. An offset print run, which is my target, takes a bit longer and on-the-water shipping can be unpredictable.\n\nGaming Ballistic provides regular updates as to the project\u2019s progress.\n\nInternational shipping is unpredictable and expensive, subject to many variables beyond my ability to predict, let alone control. The add-ons in particular may come from different locations depending on where stock is manufactured or stored, and may still add up to a good deal of money. Gaming Ballistic will work with you to do the best we can, but it may still be expensive.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Rafeindasaga (New PDFs only)", "descp": "This pledge tier gets you a PDF copy of each of the three books in the campaign.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Dragons of Rosgarth (PDF)\nForest's End (PDF)\nNor\u00f0londr F\u00f3lk (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["114 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Allar S\u00f6gurnar (All six Nordlond PDFs)", "descp": "Digital copies (PDF) of all the Nordlond books to date: Four adventure/setting books, and two rules supplements.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Dragons of Rosgarth (PDF)\nForest's End (PDF)\nNor\u00f0londr F\u00f3lk (PDF)\nHall of Judgment (PDF)\nThe Citadel at Nor\u00f0vorn (PDF)\nFantastic Dungeon Grappling (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Nordlondr Baekr (Print + PDFs)", "descp": "Print and PDF copies of all three new books.

War and Peace will be given the deluxe treatment in this re-issue.   \nFrom  the rainy opening months of 1796 through the climactic summer of 1815,  the entire decades-long conflict between France, England, Austria,  Prussia, Russia, and  Spain, is re-created in 13 separate scenarios.  Each historical scenario is presented as a separate 2-player game with  an average playing time  of 2-3 hours. Also included  is the Grand Campaign Game that covers the 10 year conflict of Empires  from 1805-1815.  \nOn December 2nd, 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned Emperor of  France. By placing the crown upon his head with his own hands, Bonaparte  brought all of Europe to the brink of war. For by its very nature, the  act of self-coronation threatened the rule and challenged the legitimacy  of every government then in existence.  \nTo restore the sanctity of the divine right and position based on noble  birth, the European monarchies branded Bonaparte an international outlaw  and pledged to remain as war against France until the Corsican usurper  was overthrown and the Bourbon was restored. For the next ten years the  fate of the French Empire rested on the on the abilities of the man: as a  warrior and as a peacemaker. \nNow YOU command Napoleon's Grand Armee!\nWhat you will get with this new version of the wonderful old game is all of the Napoleonic Campaigns in one box plus a newly revised Grand Campaign Game, with all new map, components, modern artwork, and greatly  updated rules with new optional rules for chrome and increased emphasis  on the Operational Arts. \nFrom project lead and co-designer John Gant:\n         \" This  project was about 150 hour of  work and love from me and a couple others to get it ready for One Small Step Games to look at it and that  is on top of the incredible initial labor, and the ongoing work published in the General Magazine and much more including all of  the comments and questions from the gaming audience. It would  have been impossible to have gotten to this point without the labor and  love of  countless people. Any errors or issues with this current  version are  mine alone. I wish to extend respect,  thanks, and appreciation to  everyone who has ever touched this fine  game. Thank you! Seeing the amazing work done this year by the team at  OSS Games to create this definitive version of the game, especially the  work of Paul and Antonio, plus Mark and Jon's  support, has been an amazing fulfillment of decades of work that I have  had the honor to bring to fruition.  I truly hope this new  version  provides countless new hours of enjoyment and enriched  historical  engagement for gamers young and old. \" \nThe Map\nThe map depicts the major terrain features and political boundaries that existed in Europe at the start of the Nineteenth Century. A hexagonal grid is superimposed upon the map to regulate movement and positioning of playing pieces and delineate the various terrain features affecting play. The map is scaled so that each hexagon (or hex) represents approximately 40 miles in width. The various terrain features the map depicts are illustrated with their effects on combat and movement explained by the Terrain Effects Chart.\nThe Playing Pieces\nThe die-cut playing pieces, hereafter referred to as unit counters, represent the armed forces and leaders that fought in the Napoleonic Wars. Armies and navies are abstractly and symbolically represented as infantry, cavalry, squadrons, or naval transport units. The large number printed on these units indicates their combat value measured in \"strength points\". Each infantry or cavalry strength point represents approximately 5,000 combat soldiers. Each naval strength point represents six vessels.\nThe Books\nWar & Peace will contain four books: The Rule Book, Campaign Book, Scenarios Book, and the Operational Methods Guide.\nThe Rule book is 20 pages of fully illustrated instructions to play the game. It is replete with examples of play, detailed explanations, and optional rules. Want to check it out? Download it right here.\nThe Campaign book is a 28 page illustrated booklet that explains the complete campaign game in detail, including brief history, setup, and special rules. Want to check it out? Here you go (click here).\nThe 24 page Scenarios Book contains 13 scenarios that allow you to play out individual campaigns rather than the entire war. Scenarios include (click here to see the book):\nTHE ITALIAN CAMPAIGN OF 1796\u201397\nTHE ARMY OF THE ORIENT, BONAPARTE IN EGYPT 1798\u201399\nMARENGO: 1800\nTHE SUN OF AUSTERLITZ \u2014 1805\nNAPOLEON\u2019S APOGEE: 1806\u20131807\nWAGRAM \u2014 1809\nTHE CAMPAIGN IN RUSSIA \u2014 1812\nSTRUGGLE OF NATIONS \u2014 1813\nNAPOLEON AT BAY \u2014 1814\nTHE WATERLOO CAMPAIGN \u2014 1815\nTHE PENINSULAR WAR: 1808\u20131814\nSPAIN: 1811\u20131814\nTHE FINAL GLORY: 1812\u20131814\nThe 4-page Operational Methods book is an illustrated examination of how the game can recreate the famous actions of the Napoleonic Wars.\nPlay Aids\nThere are five player-aid cards included in the game. The large folded cards included all the charts and tables needed to play the game -- one for each player. This player-aid card also contains the Terrain Effects Chart and Notes providing all of the information needed to perform Ground Movement as well as important information explaining the Main Map and optional charts for combat.\nThe Force Pool is used for the Grand Campaign Game to manage alliances, production and more.\nThe two Leader Displays are provided to reduce the number of counters physically deployed on the map. For each leader and Fleet in the game, there is a corresponding box on the Leader Display in which all the units stacked with or accompanying a leader or Fleet may be placed. The leader or Fleet counter itself remains on the map board and is moved normally. \nSequence of Play\n Attrition Phase: The active player rolls one die and consults the Attrition Table whose result may require a strength loss in any hex containing three or more of the active player's strength points. This die roll may be modified as specified in the Attrition rules.\n Alliance Phase: The active player rolls one die to determine if any political alliances are formed or dissolved according to the restrictions of the Alliance rules and special rules regulating the scenario being played.\n Reinforcement Phase: The active player may deploy reinforcements or replacements scheduled for the current turn according to the scenario\u2019s Reinforcement and Replacement rules.\n Movement Phase: The active player may move units and leaders upon the map in accordance with the Movement rules and may conduct forced marches and execute overruns in accordance with those rules.\n Combat Phase: The active player announces all combats he cares to initiate and then resolves them in any sequence desired subject to the Combat rules.\nExamples of Play\nAttrition procedure: During an Attrition Phase, the non-French player has rolled a \"three\" on the die and wishes to determine the effect in a hex in Russia occupied by ten Russian strength points which are unsupplied during the December turn. The die roll (3), is modified as follows: (-1) because the Russian units are in their home country, (+1) because the units are unsupplied, (+1) because December is a winter month, (+1) because the hex is on map board area 4. Thus, the die is modified by a total of (+2) increasing the original result to (5). The player cross-references the modified die roll (5), with the total number of strength points in the hex (10) and reads the Attrition Table result which calls for a loss of 2* strength points, one of which must be cavalry if any are present in the hex).\nMarch: At the start of the French player's Movement Phase. Napoleon and nine French infantry strength points are in Paris\u2013 hex Y16(2), one French infantry strength point is in Rheims\u2013hex AA18(2), and one French strength point is in Verdun\u2013hex BB20(2). Let us assume the French player wishes to have ten infantry strength points in Verdun at the end of his Movement Phase. To accomplish this, the French player moves Napoleon,  accompanied by all nine points from Paris to Rheims, expending three Movement Points from Napoleon's movement allowance. Now, in order to move the infantry from Rheims to Verdun, the French player must attempt to force march the force an additional three movement points. Assuming the attempt succeeds, Napoleon may continue to Verdun still accompanied by the nine infantry points which occupied Paris at the start of the Movement Phase (notice that the infantry which occupied Rheims at the start of the Movement Phase may not accompany Napoleon to Verdun although a leader may be accompanied by up to ten infantry strength points during its movement).\nForce March: During the French player's Movement Phase, Napoleon is being moved accompanied by three French Guard strength points, two French infantry strength points, and one Bavarian (French satellite) infantry strength point. After Napoleon expends three movement points, the French player announces he wishes to attempt to force march this group two additional movement points. He then rolls the die and the result is a \u201c5\u201d. This result is modified to a \u201c3\u201d, for the French Guard strength points, a \u201c4\u201d for the French infantry strength points, and remains a \u201c5\u201d for the Bavarian infantry (which received a \u201c0\u201d on the Forced March Table); Napoleon could then expend one additional movement point accompanied by both the Guard and regular French infantry, and after dropping off all of the regular French infantry, Napoleon could expend one additional movement point accompanied by the Guard strength points. Finally, the French player must eliminate one strength point of regular French infantry because a \u201c4\u201d die roll on the Forced March Table includes an asterisk. Remember, it is not mandatory to expend forced march points as depicted in this example.\nSupply: During the French player's segment, one French strength point is in San Sebastian\u2013hex P10(1), one Bavarian strength point is in Burgos\u2013hex M09(1), one French strength point is in Madrid\u2013hex J09(1). The French point in San Sebastian is within three movement points of Bayonne (a major city in France, the unit's home country) and is therefore in supply. The Bavarian strength point in Burgos is within three movement points of the French point in San Sebastian and since both points are the same color, the Bavarian point is also in supply. The French point in Madrid is not within three movement points of a supply source and is therefore unsupplied. While studying this example, notice that if the hex O11(1) was occupied by a strength point of the inactive (non-French) player, the entire French supply line would be negated and all French units in Spain would be unsupplied!\nCombat Resolution: During his Combat Phase, the French player initiates an attack by specifying that he is committing the force in hex CC36(3) to attack an Austrian force in hex BB35(3). \u201cBattle Markers\u201d are placed to designate the two hexes. During the first round of combat, the attack is resolved as follows:\na. The French force in hex CC36(3) consists of Napoleon (leadership value 3), five French infantry strength points (morale value 2), three French cavalry strength points (morale value 2), and five Bavarian (French satellite) infantry strength points (morale value 1). Thus, the French force has a leadership value of \u201c3\u201d, and a morale value of \u201c2\u201d.\nb. The Austrian force in hex BB35(3) consists of Charles (leadership value 2), seven Austrian regular infantry strength points (morale value 1), three Austrian cavalry strength points (morale value 1), and eleven Austrian landwehr strength points (morale value 0). Thus, the Austrian force has a leadership value of \u201c2\u201d and a morale value of \u201c0\u201d.\nc. There are two types of terrain which will modify the dice roll; the larger Austrian force is being attacked in a Mountain hex, therefore the dice roll is increased by two. The Austrian force is also being attacked from a River hex, therefore the dice roll is increased by an additional two bringing the total modification for terrain to plus four.\nd. Although the French player initiated this attack, the Austrian player who controls the larger force will roll the dice to determine the result. The dice roll will be increased by the Austrian leadership value (2), the Austrian morale value (0), and the Mountain and River terrain effects (4), giving a total of plus six. The dice roll will be decreased by the French leadership value (3), and the French morale value (2), giving a total of minus five. Thus, the net result is that the dice roll will be increased by one.\ne. The combat odds ratio is determined by dividing the strength of the larger Austrian force (21), by the strength of the smaller French force (13), which yields a ratio of 3 to 2.\nf. The Austrian player rolls two dice. The result is an \u201c8\u201d, which is increased to \u201c9\u201d. At the ratio of 3 to 2, this yields the following result: L = 1, S = D1. To implement this result, the Austrian player cross-references his \u201c1\u201d result with the total strength of the smaller French force (13) on the Combat Loss Chart which indicates that the Austrian force loses two strength points. Similarly, the French player cross-references his \u201cD1\u201d result with the strength of his own smaller force and finds the Combat Loss Chart dictates the loss of three strength points.\ng. The Austrian player fulfills his required loss by eliminating two landwehr strength points.\nh. The French player fulfills his required loss by eliminating one French infantry strength point, one French cavalry strength point, and one Bavarian infantry strength point.\ni. The French player finally places a \"D1\" Demoralization marker on top of his force. If the battle continues, during the next round of combat the French morale value is reduced from two to one.\nProjected Contents\nOne large MOUNTED map board in two 22\" x 34\" sections\nFour mounted and die-cut, full-color counter sheets\nOne book of Rules, Fully Updated and Illustrated\nOne Scenario Book\nOne Grand Campaign Book\nOne Operational Methods Book\nOne 3-Panel Charts and Tables Folder\nOne Force Pool Display\nTwo Leader Displays\nDice\nGame Box \nStretch Goals\nWe know that almost all Kickstarter campaigns have stretch goals. This one does not. Certainly we could think up expansions or add-ons to this game, but all that would entail lots of extra play-testing, art development, and associated work that would translate into long (potentially very long) delays in the production of the game. We don't want to do that. We put everything we could think of to make this a top of the line experience, and we're including all of it. So no gimmicks, games, or non-sense to get you to support this campaign. We are offering a solid game for a good discount.  That's the deal. \nTime-frame for Delivery \nWe are planning a fast turn-around for War & Peace. At this point all of  the game development and art-work is complete. The time spent from the  successful end of this campaign forward will be on ushering the game through the press process. Although we hope to fulfill sooner,  we are  estimating first quarter of 2020 for delivery.\nA Note About Shipping Costs\nUS shipping is based upon medium flat rate shipping.\nOur  international shipping price is based upon a 7 pound package (what we estimated the game will weigh) to non-EU overseas  destinations. \nEU shipping is based upon calculating the following 4 items:\n       1. Cost to bulk ship EU orders to the EU\n       2. Per unit VAT fee for that shipment\n       3. Per unit shipping fee of European fulfillment house\n       4. Actual European postage based upon a four pound package\nWe  understand that other companies charge lower shipping amounts in  their Kickstarter campaigns. After researching that, we found that they are doing this by amortizing that cost in the price of the game itself. We  thought about doing that as well, but two factors stopped us. The first  is that what is going to happen in a KS campaign is unknown, and each  scenario we looked at had risk over certain number ranges. Because we  are essentially a small operation, we do not care much for risk. However, we also simply felt it was unfair to others to make them subsidize shipping costs that are not their fault. And that  is why the  shipping costs are what they are.\nA Note About One Small Step\nOSS Games is a small company. We are composed of no full-time staff,  but  rather are a group of individuals who enjoy producing games in our  spare  time. Our MO is to produce small print-run games with  consistently high production values. We try to bring you the highest  quality product possible for a reasonable amount of money. We do this  because we enjoy  it.\nThat said, we are a game publisher, not a PR firm. We limit communication to essential announcements. Therefore, we will not be posting constant updates about everything little thing. Our posts will   be limited to essential milestones, such as the game going to press,  the  receipt of press samples, or when the game begins shipping. The  press process is often one of waiting punctuated by occasional back and  forth on minor issues. If you don't hear from us in the updates  section, this  is simply because we do not have any update that changes  status of the  previous one.\nAlso, because each of us has a day job, we are not  able to monitor  the Kickstarter page at all times.

Storm Knights rise to battle High Lord Uthorion and his army of darkness. A supplemental sourcebook for Aysle, an extended adventure book set within Aysle, and multiple extras and surprises help you continue and expand your table-top role-playing game experience in the evolving world of Torg Eternity. \nNew to Torg Eternity? Scroll down to the section LEARN MORE ABOUT TORG to find out more and get started!\nLimited Offer: Aysle Champion\nWant to add your own hero to the ranks of the Army of Light? You get everything in the Aysle Treasure Coffer Pledge Level, plus we\u2019ll work with you to create an official Core Earth or Aysle Archetype! This includes one custom Perk, Spell, or Miracle, plus art for the character, and the character you help create becomes the \u201ciconic\u201d version of that Archetype.\nThese Archetypes become part of the game and are available as a bonus to all backers who receive the normal digital Archetypes. The archetype is the property of Ulisses and we reserve the right to refuse any names or other features of the character that we consider inappropriate (such as inflammatory or vividly \"against theme\").\nUltra Limited Offer: Aysle Royalty\nAdd your Archetype as a Champion above, plus you earn a seat for yourself or a designated proxy at our very special GenCon event on Friday night. Last year's event was an epic battle that determined the fate of the Mystery Men. What will this year's game hold? Note that this offer doesn't include travel, lodging, or tickets to GenCon. This is a different night and a different adventure than the session for Nile Empire Vigilantes!\nBest Value: The Aysle Treasure Coffer   \nFor the best Aysle experience and the most value for your pledge check out the Aysle Treasure Coffer. It is the most convenient way to get all of the core items in this Kickstarter, plus much more! Note that the base price has gone up a little, but that\u2019s because it features an entirely extra book even before Stretch Goals come into play: Greg Gorden\u2019s new Cosms Collide mega-adventure! The Treasure Coffer also starts with a sheet of Threat Blips, 5 new Threat Cards, the Aysle Possibility Tokens, and the CD soundtrack for The Revenge of the Carredon...and tons more goodies waiting to be unlocked! Any Add-On labeled as \"Treasure Coffer\" comes in the box.\nAysle is a realm of magic, fantasy, and an eternal struggle between Darkness and Light! It's ruled by High Lord Uthorion \u2014currently inhabiting the body of a Viking warlord\u2014and his Dread Covenent of nightmares, necromancers, and nefarious lords. Uthorion attacked from above and below, with maelstrom bridges crashing down in the sea to bring his Viking raiders, and a massive ritual connecting the underground passages of Aysle to subways, cellars, and caves on Earth. Any break in the ground may now be a portal to treasure and danger.\n\nWithin Uthorion\u2019s borders magic is powerful and miracles happen, but technology beyond a flintlock rifle sputter and malfunction. High tech doesn\u2019t belong here, and reality tries to right it and transform items into something accepted by the Ayslish. Storm Knights resist this effect, and may bring modern weapons (and more) to bear against the forces of Darkness.\nHigh Lord Uthorion didn't come to Earth alone. For the last century he had possessed Queen Pella Ardinay, the Lady of Light, and used her to corrupt her forces and undermine her allies: the elves and the last of the dwarves. She was recently slain and resurrected\u2014freeing her\u2014and now she leads the remnants of her armies to Earth in pursuit of her hated foe.\nThe Aysle source book is an expansion designed for both players and Game Masters. Inside you'll find:\nNew Perks, Spells, and Miracles for advancing characters. Includes options only available to Beta Clearance Storm Knights, as they learn more about their own abilities and the nature of reality.\n Magic Gear! A bevy of new items for adventurers, and random tables for discovering items in coffers or on foes!\nAn extensive status update for the default timeline. See the course of the first year of the Possibility Wars and the toll it's taken on Great Britain and Scandinavia. Includes a list of ongoing Delphi Council operations and who's who in the Aysle theater of the war.\nGet the statistics for the Dark Lord himself, as Uthorion takes matters into his own hands. Defeating him comes at a price, as Pella Ardinay found out the hard way!\nNew threats. Angered Elementals erupt throughout the realm as raw magic courses across new lands. Knights and wizards roam the roads\u2014many of them selfish and bent towards the ways of Darkness. The Dread Covenant has its own troops: monsters of legend, giants, undead, Vikings, and the foul spawn of Darkness controlled by Uthorion.\nQuest generation tables, new Eternity Shards, and more!\nRevenge of the Carredon is a massive adventure suitable for several months of gaming. Start off in middle of the war, fighting in the trenches of Oxford. Tolwyn Tancred, the legendary hero who slew Uthorion\u2019s strange dragon\u2014the dreaded Carredon\u2014and returned to save Pella Ardinay is cursed, and heralds the return of the mighty beast she seemed to slay. Embark on a quest to unlock the mystery of the Carredon\u2019s origins and break the curse before Tolwyn is lost forever and Uthorion regains one of his most powerful weapons.\nWhen Cosms Collide! Original Torg co-creator Greg Gorden returns with a new mega-adventure! The Cyberpapacy, technodemons, Mobius' shocktroopers, and others all seem to have business in the realm of Aysle\u2014and the Storm Knights are caught in the middle. Join the action and uncover the mystery of what has so many High Lords moving through Uthorion's kingdom, and if anyone can beat the Dark One on his home ground !\nThe Aysle GM Screen has three panels. On the inside, all the most needed charts from Torg Eternity in addition to the new charts specific to adventures in Aysle. The outside features a single, gorgeous seamless image and the axioms and World Laws players need to remember. \nAysle Archetypes come within the GM Screen, and offer new stock heroes to draw from to fill the ranks of your Storm Knights. Meet the Champion of Light, a Core Earther transformed by the magic of Aysle into an armored paladin, the Necromancer, a hero touched by Darkness but who deploys her deadly spells against a common foe, and the Cleric of Dunad, an elf from Aysle who channels the holy power of the gods\u2026and many more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you'd like extra copies of an item or would like to add a product from another pledge tier to your order, you may use the list below.

This allows us to assure that we are US, EU, and Australia-friendly. We also have a partner in China (VFI Asia), which means many locations in Asia and the Pacific Rim are cheaper, though not all customs for those countries may be covered. Other locations will be more expensive based on how difficult it is to ship from those four centers.\nPlease Note \u2013 The Treasure Coffer, Sarcophagus, Survival Box, and Cargo Box are very heavy.

This new edition features mechanics that are both flexible and fast as well as nova powers designed to scale through the degrees of power that novas can reach. While the setting is quite similar to the original edition\u2019s, it has been updated to further enable heroic roleplaying.\n Check out the currently unfolding Trinity Continuum: Aberrant webcomic <at this link>\nThe Trinity Continuum is a vast timeline of adventure, speckled with dramatic points across the past, present, and future, where heroes - or villains - arise. While each setting supplement will explore part of the Trinity Continuum timeline, these points in time aren't dots in a straight line - this isn't a long-form metaplot to be simply read aloud. Instead, they're points of quantum probabilities. Anything can happen, so it's up to you and your cast to make it happen!\nThe Trinity Continuum will grow as the timeline is explored, with possible setting supplements handling everything from ancient Greek battalions to two-fisted pulp daredevils, from dystopian brain tech to galactic imperialism. \nTrinity Continuum: Aberrant is the newest setting ready to be explored on the Trinity Continuum timeline. Set in the near future, Trinity Continuum: Aberrant depicts a world just beyond tomorrow, in the year 2028. The Trinity Continuum: Aberrant setting allows for a variety of playstyles, from four-color action and space exploration, to political intrigue and deniable top-secret operations.\nNot Final Cover Design\nThe Trinity Continuum: Aberrant setting book will be 7-inch by 10-inch hardcover book, approximately 250+ pages, with full-color interiors. Contents include:\nChapter One: History\nChapter Two: Setting\nChapter Three: Character Creation\nChapter Four: Organization and Paths\nChapter Five: New Rules\nChapter Six: Quantum Powers and Abilities\nChapter Seven: Technology\nChapter Eight: Storyguide Advice\nChapter Nine: Antagonists & Supporting Characters\nChapter Ten: Setting Secrets\nNote: the Trinity Continuum: Aberrant setting book requires the Trinity Continuum Core rule book to play. \nThe Storypath system is Onyx Path's rules set designed specifically to allow the sort of rules scaling necessary to seamlessly enable players to play ordinary people as well as mad scientists and seasoned explorers.\nThe basics of the Storypath system should be familiar to anyone who has played many other Onyx Path games of action-adventure or heroic exploits, as it is a 10-sided dice pool system, where in order to resolve an action you basically roll a number of dice equal to the character's Skill + Attribute and must roll an 8 or better a certain number of times in order to succeed in the action. \nThat is the very basic resolution system, but we expand on that to further enhance how your gaming group can build their stories. Failing to hit your number of successes, or having more successes than your required amount, are built-in options in the rules. Here is a handy graphic that illustrates what we mean:\nTo further explain the basics of the Storypath system, here is a small PDF download that goes into more detail: SYSTEM PREVIEW PDF. \nThe main goal of this Trinity Continuum: Aberrant Kickstarter is to enable us to create a hardcover edition of the Trinity Continuum: Aberrant book compatible with the Trinity Continuum core rulebook and setting expansions (such as Trinity Continuum: \u00c6on).\nWe want to create an 7\" x 10\" hardcover with an evocative, action-packed cover image and a Trinity Continuum trade dress. We estimate the book to be between 250-300 pages, with a full-color interior and endpapers on high quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including scenario and chronicle options, hero and villain write-ups, and more! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done - build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imagination. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our team. \nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($40,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to load a larger version of this reward tier chart\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Elite and Defender Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (Hero Reward Tier)? And then do you add the Trinity Continuum Core Rules as a Partner to your pledge (Defender and Partner or Hero and Partner reward tiers)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Dynamic Duo and Super Squad Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!). You can further enhance these options with a Team-up, adding the Trinity Continuum Core rules to your selection.\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Trinity Continuum: Aberrant campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Friendly Neighborhood Retail Tier) will get 5 copies of the Trinity Continuum Core rulebook and Trinity Continuum: Aberrant hardcover books (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Aberrant setting or a possible future supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.   \nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Trinity Continuum: Aberrant. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates. \nPDF VERSION - The digital version of the Trinity Continuum: Aberrant setting, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nHARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful 7\" x 10\" hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus.\nTRINITY CONTINUUM CORE RULES: Contains the complete rules for playing Talents, ranging from core concepts to descriptions of secret societies around the world, as well as introductory material for playing in any of the other Trinity Continuum games. This book can be used on its own, but is necessary for playing \u00c6on, Aberrant, and Adventure!, as well as other settings within the continuum. The material presented here is enough to play a game set in a world very similar to our modern one. Included in the Defender and Partner, Hero and Partner, Dynamic Duo Team-up, and Super Squad Team-up reward tiers. Also available as an Add On Reward (See Add Ons, below).\nTrinity Continuum: \u00c6on: A setting supplement for Trinity Continuum, this book provides complete information on the world of 2123 and all of the wonders it contains. It also includes rules for creating and playing psions, as well as a variety of advanced weapons and other devices. Requires the Trinity Continuum Core rules to play. Available as an Add On Reward (see Add Ons, below).\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Trinity Continuum: Aberrant, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.     \nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run. \n The Aberrant 1E Systems & Setting PDF Bundle contains the following titles:\n     - Aberrant Core Rulebook 1E PDF  \n                   - Aberrant Storyteller's Screen and Companion 1E PDF\n                   - Aberrant Worldwide: Phase II 1E PDF\n                   - Aberrant Player's Guide 1E PDF\n                    - Aberrant: Year One 1E PDF\nNow also includes Aberrant Worldwide: Phase I via Stretch Goal achievement!\nThe Aberrant 1E Factions & Organizations PDF Bundle contains the following titles:\n    - Teregen 1E PDF  \n                  - The Directive 1E PDF\n                  - Elites 1E PDF\n                   - Underworld 1E PDF\n Now also includes Project Utopia via Stretch Goal achievement!\n The Aberrant 1E Mini Sourcebook PDF Bundle contains the following titles:\n    - Expos\u00e9: Aberrants 1E PDF  \n                  - XWF 1E PDF\n                  - Fear and Loathing 1E PDF\n                  - Church of Michael Archangel 1E PDF\nNow also includes reignofevil.comvia Stretch Goal achievement!\nDigital and  PDF Rewards will be fulfilled by DriveThruRPG.

To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/ ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Trinity Continuum: Aberrant is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "BASELINE", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "ELITE", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Trinity Continuum: ABERRANT.\nINCLUDES:\nTrinity Continuum: ABERRANT PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["362 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "ELITE and SIDEKICK", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Trinity Continuum: ABERRANT.\nINCLUDES:\nTrinity Continuum: ABERRANT PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: ABERRANT\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["108 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "DEFENDER and PARTNER", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Trinity Continuum: ABERRANT, as well as a PDF copy of the Trinity Continuum CORE RULES.\nINCLUDES:\nTrinity Continuum: ABERRANT PDF\nTrinity Continuum CORE Rulebook PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: ABERRANT\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: CORE Rulebook\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["206 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "HERO", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of Trinity Continuum: ABERRANT.

Backers will receive the PDF or print versions as they choose, or a bundle with both. Additional books in the product line are being offered at a discount as add-ons.\nHenry Hydesworth came into rather a tidy sum when his father met with an accident at the cannery. Bad news being, the old boy hasn\u2019t moved on, and neither has Henry\u2019s mother, so he\u2019s haunted by his parents quite literally. Small wonder he spends most of his time out of the house trying to be a detective. It\u2019s all much more interesting than running a fish cannery with your dead father looking over your shoulder. He\u2019s not very good at it, though.\nHenry\u2019s mother invites a neighbour round for tea, who has a problem. The Fever turned her into a troll, eight feet tall, horns, the whole bit, and with the cats in the area vanishing mysteriously, rumours are circulating that her new form has come with a new appetite. She really needs Henry to prove where the cats are going before the whispers become a scandal and her reputation is damaged. Of course the case has much more going on than a few missing cats, and as Henry tugs on the thread, all sorts of things begin to unravel. Pity Henry\u2019s such a poor knitter\u2026 he\u2019s going to need all the help he can get, from Smedley, his long time friend and also recent troll, from the crew of the USS Spindrift, and from a wide and varied cast of oddball supporting characters. \nWith original art and text by Don Higgins, the story spins out over 128 pages of steampunk hijinks, social gaffes, awkward moments, and the occasional explosion. Will Henry find out how the cats figure into all of this? Will his new disguise fool Smedley? Will Smedley ever tell Henry what he\u2019s really up to? And how does Miss Emily Devereux, the librarian Henry has long admired from afar, figure into all of this? Backers get immediate access to the pre-release PDF galley, as proof the book actually exists, but beware reading too far into it if you don\u2019t want the story spoiled before the official release!\nIn addition to the listed reward levels, we are happy to offer several add-ons to our generous backers. As mentioned before, the tabletop role-playing game is in print, and has four books currently \u2013 Players Guide, Game Master\u2019s Guide, London Sourcebook, and the Big Trouble adventure. As an add-on in the post-campaign survey, backers are welcome to request that any or all of these products be added to their shipment.

The roleplaying game itself has a Players Companion in layout, and a Game Master\u2019s Companion in final edits as of the time this Kickstarter launched. There\u2019s also further adventures in the Akkadian Connection trilogy forthcoming, some standalone adventures, regional sourcebooks for Berlin, Paris, and New York, and an ongoing series of PDF-only Personalities already going, ten-page writeups on significant NPCs with backstory, full character sheets, Adventure Hooks, Connections, and game-ready devices, spells, and creatures with complete stat blocks.

It is a game of ancient ruins on Mars, the steaming jungles of Venus, strange life in the clouds of Jupiter, RAY guns, chromed rocket ships, radium fuel, hot exhaust, and fins. So many fins on things you didn't know you could put fins on. \nThe setting is a kitchen sink sandbox for you to set your games in. Want to be the brave explorer discovering lost civilizations and new wonders? We have that on Venus, Mars, Jupiter, the Jovian Moons, and more. Looking for a daring game of brinksmanship as you battle agents of foreign powers (even alien nations)? Choose whom you want to fight and who you want to fight for, such as the Americans, British, French, Nazis, Soviets, Martian princes, or the enigmatic Europans.\n The Rocket Age first launched in 2013 using the Vortex system (we call that version Rocket Age Classic) and won an ENnie in 2014. Since then we have added four sourcebooks, an adventure path, a fiction anthology, and 13 adventures. In that time Rocket Age has gone from its original publisher to being owned and published by its creator, Ken Spencer and his company Why Not Games.\nWe love Rocket Age and we want to bring it to everyone.  5e allows us to invite more people into the Rocket Age. From the beginning we did not want to do a simple conversion, we knew that to make system and setting work best we would have to adapt both. Where possible we have kept the core of the 5e engine, you can use Rocket Age (5e) with your full collection of 5e products. We have species (instead of races), classes, armor class, hit points and dice, proficiencies, and so forth. Rocket Age (5e) has a plethora of alien creatures to interact with, but we want you to be able to pull any monster out of whatever 5e compatible monster guide you might want. Where something had to be changed in the setting, most notably the availability of psychic powers, we made small changes as needed. The result is a merging of system and setting, not just a welding of one to another.\n Now, eighteen months later nearly two years worth of work has come to fruition in the Rocket Age (5e) Corebook. The game is written, playtested, filled with art, and through the magic of our graphic designer, being turned in to a completed book. We would like you to join us on this final leg of the journey and bring the Rocket Age into a brand new era.\n For our long time fans, Rocket Age Classic is not going anywhere. From here on out all Rocket Age products will be offered in different versions, one for each system. These will not be dual stat blocks, but different books, one for Rocket Age Classic and one for Rocket Age (5e). We don\u2019t like dual stat block books; they just add pages and make it harder to find what you are looking for.\nTo our new fans, this is just the beginning. In the coming months we will adapt the entire catalog of Rocket Age, from Blood Red Mars to Imperial Jupiter.\nFor both old and new fans, there is more of the Rocket Age to explore and we have plans for new adventures, new sourcebooks, new fiction, and more.\nYou can follow us at: www.whynotgames.com, our FaceBook page, and the unofficial Rocket Age fan group on Facebook.\nInside Rocket Age (5e) you will find:\nForeword by Ed Greenwood\n 17 playable species from the bizarrely alien Europans to the ape-like Venusians, including all seven Martian castes. Two species, Ioites and Robomen, are highly varied in psychical form, allowing you to customize your character from an extensive list of species traits.\n 5 New classes suitable for play in Rocket age or any sci-fi or pulp style game. Each has a set of subclasses to allow you to flesh out or customize your character. Will you be an Agent working for a larger organization, an Explorer pushing the boundaries of the known Solar System, a Scientist uncovering the wonders of the material world, a shifty Scoundrel getting by any way they can, or a stalwart Soldier standing between danger and their loved ones?\n A system of psychic powers not tied to species or class, nor using a Vanican system. In Rocket Age (5e) anyone can be a psychic, but what will you give up for the weird powers of the mind?\n 19 new feats for those of you using that optional system. Will you be an Ace or travel with a Boon Companion? Do you Dance it Out or have Resourceful Pockets?\n All the equipment you will need for adventures in the Rocket Age! We've got RAY guns, disintegrators, Martian silthanka, Ganymedian heart bows, Europan pain batons, and much more. Armor, weapons, tools, clothing, technological gear, refurbished Ancient Martian tech, it is all in there!\n Complete and comprehensive vehicle rules for everything from a motorcycle blasting across the sands of Mars to mighty rocket ships blazing beams through the void of space. These rules interact directly with class archetypes and feats, making the entire system integrated from character creation to game play.\n The entire Solar System of Rocket Age covered in detail. Each entry offers not just the history, geography, and culture of a place, a sample NPC to interact with as well as three story hooks tied to that place and the beings from there. With a little imagination and some friends you can play Rocket Age straight out of the book.\n Ancient Artifacts from the lost civilizations of Mars and Venus. These items use esoteric sciences beyond that which even the brightest minds of 1938 can devise, so using them is a bit more than dusting them off and hitting the 'ON' switch. A big part of Rocket Age is the thrill of discovery, and our Artifact Analysis system makes all that possible with a single die roll, but be careful, there might be unintended consequences to powering up that weird bit of ancient tech. Disclaimer: Why Not Games is not responsible for anything that happens when you let lizard monkeys play with ancient artifacts.\n A bestiary of all the strange, exotic, and down right alien creatures found in the Solar System. Ride bahmoots across Mars, run from the thunder lizards of Venus, dodge kilometer long tentacles of the mighty Jovian gasbags, or get a tesselon as a pet. In addition to these nasty critters, there are plenty of NPCs to befriend of battle, including everyone's favorite punch receiver, Nazis!\nWritten by Ken Spencer, the creator of Rocket Age, with a cover by ReOnna Smith, and interior art by Paul Bourne, Brain Eads, Jon Hodgson, David King, Scott Purdy, Peter Saga, and Miguel Santos.\nRocket Age (5e) is fully compatible with Pulp Fantastic from Battlefield press. In fact, Ken Spencer wrote the system mechanics for both. You should check them out while you are here on Kickstarter. They're good people and make great games.\nAll of our stretch goals are in pdf. We are a small operation and producing stretch goals is a challenge, one that we barely made with our last kickstarter.

The crew desperately adjusted sails, pulled ropes, and turned wheels \u2014 anything to try and steer the course of the ship away from the looming thick fog sitting dead ahead of them. Captain Pug calmly walked among the crew, staring at the Fog when she wasn\u2019t barking the occasional order. Eventually, the blue sky took up more and more of the view. Noctis returned to his captain, who was still staring ahead. \u201cMa\u2019am, shouldn\u2019t you be happy? We\u2019ve cleared the Fog.\u201d\n\u201cWe have. But you\u2019ve forgotten one thing.\u201d\nAt that precise moment, the water all around the ship started to boil. The acidic water splashed onto the desk, irritating the eyes and skin of all the crew as they tried to figure out what was going on. Noctis ran to the side of the ship and stuck his head into the spray, shielding his eyes to get a better look. He caught a glimpse of something dark and rubbery slithering under the water before it disappeared again.\nThen he heard a loud keening wail, and a giant squid-like creature lurched out of the water in front of the ship. Its tentacles waved menacingly in the air as it reared up, as large as the ship itself.\nCaptain Pug stared calmly at the monstrosity. \u201cYou forgot the kraken, number one.\u201d\n Click <HERE> to learn more about the Realms of Pugmire!\nThe main goal of this Pirates of Pugmire Kickstarter is to enable us to create a hardcover edition of the Pirates of Pugmire book compatible with the other Realms of Pugmire core rulebooks such as Pugmire and Monarchies of Mau.\nWe want to create an 7\" x 10\" hardcover with an evocative, action-packed cover image and a Pugmire- and Mau-inspired cover design. We estimate the book to be between 150-200 pages, with a full-color interior and endpapers on high quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including further depth to the two new playable species! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nNot Final Design.\nPirates of Pugmire is a chronicle sourcebook for both Pugmire and Monarchies of Mau. It\u2019s usable in either game, or as part of a joint experience. Some highlights include:\nTwo new species for players to enjoy: lizards and birds\nSix new callings, including two for dogs and two for cats\nRules for building, sailing, and sinking ships\nA trove of new allies, enemies, and treasures\nInformation on Waterdog Port and Port Matthew\n\u201cGoing on the Account,\u201d a chronicle of three new adventures, taking characters from 1st through 6th level\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Pirates of Pugmire manuscript as backer-only updates. \n MORE INFORMATION, INTERVIEWS, and REVIEWS\nTo hear Eddy's complete audio Design Diary, check out the OnyxPathcast <HERE>\nClick below to hear an interview with Eddy about Pirates of Pugmire from The Story Told podcast team:\nClick to hear an interview with Eddy Webb about Pirates of Pugmire\n\nDogs have inherited the world, building the kingdom of Pugmire untold centuries after the Ages of Man were over. These dogs have been uplifted to use tools and language, and they seek to rediscover the ruins of the Old Ones. Some have learned to use the leftover technology of humanity, but they believe it to be magic handed to them by their lost gods. Others seek to create an ideal civilization, using a Code of Man compiled from ancient, fragmentary lore left behind by humanity. The world is dangerous and mysterious, but good dogs will persevere.  \nPugmire is a light-hearted and family-friendly fantasy world. It\u2019s one of the first of Onyx Path\u2019s creator-owned games, produced in a partnership with Eddy Webb and Pugsteady. Combining the ideas, passion, and creativity of experienced designers with decades of experience in producing quality roleplaying game products, these creator-owned games push the boundaries of the \u201cOnyx Path brand\u201d in new and diverse directions. \nAfter a successful Kickstarter campaign, the Pugmire roleplaying game Core Rulebook was released in 2017. The game featured a traditional fantasy rules system redesigned for streamlined play and easy creation of heroic dogs, with an emphasis on cooperation and action over competition and violence.  \nSince the initial release, the Realms of Pugmire have expanded to include adventure scenarios and audio dramas, as well as a new game in the setting featuring the cat-based Monarchies of Mau. The recent introduction of Canis Minor, a community-driven digital content storefront, has further opened up the world for exploration. \nAs noted, the primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of the Pirates of Pugmire that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the Realms of Pugmire, expanding into rules companions and other Pugmire-related tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore options and this game line. \nThirdly, we want to celebrate the success of Pugmire and Mau so far by offering an opportunity to for new players to join in. We'll help backers by including a discounted selection of PDF titles \u2014 the core rulebooks, as well as a digital treasure chest containing expansions and supplements. \nBeyond all of those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of giving this game physical form \u2014 and like the scenarios contained within, setting out on a brave new adventure! When you back this project, you join our crew and we explore this story together. \nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($40,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nAVAST! Click here to load a larger version of this reward tier chart!\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Buccaneer and Freebooter Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (Corsair Reward Tier)? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Seadog and Pressgang Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!)\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Pirates of Pugmire campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Sutler) will get 5 copies of the hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nSeveral Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to have your pet act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Pirates of Pugmire book or a possible supplement. We also offer some of our remaining stock of Pugmire and Monarchies of Mau DICE SETS, as well as the Pugmire GUIDE SCREEN. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.  \nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for the Pirates of Pugmire. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates.

When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.    \nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run.  \nDigital and  PDF Rewards will be fulfilled by DriveThruRPG. Previously-released titles are the ones currently available from DrivethruRPG.com and were created as best they could be depending on the state of the files. So quality may vary from title to title. \nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional books) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of the Pirates of Pugmire (Reward Tiers of $45+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when the book becomes available.\n As we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will unlock a bounty and add to the reward lists. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.  \nAchieved! -  KICKSTARTER BACKER T-SHIRT \u2013 Hosted on the redbubble store for a limited time, a Pirates of Pugmire-themed shirt will be priced at a steep discount.

To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/ ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for the Pirates of Pugmire is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "LANDLUBBER", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "BUCCANEER", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Pirates of Pugmire.\nINCLUDES:\nPirates of Pugmire PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["184 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "FREEBOOTER", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of Pirates of Pugmire!\nINCLUDES:\nPirates of Pugmire PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: Pirates of Pugmire\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["71 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "CORSAIR", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the hardcover versions of Pirates of Pugmire.

The darker the shadow becomes, the world gets until the Destroyer of all Things finally emerges from the Void to swallow the world and everything in it. Are these the end times as foretold?\nPerhaps. Perhaps not.\nAcross the lands of R\u00fbl, great patrons have come forth to answer the threat posed by the Eternal Shadow by throwing back the darkness and sealing the rifts to the Demon Lord\u2019s realm. The Great Druid rouses the forests fight against demon and cultist alike, while the Queen of Faeries rallies the last of her children to make a final stand loosed by the growing unrest. These and others join forces to find the light they need to safeguard Urth for the rest of time.\nAgainst the Shadow is a cooperative board game designed by Adam Doochin and Dan Heinrich, where the patrons of R\u00fbl must come together to fight against the Demon Lord before this dreadful entity breaks through the cracks in reality and destroys the world. The patrons recruit heroes to undertake quests in the hopes of gaining treasures crucial for driving back the darkness. The Demon Lord, however, has many agents at its beck and call and sends cultists and demons to thwart these heroes\u2019 efforts. It\u2019s a race against time and the patrons must work together if Urth can be saved. Based on the popular horror-fantasy roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord, the board game gives you an all-new way to fight against the apocalypse. \nAgainst the Shadow is a cooperative race game for two to five players, with optional rules for one player or six. A typical game takes about an hour to play.\nWe need your help to make this game a reality. Even though the game has been designed and thoroughly tested, We still need to edit the rulebook and cards, finalize the layout, acquire a few more art assets, and, of course, pay for the printing and assembly. Given the expenses involved in these steps, We're asking for your help to bring this game to tables all over the world.\nThe best way to help is to choose a pledge level and back the campaign. The level you choose determines the rewards you get in return for your support. Provided the project funds, your dollars go toward covering the expenses incurred as we finishing this game. Now, if the unthinkable happens and the project doesn\u2019t fund, you pay nothing and the project doesn\u2019t happen. I do understand that not everyone can help, but if you believe in this project, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could help spread the word.   \nWant to see how the game works? Sure you do! Grab a prototype rule book here. Note, this is not the final rule book.\n(prototype)\nIn Against the Shadow, you become one of the mighty patrons of R\u00fbl, an individual who ranks among the most powerful in the land. You might become the High Jarl of the Jotun or the Faerie Queen. Each patron has special abilities that give you advantages in play.  \n(prototype)\nTo fight the Demon Lord, you need heroes. You recruit heroes from the land, finding dwarfs and clockworks, humans and goblins, and many other characters drawn from the pages of Shadow of the Demon Lord. Heroes, though, are meant to serve and fighting the Shadow means few will survive!\n(prototype)\nAs a patron, you issue commands that direct your heroes and change the circumstances in your favor, either to give you a much-needed edge against the Demon Lord or to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat! \n(prototype)\nAdventure awaits the heroes under your control. You send them into deadly situations to wrest treasures from terrifying locations and to find the light the world so desperately needs. Beware, though, for the Demon Lord has many tricks to thwart your efforts!\n(prototype)\nWhen your heroes complete quests, slay enemies, and explore the land, they find potent treasures to help you throw back the encroaching darkness.  \n(prototype)\nThe Demon Lord, however, will not give up without a fight. As you play the game, the Dark Lord of the Void places curses on the world, making the game harder to defeat. \n(prototype)\nAgainst the Shadow introduces a number of powerful patrons, each one the great movers and shakers in the lands of R\u00fbl. Patrons of the Demon Lord reveals their stories, histories, motivations, and servants. Packed with new lore, this 32-page PDF supplement is the perfect expansion for creating epic adventure for the Shadow of the Demon Lord roleplaying game.\nStay tuned for details!\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the table below. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends.

It\u2019s a combination of thematic Nordic Noir such as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Broadchurch and The Killing, with isolated small-town horror similar to Thirty Days of Night, The Thing and Fortitude. Twin Peaks by David Lynch is a heavy influence, in its portrayal of small town secrets and underlying darkness that pervades every step the characters take.\n Check us out on our website, Facebook, and Twitter for updates and information! \n\nWe will be charging shipping as we fulfill each item, using Backerkit to collect shipping information and take any additional pre-orders. As both gamers and backers ourselves, we will do our best to keep the cost of shipping down.\nEstimated Shipping Costs\n Domestic Shipping: For shipping within the US, expect around $5-10 (USD). \n EU/AU/CA Shipping: The majority of associated countries are easy to ship to, such as EU, AU, and CA. Expect each package to cost roughly $5-15 (USD). \n Everywhere Else: Shipping everywhere else will be around $10-30 (USD). \nAs part of our Stretch Goals, we will be making shipping more affordable in the following levels:\n**FUNDED!** With the $10,000 level, we are including shipping to everyone who have pledged $50 and above.\n At the $15,000 level, we will include shipping to everyone in the United States. \n At the $20,000 level, we will also include shipping to everyone in the European Union. \nA typical game of Malice, where danger lurks in every corner\n\nA Town Called Malice is based on the Story Pillar System, created by Protagonist Industries in their work, Home by Dark by Jason Olsan. This system utilizes story game elements popularized in games such as Fiasco, where players develop the narrative and create complex character relationships as they struggle to keep the town together.\n(pencil sketch of artwork)\n\n\nIn the Story Pillar System, players are faced with three major story points (Pillars) to address.\nIn A Town Called Malice the three Pillars are:\n The Body - Found in the Town (or its surrounding area), its initial discovery and the victim's connections to the people of Malice throw the quiet Town into chaos.\n The Event - Vital to the Town's livelihood, the discovery of the Body threatens its success and the Town's survival.\n The Darkness - The lurking horror responsible for the terrible things happening to the Town, it is a growing threat soon to affect everyone unless it is averted, stopped, or destroyed.\n\nAn Actual Play on Happy Jacks RPG Podcast\n\nA Town Called Malice involves the isolation of small towns tucked away from busy highways and large cities. Although the default setting envisions an isolated snowbound Nordic island or outpost near the Arctic Circle, a game of Malice can be set in other locations such as the rainy Pacific Northwest, a sun-drenched tourist stop that vacates when summer ends or even a cold, distant way-station in outer space. Malice is truly everywhere.\n\n(pencil sketch of artwork)\nIn the event of reaching our initial goal, we will be providing additional playsets  that can be used as new settings for Malice.

The lands of the world called Garin are covered in thousands of years of history and legend. They harbor numerous secrets and dangers, as well as the bones of generations, the victims of seemingly unending wars. Demonworld's miniatures war game lets you take command of the armies of Tinere, the northern-most continent of Garin, and create epic battles between Elves, Dwarves, Humans, and the races of the nefarious Isthak. \nWe here at FASA Games, Inc are producing a fifth book in our Demonworld Miniatures game. Previously, we had brought you the Core Rules book, and three army books: the Dwarves, the Thain, and the Elves. Now we are pleased to announce the Isthak! In this, the fourth Army book, we reveal just who the Isthak are, and what capabilities they bring to the battlefield.\nWe on the Demonworld team have been busy, and we are happy to say that the Isthak Army Book for the DEMONWORLD Miniatures game is almost ready! This 128-page book includes chapters on rules for play, stats for all of the Isthak units, spells, a set of pre-generated game scenarios, options for customizing your game, and plenty of history and detail about the Ice Lords of Isthak and their allies. The Units chapter includes photos for all 39 varieties of miniature packs, most with variant poses. \nIf you haven't played Demonworld 3rd Edition yet, let us tell you about some of the changes we have made from the previous edition. The new edition introduces the U18 rules, which highlights a more open battle style. Rather than playing on a hexagon-based map, you move your troops around on an open field, making measurements and movement in inches. This form of play allows you to customize your battlefield in any way you choose; add buildings, lay out hazardous terrain, and create higher elevations however you want! The Core Rules Book also offers a guide for creating your own units and heroes, making the possibilities truly endless and 100% customized to your play style.   \nContinuing with the addition of Commanders into the ranks, the Isthak offer 23 Hero figures. These personalities bring all kinds of new cruelty to the Isthak. Warriors, Warlocks, Necromancers, and mounted knights take command and introduce new dynamics and come equipped with a few artifacts, as well. \nThe most exciting addition to the 3rd Edition Isthak army are the three band new sculptures we get to reveal in this Kickstarter: \nThe Iceborn Cur\nThe Stone Sentinel\nThe Golaith of Nordag\nWe believe that Demonworld is like nothing else available today. Our 15mm pewter miniatures have incredible detail that you really have to see to believe. The miniatures are popular amongst painters who love the detail we offer and want to expand their collection and are used by gamers in other platforms as well. They also make a great choice for character figures in tabletop RPGs. There is a lot to love about this collection of figures, not to mention the game itself. \nSnow Trolls painted by Mike Barker\nAs we said before, the Isthak Army Book is almost ready. The text has all been written, edited, and set in layout. We just need to put the finishing touches like photography and art into the Isthak book before we are ready to get it to the printers and into your hands. Your pledge will help secure the last few pieces of art needed to make the book truly special. We are proud of the work that we do and feel privileged to be able to bring you these products.\nWe have been offering previews and updates on our blog at that give insights into the world of Garin, the history between these races, and what new units are coming to the Isthak army. \nYou can also view our full range of existing miniatures, both classic and new U18 editions, provided by Ral Partha Europe. \nThe world of Garin has been in a state of upheaval since the demons returned from The Void twenty years ago. The disparate races on the continent of Tinere were caught completely by surprise by the invasion and have been scrambling to defend their territories from the demons. The forces of the Isthak have used this unexpected chaos to their advantage, letting the demons run loose over their enemies' lands and making further plans while the other races are good and distracted. Commanded by the half-elf Rhagai, an racial anomaly  in the world and the demon's link to the plane of life, the Ishtak nurture plans that target all of Tinere and bring the Void ever closer to Garin. \nBeastmen are the Isthak's foot soldiers and shock troops. They are savage, strong, nearly fearless, and mostly capable of following orders, or at least following the strongest leader. No one is really sure how long the Beastmen have been on Garin, not even themselves. They're very good an raiding villages and taking prisoners when they're needed. They seem to take special pleasure in razing human settlements and make no secret of their penchant for looting at every opportunity. Since they are not overly blessed with and abundance of intelligence, they are usually found under the command of at least one Ice Witch. \nBeastmen revel in their latest conquest.\nThe Ice Witches of Harane are even more vile and sadistic than the Beastmen they command. Theirs is a matriarchal society. In fact, there are no males of their race. They procreate with the male slaves they capture and always produce female offspring. Every Ice Witch has magical ability to some degree. Many are powerful casters and can obliterate their enemies without ever getting a good look at them, but just as many enjoy getting their hands bloody in martial combat. They jumped at the offer to join Rhagai's campaign of domination and were some of his first allies in the north. \nIce Giants prefer to keep out of the business of the world, but when they realized that they would either lose all of their frozen lands or, at worst, go extinct without the power of the Lord of Ice, choosing sides was an uncomplicated matter. Ice Giants, while not inherently evil, have no qualms about smashing humans. Especially ones who trespass into their territory near Nordag.\nThe Ice Lords are the generals of the Isthak forces. They are Rhagai's direct subordinates, the biggest cogs in the machine, and they are the ones who make sure everything moves forward as their commander desires. There are currently five Ice Lords representing the Humans, Ice Withces, Ice Giants, and Bestmen, as well as Melghur of Death, and undead wraith and Rhagai's right-hand. \nPoligaunt the Crusher, Beastman Icelord\nIn addition to the listed reward levels, we are happy to offer several add-ons to our generous backers.

Demonworld is special and we want to share it with as many people as possible.   \n If interest is strong enough, we will be able to unlock stretch goals, so please share our campaign with your gaming community.   \nSuccessful campaigns like this one will help us keep things coming in the not-too-distant future. Our next planned project is the Orc Army Book. The Orcs are a tribal people that live for nothing more than battle and glory. The coming of the demons was, at first, a welcome opportunity to test their strengths, but as the invasion continued, they have begun to realize they might not be able to take on this challenge and survive. Our hope is to be able to complete this and future projects for our fans. Once our current project is complete and out the door, we will be able to provide more detailed information on upcoming content and products. We do plan on continuing updating the armies from Second Edition Demonworld, including the humans of the Empire and the Goblins, as well as adding some exciting new forces that have never been published.

It also includes the new Life Point Cards, which make it easier to see your opponent\u2019s (or companion\u2019s) health across the table, the adventure \u201cThe Non-Gambling Kind,\u201d which was previously only available as a promo, and numerous other new cards and features.\nThe Inn of the Black Boar includes four new heroes: the honorable Amazon Warrior, Palinai Erlendur of Kurkum, the streetwise Grolm Merchant, Neerax Dal, the mysterious Maraskan Buskur, Nicole Sororis, and the battle-hardened Tobrian Mercenary, Heigan Malleaux.\nAlthough all four of these new heroes are ready to drop into Duel Mode, the heart of this expansion is its amazing new exploratory dungeon crawl. Based on the very first adventure for The Dark Eye\u2122 of the same name, the Inn of the Black Boar uses random Dungeon Cards and 20 different random combat encounters so that the adventure is completely different every time you play, making it the most replayable Aventuria expansion yet!\nDo you want to explore with even more people? The Return to the Inn of the Black Boar mini-expansion adds enough specialty cards to allow up to 6 players to head into the Black Boar together. But you\u2019ll want to pick this up even if you play solo or with a smaller group, because it also includes cards and combat scenarios for two new factions you can encounter in the dungeon under the Black Boar: the Black Mages and the Undead Circus!\n\nPrevious expansions\nAll previous expansions for Aventuria are available as Add-Ons.

On your turn, you may play up to two cards as endurance cards, which are then used to pay for the tools you will need for your adventure. Since you can (almost) never get any cards back into your hand, much of the strategy involves selecting the right cards to keep and the right cards to add to your endurance pool.  \nIn Aventuria, nothing is ever certain. Many of your attacks and spells require skill rolls, and your foe may still have the chance to dodge or use armor to reduce the damage you do. But Phex, god of luck, is always watching. When fortune is against you, Fate Points can help turn the tide. \n If you want to know learn more here are two Let's Plays of Aventuria with designer Markus Pl\u00f6tz.\n The  fees for shipping will be added in the pledge manager after the  campaign is finished. We have four destribution centers, shipping from  the US, Germany, China and Australia. The cost of shipping will be  determined at the moment of destribution not purchase, should rates  change in the meantime. \nWe are located in Germany, which means we have to enter our prices in Euro. Because of this the dollar values of our tables might be off by a few cents. We always adjusted the prices to your advantage.\n\nMichael Palm\nMichael  Palm was born in 1971 and discovered his passion for board and card  games early on. Puurchasing the first The Dark Eye box in 1984 changed  his life. With his brother and friends he emerged himself in the world  of roleplaying games as much as he possibly could. After he met a circle  of likeminded roleplayers in university, he opened the game and  boardgame store \"Seetroll\" with three of these colleagues in 1991. The  store grew and university deminished. Since 1996 Michael was able to  publish games. He worked on the german Simpsons Trading Card Gane, the  board game \"The Dwarfs\" and the dice game \"Bang! Dice Game\". \nLukas Zach\nLukas  Zach, born 1977, traded two toy cars for a core box of The Dark Eye in a  school yard deal when he was 11 years old. He surely made the better  deal. He ran his first game for his parents and till university played  The Dark Eye passionately, since then he also visited other fantastic  worlds. He has been designing games with Michael Plam for 15 years and is senior game designer for KING Art Games. \nMichael Palm (l) and Lukas Zach (r)\n\nChristian Lonsing\nChristian  Lonsing began his career in the previous millennium as translator for  Games Workshop, and has been with the industry since. Over the years, he  took part in the production and design of a great variety of RPG and  tabletop games, most notably the 4th edition of Shadowrun. He has been  with Aventuria from the very start and designed most of the adventures,  including the Inn of the Black Boar. Other English titles of his are the  adventure game Kaphornia and a large assortment of board games. \nChristian Lonsing\n\nMarkus Pl\u00f6tz\nAfter  25 years Markus Pl\u00f6tz is a veteran of the hobby gaming industry. Since  2000 he is owner and CEO of Ulisses Spiele and is working to shape his  company into the world's biggest fantasy publisher.  \nAventuria  has always been a passion project for Markus. He initiated the project  and after the duell-mode of an expansion is finished, Markus works on  the adventure mode. He is involved in each Aventuria design and  sacrifices countless hours of his free time to make the game as good as  it can be.\nMarkus Pl\u00f6tz", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoard games are very involved in terms of manufacture.

Designed with easy-to-learn rules for solo, cooperative, and competitive play, the English edition of Aventuria has been winning over fans and selling out at conventions for over two years now. The new Second Edition lets us bring the game to an even wider audience, and the full-sized expansion Inn of the Black Boar brings a whole new level of adventuring to old and new fans alike!\nExpanding the community of Aventuria players is our main goal with this Kickstarter. These two main products are already translated, edited, and ready to go, so we can get them into your hands very quickly. We have reward levels, add-ons, and stretch goals designed with everyone in mind \u2013 if you\u2019re new, you\u2019ll get everything you need to jump right in and play, and if you\u2019re already a fan of Aventuria, we have plenty of exciting new content and accessories! \nThe Aventuria Adventure Card Game is a fast-paced card game for 1-4 players, ages 14+, where each player takes the role of a hero from Aventuria. Choose from Arbosh the fierce dwarven smith, Layariel the fleet-footed elven scout, Carolan the cunning half-elven rogue, or Mirhiban the mysterious Tulamydian mage.\nIn Duel Mode, heroes fight against each other, while in the cooperative Adventure Mode, heroes join together as a party and go on exciting adventures. Whether battling against each other or standing united against a terrifying foe, players draw action cards every round which constantly improve their abilities. But beware, for each round brings new challenges, and you must always watch for surprise attacks from your enemies!\nThe Second Edition incorporates many rules clarifications and errata that have arisen over our years of playing both the German and English editions. It also includes the new Life Point Cards, which make it easier to see your opponent\u2019s (or companion\u2019s) health across the table, the adventure \u201cThe Non-Gambling Kind,\u201d which was previously only available as a promo, and numerous other new cards and features. \nThe Inn of the Black Boar includes four new heroes: the honorable Amazon Warrior, Palinai Erlendur of Kurkum, the streetwise Grolm Merchant, Neerax Dal, the mysterious Maraskan Buskur, Nicole Sororis, and the battle-hardened Tobrian Mercenary, Heigan Malleaux.\nAlthough all four of these new heroes are ready to drop into Duel Mode, the heart of this expansion is its amazing new exploratory dungeon crawl. Based on the very first adventure for The Dark Eye\u2122 of the same name, the Inn of the Black Boar uses random Dungeon Cards and 20 different random combat encounters so that the adventure is completely different every time you play, making it the most replayable Aventuria expansion yet!\nDo you want to explore with even more people? The Return to the Inn of the Black Boar mini-expansion adds enough specialty cards to allow up to 6 players to head into the Black Boar together. But you\u2019ll want to pick this up even if you play solo or with a smaller group, because it also includes cards and combat scenarios for two new factions you can encounter in the dungeon under the Black Boar: the Black Mages and the Undead Circus! \n Upgrade the look and feel of your game with accessoires for Aventuria.\nWe offer four wooden boxes with Aventurian motives, each of them adorned with an aventurian image.

Each backer of the  Barkeep and Count levels  receives this scenario including more than 20 cards and a booklet. \nRegardless of the mode you are playing, you will power up your hero with equipment, skills, and spells, and then use your abilities to attack your foes. On your turn, you may play up to two cards as endurance cards, which are then used to pay for the tools you will need for your adventure. Since you can (almost) never get any cards back into your hand, much of the strategy involves selecting the right cards to keep and the right cards to add to your endurance pool. \nIn Aventuria, nothing is ever certain. Many of your attacks and spells require skill rolls, and your foe may still have the chance to dodge or use armor to reduce the damage you do. But Phex, god of luck, is always watching. When fortune is against you, Fate Points can help turn the tide. \n If you want to know learn more here are two Let's Plays of Aventuria.\nThe Adventure Mode\nThe Duel Mode\n The  fees for shipping will be added in the pledge manager after the  campaign is finished.

What does that mean? It means that players take on the role of fantasy heroes that are avatars in a virtual reality massively-multiplayer role-playing game. Their characters are aware that they are characters, and they have advantages that normal RPG characters don't have. For instance, if they die in battle, they can respawn at their most recent bind point. Death is no longer the end! It's become a tactical option. But there's always a price, and in Infinity's Edge death means a loss of XP and having to go find your body to get most of your equipment back. \nIt also means that the NPCs in your fantasy game just became a completely new level of meta! They can discuss levels and classes with your characters, tell them where to find trainers, help them locate the best areas for their level and tell them what kind of loot different creatures drop. Higher level NPCs can tell characters about the abilities that they gain when they increase in level, and they can offer quests to anyone high enough level to qualify for them. Parties, guilds, and factions have mechanical effects including long-distance communication with one another through raid channels. \nOne of the most significant aspects of this kind of game is that all the chatter around the table about game mechanics just went from out-of-character to in-character. Your characters can benefit from modern world knowledge and use as much regular slang or pop culture references as they want without breaking character (although NPCs may become a little tired of not understanding what they're talking about!). Characters will be offered quests, allowing them to choose their path knowing full well its difficulty and reward. And perhaps most importantly, from the time of character creation, they can take part in events that will shape the (virtual) world they inhabit!\nAn adventurer faces a scout from the orc legion on the steps of Holdfast, the dwarven stronghold!\nInfinity's Edge uses a unique system designed from the ground up to work with conventional gaming dice but to emulate the mechanics in a modern MMO. At its core, the game works on a percentile system, with a fixed difficulty, or Threshold, for any given task. Characters have seven Attributes and gain Skills, both of which affect a character's chance for success on any given task that uses that particular combination. The default Threshold for success on any given roll is 60, meaning that a character will succeed on that roll if they get a 60 or less on a d100 roll. The higher a character's Attributes and Skills, the higher the Threshold goes, making it easier to succeed on the roll. \nThe most important aspects of a character in Infinity's Edge are the three Meters: Health, Stamina, and Mana. Health is used to measure how much damage a character has taken, Stamina is spent to take actions, and Mana is used to fuel magic or supernatural effects.\nOne of the aspects of the game designed to emulate an MMO is the process of Skill acquisition. In Infinity's Edge, characters gain Skills through use. The first time a character attempts and successfully executes a Skill, they gain that Skill at rank 1. After that, they increase in rank through using it successfully. Five successful uses achieves rank 2, then ten successful uses grants rank 3, and so on. For those who prefer less bookkeeping in their games, we included a couple of alternative Skill progression methods suggested by our playtesters so you can customize to suit your preferences! One is based on overcoming challenges (such as battles), while the other is a straight experience point expenditure system. \nCharacters in Infinity's Edge begin at level 1 and gain levels regularly through experience up to a maximum of level 50. At levels 1-9, the characters are Novices, during which time they develop their Attributes and Skills, and determine what their preferred playstyle is. At level 10, a character chooses their first class. Basic Classes, including the core concepts of Warrior, Rogue, Priest, and Wizard, are available to all characters, and there are six Hybrid Classes that mix two Basic Classes together. A combination of Priest and Warrior is a Paladin, for example, while a combination of Rogue and Wizard is called a Shadowmage. And there are Specialist Classes as well, which can be unlocked via play or by finding a trainer.\nWhen a character chooses their first class, they choose three of six powerful, thematic abilities that establish the class's theme. A priest can focus on healing or buffs, for example. Every five levels after 10, a character may choose one additional ability, completing all of the class's default options by level 25 unless substitute abilities are offered through quest unlocks. Then, at level 30, the character chooses their Advanced Class, and an entirely new level of play is unlocked! The core rules of Infinity's Edge focus on the first 30 levels, but Advanced Classes are already in playtest!\nFinally, although the LitRPG genre as well as numerous anime series (which were a strong secondary source of inspiration) tend to have protagonists who cannot log out of the game, in Infinity's Edge that option is still on the table if you want it for your games. Have the real world impact the game world by incorporating interpersonal conflicts between gamers, corporate politics surrounding game releases, and anything else you can think of! It's all in there!\nPlaytest character Aragil (Base Class: Wizard) selects the perfect spell for those pesky bats.\nInfinity's Edge is a full-color rulebook that is estimated at roughly 75-80 pages in length. Choosing to back this Kickstarter entitles you to either a digital copy of the game in the form of a PDF or a print-on-demand physical copy created via DriveThruRPG. If you're reading this, you probably already know how good their products are.\nInfinity's Edge has already been written. It's currently undergoing edits as we speak, and a portion of the art is already finished, with more in development right now. The funds from the Kickstarter will enable us to finish up the rest of the art rather than having to do it over a long period of time and begin layout immediately upon receipt of the art. But, to reiterate, the longest and most arduous part of the process, the writing and playtesting, was completed before this campaign went live. No additional content will be added to the core rules as a result of this Kickstarter, ensuring that delays will be kept to an absolute minimum.\nPlaytest character Hazmatt (Hybrid Class: Scout) evaluates a new piece of loot\n$10 Infinity's Edge PDF - At this basic pledge level, you will receive a PDF of the full-color Infinity's Edge Role-playing Game. In addition, while the art and layout are being finalized, we'll generate a text-only PDF of the rules that will only be available to backers! You can start playing as soon as the campaign is over and payments have been processed. \n$15 Infinity's Edge PDF + Print-on-Demand - In addition to the two PDFs available at the previous level, this pledge will get you an at-cost print copy of our full-color core rulebook. This will allow you to purchase the book for only the cost of printing, which tends to be at or around $5 for a book of this size (although printing costs change over time and we can't predict that). This still allows you to get the PDF/PoD combination for less than it will retail for once it is released to the general public. Because we love you.\n$20 Infinity's Edge Digital Addict - Everything in digital, all the time! You get the two PDFs and the hard copy of the core rulebook as previously described, but you also get a PDF of every unlocked stretch goal. Based on the pricing structure we have in place, this is a cost effective method of getting the stretch goals as soon as the first one is unlocked!\n$40 Infinity's Edge Hard Copy Addict - We're all bibliophiles here, no judgment. This gets your everything from the previous level, plus when we make the stretch goal items available in print-on-demand format, you get at-cost copies of those as well. In the interest of full disclosure, at the retail pricing that we currently have in mind, this particular pledge level becomes cost effective for you when the second stretch goal is unlocked. We don't want anyone to feel as if they aren't getting a great value!\n$150 Immortal Artwork - This is the big one! You get everything else in all the other pledge levels, but in addition, you can submit a picture of yourself (or of someone else, we aren't picky) and tell us what your character's name and class are. We'll commission a piece of art featuring your character! We've done this a few times already. Here's an example of a fan who wanted a \"scholarly rogue type\", and this is the art we had made for him. You can enjoy the same benefits!\nCharacter Gail, the brilliant prodigy, tames a draco-cat (and names her Athena) as her companion!\nWe'll be delighted just to have the game funded, but we have other ideas we want to explore in this game line, and here's what we're already planning on working on. Again, achieving these funding goals will allow us to accelerate the process significantly, rather than waiting on it to fund via sales after the release of the core book.\nDepending upon the complexity of the material and the art density, we expect these books to be somewhere between 16 and 24 pages (but we can't promise that they won't blow up to be much larger if and when inspiration strikes... that's how this entire game was created, after all). Pledge levels allow you to gain access to these in PDF or print-on-demand form, or both. We've included what we hope are very conservative estimates on delivery, just to be sure that we don't run overly late. Hopefully these are later than the actual releases!\n $4,500 - The Next Level: Dramatically expanding the rules in the core book, Next Level adds Advanced Classes for play above level 30 as well as advanced rules for settlements, large-scale battles, factional domains, and LOTS of new races, along with all other sorts of stuff. Imagine this is the first major DLC that makes your game even cooler, and you're starting to get the right picture. Estimated Delivery: October 2019\n $6,000 - Knights of the Edge: This sourcebook will present an assortment of knightly orders to serve as a framework for your campaign, as protagonists, or perhaps even antagonists if you like to run scoundrels! Written by guest designer Alan Bahr of Gallant Knight Games, one of the most gifted designers and writers in the industry! We are very excited to have him contributing! Estimated Delivery: November 2019\n $7,500 - The Shorefall Campaign: The playtest campaigns for this game centered around the Shorefall zone and the major events that happened there during the beta-testing of the Infinity's Edge MMO (in-game, of course... there's not really an MMO, just in case you're confused). Get everything you need to run the game here, including characters, NPCs, factions, maps, and of course the epic adventure itself. Estimated Delivery: December 2019\n $9,000 - Digital Grimoire: The Infinity's Edge core rulebook includes the basic magic system of the world and rules for designing your own spells and Magic Skills, but there's always room for more! This includes more Magic Skills than you can shake a wand at, and dozens of pre-made spells to save you time! Estimated Delivery: March 2020\n $10,500 - Need vs. Greed: What's better than more equipment? We're talking about loot! Treasure! Epic drops! Rarities, levels, and scalable items! Everything you can imagine, up to and including an optional system to have characters roll to see who gets a loot drop if they want that extra level of reality in the tabletop version of the game! Estimated Delivery: May 2020\n $11,000 - The Shorefall Chronicles: As a recovering fiction writer, the lead designer for the game fictionalized the events of his playtest campaign in what was intended to be a few short stories but what turned into a novel-length LitRPG saga in its own right. Every backer gets a copy in e-book form! Estimated Delivery: January 2020\nPlaytest character Minion (Base Class: Rogue) retrieves some poison for his blades from his inventory\nInfinity's Edge is the second brand to be released by Kyoudai Games since the company first came into existence back in 2013. In that time, we've released dozens of supplements for our flagship game, Thunderscape: the World of Aden. Thunderscape is available for both the first edition of Pathfinder (PF) as well as Savage Worlds (SW). And if you want PDFs, you'll never get them cheaper than as add-ons for this Kickstarter!\nThunderscape Core PDF (PF or SW): $10\nThunderscape Core Book (PF only): $15 with free shipping)\nThunderscape Class Guide PDF (PF only): $8\nThunderscape Adventure Path PDF, volume 1, 2, or 3 (PF only): $10\nThunderscape Worlds PDF Series, volumes 1-8 (PF only): $10\nAden Gazette PDF Series, volume 1-22 (PF or SW): $18\nPlaytest character Mordock (Base Class: Priest) mends a wound using his Magic Skills\nShawn Carman is the lead writer for this game. Having discovered LitRPG during the summer of 2018, he has consumed a truly disturbing number of novels since that time, created a game to play with his friends, then ended up writing an entire rulebook about it and finding artists that could create it with him. Shawn is the former head writer for Legend of the Five Rings at Alderac Entertainment Group (for well over a decade, we might add) as well as the creative director and chief writer for Thunderscape, the flagship RPG of Kyoudai Games for the past six years.\nChris Camarata is an audiobook enthusiast and a fellow LitRPG junkie who got very excited when he heard what Shawn was working on. He has been an invaluable sounding board and system designer for Infinity's Edge, with a particular emphasis on the races and the settlement building rules.\nMike Brodu is the graphic design master for Kyoudai Games, and always the wisest man in the room when it comes down to how things look on the page. He knows exactly what kind of margins there have to be and exactly how big the logo can (and must!) be on the front. He's a dark wizard of pictures and we both love and fear him for his powerful magics.\nKim Wong Lim is the single most prolific artist working on the project and has single-handedly helped determine how this game was going to look. He is both a gentleman and a scholar whose artistic talents cannot be overstated. You can check out more of his amazing work right here! \nPlaytest character Girth Brooks (Specialist Class: Martial Artist) checks out his character sheet.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQuestion: Can Kyoudai Games handle this Kickstarter?\nThis is not our first Kickstarter. We learned a lot from the first two, unfortunately most of it being what we shouldn't do. This Kickstarter has no shipped products (except maybe some add-ons that are already in hand and shippable), and limits our stretch goals to avoid over-promising. The book is written (and nothing will be added to the core book through this Kickstarter, which can cause delays), roughly half the art is already complete, and contracts are lined up for the rest as well as for layout. This project is as close to complete as we can make it with our currently available resources.\n\nQuestion: What if the text / art / layout isn't finished?\nThe text is finished. The art is 50% complete and we have arrangements for the rest. We have someone lined up for layout, and if that falls through, we have someone else who can take on the project in the event of an emergency. There is a secondary and tertiary project manager in place with copies of all the assets who can take over if something happens to Shawn. Our failsafes have failsafes. \n\nQuestion: What about printing / shipping issues?\nOur printing and shipping partners at DriveThruRPG operate worldwide and are well known for getting products into the hands of fans at extremely affordable rates and with minimal fuss.

It's a dive into pre-colonial Africa for all the rich lore you've never heard of. It's an exploration into a world where the majority of the faces are dark, yet isn't constrained to one corner. It's a world where women hold power equal to men and the merit of ones soul is what propels them through life. It's a world where spirits aren't to be feared, they are to be embraced. In a time where we know that representation matters, this project is an effort to add to that spirit in the way I know best. Narrative fiction in the nerdiest of flavors. \nSwordsfall is made up of three key parts; World Anvil, Tabletop RPG and Stories/Novels. Each of them telling a different part in the lore that is the world of Tikor. This Setting and Artbook is part of that synergy and the first step toward realizing the Tabletop RPG.\n For the Full Plan - Check out the Swordsfall Patreon\n Read our Feature in Kotaku!\nFinal Concept Piece for the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nThe Story So Far...\nIn the beginning... Tikor is a world where deities and spirits are as real as the nature that surrounds them. Since the earliest writings of mankind, the gods have been there with them. They are a vital part of the makeup of human societies across the globe. This is in a way to be expected. Humans were in fact, created by the gods. Various great deities created cultures of their design and ethos. As time marched forward, these various cultures and groups co-existed. Sometimes contentiously, sometimes harmoniously, but always striving to co-exist. \nConcept Art for the Dihoma - Artwork by Tumo Mere\n\nHistory, however, would change over the course of a tragic day and its horrific night. Mime, the Garuda deity of Wisdom, is assassinated at the hands of an alleged Vinyatian assassin. Mortal hands had never slain a deity. As tensions between the rival nations of Garuda and Vinyata soared under a long Tikor night, a bloody battle erupted between the two sides. A truce was called once the truth was revealed, but not before irreversible damage to both sides was done. \nDespite the armistice between bitter enemies, the wounds of that day will forever linger. The world heaves as the one constant, the gods themselves, waver and a new struggle begins.\nSwordsfall Logo Designed by Taylor Ruddle\nTHE YEAR 10 A.R\nAs the world still recovers, ten years after the bloody events that ended the Era, its fallout begins to appear. Rumors begin to give rise around the world of the arrival of a new kind of weapon. Instruments capable of killing gods, Grim Arms. Could this be related to the unsolved assassination of Mime? \nIn Garuda, a power struggle is in full effect as the current ruler of The Divine Order of the Phoenix, Amma Zencora, vies to hold onto his ill-gotten throne. How far will the ruler go to defend the throne he so desperately wants to hold on to? \nKevin Hou has allowed his art be used in Swordsfall\nVinyata is adjusting to a world with one less major city and cultural hub. The Eastern Node having been destroyed during the bloody war at the End of the Era. An unpleasant surprise emerges as they rebuild and a rash of malevolent spirits now roam the region. The souls of those lost 10 years still attached to the mortal plane, hungry for vengeance and retribution.\nHawklore's neutrality during The Longest Night has finally paid dividends. Literally. The God King, Hawken, basks in the increasing wealth of his nation. On the outside, it seems like a rich paradise where any want can be attained. Yet below, in the dingy streets of the capital city, High Perch, dissension stirs.\nAn early concept sketch of the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nRumors abound that the desolate stretch of land known as the Ebon Cascade has stirred with a new form of horror. Something cunning. And it's uniting the monstrous beings that call it home. Whispers say a Raksha is on Tikor, hiding away, building an army. None want to believe the horrifying rumor, yet none dare to confirm it either.\nIn the boundless waters of The Grand Divide, new forces stir as the largest pirate fleet of them all, Heaven's Fall, begins to marshal. With the cold genius of Nubia leading them, her power has begun to make those on land to take notice. The law of the sea changes as rumors of an alliance between her and the tech genius, Ken Musa begin to stir.\nIn all corners of the world, events are in motion.\n Visit the website - Official Swordsfall Website\nThe Book\nWelcome to Tikor will be an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover book, printed on premium color for the richest and vivid colors. With this being an artbook, the quality and feel of the book is important.\n*Update* Due to the overwhelming support of our backers, we hit the goal for OFFSET PRINTING! The book will be printed by PrintNinja, with the solid binding and paper quality you wanted!\nThe main point of this Kickstarter is to raise money for the art. Being able to see the dynamic characters and unique setting with your own eyes is something that can't be replaced. The goal represents the minimum needed to make that happen.\nAs for the book, the length will be around 150 pages, though it could be longer depending on the amount of money raised. The max page count will be around 200 pages no matter what. \nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\n\nThe Setting and Art Book will be a combination of T'umo's art, and Brandon's lore. Each piece of detailed full-color art will be accompanied by information about the person, place or thing it depicts For those only interested in the art, this lore will help bring the art to life and give it meaning. The kind of book you can sit down and just read.\nHowever, for those interested in the setting for their own games of the future Swordsfall RPG, then this serves as your window to the Afropunk setting. Throughout the pages, you will find a living world that easily makes the backdrop the right Tabletop System. However, this Setting and Artbook contains NO RULES. Just pure, sweet narrative world-building and fantastic art.\nSwordsfall itself has its own custom system that is deep into development.  Much of the art from the artbook will be used in the Corebook itself. Supporting this Kickstarter makes the Corebook's development even faster.\nAn early concept sketch of the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nThe Wallpapers\nAs a bonus to our backers all of T'umo's gorgeous work will be turned into amazing high-quality Wallpapers for your PC and phone. While the art will be used in both the Art Book and Corebook, I also want to share it with you the fans. And nothing is better than a gorgeous wallpaper on your home screen.\nThe World Map of Tikor makes for a sexy wallpaper\nAlmost every piece of art that is generated through this Kickstarter will be turned into a vivid piece of wallpaper. As well, there will be multiple resolutions available so you can always have the right size for your screen. We'll be conducting a poll after the Kickstarter to find out what the most used resolutions are. (I doubt we'll be able to do 15 resolutions for all the art)\nThat means you're not just getting the World Map as a wallpaper, but a ton of different ones with different art on it. Do you have a favorite profession? Or a favorite city in Swordsfall? Well, I'm sure there will be a wallpaper with it on it. We plan to have over 50 wallpapers in the bundle. \nA big ol fat zip of Wallpaper goodness.\nA Work in Progress shot of the Griot Wallpaper - Art by T'umo Mere, Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe Poster\nFor the Kickstarter there will be a Limited Edition run of a full-color Poster of the final book cover. The final art cover hasn't been finalized yet, but watch for updates on Kickstarter or the Swordsfall Patreon to see what the final image is. As well, a digital version will be included with all Kickstarter PDF's as part of the Digital Stretch Goals!\nThe Poster of the Minos, currently available on Redbubble!\nIf you like the art, like the poster, then check out our shop! We already have shirts, stickers, and more already available. Buying Swordsfall swag also supports the artists! All our artists receive royalties on shirts their art is featured on.\nCheck out our Official Merchandise: The Swordsfall Shop\nSo, what exactly is the world within the pages of this book? Well, Tikor is a world divided, both in idea and land. Yet, hope remains as the two halves are only divided, not separated. The Northern Hemisphere of Tikor sports much more moderate temperatures and expansive grasslands in the center. The tip of the northern region is snow-capped, with the furthest tips permanently covered in ice.\nThe Southern Hemisphere of Tikor, on the other hand, is essentially a desert wasteland. Or at least that's what some will say. Despite the harsh conditions and cunning predators, various cultures have made a home among the barren sand and oppressive heat. With dunes that sing hypnotic lullabies, mammoth beasts and a second sun that relentlessly bakes the land, the southern half is worlds different from the North.\nThe World of Tikor\n Garuda - The largest nation in the Northwestern Hemisphere of Tikor. A land of green and grasslands, it's headed by the Order of the Divine Phoenix. The organization itself was created by the deities of the land, The Divinity.\n Vinyata - The eternal rival to Garuda and the largest nation in the Southern Hemisphere of Tikor. The desert land is home to the Dracon, a culture descended from the only heroic dragon in history, Ryuu-jin. Despite the unforgiving landscape, the people of the desert have found solace underneath enormous domed cities.\n Hawklore - On the eastern edge of the Northern half of Tikor, lies a nation sitting singular. The country is embroiled in no battles, sieges or upsets to the throne. Instead, it's been lead by one single man, a god in fact. Hawken. And within his cool and steady grip, the nation has remained at the forefront of Azurean mining and economics.\n Grimnest -The living mountain, Enkai, separates Garuda from the western portion of the Northern Hemisphere.  The wrathful deity hasn't allowed a single person to cross his crags in a millennia. It's in this isolation that the rule less land of Grimnest sits. With no official government or ruler, its a land truly free. And also home to pirates, raiders and the spirit powered bounty hunters to reign them in.\n Ramnos - Nestled in the southernmost part of the Southern Hemisphere, this reclusive nation avoids attention at almost all cost. For them, being forgotten is the best thing they could do. Trade in and out of their nation is limited, and trust is a temporary arrangement in Ramnos. And with it being located between the horrors that wait in Ebon Cascade and the Outskirts of Vinyata on the other side, most who are born there stay there.\nSecond set of concept art for the Dihoma - Art by T'umo Mere\n\n Independent Freeland of Teslan - A small island located off of Grimnest. Tucked away in the turbulent ocean, Crystal Priest train to control their gift, all while studying the secrets to Hekan itself. The school for these Azurean molders, Druse Academy, rarely allows visitors into its halls. And the ring of Sentrylocks guarding the island makes it a place people only come to by invitation.\n The Grand Divide -The vast ocean that almost splits the land in two has its own personality. Its sparkling blue and green seas can turn harsh at any given moment. With hellish winds and torrential rain coming on seemingly at its whim. And if the weather doesn't get you, the pirates may. Yet millions flock to the sea everywhere. In search of glory, freedom, and prizes on its sea.\n Ebon Cascade - This perilous zone has swallowed up a chunk of the western part of the Southern Hemisphere. The air near the plagued lands seem to make every pore cry out, threatening to vomit. The waters run yellow with poison and the air feels stiff with suffering. Yet throughout the harshness, humans continue to visit the lands. Pushing their luck, and eventually their lives.\n The Canopy -  Located on the very western quarter of the Northern Hemisphere, this mountain region is unlike anything on Tikor. The peaks of the half a dozen mountains can't be seen from the ground level. Even if you could see them, these majestic peaks are not safe for visiting or habitation. Tales float around about mysterious creatures that whisk away anyone that dares venture into these lands.\nMinos Concept Bust - Art by Tumo Mere\n For More Lore: The Swordsfall World Anvil\n $4,000 \nMoar art from T'umo Mere\nA Deadquiver in action - T'umo Mere\nAt this Pledge level we'll be able to add more fantastic artwork to the Welcome to Tikor.

To accomplish that, we've enlisted the help of a master in landscape design. The amazing Sabina Lewis! She's agreed to be a guest member on the Swordsfall to help bring the luscious world to life. When we hit this pledge level she'll be able to bring Tikor's incredible world to life.\n\n $10,000 \n Second PDF \"Tikor: The Professionals\"\nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\nWith your continued support we will be able to release a SECOND PDF as part of the Kickstarter. In the future this will be sold separately, but this and any other unlocked PDF's will be included as part of your Kickstarter!\nTikor: The Professionals will detail the 34 unique professions used in the Swordsfall Corebook. However, they are not classes, they truly are Professions. They are a symbol of not what someone is, but truly what they accomplish in life. The Professionals will talk about these professions in detail including history, location and important figures within each. Each Profession will be accompanied with full page art from T'umo Mere.\n\n $12,000 \nChibi Profession Art and Pins\nA Chibi Celestial Shield in the middle along side two other examples\nSwordsfall team member Taylor Ruddle has long had a love for Chibi art, even studying in Japan to hone his art. He's bring those skills to Tikor by designing Chibi versions of all 34 of Swordsfall's Professions. \nThen we're going to take those adorable creations and craft quality pins from them. They're cute, and fiercely adorable.\n\n $15,000 \n10 page Comic \"The Rise of Nubia\" Prologue\nThe story of Tikor's most famous and powerful pirate is one that needs more than just words. To describe the true depth of the character, only a comic can suffice. And so if we hit this goal Brandon and T'umo will credit a comic of Nubia, leader of Heaven's Fall.\nNubia has become a fan favorite among those who have read the Swordsfall World Anvil. Her strong spirit and fire has made her a often talked about character. The story of her rise may be known by some already, but it's never been shown in this kind of detail or color. \n $20,000 \nThird PDF - \"Pantheons of Tikor\"\nNot the Final Version - Art by T'umo Mere | Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe world of Tikor would not be where it is without the help of its divine beings. Almost the entire world is covered in various spirits and deities. Some influencing the people, and some hindering them.\nIf we reach this goal another PDF will be produced. This one all about the Pantheons that exist on Tikor. From the The Divinity in Garuda to the Orisha in the Outskirts of Vinyata, each pantheon will be detailed. Each pantheon will have gorgeous art alongside of it to show you the lives the divine live.\n$26,000 \nTop Notch Editing and Formatting\nAt this point with now three books in the lineup, we've more than maxed our ability to edit in house or within our circles. It's official become time to bring in the experts.\nIf we hit this tier we'll be able to commission the help of a number of freelance editors to help make the books truly shine. And most importantly, be effortlessly readable (because sometimes English is hard).\n $35,000 \nDragons and Creatures from Jonah Lobe\nDragons from Elder Scrolls: Skyrim - Designed by Jonah Lobe\nA true legendary figure has joined the Swordsfall team for a limited engagement. His creatures are ones you've certainly seen before. Jonah was the genius behind many of the Tamriel's most famous creatures such as the Dragons, Giants, and Draugr. He was also the whiz behind the grotesque Deathclaw and freakish Super Mutants from Fallout 4.\nIf we reach $35,000 the master Jonah himself will apply his dragon scales to the Afropunk style of The Wretched Ones. Swordsfall's own winged horrors. As well, he'll also draw other varied creatures from Tikor's wildlife.\n\n$50,000\nCharacter Design From Venus Bambisa\nTitan Slayer: Tinishi (Previous Work) - Art by Venus Bambisa\nThe look and feel of characters is important to Swordsfall, we want to create truly something unique. To help make the Tikor as rich as possible, we're bringing one of South Africa's most talented Character Concept artist, Venus Bambisa.\nHer design's are just jaw dropping in the way they same to flow an anime style with black faces. Her Artstation has character designs of all sorts, each of them elegant, sleek and badass. I especially love how she shows a characters increase in power. Who doesn't love transforming heroes?\n\n $70,000 \nFourth PDF - \"The Animalists' Guide to Creatures\" - Art by Jonah Lobe and T'umo Mere\nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe final and ultimate goal. A FOURTH book through this kickstarter, and the most expensive. That's because this book will be the most art heavy of them all, featuring art from both Jonah Lobe and T'umo Mere.\nAt this final amount we'll craft a trip through the wildlife across Tikor. From the monstrous Nandi Bear to the adorable and house trained Aardwolf. Each animal will be drawn by one of these dynamic pair. This is not a Monster Manual however, this, like the other books, will be narrative journey through the world. Instead focusing on the the animals and how they fit into the world. Their tales and even their bestial gods.\n\n$100,000\nThe Azurean Finish\nArtist Rendering of the Boxset, not ANYWHERE close to the final design. (The final version will be way cooler, and full of T'umo art)\nWhen we hit the $100,000 goal, I can do what people have wanted for over a week, ALL of the books printed. However, I'm going to do one better and not just print all four books, but print them in stupid high quality. And put in a few little extras.

In the chronicle, the Contagion acts as a motivational force and inspires the formation of factions where vampires, werewolves, mages, mummies, etc. come together in new and unique ways.\nOnce joined together to deal with the Contagion, these factions will never see their world (or each other) the same way, and will be forever changed. Each time the Contagion emerges to threaten the fabric of our world, the only beings capable of manipulating, slowing, weaponizing, or halting it, are the unnatural denizens from across the Chronicles of Darkness. The Contagion permeates Infrastructure and warps the known antagonists and supporting blocks present in the lives of every inhuman being.\nThe Chronicles of Darkness, which debuted in 2004 as the new World of Darkness, drew upon the roots of the original World of Darkness and introduced a new look into a shadowy, dangerous world. Players could step into the everyday shoes of mortals, or they could vie for power and control as a vampire, werewolf, changeling, geistsin-eater - and more.\nNow, some 15 years later, the Chronicles of Darkness and its supporting lines are flourishing, with each game receiving second editions, starting with the 2013 release of the Chronicles of Darkness rulebook. \nAll of that development will be for naught, however, if the Contagion spreads, taking the supernatural world with it, and writing a single bleak end to all tales told in the Chronicles of Darkness.\nThis Contagion Chronicle Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a prestige hardcover edition designed to match the look and feel of our other Chronicles of Darkness core rulebooks such as Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, or Changeling: The Lost.\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed on a metallic under layer, and featuring an emboss/deboss of the logo. We estimate the book to be more than 280+ pages, with a two-color interior and endpapers on high quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including rules for multi-type supernatural interactions and new locations and manifestations of the contagion! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nThe Contagion Chronicle will include all the rules you need to combine the various protagonists from the Chronicles of Darkness game line. It features Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, Mage: The Awakening, and all the other lines from Promethean: The Created to Deviant: The Renegades! \nThe Contagion Chronicle contains new playable options in the form of the Sworn and False Factions, new powers in the form of vectors, new antagonists, Tilts, and Conditions, and a broad array of settings and chronicle hooks to keep you playing for year \nChapters include:\nThe Sworn and the False - Your playable factions in the Contagion Chronicle \nThe Vectors - Powers available to the Sworn and False\nPlagues, Interstitial and Otherwise - A history of Contagion and how the different factions formed\nStorytelling - Thorough, accessible advice on running your crossover chronicles\nFive chapters of Contagious fiction\nOutbreak Sites - A rich campaign setting spanning all seven continents and providing 12 different playable settings from Odense to Edinburgh, San Francisco to New Zealand, and Kyoto to Antarctica\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Contagion Chronicle manuscript as backer-only updates. \nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of the Contagion Chronicle that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers, but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of the Contagion Chronicle, expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore these scenarios and challenges. \nThirdly, we want to celebrate the legacy of the Chronicles of Darkness by offering an opportunity to cross-pollinate ideas from all the lines, encouraging a story built from all elements of our Chronicles games. We'll help backers by including a discounted selection of PDF titles from the Midnight Library \u2014 the rulebooks for each of the current lines contained in the Chronicles of Darkness. \nBeyond all of those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of giving this game physical form \u2014 and like the Contagion itself, spreading the joy of the game. When you back this project, you join our alliance and we explore this story together. \nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($50,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to load a larger version of this reward tier chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Infected and Host Reward Tiers), or go all in with the prestige hardcover (Carrier Reward Tier)? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Epidemic and Pandemic Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!)\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Contagion Chronicle campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Bio Response Unit) will get 5 copies of the hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nSeveral Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Contagion Chronicle book or a possible supplement. A limited number of may be created if we hit Stretch Goals and fund additional supplements. Finally, as a Consulting Developer, you will act as be copied on all e-mails and receive all drafts during the development of a future Chronicles of Darkness product produced by Onyx Path. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details. \nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for the Contagion Chronicle. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates. \nPDF VERSION - The digital version of the Contagion Chronicle, fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DrivethruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nPRESTIGE HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus.\nPLAYER'S COMPANION PDF - A supplement containing crunchy rules section(s) on supernatural interactions with examples and guidance (ie, \"What happens when a Vampire does \"X\" to a Mage?\" and similar issues). Built via Stretch Goal achievements, final length and scope will be determined by how many sections are added. Will be included in the rewards list of all backers receiving the Contagion Chronicle PDF.\nGLOBAL OUTBREAKS PDF - A travelogue supplement PDF will be created for the Contagion Chronicle, adding new locations and new manifestations of the Contagion. The Global Outbreaks book will also contain more on the factions, vectors, and sub-splats. Built via Stretch Goal achievements, final length and scope will be determined by how many sections are added. Will be included in the rewards list of all backers receiving the Contagion Chronicle PDF.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For the Contagion Chronicle, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com and cards from DriveThruCards.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.  \nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run. \nPDF Rewards will be fulfilled by DriveThruRPG. Previously-released titles are the ones currently available from DrivethruRPG.com and were created as best they could be depending on the state of the files. So quality may vary from title to title.\nThe Midnight Library contains relevant rulebook PDFs for the Chronicles of Darkness, which can be added on to your reward list. Specific title selection will be made in the BackerKit post-campaign pledge manager. The Midnight Library Collection includes:\nChronicles of Darkness Core Rulebook PDF\nVampire: the Requiem 2nd Edition PDF\nWerewolf: the Forsaken 2nd Edition PDF\nMage: the Awakening 2nd Edition PDF\nChangeling: the Lost 2nd Edition PDF\nPromethean: the Created 2nd Edition PDF\nChronicles of Darkness: Dark Eras PDF\nDemon: The Descent PDF\nBeast: the Primordial PDF\nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional books) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of the the Contagion Chronicle (Reward Tiers of $50+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when the book becomes available.\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\nACHIEVED! - CONTAGION CHRONICLE: PLAYER'S COMPANION - \"Death\" - A Player\u2019s Companion PDF supplement will be created for the Contagion Chronicle, containing a crunchy rules section on supernatural interactions with examples and guidance (ie, \"What happens when a Vampire does \"X\" to a Mage?\").

To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/ ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for the Contagion Chronicle is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "PATIENT", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["75 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "INFECTED", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive a PDF version of The Contagion Chronicle.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Contagion Chronicle PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["545 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "HOST", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of the Contagion Chronicle.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Contagion Chronicle PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: The Contagion Chronicle\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["107 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "CARRIER", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the prestige hardcover versions of the Contagion Chronicle.

If we hit \u00a34,000 (and for every additional \u00a3500 after that) we'll add more pages to the Guide to Hags. \nIn 2012, Triple Ace Games released Leagues of Adventure, a Late Victorian steampulp RPG of exploration, heroic exploits, and derring-do.\nIn 2015, the Leagues of Gothic Horror supplement added horror, magic, mentalism, and numerous supernatural foes to the Leagues universe.\nThanks to the support of our fans we've since published six detailed monster guides (apparitions, black magicians, mummies, shapeshifters, vampires, and wicked scientists), an expansion, a detailed Leagues of Adventure (The Ministry of Unusual Affairs), a complete country (Mordavia), and a book on creating spooky lairs for the Leagues of Gothic Horror line.\nThe Leagues of Gothic Horror gristly line up!\nThis project brings together the remaining monster guides in the series - Faeries, Hags, and Walking Dead - as three volumes.\nNote: Backers of a previous Kickstarter received a no-art, unedited version of Guide to Walking Dead as a free bonus reward. This version of Guide to Walking Dead not only has brand new art being commissioned, but also includes new content.\nGuide to Faeries Format: 64-pages, comic book size (6.69\" x 9.61\"), softcover, color cover, black and white illustrated interior.\nGuide to Hags Format: 32-pages, comic book size (6.69\" x 9.61\"), softcover, color cover, black and white illustrated interior.\nGuide to Walking Dead Format: 64-pages, comic book size (6.69\" x 9.61\"), softcover, color cover, black and white illustrated interior.\nGuide to Hags, Guide to the Walking Dead & Guide to Faeries\nWhile the contents are shaped to suit the specific entities being discussed, all three books have the same chapter headings. Our aim is to make these a one-stop resource for the particular monster. As a result, some information is copied from Leagues of Gothic Horror to save you searching through multiple books at the table or when designing adventures. The great majority of what you'll get, though, is brand new material.\n Chapter 1 - Infernal Origins: Looks at the creature in folklore and history throughout the ages.\nChapter 2 - The Nature of the Damned: Describes how the fell monsters come into existence, their motivations, means of identifying your prey, and ways to protect yourself and defeat them.\nChapter 3 - Forsaken Lairs: Discusses the sorts of lairs the creatures inhabit, as well as any special powers or abilities they might have.\nChapter 4 - Diabolical Powers: Details the array of fell powers wielded by these creatures. Using a pick-and-mix system, the Gamemaster can create unique individuals in a matter of minutes.\nChapter 5 - Catalog of Fiends: Includes statistics and information on a number of stock creatures of the appropriate type.\nChapter 6 - Princes of Darkness: A number of unique villains, complete with image, statistics, and background notes.\nSupporting our Kickstarter is easy!

Nor is the project a pre-order. The books are written, edited, and laid out, and you've seen the covers. Your support will allow us to purchase interior art and pay for printing. Without your support, these books won't be published in any format for the foreseeable future. Many of you know our work, so you know what you're getting for your investment.\nTriple Ace Games began in 2008. The masterminds behind the company, Paul \"Wiggy\" Wade-Williams and Robin Elliott, had previously worked on The Savage World of Solomon Kane and Slipstream settings, among others, for Pinnacle Entertainment Group. Triple Ace Games has produced many popular settings, including Hellfrost, Leagues of Adventure, Leagues of Gothic Horror, and All for One: Regime Diabolique, plus the Rocket Race, Cadaver, and Halfling Feast card games. With many years of experience in the games industry, we continue to create fantastic games for everyone. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe books are written, edited, and laid out, and the final covers are done. We're looking to fund the interior art and printing!\n\nHowever, things can go wrong with anything that goes into a manufacturing process. We have identified that delays in manufacturing could happen. So we have allowed additional time in our schedule to enable us to navigate any delay issues. If all goes to plan, we may even be able to deliver the project a little sooner.\n\nWe understand the printing process as we have printed a good number of books previous to this project, and we know how to communicate our ideas to the printer. We have discussed proofing requirements, so we know that when the printing press is started our book will match our specification requirements.\n\nWith projects like this there is nearly always something that costs more so it is good business sense to have some contingency for this, which we have built in to our costs.\n\nNo matter what problems may occur we will always keep our backers and

The area is so teeming with strife and peril that their characters will have the opportunity to stand at the center of many crises.\nThe Citadel at Nor\u00f0vorn is a setting for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG. It consists of three major settlements, many small villages, at least one ruin, and two primary sources of conflict: The Hunted Lands to the northwest of The Palisade, and the Endalaus Forest, to the north and east of Audreyn's Wall.\nReturn to Nor\u00f0lond, a Viking-flavored world with its own history, culture, and expectations. Visit as an outsider, or fresh from a victory rediscovering the Hall of Judgment.\nIt is intended for starting Dungeon Fantasy RPG characters of 250 points. They will be major players, and the fulcrum around which the future of Nor\u00f0lond turns. While it is set in the same world as Hall of Judgment, it is not sequel. It is a setting, filled with adventuring possibilities, and easily tuned up or down in power level as the GM desired to suit any fantasy campaign!\nGood luck, and may the Fates have a bold destiny in store for you!\nIf the project funds at the basic level, the book will contain 96 pages of material . . . but the potential exists for many more. What will definitely be there?\nNor\u00f0vorn\nThe 25-page section details the key locations in the city, from the Keep itself, to details of Laegribaer, the lower town. The book describes the local geography, key natural resources that are important to trade and commerce, local landmarks, a detailed city map, and of course details on law, guilds, religion, and things to buy and sell. Plus festivals!\nThe city gets a detailed treatment: one of the goals of the project is to turn my rough map, done in a definitely-not-suitable style, into something breathtaking.\nL\u00f6ngbr\u00fa\nMore than any other settlement in the book, Longbru is the area best set up to be considered \u201cTown,\u201d as per Exploits p. 13. It is a staging point and clearinghouse for adventure and treasure, and has everything required for a good start to killing monsters and taking their stuff.\n\u00c1inferill\nA town in crisis. The jarl recently lost his eldest son Asbjorn and his wife in a misadventure in the Endalaus forest, killed and presumed eaten by the dragonkin. Why was Asbjorn even there? Well, like any good story, it's all about a girl. Ylsa El\u00f0har, the flame-headed daughter of Orm Karrisson, the wealthiest man in Nor\u00f0vorn, and maybe all of Nor\u00f0lond. Orm's very public rejection of the pair's declaration of affection nearly caused an instant feud, and did start a chain of events that could consume the entire region.\nOr perhaps that chain of events started two generations in the past?\nOther Villages\nThe space between the larger settlements is not empty. Every few miles, a traveler finds a small village, home to perhaps a hundred or so families. Perhaps it's a farming village, or a riverside community blessed with productive orchards, or a failing logging town, remote and dying. At least one sample village will be detailed, and more if stretch goals are passed!\nSupporting Cast\nMajor NPCs and minor ones each get some detail. You will meet Egil Skarpuror, the Castellan of Nor\u00f0vorn and his wife Olrun Skotblad. Learn the secret history of Orm Karisson, huskarl to Egil and father to Ylsa Eldhar. Meet Gunnulf Kaldrvik, Jarl of Ainferill, and watch his rule disintegrate, despite the worthy efforts of his surviving daughter Asleif. From minor Wardens to powerful nobles and influential clerics, The Citadel at Nor\u00f0vorn has you covered.\nFactions and Encounter Seeds\nEven beyond the backdrop, The Citadel at Nor\u00f0vorn details the goals and motivations, methods and tactics for NPCs: each can want something, and the GM will know what they're willing to do to get it.\nThe E\u00f0lafolk and their gangae\u00f0la minions are swarming in the forest, threatening loggers and the Wall itself. Why?\nFaerie raids into the Hunted Lands, and even beyond, are occurring with terrifyingly regular, and increasing, frequency. What happened? Why now? Can anything be done?\nGunnulf is misbehaving more and more each day. Always hot-tempered he flaunts his new mistress and hardly seems to grieve for his fallen wife and son . . . and each day steps closer to a feud the land cannot afford.\nFrom big to small, grand plots and random encounters in the forest, the book gives strings on which the players pull . . . and provides a detailed relationship map so that the GM will know who reacts to each string, and why. \nBestiary\nThe book wouldn't be complete without monsters! Where Hall of Judgment was heavy on faerie, this book will contain more dragonkin, and the dangerous fauna of the Endalaus Forest. The Dragongrounds north of Audreyn's Wall are riddled with underground and above ground ruins, old haunts of broken ley-line crossings, and other supernatural occurrences. \nAnd treasure. Magic and mundane . . . so much wealth lies in the wreckage of the fallen Dragon Empire. Fell beasts guard it.\nYou know what to do. \nIf everything were completely done, we wouldn't need Kickstarter. Some layout and graphic design is already complete.\nWhere will the money for the Kickstarter go?\nArt and Maps\nThe lion's share of the funding will go to maps, the cover of the book, and original images that illustrate key locations, events, and characters in the book.\nWriting and Editing\nWriters need to be paid. More importantly: editors need to be paid, and a book of this length and complexity needs a capable, strong hand. Once the manuscript is finished, it will go to an editor with a good eye for both narrative and grammar.\nPrinting\nThe Citadel at Nor\u00f0vorn will be printed as well as delivered in PDF. Short-run digital printing takes us threough the first stage. Two printers, one in the UK or EU, and one in the USA, will take on the printing of the book. \nWhy two printers? Because shipping from the USA is utterly ridiculous, and the best way I can find to get books to customers who are outside the USA - and for Hall of Judgment, that was a full third of the physical books! - is to print the books in the UK/Europe and then ship them via Royal Mail.\nThe US is easy: I'll print 'em here and ship them via USPS Media Mail. \nPILLAGED!!! The First Goal: $13,000\nThe initial goal of the book will be 96 pages. There's already more than that written, but the core - the main settlements, the NPCs, the key faction interactions, plus critters, are going to be part of that 96 pages.\nSo, how does the project get even better?\nPILLAGED!!! Expand to 112 pages : $16,000\nMore art, more encounters, more content. \nMoving beyond the basic funding level . . . including \"non-shipping\" funds raised in the post-KS campaign phase in Backerkit . . . will enable me to expand the book by another 16 pages.\nEach sample village is 2-3 pages. A monster is a page. Sample encounters run about 10 per page without details.\nPILLAGED!!! Expand to 128 pages: $20,000\nAnother content expansion, this time focusing on making the Bestiary and some more detailed encounters with maps and monsters: at least one mini-dungeon.\nOffset Print Run: $25,000\nThe book is as thick as Hall of Judgment, and making it to $25,000 enables a full-scale offset print run! Glorious paper, and a lay-flat, sewn binding for durability and ease of reading.\nExpand to 144 pages: $30,000\nThe final stretch goal pushes the book to it's maximum value: 144 pages. Another micro-location, and ensuring all monsters referenced in the book are included fully in the Bestiary for easy reference. \nNEW GOAL: Hall of Judgment 2nd Edition: $35,000\nI'm actually starting to run out of Hall of Judgment and my That Other Game book Dungeon Grappling. If we hit this goal, I'll reprint Hall of Judgment in the same offset print quality - sewn lay-flat binding, heavy paper, and all the new maps by Glynn Seal. \nWhile the retail price of the new edition will jump to $30, for this Kickstarter, the print price will remain $25 for you guys. If we hit it, it'll take 3 months to print, but the new editions will be printed and shipped at the same time as Citadel.\nIf the DFM2 Kickstarter shoots through $45,000, Steve Jackson Games has agreed to include a copy of the 8-page Fantastic Dungeon Grappling booklet in the boxed set itself.\nAll of Gaming Ballistic's Dungeon Fantasy RPG products are 8x10\" size . . . just like the box. And if that stretch goal is reached, we get to put that into practice.\nTo unlock this new stretch goal and improve the box set contents, please visit and support The Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 2 Kickstarter today! And for those of you who already own the box, don't worry!. . . Fantastic Dungeon Grappling will be available separately as an add-on.\n Add-ons are extras that can be placed in your backpack of holding during the campaign.

NOT the Dungeon Fantasy RPG.\nIf you want to see just how fun and simple grappling should be in That Other Game, you're definitely going to want to seize this book.\nDungeon Grappling PDF - $7.50 Add-on item  \n Dungeon Grappling Print + PDF - $20 \nLost Hall of Tyr 2nd Edition (5e; Swords and Wizardry)\nThe first fully-native support for the Dragon Heresy RPG, this edition of Lost Hall pulls all of the great stuff that was added into Hall of Judgment into what was originally a linear one-shot adventure suitable for convention play.\nJourney through the lands of Torengar to seek and find the Lost Hall of Tyr. Find the waybridge that will transport you instantly to your destination, or journey overland for weeks through treacherous terrain.\nWhen you get there, will you be able to prove your worth and enter the Lost Hall of Tyr . . . or will a conniving High Lady of the Fae thwart your intentions?\nThe digital version is a 112-page PDF, hyperlinked, bookmarked, and in full color.\nThe Print and PDF bundle is for those that want a tangible copy of the original. Printed perfect-bound on 100# matte white paper, copies in the USA will ship from Gaming Ballistic, while overseas will fulfill through CPI (and are slightly thinner).\nLost Hall of Tyr (PDF) - $13\nLost Hall of Tyr (Print Only) - $26\n Lost Hall of Tyr (Print + PDF) - $33 \nThe Dragon Heresy Introductory Set\nThe Norse-inspired world of Etera gets a full treatment in this self-contained RPG. All you need to play through Level 1-5, including setting, rules, character creation, and a bestiary featuring over 100 Norse-inspired critters. \nThis 285-page RPG is a stand-alone game based on Fifth Edition, but modified to be significantly more interesting. Wounds are differentiated from vigor, armor has Damage Reduction (DR) rather than making you harder to hit, and shields are just way, way cooler.\nBased on real-world combat research, inspired by Norse mythology, and with speed and fun of play foremost in mind, this is Gaming Ballistic's flagship product to date.\nThe PDF is 287 pages, indexed, hyperlinked, and cross-referenced. The background, art, and borders can be turned off as layers for toner-saving ease of printing and accessibility for those with vision contrast challenges.\nThe print version got an offset print run, and the book is nearly an inch thick, on 85# matte-paper, with a smyth-sewn binding. This is a beautiful book, and showcases how much more you can do in the Nordlond (called Torengar in the book).\nDragon Heresy Introductory Set (PDF) - $20\nDragon Heresy Introductory Set (Print Only) - $50\nDragon Heresy Introductory Set (Print + PDF) - $60\nThe Battle Shield of Torengar ($500)\nJust for fun, I will hand-build for you a mostly-authentic viking-style center-gripped shield. Made of quarter-sawn poplar wood, with a hand-carved oak handle, mild steel boss, and faced, backed, and edged with goat rawhide, it's put together with hide glue, and tapered at the edges. Who doesn't want their own Viking-style shield, made to historical dimensions? Make an impression at your next staff meeting. \nIf you pledge at this level (or buy one as an add-on), I'll contact you and we can work out the details of size and how you want it painted. The shield will likely weigh about 4.5-7 lbs, depending on our mutually-agreed-upon specs.\nThis is only available in the USA, because even inside the USA, this is horrifically expensive to ship!\nThe shield and all of Gaming Ballistic's books and PDFs are included in the \"Shield-guard of Nor\u00f0vorn\" pledge level.\n Some prior samples below. The first two are my personal training shields. Each weighs 6 lbs. The next two were shields for backers of the Dragon Heresy project at the highest level. \nTo help manage post-campaign add-ons, as well as the distribution of the final product(s) to backers, Gaming Ballistic will be using Backerkit to conduct the post-Kickstarter surveys and fulfillment. \nBackerkit is a company whose purpose is to help creators manage these details, including add-ons and shipping costs. When the campaign ends, you will be invited to fill out a Backerkit survey to confirm shipping details, and choose any add-ons you might like to purchase. If you've pledged more than your reward total, this will show as a credit on your account.\nThe Backerkit phase will only last between 10-14 days. The survey will probably only have two or three questions in it: shipping address, and reward selection. It is important to get the shipping address question answered promptly if you order physical product.\n \"Ships to Whole World\" is not Free Shipping!  \nAn important point: the project will ship to the entire world. \nShipping in the USA of physical product will use the USPS media mail, and shipping will be added to your pledge total during the Backerkit phase.\nInternational shipping will use a separate print run done in the United Kingdom or in the EU in order to control shipping costs unless we hit an offset print run. Every effort will be made to make the US and International print runs of identical, outstanding quality . . . but two print runs is the only way to control shipping.\nEither way, I don't control shipping costs, and there's no way around it: International shipping is very expensive, and time-consuming to boot. If you have purchased multiple physical products, such as a physical copy of Dragon Heresy or Dungeon Grappling plus your physical copy of Citadel at Nordvorn, Gaming Ballistic will do everything possible to group them into a single shipment to reduce costs, but that might not be possible. Certain countries (such as Brazil) are ridiculously expensive to ship to, and those costs will need to be passed on during the Backerkit phase.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe primary risk to backers is the timing of delivery.\n\nThe basic mini-setting is complete. The layout template is in place and I have already started work on graphic design and getting the right feel for the work. \n\nUnlike Hall of Judgment, which benefited from effectively being a conversion of an already-complete book, this one will be all new. New art. New setting. New maps. Some re-used monsters, some new ones. That means that it's possible one or more of those things could be delayed.\n\nThe finishing touches on writing will happen during the campaign, and we'll need to see how well we do right off the bat before I start buying art. If things go very well - better than Hall of Judgment - we might see an offset print run, but things would have to go very well. If they DO go that well, it extends the time of receipt by 8-10 weeks over short-run digital print.\n\nAll add-ons are already in hand, and if there are shields ordered, we'll work together to get those done. I don't rush those. \n\nThere are very few things that would disrupt the project other than mild schedule slips \u2013 though of course things can always go pear-shaped. Gaming Ballistic will provide regular updates as to the project\u2019s progress, and do everything possible to deliver the final PDF on or ahead of schedule. Since the final touches on the manuscript are still being made, \"on schedule\" is much more likely than \"ahead of schedule\" for this effort.\n\nOne last risk: International shipping is unpredictable and expensive. The add-ons in particular may come from many different locations in order to save on shipping cost, and may still add up to a good deal of money. Gaming Ballistic will work with you to do the best we can, but it may still be spendy. \n\nIn order to mitigate shipping expense, unless we have an offset print run (1,000 copies or more), I will print the US copies here, but the International copies using a different printer. This allows me to use Royal Mail for international shipments. I will endeavor to make the books as close to the same level of awesome as I can, but I'd rather use slightly lower weight paper for International orders than stick folks with a $50-70 shipping charge for a $30 book.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Lonely Scout", "descp": "Crouch unseen, hidden inside the brush and flora of the Endalaus Forest.

We will be trawling through the Journals of yesteryear, selecting the best articles, revising/re-writing them for the latest edition of the game, and adding a whole host of never-before-seen material. This will (initially) be compiled into three volumes which, for Kickstarter backers only, will arrive within their own deluxe slipcase.\nWe will also be drawing from the better fanzines of the era (having tracked down the original authors) to create the essential resource for exploring Charted Space!\nThe Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society (JTAS) will be starting at three 128 page volumes, but stretch goals will unlock additional volumes at no extra cost to backers - we will simply extend the slipcase in size and add the additional books!\n\nWhat is Inside?\nMuch of the work on the first three volumes has already been completed, and you can download part of Volume One right HERE, so you can see the style we are going for with these books. This is a work in progress, and you will see it updated to completion over the course of the Kickstarter project.\nEach is a treasure trove of information and game additions, including adventures, new ships, animals from across Charted Space, philosophical musings on the big empires, histories, different takes on familiar equipment and vehicles, brand new vehicles, characters to be met in starports, playable alien races, and much, much more...\nThis is what we currently have planned for Volume One (subject to tweaks and ever better ideas as we continue to work on the Journals):\n The Ship in the Lake: Uncover a sunken vessel lying in a potential hotspot to uncover a small fortune\n Bestiary: Poke and provoke the Bush Runner, Tree Kraken, Lozin, Luugiir, Tree Lion, Seedspitter and Miniphant\n SOHO Light Freighter: A heavily armed trader suitable for the worst areas of the Reach - with High Guard rules for Laser Barbettes\n SuSAG: The run down on one of the largest megacorporations in Charted Space\n The ATV: A look at the familiar ATV, with variants both large and small, grav-assisted and aquatic\n A Concise History of the Vilani: Explore how the Vilani rose to prominence\n Burst Lasers: For when you just cannot decide between pulse and beam\n The Dynchia & Girug'kagh: Two fully playable minor alien races\n Remote Piloted Reconnaissance Unit: A perfect device for Travellers who want to see what they will be facing before leaping in with both feet\n Embassy in Arms: Stage an evacuation of an embassy under fire in this adventure\n Within the Two Thousand Worlds: Understand the K'kree before they appear in your campaigns later this year\n Piracy on the Spinward Main: How best to make Credits from 'freelance' trade?\n Vargr Corsairs: And then see how the masters do it\n Assault Rocket Launcher: A brand new weapon with ammunition to resolve any situation\n Simone Garibaldi: A scholar to be met at any starport - but is her latest discovery real?\n Emperors of the Third Imperium: Just who is in charge, and how did they get there?\n Light Patrol Vehicle & APC: Found at many starports, these light vehicles are suitable for policing and light military use alike\nVolumes Two and Three have oodles more articles, including more aliens and animals, more adventures and characters, explorations of Imperial and Zhodani military forces, a revision of the original Exotic Atmospheres Special Supplement, vehicles of the IISS, and much, much more - we will be showcasing the contents of each volume during the Kickstarter process and courting your opinion on the articles!\nThe new Journals of the Travellers' Aid Society come in a 8.5\" x 5.5\" format (a bit bigger than the old 'little black books'), making them easy to have at hand at the gaming table to flip to the articles you are after.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWell, we enjoy talking about Traveller to Traveller fans which, for us, is enough to get everyone involved in the first place.\nHowever, the greater truth is that we are sitting on tons and tons of Traveller source material... and these Journals are the perfect vehicle to get it to you. \nDoing this project via Kickstarter will not only allow us to gauge your opinions and reactions as to the actual contents of the Journals and which articles should be selected for inclusion, but we can link your backing directly to the amount of content - in effect, the more popular this project becomes, the more volumes we will be able to put into the slipcase.\nWe will be starting with three volumes and have already started compiling articles for a fourth.

These will also be received as ebooks (PDF, ebook, and mobi formats), and High Passage backers will be the very first to read the first instalments of a new range of Traveller fiction coming later this year...\n\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill in the gaps of their collections. The Traveller range is starting to grow quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for the Journals to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level.

This is the definition of brainy beer-and-pretzels fun, with plenty of tentacles.\nFunded! \nWrestlenomicon will ship in August 2019 as a boxed set with two decks of 60 tarot-size cards each plus cards for their cultists. Cards for the Attack Track and Ground Zero. Placement cards to help keep track of your deck, cultists, Guts, and discards. Dice. A free bonus card by John Kovalic. And the Wrestlenomicon playmat as a $20 add-on (S&H to be charged later)!\nPLAY\n\nHEY MEDIA PEOPLE! \nGet the quick facts here.\nWelcome to the Brawl of Cthulhu!\nIn Wrestlenomicon, each deck of cards represents a unique Great Old One. The core game includes a deck for CTHULHU\u2014the Ageless Abomination! the South Seas Smasher!\u2014and another for HASTUR, the insane and unspeakable force behind the King in Yellow.

And every deck now comes with 80 cards plus cultists.\nHow to Destroy the World\nHand-to-tentacle combat between Elder Gods demands unique new game mechanics! \nThe game is simple. On most of your turns, you play an attack card. But unlike most games, attack cards don\u2019t take effect right when you play them. This is a battle across time and space, and you see the enemy\u2019s attacks coming long before they hit you. The question is whether you can properly counter-attack\u2014and keep the enemy from slamming you back!\nA card's Position tells you where to put it on the track\nThe Attack Track has six spaces that count down to Ground Zero. On your turn, you place an attack card onto its starting Position on your side of the track. \nPosition 5? Put in in Space 5\nThen you use that attack card\u2019s Momentum to move an attack card you already played onto your track. That brings the previously-played card down the track towards Ground Zero.\nA card's Momentum moves another card closer to Ground Zero\nWhen an attack card reaches Ground Zero\u2014oh yeah. That's when the attack hits. Your attack's damage reduces your foe's Guts. If it's just the right kind of counter-attack, you get a Slam bonus, too. A Bizarre attack slams if your foe's most recent attack was Dominance; Dominance attacks slam Ranged attacks; Ranged attacks slam Viscera attacks; and Viscera attacks slam Bizarre attacks. \nSlam!\nThe fight goes back and forth, round and round, like a Wheel of Slam! \nCombo and Permanent cards add options and weird advantages in the right circumstances. Defense cards make the hits hurt less: play one to reduce an attack's damage.\nA Combo card changes the way an attack works\nPermanent cards change the game long-term\nWhen your foe runs out of Guts, the world is yours!\nMaterials\nThe cards are printed on sturdy 300 gsm blue-core stock, with rounded corners to prevent foxing. They will stand up to plenty of world-ending brawls.  \nAdd-Ons!\nSoft fabric top and non-slip bottom! Add $20 to your pledge to get the 24\" x 24\" playmat\nMobile Wallpapers\nDownload the Putrid Patriarch and the South-Seas Smasher for your phone or tablet!

But while finishing the two-player game, we\u2019ve figured out the rules for three-player or four-player Grand Melees as well as four-player tag-team matches! \nTo play three or four-player from the start, you could buy extra Cthulhu or Hastur decks. Better yet, get a friend or two to back the Kickstarter and push us towards the stretch goals that add new decks for elder gods like Nyarlothatep and Yog-Sothoth!\nWhere the End Began\nWrestlenomicon is a game of the Old Ones battling over the end of the world, developed by Fire Opal Games for Arc Dream Publishing.\nWrestlenomicon was conceived in the stinking mists of pre-history by DENNIS DETWILLER and SHANE IVEY, the creative team from such award-winning Cthulhu Mythos works as Delta Green and The Unspeakable Oath. Shane Ivey has managed Arc Dream Publishing for more than 15 years and, back in the day, helped produce boardgames for Avalanche Press. Dennis Detwiller conceived and wrote the best-selling video game [PROTOTYPE] for Radical Entertainment and Activision, produced high-profile mobile games for Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, and still collects bloated royalty checks for cards he illustrated for Magic: The Gathering.\nDennis and Shane tinkered with Wrestlenomicon for many years before they stumbled across the key to making it perfect: Get ROB HEINSOO to do it! Rob has designed tons of successful card, board, role-playing, and miniatures games. He instantly got what Dennis and Shane were going for in Wrestlenomicon, and instantly threw out all their nonsense and made a brilliant game from scratch. The rules developed by Rob's team at Fire Opal Games brought Wrestlenomicon's fun attacks and combos to life, making them easy to play but charged with interesting tactical options.\n\nWrestlenomicon's cards are painted by KURT KOMODA. An amazing, fast, and\u2014most importantly\u2014reliable artist, Kurt brings the pain whenever called. It's never \"What's an ovipositor?\" or \"Why would Cthulhu shove the Statue of Liberty up Hastur's nose?\" It's just \"How does this look?\" And you know what, it always looks awesome. Always.\nFor the last couple of years, Kurt slashed and burned his way through the Cthulhu and Hastur decks, creating dozens of astonishing illustrations for each of them. Then Rob's team too Kurt's art and Arc Dream's ideas and designed, playtested, designed, playtested, and designed and playtested some more. If you listen, you can still hear the whimpers of their schedules, begging for mercy from afar. \n\nMeanwhile, Dennis and Shane were heads-down in Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game, devoting all their efforts to the new edition of that classic game line. That labor would eventually pay off in the summer 2018 release of the Handler's Guide and the six Ennie Awards given to Delta Green books at Gen Con 2018.\nYou know how much all that acclaim mattered to Rob and Kurt? NOT AT ALL, that's how much. Kurt and Rob sent Arc Dream Publishing a certified letter, flapping out of the night on black wings. It said, and we quote, \"We have heard enough about your award-winning RPG bullsh***! We all have awards, and we don't spend every Kickstarter page bragging about it. It's been f***ing YEARS. It is time for us to GET PAID.\" (We're pretty sure that's how it happened, anyway. Memories are tricky things.)\nSo here we are. Fire Opal is ready. Arc Dream is ready. It's time to punish your foe with Cassilda's Thong and the R'lyeh Shuffle. It's time to gather your Cultists and build up Momentum. It's time to put the hammerlock on your favorite credit card until it squeals.\nIt's time for WRESTLENOMICON!\n\nWho Did This?\nFIRE OPAL GAMES: Rob Heinsoo designed the game mechanics and card set. Sean McCarthy handled development. Lisa Eschenbach was the key playtester. Marie Poole helped Arc Dream plan things and gave valuable advice, and ran tons of Gen Con 2018 demo games. Brittanie Boe of Be Bold Games helped plan and promote Wrestlenomicon, and produced introductory and how-to-play videos with Rob Heinsoo.\nARC DREAM PUBLISHING: Dennis Detwiller and Shane Ivey conceived Wrestlenomicon, wrote all the card titles, oversaw production, and will publish the game. Kurt Komoda painted the cards. Simeon Cogswell designed the cards. Adam Jury-Last laid out prototype decks in time for Gen Con 2018. Rachel Ivey produced preview videos. Jonathan Ivey narrated them. Jake Cook, David LaRocca, and Heath Robinson played Wrestlenomicon with Shane Ivey in the videos. The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets provided bad-ass music.\nCTHULHU AND HASTUR MYTHOS: H.P. Lovecraft and Robert W. Chambers created the mythology that we're pillaging, and may rise from death for unwholesome revenge when they see what we have done to their works.\nBack WRESTLENOMICON now! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHE CORE GAME: The most time-consuming work for WRESTLENOMICON has already been done\u2014we worked on it for years before bringing it to Kickstarter. The decks for Cthulhu and Hastur have been fully laid out. Before we go to press, the Fire Opal Games team will review everything and make any last changes that come up. We'll lay out the final rules, only a few pages long, and the deck boxes. Those will not take much time. We are working with manufacturers who have done great work for us before and who can handle anything we come up with, so we have no reason to expect any delays on that end.\n\nSTRETCH GOALS: Stretch goals will come out as they are completed. We will announce their schedules along the way as each comes nearer to shipping.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING AND HANDLING: Veteran Kickstarter backers know what a bugbear shipping charges can be. We will not charge backers for shipping and handling up front. Instead, we will charge for individual rewards as they are ready to ship, using a management program like Pledge Manager or BackerKit. We anticipate (knock on wood) that delivery of the core game will cost about $10 in the U.S. and U.K., $20 elsewhere in the E.U. and Canada, and $30 to $40 elsewhere. But international postage changes often, so we cannot promise firm shipping rates until the time comes.

Only after a couple of weeks of confusing back-and-forth emails did I determine that this was not happening here. So I reached out to a shipping service that has handled past deliveries. I connected them with the printer. I thought everything was squared away. Then after a week or two I checked in to confirm the shipment was on its way. Nope. The printer needed a third company, someone local, to pick the pallets up from the print plant and deliver it to the docks. I scrambled to figure that out.

You'll also see new settlement sections for Rybalka, Embla, Stoneholme, Vethin's Hold, Jorumgard, Fungi Forest, the drow city of Holoth, and tons of brand-new content we hope to unlock via stretch goals!\nRise of the Drow: Collector\u2019s Edition contains revised, updated, and all-new content for the adventure and setting. The same expanded and updated content is included in both the D&D 5E and Pathfinder RPG versions of the Collector\u2019s Edition, both PDF and print.\nThe D&D 5E Hardcover pledge level available to backers is funding a high-quality offset print run of the 5E version of the book. This is the first time that Rise of the Drow content has ever been available for 5th Edition.\nWith a limited number of Pathfinder RPG backers, we can't justify an offset print run but we don't want to leave our longtime Pathfinder friends in the dark, so we've figured out a way to do a Print-on-Demand version which will be available for PDF backers at cost + S&H from DriveThruRPG.com.\nThe Underworld, or Underdark if you prefer, is a dark and dangerous place inspired by Norse mythology and popularized by the late, great E. Gary Gygax, authors Ed Greenwood, R.A. Salvatore, and many others.  \nA twisted and dark place with a myriad of cultures and creatures, the Underworld is an entire world buried below the surface and hidden from the light of day. Deep caves and dark passages wind and honeycomb throughout the earth, distinctly unique races plot against each other and unknown horrors slog about looking for an easy meal.\nPlease see information about Shipping & Handling of physical add-on items in this update post. \nIf you pledged for the 5E print book, there is no additional S&H for physical add-on items (including overseas backers). \nIf you pledged at a PDF level and are shipping domestically, then there will be additional S&H added for physical add-on items. \nPhysical add-on items are not available for international backers at the PDF pledge levels. \nTo include an add-on item as part of your pledge, do the following steps:\n1. Click on the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button.\n2. Click the \u201cChange Your Pledge\u201d button.\n3. Adjust the amount of your pledge by adding the funds to cover the cost of the add-on item you want to include.\n4. Click on the \"Continue\" button after adding funds, and then click the \u201cConfirm\u201d button.\nThat\u2019s all you need to do!

The Underworld is on the verge of war and while some begin to take sides to survive, others watch cautiously from the shadows, waiting for opportunity to come to them.  \nTo participate in Clash of the Factions and help determine the outcome of the great Underworld War (and increase the number of dice in your favorite faction's set), private message AAW Games here on Kickstarter and let us know you'd like to sign up!\nRise of the Drow: Collector's Edition is dedicated to Joshua Gullion\nJoshua Gullion was a core member of the AAW Games team who sadly  passed away soon after receiving the printed hardcover versions of the  original Rise of the Drow, the culmination of his life's work.  Joshua entered the RPG industry with zero experience and left this world  a pivotal person, both in the industry and in our lives. Joshua was the  kind of person who was there to listen when you needed to vent and  there to give you an earful or a kick in the ass when required.\nJoshua was instrumental in everything AAW Games has done, past and  present. Sometimes when the days were dark and I didn't know if I could  do it, Joshua was there to give me the gruff reality check I needed and  just like Gandalf, when doubt arose, he gave us that extra little nudge  out the door.\n-Jonathan G. Nelson, Owner/Publisher of AAW Games\nRise of the Drow was initially inspired by David C. Sutherland III's incredible hand-drawn profile-view cartography from the Dungeoneer's Survival Guide.  Our cartographers Todd Gamble, Tommi Salama, and Sean MacDonald have  spent hundreds if not thousands of hours combined; crafting, refining,  and re-refining maps to perfection. You'll find over a hundred maps  within Rise of the Drow, each distinctly different and  inspiring alongside beautiful artwork by Bryan Syme, Mates Laurentiu,  and dozens of other top-notch artists, you also get the award-winning,  5-star + seal of approval writing of Stephen Yeardley and Jonathan G.  Nelson. This tome is the holy grail of Underworld adventures, second to  none. \nDavid produced much of the art and cartography for the original  incarnations of Dungeons & Dragons and was disregarded by most of  the industry when technology came into the mix. Sadly, one of the greats  was let go simply because he didn't use computers and Photoshop. This  is a reminder to us all to respect our elders, for they have carried the  torch all this way, and it is our responsibility to learn all we can  before we heft the weight of this ancient torch and use it to illuminate  the wonders and horrors of the great Underworld hidden below \nRise of the Drow was written by Stephen Yeardley & Jonathan G. Nelson with contributions from Ed Greenwood, Owen K.C. Stephens, Jen Page, Satine Phoenix, Brian Syme, Tommi Salama, Sean MacDonald, Mates Laurentiu, Brian Berg, Christina Stiles, Jason Stoffa, Joshua Gullion, Kevin Mickelson, Mike Myler, Rick Hershey, Will Myers, and Justin Andrew Mason.\nThis project is being shipped by Card Kingdom / Mox Boarding House in Ballard Seattle, WA in the USA to backers worldwide.

This file is still a work in progress and subject to change.\nYour hardboiled detective visits Locations in New Orleans' three neighborhoods, tracking down clues, while trying to prevent other detectives from beating them to the punch. The first gumshoe to come up with a Suspect, Motive, and Evidence can make their accusation and solve the crime. \nCharacters visit the various Locations in New Orleans to search for clues.\nAt each Location you must overcome an encounter, ranging from simple obstacles to the Big Easy's most fearsome adversaries. The other detectives have the opportunity to meddle in your affairs and make life difficult for you. \nWhen I arrived at the scene, it was clear that there weren't going to be any clues left here.\nEach turn is broken into 5 phases which you complete before play passes to the next detective to the left.  \nAt the start of your turn, draw enough Gumshoe cards to fill your hand to its maximum hand size. Your hand size is six, unless modified by some other card.  \nIn the Legwork Phase you can play cards to equip your detective for the coming investigation, add Locations to the Neighborhoods in play, and play Legwork cards to give yourself an advantage later in the round.  \nLocations must be played adjacent to the neighborhood they belong to.\nEach detective can equip up to three equip cards, one of each type: Device, Weapon, and Getup.\nIn the Move Phase, your detective can travel between neighborhoods, or from one neighborhood to an attached Location at that same neighborhood. \nIt takes two moves for Jean to visit Congo Square: one to go Downtown, then on to his destination.\nWhen you arrive at a new destination, you reveal the top card of the encounter deck, and must face whatever challenge you find there in the Investigate Phase.   \nWalter arrives at the cemetery and must face an encounter with the Walkin' Dead!\nIn the Investigate Phase, if your detective overcame the encounter at the new location, he or she may Investigate the scene to reveal a clue. \nTo succeed, your detective must equal or beat the Target Number of the Location by discarding a card with sufficient Value. The card's base value is modified by each icon it has that matches those on the Location.    \nYou gain a +1 bonus for each matching icon.\nIf the gumshoe is successful, you draw a Clue card of the type shown on the Location card (a suspect, in the image above). The Clues you collect are added to your Case File alongside your character card.  \nAt the end of your turn, you must discard any cards in excess of your maximum hand size. You can choose to discard as many other cards as you want to. \nThe game continues until one player is able to collect one Suspect, one Motive, and one Evidence clue in their Case File. When you have the clues you need, you can make your accusation. Reveal the clues you are using to solve the case and describe how they fit together to resolve the mystery.   \nTony Marcello committed the crime in a fit of jealousy.

Like their divine patron, the Lunars are puissant shapeshifters, devouring the forms of their human and animal prey and making these a part of their own nature. The Lunar Exalted are creatures of boundaries and transgression \u2014 the boundaries between hero and monster, between devil and saint, between civilization and wilderness, between the mortal world and the divine. They stand on whichever side of the boundaries they please, and cross between them with unmatched ease. A Lunar who embraces the power and freedom of becoming an untamed monster need not sacrifice her humanity; a Lunar who devotes herself to living among mortals and protecting them need not abandon the freedom of running wild and untamed.\nIn the Divine Revolution, the Lunars were monsters that even the most nightmarish among the enemies of the gods learned to fear. They waged war in the shapes of snakes as long as rivers, all-devouring swarms bearing devil-slaying plagues, beast-mothers with tusks like daiklaives and stampedes of murderous children, and countless other wild horrors. Fighting alongside the Solar and Sidereal Exalted, and with Dragon-Blooded armies, they toppled the makers of the universe and stained their fangs red with the blood of slain divinities.\nAs the First Age\u2019s glories arose from the Exalted\u2019s triumph, the Lunars enjoyed the fruit of the paradise they\u2019d helped to win, and transformed themselves into the Lunar Exalted of an Age of Dreams. Though never forsaking the divine monstrosity at the heart of their Essence, they became guardians, guides, world-walkers, judges, and mystics.\nThe Usurpation brought an end to the First Age and a new transformation for the Lunar Exalted, the change that made them what they are today. The mass death of the Solar Exalted, and the foul murder of Lunars who fought beside their Solar mates or were deemed too dangerous to the usurpers\u2019 plans to let live, awoke a keening fury in the souls of the Lunar host, a rage that had not been witnessed in Creation since the Lunars first hunted the enemies of the gods. The first Wyld Hunts perpetrated by the nascent Dragon-Blooded Shogunate and its Sidereal benefactors solidified the Lunars\u2019 vendetta, ensuring that the usurpers would never know peace so long as one Lunar yet drew breath.\nLunars: Fangs at the Gate is a core expansion for the Exalted tabletop roleplaying game. Exalted 3rd Edition is set in a mythic world where spirits walk openly among men, warring demigods topple kingdoms, and the restless dead roam on moonless nights. Heroes granted power by the mightiest gods war and intrigue against one another for the fate of Creation. These are the Exalted!\nLunars: Fangs at the Gate introduces the Lunar Exalted into their 3rd Edition incarnation and includes all the rules necessary to feature them as player characters or NPC antagonists, including character-creation rules and the Lunar Charm set of powers. This book will give an iconic view of the Lunars, from their mythic origins as the apex predators of Creation to their struggles at the boundaries in the current era. It features details of The Silver Pact, as well as detailing Threshold and other locales where Lunar bands are prominent. Overall, it will focus on the legend of the Lunars, the transformations they've made, and lines they've crossed to take back Creation.\nThe Exalted 3rd Edition rulebook is required to make full use of the rules and options presented in Lunars: Fangs at the Gate. \nWith your help, we will work to create a deluxe hardcover edition of Lunars: Fangs at the Gate, featuring a blue leatherette hardcover with 300+ full-color, silver-edged interior pages and a silver-white silk ribbon bookmark. The front cover will be blue/silver foil embossed with \u201cLunars\u201d written in Old Realm script, and the spine will be foil-stamped. This book will be a perfect companion to the deluxe editions of the Exalted 3rd Edition rulebook and Dragon-Blooded: What Fire Has Wrought.\nLunars: Fangs at the Gate features all of the rules options necessary to create and play a Lunar character within the Exalted 3rd Edition roleplaying world. In addition to introducing new mechanics and Charms, this supplement also includes invocations of moonsilver tattoos, sorcery of the ever-hiding moon, information on The Silver Pact and its factions, and detailed write-ups of prominent Lunar NPCs. The final book will contain the following chapters:\nChapter One: The Lunar Exalted\nChapter Two: The Silver Pact\nChapter Three: Lunar Dominions\nChapter Four: Character Creation   \nChapter Five: Traits \nChapter Six: Charms \nChapter Seven: Martial Arts and Sorcery \nChapter Eight: Artifacts of Luna's Chosen\nChapter Nine: Heroes and Monsters\nDuring the course of this Kickstarter campaign, the ENTIRE, COMPLETED manuscript for Fangs at the Gate will be shared with backers through backers-only updates posted throughout the campaign.\nThe manuscript is written, awesome artists have been contracted, and layout templates are being built. An amazing digital PDF product will be created with this material. With your help we will be able to take it a step further and produce a deluxe hardcover version of Lunars: Fangs at the Gate for Exalted fans and collectors. The main goal and primary focus of this Kickstarter campaign is the creation of this limited-edition book.\nBeyond that, we hope to illuminate the world of the Lunars even further, by adding (and expanding) new topics that will be included in the Lunars companion, Many-Faced Strangers, a rules and options expansion for Fangs at the Gate that will be built via Stretch Goal achievements during this campaign.\nFinally, and no less important \u2013 we want to continue to acknowledge and cultivate the passionate and creative community that exists around the Exalted 3rd edition game.  Tabletop roleplaying games have always been about community, sharing stories, and celebrating imagination. Our shared enthusiasm brings us together, and when you back this project, you continue with us on this journey and keep the world of Exalted growing and transforming.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($60,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn exchange for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged.\nYour chosen Reward Tier lists the rewards that you will receive should this project fund. Reward Tiers are not cumulative - each Reward Tier is a distinct list of rewards based on a base pledge amount, though they can be modified with add-ons and other options (detailed below). It's important that you select the Reward Tier that best reflects your desired rewards and pledge amount.\nPlease note that rewards that include physical goods (such as the deluxe books) may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to load the complete reward tier chart\nTo help simplify matters, the basic reward chart lists the core reward (stay digital with just the PDF, or jump in on the deluxe hardcover) and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below). \nClick here to load a larger version of the complete reward tier chart\nBeyond the standard combination of rewards presented, there are also limited options available that allow some specially customized interaction with the world of the Lunar Exalted. From naming characters included in the world, deciding which animals have Quick Character-style write-ups, having custom Charms or Artifacts specifically designed for you, to having your character featured as part of the interior artwork or even on the cover of The Lunars Companion: Many-Faced Strangers, these limited rewards provide unique opportunities.\nClick to load the complete reward tier chart.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Moon-and-Sun Partnership and Honored Shahan-Ya Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!)\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this deluxe version of Lunars: Fangs at the Gate, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (\"Patron of the Thousand Fangs Army\") will get 5 copies of the deluxe hardcover book, at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nBy selecting a specific Reward Tier, you are confirming to pledge the minimum amount (or more) in hopes of the project achieving its funding target and receiving the rewards listed. You can also add additional rewards to your overall reward list via Add Ons - simply increase your total pledge amount by the amount listed for each Add On you wish to receive (see the Add On section below), and after the campaign concludes, you will be able to confirm which Add On rewards you'd like via a BackerKit Survey. \nYour Total Pledge Amount will be the sum of your chosen Reward Tier plus any shipping fees plus any Add Ons that you've manually included. To reiterate, your Total Pledge Amount is not the same as your Reward Tier, as it may include shipping charges and Add On rewards. Your Reward Tier selected (plus any Add Ons chosen) is what determines your final reward allocation.\nMANUSCRIPT PREVIEWS \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Lunars: Fangs at the Gate. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates once per week. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nLUNARS: MANY-FACED STRANGERS \u2013 A PDF of supplemental rules and extra material for the Lunars of Exalted.

To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Lunars: Fangs at the Gate is finished, initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise dramatically the past few years, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges for shipments outside the US - both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "CASTELESS", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.

We\u2019re running this campaign to fund the development of the Interface Zero 3.0 core rules, the GM's Guide to 2095, the introductory adventure, and a host of cool add-ons such as a 3-panel Game Master's screen, an action deck, bennies, and much more! \n  Interface Zero 3.0 is a cyberpunk setting\u2026 Sort of. Interface Zero 3.0 is inspired by a plethora of sources including novels such as Neuromancer, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Burning Chrome, Count Zero, Altered Carbon, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Snow Crash.\nAnime such as Akira, Cowboy Bebop, Psycho Pass, Ghost in the Shell, Alita: Battle Angel and Appleseed help to round out a vision of our world, incorporating eastern and western influences on the genre. The result is a setting that echoes other popular cyberpunk games in that it holds tight to the flavor of a world where megacorporations have enormous wealth and influence with little regard for the masses or the world in which they live. It diverges slightly in that Interface Zero tends to focus more on geopolitical action and intrigue as ways to bring in dystopian elements and really hammer home the idea that the world your characters live in is in need of change. The question is, will you work towards change, or will you stand idly by and watch the world burn?\nIn Interface Zero 3.0, you might play as genetically modified humans,  vat-grown simulacra, or even a psion, more commonly known as a zeek. You'll be able to embrace a variety of concepts firmly rooted in the cyberpunk genre, but geared towards the setting.  You'll be able to play razor boys and razor girls, gearheads who use their drones for tactical dominance of the battlefield, hyper reality hackers and network crackers, combat medics, lone wolf assassins, cybermonks, and many more concepts common to our setting!\n  In the five years since Interface Zero 2.0 was released, we\u2019ve received a bunch of feedback from you regarding almost every aspect of the book about everything from races and gear to edges, hacking, drones\u2026I could go on. Though at times it may not seem like it, I\u2019ve listened to all of the feedback and we(the development team) are incorporating it into this new design. \nIn Interface Zero 3.0 you\u2019ll find:\nUpdated Races, including 2nd generation Hybrids and a Psion\nCompletely overhauled rules for hacking and drones\nCampaign Themes that help you dial in on the type of cyberpunk game you wish to run and play\nMore City Trappings\nCorporate Trappings for gear and equipment\nNew bio-horrors and more threats\nA lighter approach towards gear, but improved customization options\nA broad view of the world and solar system as it exists in 2095\nA bunch of Savage Tales to get you started\n In the GM\u2019s Guide to 2095 you\u2019ll find:\nA more detailed look at the Interface Zero setting\nSavage Tales for each region of the world\nInformation on major corporations, governments and the people who run them\n3 Plot Point Campaigns based on campaign themes\nNew Threats\nSecrets for the GM\u2019s eyes only\nGuidelines  for effectively using SWADE's rules for networking, contacts and much more \n  Some of you might have heard that Interface Zero is getting something of a reboot. That's partially true, and it's only natural for you to wonder if the new edition is going to make your old sourcebooks obsolete.\nWe are taking Interface Zero in a new direction, definitely. In the third edition, you'll see changes, some of them really big, but none of these changes will make any of your sourcebooks or the lore in the Interface Zero 2.0 book obsolete. In fact all of that lore is essential to better understand why many of the changes coming to the world are being made. \nI've been wanting to get back to a setting that feels more hard-core cyberpunk and less science-fantasy.  One of those ways is to get the world (primarily the United States) moving in a certain direction...down. The reunification of the United States begins in late 2090 with what is known as the reunification war. It's a short-lived, but bloody conflict primarily between the North American Coalition, the United Combine, Atlantica, and the Republic of Texas. To make a long story short; The North American Coalition wins the war, successfully reuniting the lower 48 states under a new banner: The Reformed United States.\nI won't go into all the specifics here, but the ramifications of the Reclamation War are vast, and much of the new setting addresses these issues. It's going to be a fun ride, though, and I hope you come along with me!  \n  To give you an idea of the deals we have planned for backers of this kickstarter, I'm listing the retail costs for the three core products. As you can see, your total costs get much cheaper for you the higher you pledge.  \nIf you want to grab all of the bells and whistles without worrying about how much each individual add-on is going to cost you after the campaign, going with the Southland Ganger pledge gets you everything and ends up being the best value for your money.\nIf you just want the books in print, stick with the Gearhead pledge, and wait until after the kickstarter ends to grab extras like bennies, the gm screen, action deck and the way of the gun deck as add-ons. This will be handled through Backerkit at the end of the campaign.\n Interface Zero 3.0 will be a full color, hard cover graphic novel-sized book approximately 210 pages in length. The book will retail for $35.99 in print, and $19.99 in PDF.\n The GM's Guide to 2095 will be a full color, soft cover graphic novel-sized book approximately 128 pages in length. The book will retail for $24.99 in print, and $11.99 in PDF.\n The Introductory Adventure will be a full color, soft cover graphic novel-sized book approximately 48 pages in length. It will retail for $9.99 in print, and $5.99 in PDF.\n  I've found that it's much easier to do add-ons at the end of the kickstarter rather than have a ton of pledges that slowly build on the content until you eventually get everything. As mentioned above, if you do want everything, and don't wish to mess with all the extra financial calculations, you should select the Southland Ganger pledge.\nIf you'd rather just pick and choose which add-ons to get, here is a list and their costs. You can either add the dollar amount to your pledge upfront, or you can simply wait until after the kickstarter and purchase them via pledge manager. I recommend waiting. Some people have gone all in-and later decided that they didn't want certain things, and that can cause complications, as the credit cards have already been charged. In any case, here is what we are offering!\n Bennies: $15.00  (A pack of 25 bennies)\n Action Deck: $15.00 (52 Card Action Deck)\n Way of the Gun Deck: $15.00 (52 card cyberpunk-themed Adventure Deck)\n 3 Panel GM screen:  $20.00 (A sturdy Graphic Novel size)\n Wild Die (5): $5.00 A set of 5 custom Wild Dice.\n Additional physical copy of Interface Zero 3.0 (Offset printing): $30.00 (6 dollars below retail)\n Additional physical copy of the GM's Guide to 2095 (Offset Printing): $20.00 (5 dollars below retail)\n We have a bunch of stretch goals lined up for this kickstarter. Some, like maps and tokens are designed for VTT (Virtual Table Top) platforms, but can also be printed out for use at your game table. Others include  regional setting books, HOT SPOT guides to specific cities or other locations of note, adventures, character folios, and much more.  \nAll of these stretch goals are going to be delivered in PDFs or downloadable files. These books won't be going through a traditional print run. Now that said, we will be giving all backers vouchers to get them in Print On Demand for every POD product we unlock! This saves both you and I tons of headaches dealing with shipping costs, delayed shipping dates, and things of that nature.\n[UNLOCKED!] $33,000:Malmart Catalog 4 VTT Tokens and a New Savage Tale: If we reach this stretch goal, we\u2019ll wrap up the malmart catalog and do some VTT Tokens and a brand new Savage Tale! The Malmart Catalog is a 96 page supplement that gives you more goodies to choose from when outfitting your characters. More cybernetics, vehicles, weapons, and tech to enhance your game! Much of this book has already been written, but we need to convert to the SWADE rules, do layout, run it through editing, and order artwork.\n[UNLOCKED!] $43,000: The Europe/Russia/China Source book: If we reach this stretch goal, we\u2019ll wrap up the Europe/Russia/China source book and do some more VTT Tokens for Online platforms like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds! We\u2019ll also do a brand new Savage Tale! We\u2019ll wrap up this 128 page supplement and give you everything you need to know about the war between China and Russia, and the fractured nations of Europe. The manuscript has been written, but it needs heavy editing and rewrites to update it to 2095, artwork, and conversion to SWADE rules. \n[UNLOCKED!]$53,000: The Zero\u2019s guide to the Solar System: Another book that is in development, the Zero\u2019s Guide to the Solar System needs more writing, artwork, editing, and conversion to SWADE. This book will be an estimated 128 pages in length. If we reach this stretch goal, we\u2019ll wrap up the sourcebook and do some more VTT Tokens, a brand new Savage Tale, and digital maps for Online platforms like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds!\n[UNLOCKED!]$63,000: Interface Zero: Dark Pathways (working title): An 96 -128 page alternate setting book, Dark Pathways gives you everything you need to know about introducing fantasy and horror elements to 2095! If you\u2019ve seen movies like Aliens, Bright, or The Matrix, you\u2019ll have a good idea of what we plan on doing here. The book will come with a sample setting, new gear, edges, and much more! We\u2019ll also do more VTT gaming maps, and more Savage Tales!\n $70,000: Corporate Profiles: This 32 page supplement marks a new line for Interface Zero. In These supplements, we\u2019ll discuss various megacorporations as they exist in 2095. \n  Print on Demand vouchers allow you to purchase the book at cost plus shipping to your home. This means that if it costs me 4 dollars to make the book, that's what you pay, in addition to the shipping costs. I don't collect any revenue off of POD books. This is simply a way to help you save some money if you wish to have everything in print.\nFor estimated shipping costs for Print of Demand products by page count, check their website here.  All of the sourcebooks, guides, etc. will be printed in softcover  and will range from 18 pages to 128 pages in length, depending on the content.\nHow does it work?\nOnce I put a product on sale in Print on Demand, I send you an email with your Voucher, which is essentially a coupon. It comes in the form of a URL linking to the product. You click on the link, and it automatically adjusts the price to my cost to print the book. Then, you simply check out like you would any other time you purchase a product. Shipping is then added to the total. At that point, you complete the transaction and your done!\nNOTE:  The Interface Zero Core rule book will only be available in softcover as a Print on Demand Product. This is because the size of the book has to change if we print it with Hard Cover, which would require an entirely different layout.\nHere is a graphic that shows the estimated printing costs for POD  products I'll be offering in this kickstarter.  \nWhat's the difference between Print on Demand and Traditional Offset Printing?\nPrint on Demand (POD) books are made using a digital printer that uses inkjet printing rather than traditional offset. It\u2019s a quicker, cheaper way to print books, because you don\u2019t have to order larger bulk runs (usually 1000 copies or more). With POD, books are \u201cmade to order;\u201d you can order a single book or multiple books at one time.\nThe main difference is quality. While Print on Demand has come a long way, it\u2019s still not as good as offset printing. Binding is perfect bound for softcover, and case-bound for hardcover, though I\u2019ve printed hardcover POD books in the past that don\u2019t hold up well for long. The softcover POD books tend to do much better over the long run. The pages tend to feel rough. Sometimes images can be grainy, or bleed through; it just depends on whether or not the specs are right. Hardcovers don't have customization options. They are all done in standard glossy format.\nOverall, the quality is good enough that I'm happy using them, but not for large print runs designed to go into distribution to games stores world-wide. For that, I go with offset printing.\nWith offset printing, the color really jumps off the page. It feels better to the touch. I generally use semi-gloss paper for my books, at 80lb. weight to ensure you get the best book possible. Binding is much better, especially for Hardcover books. With offset, I can do stuff like put custom end pages, choose stronger binding, and change the type of hardcover style, which can really improve the book as a whole. The only downside is that it takes longer to get the books. Any book by a major publishing company (Like Pinnacle Entertainment Group, Wizards of the Coast, Paizo Publishing, etc.) that you find in your local game store is probably done with offset printing.\nHere are the Shipping Costs for all orders for books shipped directly from our warehouse in the United States, as well as overseas partners.\n Our plan is to deliver the PDF and have the book ready to go to the printer in June, 2019. After that, printing will take approximately 8 to 12 weeks, so we should be getting them right at the end of August, 2019. Once we get the books in our warehouse, we'll start shipping them to you, along with any other physical rewards you ordered.\nI want to stress that sometimes things can go sideways. While I don't foresee any issues, I can tell you that I've had problems in the past that were completely out of my control, and affected the timeline to print. I should also stress that I want to make sure you get the absolute best quality books I can produce, and regardless of whether or not we're talking about artwork, or a second or third edit of content, I will not print a book until I'm happy with it.\nAll of our digital and Print on Demand titles will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'd like to stress upfront that this project is not a pre-order. My team and I are working on the project as we speak, and this will get finished and released. You have my word on that, but as someone who has been publishing role-playing game supplements since 2005, I can attest to the fact that things don't always go as planned. \n\nWriters and artists pull out of projects, or turn in manuscripts and illustrations late. Editing and revisions sometimes take longer than anticipated. The proofs for books come back from the printer with errors that need to be fixed. These things can happen. It's a part of the publishing business. But I've been around the block, and I know that a large part of dealing with issues like the ones I mentioned above is communication.\n\nI have regular conversations with everyone involved in this process to ensure that I know things are progressing the way they should be, and if they aren't, I roll up my sleeves and work with my team to find the best solution to a problem before it gets out of hand.\n\nAs a backer, you'll receive regular status reports from me about this project.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Can Gallant Knight Games handle this project? \nThis is Gallant Knight Games's twelfth Kickstarter, and we learned a lot from the first eleven. We've got an exceptional track record. Note: we have two projects that are not out to backers yet, but they are on track (digital rewards are already out) and this project will not impact the others. This is a straight-forward project with some nuances, but we're prepared to handle them, and we're shooting for the same exceptional success we've already had!\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished? \nA: The draft text of all the rules is 100% done. All the art that isn't tied to stretch goals is in and done. The only text we're waiting on is the \"micro-verses\" and our stretch goals, and as we depend on the backers to determine what needs to be written, those will come throughout and after the Kickstarter.\n\nQ: What if the complexity of the project overwhelms GKG? \nA: We have straight-forward pledge levels to make it easy to manage, and we've budgeted our stretch goals up to our cap. In order to keep the project manageable for our small team, we've worked hard minimize our stretch goals to tasks we can handle.\n\nQ: What about delays in art? \nA: We've already contracted and finished the core art for the game. Isn't it great? We're really happy with our artists. We've got some stretch goals for more art, but our artists are professionals. If there's a delay on the art, we have back-up artists we've already done test runs with, and who we are ready to work with.\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs? \nA: Shipping costs constantly rise, and while we've projected them to the best of our abilities, there's not a lot we can do if they change. However, due to the limitations on the size of our product, we're confident this won't be an issue.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals? \nA: If something were to happen to Alan, or another writer on the project, we've identified our backups, and our team is spread all over the world. It'd take a really big asteroid, zombie apocalypse or alien invasion to wipe us all out. The files and plans have been communicated to the whole team, and a new project lead (who has been identified) will step up.\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE* \nWe hold rewards for a year from fulfillment start date before we can no longer promise that we'll be able to fulfill your rewards.

Once we start shipping, if your reward gets returned, or your fulfillment info wasn't provided, we'll give you a full calendar year and ship that reward for you.

A storm was coming from the sea, bringing with it the smell of wet grass. A soft smile curled her lips. It was a good day for a hunt.  \nThese are hard, trying times. \nYou can feel the tension in the air, nobody feels safe anymore. War is stirring up once again on the continent. The last couple of years have been tough on Alliance of the Great Cities. The loss of trust and faith between folk, the rise of corruption among the Vasalli, and the Vargan incursions have all taken a toll. \nStill, life goes on in Salvora. The seat of the Alliance is to be moved to Liboria, the Jewel of the Sea, in the southeastern region of the continent. Liboria is a fascinating territory with towering mountains, wild rivers, and an unforgiving sea. It is home to illustrious characters, mighty leaders, and dangerous enemies. It\u2019s a wild place full of mysteries, hidden locations, and treacherous roads.  \nThe Liborian Saga is a campaign book for the Awaken game which will explore the stories in this territory, and everything it offers, across both land and sea. Expect extensive adventures spanning throughout the three Great Cities as well as in numerous smaller locations. \nAwaken is a dark fantasy role-playing game (RPG) where you play as one of the Vasalli, a group of people who have undergone an unusual change that\u2019s given them powers. You live in a war-ravaged world, where the Great Cities fight for supremacy and leadership over the Alliance: a loose political association holding together the territories of Salvora.\n\nHere is Logician Tim with his first impressions and intro to Awaken, be sure to check it out if you want to see what Awaken is all about!\nDuring the last days of this campaign, Tim will be having the in-depth review of Awaken every day at 5 PM \u2013 6 PM CST until Thursday 21st. \nCheck it out on Misfits of Tabletop facebook group! \nIf you already own an Awaken: Core Rulebook, but a higher pledge level\u2019s goodies have caught your eye, you can opt to choose a $30 bonus instead of the original Awaken book. This bonus can go toward the shipping cost or an extra add-on of your choosing. \nAfter the campaign ends, once we start collecting backer\u2019s information, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to notify us of your choice! \nIf you are a newcomer to Awaken, check out the Tim's video or download the 52-page Quickstart Edition, give it a try and then find the Acolyte or The Salvoran pledges designed for you!\nIn the meantime, hear what others have to say about Awaken\nThe Liborian Saga will include: \n Extended Regional Lore \u2014 Players and Narrators can expect to get a ton of new information about the Great Cities of the region: Jorgun, Rinean, and Liboria, and their domains. This will include detailed maps, histories, locations of interest, and story hooks. Explore the wilderness outside of the city walls, but don\u2019t forget to stick to the road! \n More Antagonists & Monsters \u2014 A fan favorite! We\u2019ve got you covered with expanded options for antagonists, as well as new bigger and badder creatures who can be found in certain places or all over the continent. From the heart of the mountains to the depths of the seas, the monsters are here! \n Regional Orders \u2014 Although they share the same philosophy, the same Orders can differ from city to city. Additionally, every city and region contains smaller cults which are usually radically opposed to the establishment. \n Superior Gifts, Rituals, & Expanded Rules \u2014 Tightly connected to the regional Orders, Gifts are evolving constantly. We\u2019ve included rules that will allow players to create their own Superior Gifts. A flying dagger can be handy, but it isn\u2019t nearly as good as a flying dagger that\u2019s on fire! \n Expanded Items and Weaponry \u2014 Salvora is a vast continent that\u2019s filled with people from all walks of life, so it\u2019s only natural that players should have access to a more varied selection of items and weapons to use throughout their adventures. \n \u201cThe Death Cycle\u201d \u2014 A spree of brutal murders has struck Liboria. Numerous bodies have washed ashore, each covered in similar marks. It seems like the victims were killed in the same way. Is this the work of one serial murderer? Or are more sinister forces involved? This large adventure will take you through the three Great Cities of the region and showcase much of the information presented in the book. \nThe Awaken game system was designed from scratch and tailor-made to bring out the strengths of role-playing without the burden of the complicated mechanics that most role-playing games are built upon.\n The game emphasizes player interaction, has an immersive feel to it, and is filled with compelling narration.\n Fast, fluid, and intuitive rules: We\u2019ve designed Awaken for new and experienced RPG players alike.\n We only use common six-sided dice, making it easy for anyone to play Awaken. \n Character creation is quick and simple: The player has full freedom in choosing and mixing their skills, attributes, and Gifts (the special powers of the Vasalli).\n The character development is skill-based and depends completely on how the player uses their abilities, not on how the dice land.\n Picture Rule: For particularly creative descriptions, the player is rewarded with bonus dice or automatic successes.  \nThe Liborian Saga \nA 140+ page full-color, softcover, perfectly bound handbook to explore the Liborian region. This book is packed with information about the large southeast region where gold shines brighter and shadows are darker. It also includes an epic adventure that takes place in this immersive region \u2026 the start of The Liborian Saga.\nAwaken: Core Rulebook \nThe original hardcover Awaken: Core Rulebook, with 220 full-color pages, is packed with all the information needed to play the game. Discover what Awaken is all about. \nAwaken Narrator Screen\nA tough and durable four panel Narrator screen, with all the important stats and tables, is perfect for hidden rolls and to use as a barricade for your Narrator\u2019s materials.   \nAdd-ons are additional items that you can add to your reward level if they're not included by simply increasing your pledge by the appropriate amount for each extra item that you would like to receive. \nAfter the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money that you pledged and what you would like it to be used for. Be aware that some of these add-ons will only be available through this campaign. If you want any of the add-ons (and they aren\u2019t included in your selected pledge tier) then be sure to add them to your pledge!\nRewards are susceptible to changes. Artworks and design can improve and so can the final look of the items.\nShipping is often the downfall of even the most thought-out campaigns. In light of this, we\u2019ll be able to offer free shipping for US-based backers, but we\u2019ll be trying to cut the shipping rates for other countries as much as we can!\nWe will be charging for shipping through the pledge manager after the Kickstarter campaign ends based on the actual cost for shipping. We don\u2019t know exactly how much shipping will cost\u2014shipping rates can change quickly and vary dramatically depending on destination, shipping method, and how many rewards you\u2019re getting. However, we hope to gain some efficiencies that will save us\u2014and eventually you\u2014money. \nShipping prices are estimated as follows:\nUS: Free\nCanada: $8 \u2013 $15\nEU: $8 \u2013 $15\nRest of the world: $12 \u2013 $20 \nWe want to charge as little as possible, so thanks to fulfillment centers, backers in the EU won\u2019t pay any customs or VAT on their shipments!\nOnce again, The Games Collective stands behind the Awakengame, but this time we have reinforcements in the form of additional writers.\nThe Games Collective is an RPG design team founded by Marko Matijevi\u0107 Sekul and Zoltan Le\u010dei.

This game evokes all that is great in the B-movies of decades ago, and provides a dynamic, fun experience at the table.\nTHEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! is a tabletop roleplaying game in which the players, as humans, live in a world under increasing attack. The attackers? Aliens from beneath the sea, obviously!\nAdventures can range from the one-shot defense of small coastal town, to the lengthier liberation of a cruise ship invested with gill-kin, all the way to a campaign in which characters seize an alien submarine and ride it all the way down to the sea bed to take the fight to the invaders.\nIn this game, the protagonists are strong-jawed war veterans, cunning and resourceful explorers, utterly insane scientists, and blue-collar heroes, just looking to defend their patches of land. Each appears as in the B-movie classics of the era, providing a wealth of inspiration for the kinds of characters you'll play in this game.\nYour weapons against the alien incursion come not only in the form of fists and bullets but Quips and Cinematics. Drawn from decks of cards or rolled from tables in the book, Quips are your award-winning one-liners that allow your blow to pack a harder punch, make your rebuke more scathing, or just act as a pithy thing to say before dying. Are they sometimes incongruous to the scene or inappropriate in any context? Of course! But use that moment where you state \"this alien tastes like momma's apple pie\" to your advantage with this new game mechanic and get your whole table laughing, too!\nCinematics, meanwhile, encourage you to put the \"meta\" in \"metagame,\" as you accumulate points to spend on inserting deleted scenes in your game, cut to black when the action gets too hot, apply bad dubbing to an alien's dialogue, or summon a stuntman to replace the scrawny scientist character when he has to run the length of an exploding submarine, crab-person baby in arms. Cinematics are a new feature the players can use to make their game of THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! even more frenetic and fun.\nThe world with which you're presented in THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! is familiar, yet weirder. Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley blare from the jukebox in the diner corner, our heroes gather at the counter for their dollar shakes, greasers drive up to the outdoor theater with their hair slicked back, and the ladies do the Twist, all while suspicious military personnel and scientists work on new weapons and experiments within walking distance of town. \nThe Red Scare is in full effect. The words \"atomic\" and \"bomb\" are on everyone's lips. This could be the 1950s we all know, except everything is cranked up: the paranoia, the pop culture, the fear of global destruction. Everyone is a little more protective over their homeland, fearful of the neighbors, and when word spreads of the Soviets consorting with aquatic monsters, it doesn't take long for the rumors to gain traction.\nThis THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! Kickstarter campaign is designed to enable us to create a full-color traditionally-printed hardcover rulebook, a print-and-play PDF of Quip and Cinematic cards, and a Director screen to aid play. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including more scenarios and additional threats! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover rulebook with a dynamic cover and full-color interior art. We estimate the book will be more than 200+ pages and will be traditionally printed on high quality paper stock. In addition, we want to create a print-and-play PDF with more than 120 Quip and Cinematic cards to use in-game, and a sturdy three-panel THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! screen featuring a illustrations from the rulebook on the outer side, and a selection of charts and other info on the inside to make the Director's job a little bit easier.\nTHEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! will be powered by Onyx Path's Storypath system, and includes all the rules you need to play as a two-fisted hero dealing with alien threats, including rules for creating characters with a mix of Origins to customize your Archetype. It also has ready-to-play scenarios, along with information on events of the 1950s that you can incorporate into your game with a new fishy taste. And, finally, dozens of antagonists, including a chaotic assembly of conflicting bad guys that create a broad culture for players and Directors to explore, manipulate, and form into a living, gurgling world of aquatic menace.\nThe Storypath system is Onyx Path's rules set designed specifically to allow the sort of rules scaling necessary to seamlessly enable players to play ordinary people as well as mad scientists and seasoned explorers.\nThe basics of the Storypath system should be familiar to anyone who has played many other Onyx Path games of action-adventure or heroic exploits, as it is a 10-sided dice pool system, where in order to resolve an action you basically roll a number of dice equal to the character's Skill + Attribute and must roll an 8 or better a certain number of times in order to succeed in the action. \nThat is the very basic resolution system, but we expand on that to further enhance how your gaming group can build their stories. Failing to hit your number of successes, or having more successes than your required amount, are built-in options in the rules. Here is a handy graphic that illustrates what we mean:\nTo further explain the basics of the Storypath system, here is a small PDF download that goes into more detail: SYSTEM PREVIEW PDF.\n Here's a video of THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! in action...\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautifulbook to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA!, possibly creating additional content in the form of scenarios, threats, and ready-made characters. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore this thrilling world.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world \u2014 and like our protagonists, this mission binds us with common purpose. When you back this project, you join our amazing cast of characters as we create our adventure together.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($20,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to load a larger version of this Reward Tier chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nKey Decision: do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version, or go all in with the hardcover rulebook? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the BODY DOUBLE, STUNT DOUBLE and ACTING CLASS Reward Tiers, which offer 2 rulebooks, 2 rulebooks and a Director's Screen, or 5 rulebooks and a Director's Screen respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!)\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (\"CRAFT SERVICES\") will get 5 copies of the hardcover rulebook (as well as the PDF versions) and 5 copies of the Director's Screen at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nSeveral Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE Stickers which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! rulebook or a possible supplement. A limited number of premium slots to play in an online RPG session with the Onyx Path's Matthew Dawkins. Finally, as an Executive Producer, you will act as a \"consulting developer\" on a future Storypath product produced by Onyx Path. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates once per week. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nClick to go to the latest Manuscript Preview update post\nDIRECTOR'S SCREEN - a sturdy three-panel THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! screen featuring evocative art on the outer side, and a selection of charts and other info on the inside to make the Director's job a little bit easier.\nEARLY ACCESS PREVIEW PLAYTEST DOCUMENT - When we launch the campaign, we'll be providing a stripped-down version of the game with just the basics, allowing you to take the system and setting out for a spin! Only Backers will be able to download this Early Access preview playtest document. \nClick to go to the Early Access PDF update link\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013 All PDF products will be fulfilled through our partners at DriveThruRPG.com, the largest RPG download store. For THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA!, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com and cards from DriveThruCards.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards. \nQUIP & CINEMATIC CARDS PRINT & PLAY PDF- More than 120 cards featuring perfect phrases and one-liners to drop in during key moments of play, as well as Cinematic metagame abilities.\nDesign subject to change.\n RULEBOOK - a 200+-page, full-color hardcover rulebook containing all the information needed to play THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA!\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run.\nAll PDF rewards will be fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. PDF reward Add Ons can be added to any Reward Tier.\nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional rulebooks, screens) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of the THEY CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA! rulebook (Reward Tiers of $50+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when the book becomes available.\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\nAchieved! - NEW DIRECTOR'S SCREEN ARTWORK - We'll commission new widescreen full-span Larry Blamire artwork for the Director's Screen!\nAchieved! - ADDITIONAL AQUATIC ALIEN ADVERSARIES! - A handful of new threats and antagonists will be created and released as a Threat File!

To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for They Came From Beneath The Sea! is finished, initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "BACKGROUND", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive the Early Access Playtest preview PDF, as well as access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nEarly Access Playtest PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}], "stat": ["57 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "PRODUCTION ASSISTANT", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive a PDF copy of They Came from Beneath the Sea!\nINCLUDES:\nThey Came from Beneath the Sea!

His goose-stepping hordes have expanded west into Libya and east into Saudi Arabia. \nWithin Mobius' domain magic, miracles, and wondrous weird science prevails. The technology of the empire is roughly that of 1930's Earth, but the realm's World Laws allow for rayguns and fantastic inventions that would be impossible with normal technology.\nHigh Lord Mobius and his evil legions are extremely powerful, but they didn't come to Earth alone. He comes from a cosm of masked crime fighters and heroic deeds. Some of these Mystery Men followed Doctor Mobius from Terra, and others have been created as Storm Knights transcended all across Africa during the invasion.\nThe Nile Empire source book is an expansion designed for both players and Game Masters. Inside you'll find:\nNew Perks, Spells, Miracles, and Pulp Powers for advancing characters. Includes options only available to Beta Clearance Storm Knights, as they learn more about their own abilities and the nature of reality.\nMore gear designed to take advantage of the Weird Science available in the realm, including the powerful Rocket Ranger battle suits!\nAn extensive status update for the default timeline. See the course of the first year of the Possibility Wars and the toll it's taken on Africa and the Middle East. Includes a list of ongoing Delphi Council operations and who's who in the Nile Empire theater of the war.\nThe disposition and battle tactics of the Nile Empire's war machine and major henchmen. Get the statistics for the Pharaoh himself, as Doctor Mobius plots and schemes his way to the top. Heroes beware!\nNew threats. Gangsters struggle to claim a piece of the action, monsters of legend appear across the land, and masked super villains rise to prove their worth to Mobius or take some of his power for themselves. Over thirty new foes in all, suitable for Storm Knights of various experience levels!\n Obstacle generation tables help raise the stakes and keep the action exciting, and more!\nThe Fires of Ra is a massive adventure suitable for several months of gaming. Start off in free Venice where a group of villains attempt to steal an ancient treasure, and get swept up in Mobius' machinations all across Africa. Can you find a weakness to his ultimate war-machine before it's campaign of terror destroys all resistance in the region?\nThe Nile Empire GM Screen has three panels. On the inside, all the most needed charts from Torg Eternity in addition to the new charts specific to adventures in the Nile Empire. The outside features a single, gorgeous seamless image and the axioms and World Laws players need to remember. \n The Nile Empire Archetypes come within the GM Screen, and offer new stock heroes to draw from to fill the ranks of your Storm Knights. Meet the Vengeful Hero, a transformed vigilante who has lost too much to Mobius' cruel invasion, the Nile Engineer, who uses a blend of science and magic unique to the realm, the Pulp Sorcerer, and more!  \nIf you'd like extra copies of an item or would like to add a product from another pledge tier to your order, you may use the list below.

All actions, for example, are accomplished by succeeding in an appropriate check (such as a Gun Combat check to shoot an enemy or Computers check to hack a sealed door).\nPlay begins by selecting a ship to board, such as a Destroyer, Cruiser, or (gulp!) Battleship, and then both players build appropriate forces to attack or defend the vessel. This could be as small as a platoon or an entire company, depending on the type of ship being assaulted.\nAn initial breach scenario is played and, from there, players will proceed through several scenarios as the two forces battle one another, culminating in either the attacking force reaching a critical objective, such as the power plant or bridge, or the defenders throwing their enemies off the ship altogether!\nThis campaign-style of game means players have to be careful as to which forces they commit and when, marshalling their best troops for the most important fights.\nTo complicate matters, both players will acquire Strategy Cards that will allow them to wrong foot their enemy - like turning off the ship's artificial gravity or explosively venting the atmosphere, exposing everyone to the void!\nUpdate Summary\nLots of updates are coming for this Kickstarter, but you can keep up to date with the list below:\nUpdate 1: Miniatures Preview\nUpdate 2: Force lists for the Marines and Zhodani\nStretch Goals\nThe Vanguard: Boarding Actions in the Fifth Frontier War box set contains everything you need to play these exciting battles on the tabletop - but we have the opportunity to give you more for your money and further expand this corner of the Traveller universe.\nTaken on the Run\nIf we reach a total of \u00a360,000, we will include a printed short story written by fan-favourite Martin Dougherty. Taken on the Run begins during the first few minutes of the Fifth Frontier War and will take you through a dangerous boarding action from the point of view of the Imperial Marines.\nThe Aslan\nWe do not want the Imperials and Zhodani to have all the fun! If we reach a total of \u00a380,000, we will add both the rules and 16 miniatures for the powerful Aslan, a warrior race who will look forward to boarding the largest enemy warships. The Aslan lack the sophisticated armour of the Imperium, but more than make up for that with lethal weaponry, a penchant for close combat, and sheer predatory ferocity!\nThe Vargr\nOften derided as mere corsairs and pirates, the Vargr have a lot to prove. If we reach a total of \u00a3100,000, we will add both the rules and 16 miniatures for a Vargr raiding force. While not known as mighty warriors, the Vargr are exceedingly good at what they do, and many a starship has fallen to their cunning tactics.\nMulti-Deck Battles\nIf we reach a total of \u00a3110,000, we will add rules to combine two or more sets of Vanguard: Boarding Actions in the Fifth Frontier War so you can launch multi-deck assaults upon a warship and really keep the defenders on their toes!\nAfter More Traveller?  \nTraveller is one of the oldest Roleplaying Games still around, and it has built up a massive amount of background lore. You can explore this universe by adding any of the following to your pledge, simply by increasing the amount you have pledged by the appropriate amount (no need to increase your pledge level, just the pledge amount!).

In this game, players assume the roles of desperate people who come forth to fight against the imminent apocalypse promised by the dreaded Destroyer of Worlds, the Hunger in the Void, the being known as the Demon Lord. Since the first Kickstarter campaign three years ago, Schwalb Entertainment has revealed the hidden kingdoms, the terrifying vistas of Hell, the madness of the Void, and has even taken you to a post-apocalyptic world in which the Demon Lord has already won. Now, though, is the time to arm your heroes with even greater weapons so that you can take the fight to the darkness and triumph. \nOccult Philosophy, the first major expansion to this sinister game, offers 800 new spells divided between forty traditions of magic. Whether you are calling down a mountain to shatter the armies of the Witch-King or opening a portal to the ancient past before the troubles began on Urth, Occult Philosophy ramps up the magic in the game. Each tradition receives a considerable expansion, with spell offerings for rank 0 to rank 10, each of which has been tested for use in your campaigns. If you want to master the secrets of Battle magic or plumb the depths of Forbidden magic, Occult Philosophy has you covered.\nWant to learn more about Occult Philosophy? Check out these interviews with Mud & Blood, Tales of Blood and Stone, and TabletopBabble.\nShadow of the Demon Lord is a horror-fantasy tabletop adventure game that presents a world standing on the brink of annihilation. In this game, you and your friends play characters charged with fighting back against the spreading evil, whether that involves tracking down potent relics, exploring ancient faerie ruins, journeying into Hell to bargain with the Devil, or battling demons and the cultists who summon them. \nIf you\u2019re new to this game, check out some of the great reviews about Shadow of the Demon Lord here, here, here, and here, and some live-plays of the game: here, here, and here.\nFinally, you can grab a copy of the quick start rules and a starting adventure for almost free, right here.\nThe book is written and extensively tested, so we\u2019re ready to move to the next stage of production, which involves editing, layout, art direction, and the rest. Given the size of the book and the expenses involved, I\u2019m asking for your help to bring this project over the finish line. The best way to help is to choose a pledge level found below and back the campaign. The level you choose determines the rewards you get in return for your support. If the project funds, your dollars go toward purchasing art, paying for editing, and covering the other production costs. Of course, if the project doesn\u2019t fund, you pay nothing and everyone becomes quite sad. If you can\u2019t help out by backing at a pledge level, we\u2019d be mighty grateful if you spread the word to those who can. \n[NEW!] Digital Spell Cards\nOn DriveThruRPG, I've been selling spell cards for most of the spells presented in game. Now, backers at the $50 or higher pledge levels automatically gain digital spell cards for every spell presented in Occult Philosophy to make using this awesome project even easier. How much value does this pledge add to your game? Well, each deck includes at least 18 spells and MSRP is a $1 per deck. At 42 decks, that's a $42 bucks worth of content you get for free!\nOver the last few years, we\u2019ve released a ton of great content for the game. From dozens of adventures to optional rules to new paths, spells, monsters, and more, Shadow of the Demon Lord has the support you need to tell the stories you want to tell. To celebrate the Kickstarter campaign, we\u2019re offering bundles of products at a discounted price so you can catch up on releases you have missed and see what all the fuss is about.\nPoisoned Pages Bundle $12 (normally $22.77)\nFor the sake of completeness, here's the Poisoned Pages bundle. It includes all of the following products: Battle Scars, Children of the Earth, Do We Not Die?, Fever Dreams, Flesh of the Fallen, Insupposable Instruments, Power in a Name, Price of Evil, Riders of the Wind, Tooth and Claw, Unhinge the Mind, Vine and Willow, and Dark Passages.\nCharacter Sheet Pads ($20 US/$35 International)\nPads of sexy new character sheets designed so you can keep track of everything that pertains to your character. Price includes shipping.\nDemon Lord Dice ($25 US/$35 International)\nA set of 9 dice with the Schwalb Entertainment logo featured on the 6. Dripping with evil, the dice set includes 3 white dice (boons), 3 black dice (banes), and 3 red dice (damage).\nDigital Spell Cards ($15)\nYou can complete your collection of digital spell cards, getting all the decks released for the game until this KS for a low price of $15. These decks include all card sets from the core rulebook, A Glorious Death, Demon Lord's Companion, Demon Lord's Companion 2, Exquisite Agony, Godless, Hunger in the Void, Terrible Beauty, and Tombs of the Desolation.\nIn addition to the above add-ons, you can also pick up Demon Lord Turn Tokens and Demon Lord Fortune Tokens.\nShadow of the Demon Lord Turn Token (1) - $10\nThis large 50mm token is 4mm thick, and brings real weight to the table. It can be used to track the Fast and Slow combat rounds, and the token features white enamel letters and red enamel sigils and glowing eyes. Not for the faint hearted. Designed by Lee Smith and made by Campaign Coins under license from Schwalb Entertainment.\nShadow of the Demon Lord Fortune Tokens (6) - $10\nThese tokens are emblazoned with the word Fortune. The top side features the Demon Lord symbol in magnificent 3D, while the reverse has the design in 2D, making it naturally lie flat on the table. Comes as a pack of 6 tokens. Designed by Lee Smith and made by Campaign Coins under license from Schwalb Entertainment.\nShadow of the Demon Lord Dice Tray (1) - $14.99\nThe Demon Lord approaches... your hands are shaking... your character has one chance to live... now would be a bad time to lose your dice.\nThis deluxe pleather dice tray will keep your dice where you need them during your sessions of Shadow of the Demon Lord.\nThe dice tray packs flat with your rulebook and is easy to snap together for play.\nIt features the legendary Demon Lord design by Schwalb Entertainment, printed in stark bone white on jet black pleather. The dice tray is vegetarian-approved (Hail Seitan!)\nApproximate assembled dimensions: 9.5\" (24cm) Length x 6.75\" (17cm) Width x 1.5\" (3.8cm) Depth\nShadow of the Demon Lord dice not included.\nThe dice tray is manufactured by Campaign Coins, as part of their licensed range of products for Shadow of the Demon Lord. C\nShipping\nFor any and all of the Campaign Coins accessories, add $5 to your pledge for US, Canada, and the Rest of the World. Add $3 to your pledge for Asia/New Zealand/Australia.  \nFor now, you\u2019ll pay shipping for printed copies of Occult Philosophy directly to the printer when you redeem your at-cost coupon. If we hit a funding level that allows us to do an offset print run for Occult Philosophy, you\u2019ll pay shipping after the campaign closes through Backerkit. Doing so allows us to avoid distorting the funding levels to give us an accurate estimate of how much money we've raised, and it allows us time to find the best shipping options for the campaign. Typically, I can ship out a book to US customers for about $6 (includes shipping, box, and tape). \nFor international backers (under 4 lb.), we\u2019re in $40-50 range, which sucks on so many levels. Since international shipping rates keep climbing, I\u2019m offering the print-on-demand coupon, so you can receive the book for the cost of glue, paper, and binding. I\u2019ve ordered plenty of hardback books from Lightning Source, and the quality is good. Best of all, Lightning Source has a printer in the UK, which cuts the world-wide shipping costs way, way down. So if you\u2019re not wild about paying $50 for shipping, please, please, please avail yourself of the at-cost print-on-demand coupon. Hail!\nNormally, I\u2019d hide all this stuff, but I think it\u2019s worth getting some of this info out early so you know what you\u2019re getting for your hard-earned bucks. I intend to use this campaign to fund the production of a whole host of new products that I\u2019ve been wanting to design. If you back at the 50 dollar level or higher and funding exceeds the goal, you\u2019ll get the stuff unlocked at no extra cost!

Each player is given some starting funds, two mission cards, to try and complete during the course of the game, and a guide token to help them on their way. \nExploriana is played over a variable number of rounds, further split into 4 phases. \nPhase 1 - Recruit explorers\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nEach round a number of explorers are laid out. Each explorer has their own special ability and each player gets to pick one to add to their team.\nExperienced players may choose to use the alternate recruitment rule that eliminates the need for the recruit explorers phase. The players start the game by drafting a full team of explorers to use throughout the game.\nPhase 2 - Send Explorers\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nThere are three regions to explore in Exploriana: South America, Africa and the Far East, each of the regions is more dangerous than the last. \nThe players now decide which of the three regions they will send their explorers too. \nIn renown order, players take turns placing one of their explorers until every player has placed two explorers.\nPhase 3 - Explore regions\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nEach of the three region decks has its own unique deck of cards and the decks are packed with fabulously illustrated discoveries.\nEach deck contains five types of discovery cards! \nEvery card has a unique piece of art showing what type of discovery can be found.\nA region is explored by revealing cards one at a time, simulating an expedition pushing ever deeper into the wilderness. \nAs a player reveals a discovery card there is a chance a hazard is found on that discovery card! \nIf a player should reveal any three hazards of the same type, or all three different hazards while exploring, then the expedition is lost and the cards are shuffled back into the region deck to be found in furture expiditions. \nRevealing up to four discovery cards allows a player to make a single pick.\nA pick is taking a set of animals or a single treasure, orchid, map or location card.\nIf they are brave or lucky enough to have revealed five discoveries without becoming lost, they may make one extra pick!\nPhase 4 - End of round\nAt the end of each round the players check to see if any deck is empty, and replace any region deck that is with its respective reserve, which will then trigger the final round of the game.\nVictory\nThe aim of the game in Exploriana is to accumulate the most victory points.\nThe discoveries the players make award renown, wealth or victory points, and some even give the player a combination of awards!\nFOR A MORE DETAILED LOOK AT THE RULES PLEASE DOWNLOAD THEM FROM HERE.\nThe above is a brief overview of Exploriana.

The funding raised through this campaign is for manufacturing & bulk shipping the game.\n\nThe main risks faced with, when attempting to bring a board game to market, are usually problems associated with production, shipping and fulfilment. Delays in production can hopefully be avoided by using an experienced manufacturer. We intend to use Longpack, a well-known and well-established manufacturer and we also intend to have Longpack arrange delivery alongside our fulfilment company to ensure there are also no unforeseen problems with the shipping of the product.\n\nBrexit is a concern, of course. We are planning on using fulfilment centres within the EU to limit any impact that it may have on the campaign, in this way we don't envisage any major problems to overcome.\n\nDue to the combined experience and determination of the team involved with the Exploriana campaign, we are confident that any challenges we run into can be overcome and of course we will endeavour to keep our backers up to date with the progress of the project with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Benefactor", "descp": "A big thank you from us for showing your support for Exploriana.\nJoin us on our Kickstarter expedition and follow the progress of the Exploriana campaign.

(SFW) is an alternative history wargame intended to investigate the strategic parameters that would\u2019ve been in place during the first 10 weeks of operations had that dictator lived long enough to put in motion his plan to start World War III in 1953. Had he lived, the most likely start date would\u2019ve been one closely coinciding with the signing of the Korean War armistice in July (in order to achieve a surprise effect).\nHis main goal in starting such a war wouldn\u2019t have been immediate global conquest; rather, in Europe he would\u2019ve been seeking to seize or thoroughly wreck the Ruhr \u2013 then, as now, one of the world\u2019s main industrial regions \u2013 or otherwise abort the still young Federal Republic of Germany (\u201cWest Germany\u201d) as an effective member of the Western alliance. In Asia, the then already long- sought conquest of the entire Korean peninsula would\u2019ve been the objective, thereby putting Japan into what would\u2019ve amounted to a geo-strategic vice given that the USSR already possessed Sakhalin Island to the north.\nThere are atomic warfare rules, but their use on the Communist side is constrained by the limited availability of the bombs themselves, as well as by their historic lack at that time of a fully dependable means to deliver them. On the Allied (a.k.a. \u201cUnited Nations\u201d or \u201cUN\u201d or \u201cUS\u201d) side, the limitation is a cultural one. That is, the early 1950s marked the full blown emergence of the anti-imperialist (a.k.a. \u201chate America\u201d or \u201cthird world\u201d or \u201cnon-aligned\u201d) movement onto the global media stage. If, therefore, the Americans were to try to win this war by using enough a-bombs to simply blow to bits the attacking communist hordes, they would do so much damage to the environmental and socio-political ecologies as to undo that battlefield victory in the broader grand strategic sense.\nOne map covers West Germany and its immediate environs; the other covers the Korean peninsula south from the Pyongyang-Wonsan \u201cneck.\u201d Each hexagon on both maps represents 10 miles (16 kilometers). The Communist units of maneuver are armies and corps, while those on the UN side are mostly divisions along with a few corps. Air power is represented abstractly, with counters and rules showing the effects of one side or the other gaining temporary air superiority above one or both theaters of operation. Each full game turn represents one week of \u2018real time\u2019 from late July to early October 1953.\nComponents\nThe game comes with two play maps, one of the region of Europe along the border region of the two Germanys, the other of the Korean Peninsula.\nEuropean Map\nKorea Map\n\nThere are two counter sheets of large 5/8\" counters depicting the forces involved in the conflict. Forces include the Soviets, Chinese, North Korean, United States, United Kingdom, France, South Korean, and West German.\nCounter Sheet 1\n\nAnd since it was expected that this war would be abundantly nuclear, a sizeable portion of nuclear use counters are included.\nCounter Sheet 2\nExample of Play\nIt\u2019s late in the game, and the Communist player still controls only the three cities on the Korea map with which he began the war already controlling. When the die rolls give him a superiority (one MiG) and five Refugee markers, he decides to go big to try break open the front in a critical sector and get things rolling toward seizing the three other cities available there, and which would give him a win on the Korea map.\nEven failing that, the US Player, whose prestige point total is getting low, may still be moved to use more atomic attacks to try stabilize the situation.\nThe Soviet airborne are dropped to jam up any US move by reinforcements coming up from farther south. That thinking also guides the Communist player\u2019s placement of the five available Refugee markers. Their presence in a hex either increases US per-hex movement costs by one or causes a one-point reduction in that side\u2019s aforementioned prestige point total for just moving through them without care. (If that point total reaches zero for any reason, it\u2019s a sudden death Communist victory.)\nBoth sides\u2019 units have suffered heavy attrition in earlier fighting. The only two-step units on the map are the newly arrived Soviet airborne, but they can\u2019t attack this turn because they\u2019ve just landed.\nThe Communist player uses all four of his available offensive support markers \u2013 the etile 33rd Independent Infantry Division, the Artillery Control Bureau and the 1st and 2nd Armor Control Bureaus. Each of those generates a one-time, one-right column shift on the odds chart. He also commits his one available air power marker for a total of five right column shifts.\nThe initial odds of the Chinese attack into hex 4610 is 1:1 (eight Chinese attack factors versus eight US defense factors. The river then shifts it one column left to 1:2, but the five Communist rightward shifts then move it back in that direction to 5:1, which will be enough to guarantee the Communists will seize the hex and a two-thirds chance of destroying both the already reduced US units.\nSequence of Play & Rules\nI.

This one does not. Certainly we could think up expansions or add-ons to this game, but all that would entail lots of extra play-testing, art development, and associated work that would translate into long (potentially very long) delays in the production of the game. We don't want to do that. If this campaign completes successfully, we'll be going straight to press. So no gimmicks, games, or non-sense to get you to support this campaign. We are offering a solid game for a good discount. That's the deal.\nWe considered adding mounted maps, but due to the added weight that would entail, it's really not feasible from a shipping stand-point. It's already expensive to ship as is. So our approach was simply to deliver the best quality within tolerable shipping parameters out the gate.\nTime-frame for Delivery\nWe are planning a fast turn-around for SFW. At this point all of the game development and art-work is complete. The time spent from the successful end of this campaign forward will be on ushering the game through the press process. Although we hope to fulfill sooner, we are estimating February/March of 2019 for delivery.\nA Note About Shipping Costs\nUS shipping is based upon medium flat rate shipping.\nOur international shipping price is based upon a 3.5 pound package (what we estimated the game would weigh if it had mounted components in a box) to non-EU overseas destinations. The USPS charge for that at the time of this writing is $50.11 first class international. We are charging slightly less than that.\nEU shipping is based upon calculating the following 4 items:\n1. Cost to bulk ship EU orders to the EU\n2. Per unit VAT fee for that shipment\n3. Per unit shipping fee of European fulfillment house\n4. Actual European postage based upon a four pound package\nIn estimating the numbers, this adds up to $32.\nWe understand that other companies charge lower shipping amounts in their Kickstarter campaigns. After researching that, we found that they are doing this by amortizing that cost in the price of the game itself. We thought about doing that as well, but two factors stopped us. The first is that what is going to happen in a KS campaign is unknown, and each scenario we looked at had risk over certain number ranges. Because we are essentially a small operation, we do not care much for risk. However, we also simply felt it was unfair to others to make them subsidize shipping costs that are not their fault. And that is why the shipping costs are what they are.\nA Note About One Small Step\nOSS Games is a small company. We are composed of no full-time staff, but rather are a group of individuals who enjoy producing games in our spare time. Our MO is to produce small print-run games with consistently high production values. We try to bring you the highest quality product possible for a reasonable amount of money. We do this because we enjoy it.\nThat said, we are a game publisher, not a PR firm. We limit communication to essential announcements. Therefore, we will not be posting constant updates about everything little thing. Our posts will be limited to essential milestones, such as the game going to press, the receipt of press samples, or when the game begins shipping. The press process is often one of waiting punctuated by occasional back and forth on minor issues. If you don't hear from us in the updates section, this is simply because we do not have any update that changes status of the previous one.\nAlso, because each of us has a day job, we are not able to monitor the Kickstarter page at all times.

In addition to a revised Second Edition version, the book had many supplements that introduced important characters and stories to the lore of Vampire: The Masquerade. \nThis Chicago By Night Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a prestige hardcover edition designed to sit proudly alongside Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition core book. \nWe want to create an 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d hardcover with a beautifully designed, full-color cover image featuring the Windy City. We estimate the book to be more than 240+ pages, with a full-color interior and endpapers on high-quality paper stock.\nChicago By Night includes all the information you need to build ongoing chronicles. From courtly intrigue within the Masquerade to confrontations at the Succubus Club, this setting sourcebook will help Storytellers develop rich and rewarding tales of excess set in the Windy City.\nIt also includes information and game rules for the Lasombra, introducing the clan into Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition.\nIllustration by Mirko Failoni\nChapters include:\nIntroduction\nThe World of Chicago (Local Metaplot)\nWelcome to the Night\nThe City (History, Politics, Geography)\nChicago's Kindred\nCoteries\nClan Lasombra\nThe Disciplines of Clan Lasombra\nLoresheets\nThe Chicago Chronicles\nIllustration by Amy Wilkins\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting sneak peek previews of sections of the Chicago By Night manuscript as backer-only updates.\nClick to see Backers-Only update with links to manuscript sneak peeks.\nThe main focus and goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Chicago By Night that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful hardcover book to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into the book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nIllustration by Amy Wilkins\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the secret city of Chicago and the American Midwest, expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to create to explore the world hidden in the shadows.\nThirdly, we want to celebrate the shared legacy of Vampire: The Masquerade and Onyx Path, hopefully adding opportunities to explore past releases, historical texts, and related products.  These opportunities will allow backers to revisit concepts and ideas from the past even as we move forward with the new edition.\nBeyond all the campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and engage imaginations.

With this Chicago By Night campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you.

To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects, and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process work and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Chicago By Night is finished and initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs \u2014 unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges \u2014 both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn\u2019t eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We\u2019ve learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we\u2019re becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We\u2019ve found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions, and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to an unresponsive backer, that\u2019s just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Ghoul", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript sneak peek update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nBacker Access to Manuscript Sneak Peek Previews", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Embraced", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive a PDF copy of Chicago By Night.\nINCLUDES:\nCHICAGO BY NIGHT PDF Version\nBacker Access to Manuscript Sneak Peek Previews", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["305 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Childe", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive a PDF copy of Chicago By Night.\nINCLUDES:\nCHICAGO BY NIGHT PDF Version\n\"At Cost\" PoD Option: Chicago By Night\nBacker Access to Manuscript Sneak Peek Previews", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["55 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Kindred", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive a hardcover printed copy of Chicago By Night.

In Nahual you  play as shapeshifting nahuales that hunt angels to make a living. You  run a changarro\u2014a business\u2014together and sell the angels you hunt as different types of products. Caught in the middle of an ancient feud, you struggle to find your place in a world of fantastical and overwhelming forces. \nNahual builds upon the Powered by the Apocalypse system used in Apocalypse World, Urban Shadows, Dungeon World and more. When your character\u2019s actions trigger a move, the move tells you what happens in the fiction or you roll two six-sided dice to find out. Moves are designed to push the fiction forward, building tension and taking the story in unknown and exciting directions.\nNahual is set in the universe created by Mexican comic book artist Edgar Cl\u00e9ment, first presented in the graphic novel Operaci\u00f3n Bolivar\u2014which you can find here in Spanish\u2014and expanded in titles like Kerubim, Los Perros Salvajes (I & II) and other short stories. Nahual is yet another addition to that ever-growing universe, using elements from the comics and creating new ideas that add to this amazing setting. \n\"When our Spanish ancestors first arrived to this continent they were not alone, with them came their gods and their armies of angels. For our indigenous ancestors, these angels were not the incense vendors of the present day; they were emissaries of destruction. Between the sword of Cort\u00e9s and the sword of St. Michael, the Archangel, there was no difference, and neither made a clean cut to the roots. The brujos resisted. Nahuales, the most powerful shamans, took on the task of fighting the invading angels.\"\n\u2014Edgar Cl\u00e9ment. Operaci\u00f3n Bolivar.\nIn Nahual, players are angel hunters, descended from the powerful brujos nahuales. They have special gifts that enable them to contend with gods and angels, but their cultural memory has been taken from them\u2014they no longer possess the shamanic traditions to unleash these wonders to their full potential. Many struggle for survival, others look for answers, but all agree on one thing: a nahual lives to hunt down angels.\nThe game setting is a Mexico filled with fantasy and sci-fi elements, mixed with a maelstrom of violence, inequality, corruption, folklore and fiesta. In this mess, angels prowl the cities, looking for souls to feed upon. Restless humans pray to God and his angels; where there are people hungry for hope and faith, angels thrive.\nAnd yet...there are angeleros\u2014angel hunters. They have the power to fight back, to get rid of the celestial parasites, to free the people. But these are not times for idealism. What is it to be gained by revolution? It is kill or be killed in the concrete jungle. All you can do is look out for yourself and your closest allies, to try to make a living in the face of poverty, decay, and death. And so they hunt.\nOf course, everyone wants a piece of heaven, a fragment of the magical flesh of celestial beings. The drug dealers are interested in the \"angel dust\" made by grinding their bones into an addictive and potent drug. The Church uses the angels as circus animals to lure in worshipers. The corporations are finally beginning to realize the business potential of these creatures, for experimentation and synthetic replication. The politicians\u2026 well, they like to get their hands in everything, as long as there is a profit to be made. Con dinero baila el perro.\nThe nahuales are caught in the middle of all this. They are the drivers of the angel trade. The laborers. And the cheaper the labor the better the profits. The only thing they can do is fill their role and struggle to survive these shark-infested waters in which everyone wants a bite. Freedom? Revolution? There is no time for such nonsense, is there? \nNahual is a tabletop roleplaying game for 3-5 players that takes about 3-4 hours to play. The game is Powered by the Apocalypse, revolving around moves and their triggers. As you play and follow the fiction of the story, you look for when your character\u2019s actions hit the trigger of a move\u2014like when you assail someone, sneak around, or make a fuss. Sometimes these moves ask you to roll two six-sided dice (2d6) and add the corresponding stat:\nIf your result is 10 or more, that means it\u2019s a full hit. You succeed at what you were trying to do, no strings attached\u2014most of the time at least.\nIf you get a result between 7 and 9, it's a partial hit. You succeed at what you intended to do but with a cost, complication or ugly choice. \nIf you get a 6 or lower, that\u2019s a miss. A miss doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you failed at what you were doing, but instead the game master (the Marakame) says what happens. And yeah, you probably won\u2019t like it. \nIn Nahual, each angel hunter character has their own playbook\u2014a sort of character sheet and template that contains all the necessary rules for creating and playing your character. Each playbook is defined by a different totem animal, a manifestation of the character\u2019s inner nahual power and a metaphor for the character\u2019s personality.\nThere are 5 playbooks in the base game of Nahual, but we might be able to add more through stretch goals. The basic set includes:\nThe angel hunters are known as angeleros. In present day, the people that inherited the gift to see and touch the angels don\u2019t know what to do of it. Some don\u2019t even have an awakened nahual. All the shamanic traditions and philosophies they need were brutally snatched away by the angels and their allies centuries ago. \nNow all the angeleros can think of is survival. And what they see in their old enemies, the angels, is a rare commodity that fetches a decent price. So they hunt them, butcher them, and sell them to the highest bidder. It's ugly, brutal, dangerous work, but most angeleros are in the business because they know nothing else. It\u2019s a trade passed through family or friendship, the kind of work that keeps you alive while it kills you by the day. \nThis trade has three main pillars: La Cacer\u00eda, the hunting and killing of the angels; La Tablajer\u00eda, the skinning and butchering of the angel; and El Expendio, the retail sales, which varies considerably depending on the type of the changarro you run.\nIn Nahual, player characters work together through a business they own\u2014an establishment known as El Changarro, the place where they sell the angels they hunt, in different ways, depending on the type of business:\n Taquer\u00eda: Your changarro operates as a taco joint; you mainly sell angel meat cooked and served as tacos.\n Carnicer\u00eda: Your changarro operates as a butcher shop; you mainly sell the angel meat raw for others to cook.\n Cantina: Your changarro is a traditional Mexican bar where you mainly sell ch\u00ednguere\u2014a spirit drink distilled from angel blood\u2014and maybe also polvo de \u00e1ngel, a drug made of ground angel bones.\nChangarros are usually simple and humble establishments, a taco joint or a local cantina. Most of the clientele are ordinary people looking for food and drink with invigorating properties. For those who live in the harsh conditions of the barrios, eating angel meat and drinking angel blood is a blessing that keeps them afloat, to fight another day. \nWe all have our nahual: it is the innermost part of the unconscious mind, the wildest part in each of us. But your nahual is also part of something bigger, something infinite. The Nahual is the energy that permeates and connects the Cosmos. It is everything that surpasses our comprehension.\nTrying to fully understand and control the power of the Nahual is practically impossible. To ease this endeavor, you must use a totemic animal that serves as an anchor to channel and shape the energy of the Nahual. Your animal is a learning tool that allows you to condense and focus that power which otherwise would consume you. Think of it as a dam holding back a torrent of energy that lets you access that flood little by little, depending on how confidently you can open the gates.\nTo be able to use the power of the Nahual, you first need to transform into your totemic animal. There are six different levels of transformation, known as the Stages of Nahuality.\n Novato: at this stage the change is barely visible, but you\u2019re able to do things like see perfectly in the dark, climb with uncanny skill, or expand your olfactory sense or hearing.\n Aprendiz: your body starts to show some change; your back is hunched over and you move more like an animal. You can now take on a group of soldiers on your own, make an impossible jump, or make yourself invisible to normal eyes.\n Brujo: you are now in a hybrid stage, with prominent animal features showing. Your power level lets you take on a small army, leap a tall building in a single bound, or phase through a solid wall.\n Nahual: you are now a fully transformed animal. You can rip a car apart with your bare paws, cover a few miles of distance with a single jump, or take on an elite angel or powerful demon.\n Kibal: you can now transform into multiple animals or even mix different ones into a chimeric form. You are now the stuff of legends and can face powerful archangels or ignore the laws of physics.\n Postome: you\u2019re beyond mortal comprehension. You have now acquired godlike power. Upon reaching this stage, you retire your character.\nNahual shines in  long-term play, as players engage in the day-to-day hardships of their changarro: managing the business, hunting for angels to restock their shelves, and dealing with competitors or other factions that try to get the best of the pack. In addition to that, each character\u2019s advancement is centered around the power of their nahual and their transformation, expanding and growing over time.\nKilling angels and dabbling with the Nahual is ugly business. It takes its toll, represented in play as traumas. At the beginning of play, characters choose one trauma; as the game progresses and they make use of the power of the Nahual, their humanity will erode, and they will take more and more traumas.\nTraumas are presented as triggers that give XP to the character if they take certain dangerous and self-destructive actions. Therefore, as characters accumulate XP, they\u2019ll be able to advance their control of the stages of transformation, which in turn may result in more traumas unlocked. This system traps characters in a dangerous spiral: as their power grows, their very humanity is eroded.\nThe Nahual Corebook will be a 6\u201d x 9\u201d book (approx. 200+ pages), with black and white interiors, featuring the amazing art of Edgar Clement, and a full color cover. The book will come in both soft- and hardcover editions.\nThe game will be available both in ENGLISH and SPANISH. From the get-go I have been working on Nahual in both languages. At first writing in Spanish, then translating to English, but later I sometimes did it the other way around. In the end, it has been a very organic process in relation to language. For some of the things I\u2019ve written directly in English, Ileana will help me translate into Spanish, and sometimes Mark will proof my English when I translate things from Spanish to English.\nAt the end of the campaign, if we are funded, you\u2019ll be able to pick which edition you want through your Backerkit survey. If you want both, you can choose one language on the survey and then ask for the other language as an add-on. \nNahual is a Mexican project and will be developed both in ENGLISH and SPANISH: if funded, you will be able to choose your version through your Backerkit survey.\nWe will be shipping Nahual anywhere in the world! Thanks to our international fulfillment partners, backers in the EU, CA, and AU won't pay any customs or VAT on any of their shipments.\nThe costs for shipping each tier are included in the pledge levels. When you select your pledge, Kickstarter will tell you how much additional funding you'll need to add based on your location.\nInterview with Richard Rogers on +1 FORWARD, a podcast Powered by the Apocalypse.

If you want to know more about the Gauntlet community visit www.gauntlet-rpg.com \nAdam Koebel (@SkinnyGhost) getting excited about Nahual in Office Hours, Episode 58: \"The idea of a game set in modern Mexico, with fantasy, sci-fi, angel hunting, and brujos... it gets me in a place where I'm excited to see more.\" Check here the video:\n\"Nahual is the most exciting take on the Apocalypse Engine in a while. It\u2019s intense, evocative, and efficient: every move in the game needs to be there. The characters feel vivid and unique; I couldn\u2019t have made my Nahual character in any other game system. Its setting and mythology are darts aimed at colonialism\u2019s heart. Playing Nahual made me feel proud to be Hispanic, and both excited and terrified to tear some angels apart.\"\n\u2014James Mendez Hodes\n\"This game is not only well-designed and compelling but incredibly necessary, and I cannot recommend it more highly. I had an opportunity to playtest Nahual at Metatopia 2017. Miguel's multiple, interlocking PbtA economies immediately immersed me and my fellow players in the  world of the nahuales, and as we played it revealed its brilliant and subversive anti-colonial themes.\"\n\u2014Eric Mersmann (@presenteric)\n\"Miguel\u2019s many talents collide to bring us this beautiful game of passion, violence, and fun! Nahual is a rare opportunity for players to put on their own mask and step into the world of Edgar Clement, to protect their community from the invasion of soul-eating angels, and feast on the spoils. Moreover, I am excited to run a game that is so accessible to my English and Spanish speaking friends alike!\"\n\u2014Marissa Kelly\n\"Miguel\u2019s game is a heady mixture of mysticism, mystery, blood, history, violence, and community that fully presents the meat and heart of Edgar\u2019s amazing graphic novels and lets you shape them as your own. It\u2019s been a pleasure having late night discussions about it with Mike and an even greater one to play the game with him at Metatopia last year. Nahual isn\u2019t something you\u2019ve tried before; drink deeply, but, be warned, it will change you.\"\n\u2014Kevin Petker, creator of The Ward \n\"Nahual  is an exciting action RPG that mixes monster hunting with the aftermath  of colonialism in fascinating ways. At first, the idea of a game about  hunting and killing angels for a living had me a bit worried, but when I  found out those angels are the remnants of the oppressive Spanish  conquistadores, the whole game went next level. That, combined with a  living and breathing barrio where those angels\u2019 body parts are part of a  black market economy; along with mechanics for keeping your pack  together; and the choice of animal playbooks and powers\u2014it\u2019s a  rollicking good time where your angelerros are characters you care  about, not just when you tear an angel apart, but when they deal with  their pack, their changarro, and their barrio.\"\n\u2014Richard Rogers\n\"One  of the most fun and interesting concept games I have ever played! It  was completely transportive. From the moment we built the characters I  was hooked! Can't wait to play that game again.\"\n\u2014Tara Newman", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this is our first Kickstarter, we have the experience from working with important companies in the industry, like Magpie Games, John Wick Presents, Nocturnal Media, among others. We are experts in layout and we\u2019ve helped deliver Kickstarter projects like Talislanta: The Savage Land and Bluebeard\u2019s Bride. We\u2019ve been getting feedback from great designers, and that\u2019s given us a good grasp on how to do game design and a clear path ahead of us. We\u2019re also hiring the services of experts in the industry to help us fulfill shipping of all the products.\n \nThe largest problem we may encounter is delays. Even though most of the art is already done by the artist Edgar Clement, there\u2019s more pieces to be commissioned, depending entirely on how many stretchgoals we unlock. There\u2019s also more playstesting to be done\u2014although the core engine has been worked and written entirely, we want to bring to you the best version of the game we can possibly achieve.

Not just a monster book, but a monstrous empire for your 5E game. Whether you play in another published setting, a home brew or in Arcanis: The World of the Shattered Empires, you\u2019ll find this book to be an indispensable resource. \nBack The Ssethregoran Empire today and spice up your campaign by adding a new dimension to these scaled villains. Everyone should have an ancient empire of serpent men in their campaign. Shouldn\u2019t you? \nThe Ssethregoran Empire isn\u2019t just a collection of monsters as there\u2019s a full society explored within these pages, from their culture and religious views, to their history which stretches back over 7,000 years.  \nThis second volume in the Codex Geographica series focuses on the reptilian empire of Ssethregore, ruled by a race of serpent men, it is an ancient nation filled with other sentient reptilian species, like the ss\u2019ressen, lizard men of different egg clutches bred for specific tasks, the massive iguadons, aquatic pliesauran, winged rhamphorikes, the vermin-like kobolds, and more! \nEach of these monstrous races also include player character options, new spells, feats, and subclasses. For those playing the Black Talon ss'ressen, an entire chapter is devoted to the Pariah Egg-Clutches, with an in-depth look at their culture, history, religions, and more. \nThe Pariah Egg Clutches: A Player's Guide\nThis soft cover book compiles the information on the Black Talon, Ghost Scale, and Ashen Hide ss'ressen, along with all the pertinent rules and character options. This book is perfect to give to players of these egg clutches so they don't mess up your copy of the Ssethregoran Empire. \nReminder: The information in this books is in the main Ssethregoran Empire book.   \nShipping costs continue to rise for packages shipped within the US to countries abroad. PCI will always attempt to use fulfillment houses overseas to attempt to lower the cost, but with the laws on VAT and duty changing at a moment's notice, it is impossible to promise that the cost today will be the same as when the book ships next year. We maintain a policy of not making any profit from shipping, however we also cannot afford to lose money getting the book to you. \nHowever, we've received news that a new program with FedEx could cut costs on a 4 lb. book to about $25 + VAT or duty (as applicable). The additional bonus is that orders would arrive in days rather than the weeks necessary with a freight forwarder. Now, this is still being finalized and so far it's only for European shipments, but I'm told that this program will be extended to Canada and possibly Australia. I've been informed that it is HOPED that the  process will be concluded in about 6 months, which will be in time for this Kickstarter, but again, this is not finalized and until it is, I can't guarantee that it will be available. \nTo our beloved backers overseas, we apologize we can't guarantee a shipping cost that won't seem outrageous to many of you. We offer PDF versions of every product for those who prefer not to deal with shipping. \nIf your interested in what a book of this size will cost to ship to you, please take a moment and use the following link to calculate the possible cost.  Assume an International Medium Size flat rate box. This is, of course, the worst case scenario. We will always strive to lower the cost using fulfillment houses in Europe and Australia to lower those costs. \n https://postcalc.usps.com/      \nThe initial funding for the book allows us to produce a soft-back book of 160 pages or so. We hope to make this book bigger and lavishly illustrated with your help. Our ultimate goal is to turn this book into a hardback and 224 to 256 pages in length. There is lots of additional material that can be added to the book to make this a truly spectacular book. \nSpeaking of spectacular, should we unlock the hard cover upgrade, it will unlock the Limited Edition version for purchase, as well. The Limited Edition will be printed to order and have a green-scaled textured cover with the symbol of the Ssethregoran Empire emblazoned upon it. \nAfter the book is fully realized, the Stretch Goals will turn to a series of adventures (legal for both the Living Arcanis 5E and Legends of Arcanis organized play campaigns) that will plunge your Heroes into a desperate battle deep within the Ssethregoran Empire and finally confront the deadly Varn.    \nArcanis 5E Product Line\n For the organized play campaign, we can offer these three new special characters. To play one of these races, you must own the cert that allows you to do so.  More details upcoming in the Updates. \n Yissera \nBioengineered by the ssanu to infiltrate the human nations of the Known Lands, the yissera are indistinguishable from humans until they reach the age of fifty or so. At that time, they begin to show signs of their ssethric heritage, eventually suffering from mutations, from exhibiting scaly skin to truly horrific ones.  Many yissera, like these special character, are fitted with biotech. These yissera have a small venom sac and retractable fangs in their mouths, allowing them to spit their venom a small distance.  \nShell-Backs\nThese sentient amphibians resemble anthropomorphized turtles and may be one of the oldest races upon Arcanis. Sadly, these creatures\u2019 culture, religion, history, and even their name, has been obliterated, purposefully destroyed by the frog-like hylis, whom they warred with for centuries. The hylis allied themselves with the Serpent Empire in exchange for their aid in defeating their ancient foes. Yet, victory and subjugation was not enough. The hylis annihilated the shell-backs\u2019  cities, along with any written material immortalizing their history, culture, and philosophy. They rounded up and executed their scholars, priests, and loremasters to deprive their hated foes even the comfort of who they were. Temples and idols were burned so that knowledge of the shell-back\u2019s deity is unknown. Even their species\u2019 name was erased, and the creatures were forced to use the derogatory name given to them by their oppressors \u2013 shell-backs. \nDark Crest Ss'ressen\nCondemned to complete eradication by the naga when they refused to turn away from the ssethric deities and venerate the Varn gods, the Dark Crest ss\u2019ressen were long thought to be an extinct egg-clutch, but the ssanu bioengineered them too well. Bred as infiltrators and assassins to counter a rival ssanu pit\u2019s Black Talon, the Dark Crest are able to use their matte black scales to lose themselves in shadows. Ironically, it was the Black Talons that were ordered to destroy the Dark Crests, but they also refused, creating a blood debt that remains to this day. Due to their purpose of penetrating rebellious ss\u2019ressen egg clutches or the stronghold of their masters' enemies, the Dark Crests were created without the gland that instills frenzy in other ss\u2019ressen, making them unmatched in infiltrate other clutches . \nHave an idea for a monster and would like to see it developed, illustrated, and published in the Ssethregoran  Empire book? Well, here\u2019s your chance! Up to ten of you can pledge to do just that. Pledge at the Submit a Monster level and along with getting a book (and hopefully the Limited Edition Hardback version if/when it\u2019s unlocked), you\u2019ll be created in the book for the creature. \nThere are some restrictions: The creature idea you submit must not violate copyright laws (US or International), must be of CR 10 or lower, may not be a Legendary creature, and must fit into the theme of the Ssethregoran Empire book. This means it should fit into the category of reptilian, amphibian, or just generally a creature that can be found in a jungle or swamp environment. Additionally, the final creature developed is owned by Paradigm Concepts Publishing, LLC.\nLastly, we do reserve the right to refuse a submission. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nParadigm Concepts has published dozens of books over the past 15 years as well as a number of Kickstarters. \n\nThe risks to this project are relatively small as the manuscript is already complete. This Kickstarter helps fund the art and printing of the book. The primary risk is production is always those delays due to unforeseen life events in the production team (family emergencies, illness, etc.). The secondary risk is a potential delay in receiving the necessary information and feedback from those backer levels that require their input.

See Update #4 for details.\n We also have this funky cool design for a d4 that you can order as an Add-On to your pledge.   This style of d4 is basically a short cylinder cut in half vertically, one half rotated 90 degrees, and joined back together.  It's been around for years, but not very common.  We  thought we'd offer it as an option.  It's the only die in the whole kickstarter that we haven't yet prototyped with a mold (we did 3D print it, though).  Here it is:\nAll of our designs \"start on paper\" to choose the best possible one-color and two-color candidates.  We then produce prototype sets of all the chosen color combinations using the actual production molds.  Each prototype set of dice is then reviewed and voted on by our design committee to ensure only the most beautiful dice are selected for production.\nAll sets of dice in this Kickstarter from the initial 8 colors through all unlocked stretch goals are the real thing.  No color renderings or photoshop tricks.  \nThe Kickstarter exclusive d4 is the only item that has not already been produced through a production process  (we 3D printed it ourselves).\nOnce all the dice have been molded, we will manually inspect every die to ensure the highest quality before packaging it and sending it to you, our loyal customers.  We will not ship it, if it isn't the highest quality.  And if for any reason your are not satisfied with your dice, feel free to contact us and we'll make it right.  All dice come with a 30-day return or exchange policy.\nFULFILLMENT\nWe will be using BackerKit to assist in the receiving pledges,  order fulfillment, and shipping.\nSHIPPING\nShipping will be collected after the campaign has completed with our pledge reward survey.  Here's an estimated cost of shipping based on number of sets of 7 dice.  Actual shipping will vary based on number and weight of add-ons and bonuses.\n Last but not least, Role 4 Initiative\u2122 would like to thank two groups of people:\n1) Our fans and customers that have supported us over the years.  Without you this would never be possible.  If you'd like to see sneak peeks of unlisted Stretch Goal colors or chances to win free dice, please join the  R4I dice Kickstarter group .\n2) Our friends at the Dice Maniacs Club who have been most supportive throughout our Kickstarter preparation.

At $12,750 we start unlocking expansion packs with new cards, rules, tokens, and gameplay mechanics! These expansions are included with your rewards!\nRubbin' is Racin' - Unlocked at $12,750 - Dare other racers to overtake you with this melee focused expansion. This pack expands what you can do with the Metal Scraps junk card, adding the Armor Plating upgrade, as well as the Wheel Scythes upgrade. It also allows an alternate rule for players to bring one metal scraps junk card with them to use as an unlimited use contraption to damage racers in the same space.  \nLube it Up - Unlocked at $13,500 - Get greased up and wonder why you never oiled your moving parts before with this messy expansion. This pack includes the Oil Can and Rubber Hosing junk cards, as well as the Grease Gun contraption which drops oil slick tokens on the map, forcing all players who pass them to avoid them or crash.  \nRampin' my Style - Unlocked at $14,250 - Jump over hazards instead of facing them head on with this lofty expansion. This pack includes the Ramp and Goggles contraption cards, as well as a new mechanic for dropping ramp tokens. These ramps allow you to make a drive check to jump over the next space on the board, but once its on the board, everyone behind you can use it too.  \nPit Stops - Unlocked at $15,000 - Top off your contraptions with this crafty expansion. This pack includes Junk Stand tokens which allow a player to draw two random junk cards as they pass by. Contraptions can now be made on the race track! This pack also adds the Autolube System upgrade which makes your racer handle better, more durable, but also more complex.\nJunkyard Derby is a card-driven steampunk racing board game from the makers of the Pure Steam series of roleplaying game resources. In Junkyard Derby, players construct a racing machine from components found in the junk pile and battle down the track to the finish line. \nCheck out the Rulebook \nExample Play Videos: \nYou need to build quickly, because anyone can race after the third round of play. There are four components every racer needs to race: chassis, wheels, steering, and propulsion. Each component has its own attributes; some are quick and flimsy, others slow and sturdy. \nOur unique card design lets you envision your racer! The base game includes four options for each slot, creating lots of racer combinations!  \nSo many options!\nOnce you've built your racer, hit the streets! \nThe basic track has 5 slots for random hazards!\nBut beware! The proprietor of the race didn't get permits, so there are plenty of hazards on the way to the finish line. These hazards may damage your racer or slow you down. Players can also target each other with effects to slow them down or damage their racers. While your racer is damaged, its attributes are reduced. Since it's made of junk, each time you take damage you roll to see if your racer falls apart. A failed check means your racer has a catastrophic failure, further reducing its stats...\nThis trope-heavy hazard can wreck your racer.\nFret not! These racers are expected to fall apart. They\u2019re made out of junk, after all.. You can stop to repair damage at any point during the race, removing some damage each turn. Or you can build yourself with a Pneumatic Jack contraption, and discard it to remove ALL damage during a repair. \nMost of the cards you find in the deck are Junk cards, which are worthless by themselves. If you combine them in innovative ways, however, you can build an upgrade for your racer or a contraption to battle on the streets.  \nTrade in a battery and magnet for an electromagnet!\nCombine metal scraps, a magnet, and a lens for a compass!\nThere are six characters to choose from. Each character has unique stats they add to their racer, regardless of the components used. Additionally, each character has two unique abilities--one to use during the Prep phase  of the game (such as stealing a component from a foe) and another while racing (such as the ability to repair one damage on the fly).\nThe Bedlamite is a hot-headed brute who steals cards and plows through obstacles.\nThe Ructioneer is a stubborn racer who can mulligan and use contraptions easily.\n2-6 Players\nAges 8+\n30 minutes\nJunkyard Derby is a game for two (2) to six (6) players ages eight (8) and up. It takes about 30 minutes to play. \nInside the box, the base game has a race track board, approximately one hundred twenty (120) cards, one (1) die, fifty (50) damage tokens, six (6) player tokens. Please note: the quantity and quality of items will change as stretch goals are unlocked!\nInitial mockup of contents\nJunkyard Derby is expected to have an MSRP of $40 USD.

And we've assembled an all-star roster of talent to bring them to you. All we need now is a show of support to make these dreams (and nightmares) into reality.\nThis Kickstarter project will fund no fewer than four separate books. Three of these are long-form prose fiction books, that have been out-of-print for a long, long while. We'd also like to produce a new book that's been a fan request for quite a while: a book of strange creatures and bizarre flora that have never seen before. And that's just the beginning.\nIn the remote corners of wilderness, in the far islands of undiscovered country, the darkest and palest of the thickets... there be monsters. To date, IRONCLAW has told stories about the elite masters far removed from the squalid villages below, all fighting their petty battles over power and money. BOOK OF MONSTERS introduces far darker things that can't be reasoned with.\nThe Book of Monsters project is led by Tempe O'Kun (Nordguard, Sixes Wild, Windfall) and Ursula Vernon (Digger, It Made Sense At the Time, the Sumatran Biting Pear).\nIn the course of Ironclaw's bronze history, we were fortunate to publish three novels. These books have long since been out of print and unavailable.  But no more! Your pledges will let us bring these books back, and better than ever. Fully revised, newly-typeset, and formatted for both print media and digital versions.\n\nThe Book of Legend project is led by Tempe O'Kun (Nordguard, Sixes Wild, Windfall) and Norman Rafferty (Ironclaw, Myriad Song, Urban Jungle.)\n\n\n With your support, we'll be able to bring more people on board. Long-time favorites such as Jon Ascher (Ironclaw, Urban Jungle), Erin van Hiel (Dream-Carver), Trent Halvorsen (Scars) and the proverbial more.

They just need to survive. But people don't need a reason to survive, either. They just need each other. Figure that one out, you've got a shot of understanding why we're all still here.\"\n- Tribeca Rockaway, sniper of the Dead Heroes gang\nNo one knows how long it's been since the world was blasted with nuclear radiation and became infected with the undead. Major cities were all but destroyed; transit is reduced to animals, wagons, and the occasional iron horse. The survivors of the Fall were the first strain of deviation from the human condition and were able to make it through the rapidly spreading epidemic.\nHumanity has just started to rebuild, but large sections of the world are still irradiated or completely overrun by the undead. Small communities come together in a world where the concepts such as \"democracy,\" \"freedom,\" and \"government\" are newly reborn. Finding a community of decent size in this world is rare; finding one that has any concept of equality or morality is rarer still. \nOh, and people have the unnerving ability to come back from the dead, regrown from the very virus that destroyed the world.\nThis is dystopia. The world is broken. It is up to you to pick up the pieces and make a new world from the remains of the old.\nDystopia Rising: Evolution is the latest edition of the Dystopia Rising post-apocalyptic tabletop roleplaying game, which quickly grew into a live-action sensation, and now comes full-circle back to it's tabletop roots. Onyx Path is pleased to update the earlier edition and incorporate elements from the live-action setting with Dystopia Rising: Evolution, a tabletop roleplaying game that presents a fresh and exciting take on the post-apocalypse genre. \nThe Dystopia Rising: Evolution Kickstarter campaign is designed to enable us to create a hardcover core rulebook that will introduce the world, as well as setting up room for expansion and further exploration of the setting. We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores. \nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, evocative cover image, and full-color interior art. We estimate the book to be more than 250+ pages, and will be traditionally printed on high quality paper stock.\nCover design subject to change.\nDystopia Rising: Evolution will be powered by Onyx Path's Storypath system, and includes all the rules you need to play as a survivor in the post-apocalypse, including rules for creating characters for up to 24 different Strains, variations on humanity that survived the Fall. It also has details on the powers of faith and psionics, along with advice on running action-adventure stories, webs of personal intrigue, or procedural investigations. And, finally, dozens of antagonists, including a variety of zombies and raiders to use in your series.\nChapters include:\n Chapter One \u2014 A New Age: A look at the background of Dystopia Rising: Evolution, including some insight into the people that live in this post-apocalyptic world. \n Chapter Two \u2014 Your Brothers and Sisters: The survivors of the Fall can be categorized into eight Lineages, which each have a handful of Strains that fight to reclaim the world that was destroyed. \n Chapter Three \u2014 Knitting the Flesh: How to make a character for Dystopia Rising: Evolution. \n Chapter Four \u2014 Rolling the Bones: The core rules of Dystopia Rising: Evolution, which stem from Onyx Path\u2019s Storypath system. \n Chapter Five \u2014 Acts of Violence: How to hurt people, and avoid being hurt. \n Chapter Six \u2014 Wild Wild Wastes: How to survive the variety of environmental dangers in Dystopia Rising, as well as rules for salvaging and scavenging items and gear.\n Chapter Seven \u2014 Birds of a Feather: You can\u2019t survive without making friends, and several factions and groups have popped up all over the wastes. \n Chapter Eight \u2014 What You Believe: Faith in a higher power, or in something else entirely, helps many survivors get through the harsh days and long nights. \n Chapter Nine \u2014 Brain Bleed: The Fall of humanity lead to a few benefits, including the discovery and cultivation of psychic potential. \n Chapter Ten \u2014 Campfire Stories: The Storyguide is the person who helps the players experience the world of Dystopia Rising. \n Chapter Eleven \u2014 Threats of the Wastes: Living in the wasteland is no picnic. If the weather and the lack of supplies won\u2019t kill you, the zombies and raiders will. \n Chapter Twelve \u2014 The Wasteland: No one is quite sure how things got to bad. But at least the new settlement of Philly del Phia offers a new chance for people to start fresh. \n Chapter Thirteen \u2014 Let the Dead Lie: Every story has a beginning. This might be yours. \nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Dystopia Rising: Evolution playtestmanuscript as backer-only updates.\nClick HERE to see the Manuscript Preview download links\nThe Storypath systemis Onyx Path's rules set designed specifically to allow the sort of rules scaling necessary to seamlessly enable players to play ordinary people as well as characters with psi powers, and everything in between.  \nThe basics of the Storypath system should be familiar to anyone who has played many other Onyx Path games of survival or personal horror, as it is a 10-sided dice pool system, where in order to resolve an action you basically roll a number of dice equal to the character's Skill + Attribute and must roll an 8 or better a certain number of times in order to succeed in the action. \nThat is the very basic resolution system, but we expand on that to further enhance how your gaming group can build their stories. Failing to hit your number of successes, or having more successes than your required amount, are built-in options in the rules. Here is a handy graphic that illustrates what we mean:\nTo further explain the basics of the Storypath system, here is a small PDF download that goes into more detail: SYSTEM PREVIEW PDF.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Dystopia Rising: Evolution that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful hardcover book to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Dystopia Rising: Evolution, possibly expanding into supplements or other accessories, as well as possibly building a portal for more community development. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore this shattered world.\nThirdly, we want to celebrate and build on the existing Dystopia Rising fan base, further exploring and developing the world that they've built and forging a shared and strong community. We'll have opportunities for some crossover and integration as we move forward by presenting special Reward Tiers and Stretch Goals.\nBeyond all of those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world \u2014 and like our protagonists, this creed binds us with with common purpose. When you back this project, you join our burgeoning society and we evolve and grow together.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($20,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to see a LARGER version of this chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nKey Decision: do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version, or go all in with the Hardcover + PDF reward? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the DIGGER and TOY BOX Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!)\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Dystopia Rising: Evolution campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (\"MASS GRAVE\") will get 5 copies of the hardcover book, PDF, and Reference Screen at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nSeveral Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a Creed symbol enamel pin to an opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind Dystopia Rising artifact. We also have tiers with BOOK PLATE Stickers which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL (either as a human survivor or a decaying zombie), as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Dystopia Rising: Evolution core book or a possible supplement. Finally, a limited number of premium slots to play in a tabletop rpg session with the Onyx Path creative team at Gen Con 2019, or with Michael Pucci at 2019 Midwinter Convention in an event that will bridge the continuity between the LARP and Dystopia Rising: Evolution timeline. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Dystopia Rising: Evolution. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates once per week. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nClick here for Backers-only manuscript previews\nCREED SYMBOL ENAMEL PIN - An enamel pin of one of the nine in-game religious affiliations. \nREFERENCE SCREEN - a sturdy three-panel Dystopia Rising: Evolution screen featuring evocative art on the outer side, and a selection of charts and other info on the inside to make the Storyguide's job a little bit easier.\nREFERENCE CHARTS  - a PDF version of the charts from the Reference Screen. \nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013 All PDF products will be fulfilled through our partners at DriveThruRPG.com, the largest RPG download store. For Dystopia Rising: Evolution, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the hardcover has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards. \nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run.\nAll PDF rewards will be fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. PDF reward Add Ons can be added to any Reward Tier.\nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional hardcover books, screens, pins) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of the Dystopia Rising: Evolution core rules (Reward Tiers of $50+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when the hardcover book becomes available.\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\nUNLOCKED! - KICKSTARTER BACKER T-SHIRT - hosted on the Redbubble store for a limited time, a Dystopia Rising: Evolution -themed shirt at a steep discount.

To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Dystopia Rising: Evolution is finished, initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support":

Ideal for displaying on your person, dice bag, game gear, or even a hat!\nWe are looking for your backing to fund this set of badges!\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNEW STRETCH GOAL ANNOUNCED!  \nHaving unleashed the cults of the Mythos, we're now proud to announce a stretch goal badge - The Esoteric Order of Dagon badge!  \nStretch Goal Target \u00a33500\nEsoteric Order of Dagon  \nDuring the 1830s, Captain Obed Marsh traded with the degenerate natives of an unnamed Pacific island. Through their chief, Walakea, he learned terrible rites that would allow him to summon Deep Ones. Returning to his native Innsmouth, Marsh founded the Esoteric Order of Dagon, a secretive cult that has since spread its fell influence throughout the entire town.\nALL BACKERS (apart from folk selecting the No Reward pledge level) will receive the Esoteric Order of Dagon badge completely FREE as part of their rewards!\nWe have just one pledge level for this Kickstarter. If you're quick to the party (or cult gathering, if you prefer), you can get the badge set at a small discount! This early bird will not be available after 100 backers have pledged for them!\nWe've just released a very special and VERY LIMITED pledge level that includes the first set of Mythos Book Badges! Grab it while you can!\nThis set of five badges are made from die struck metal and hard enamel colors. Each badge comes with a butterfly catch.  \nDesigned in house at Triple Ace Games, the Mythos Badges are a unique collectible item.\nServants of the Heretic Pharaoh\nWhat few fragments of lore exist concerning Nephren-Ka speak of him as an insane pharaoh who instigated abolished the old faith in favor of dark rites honoring a monstrous deity. After his death, the name of the great heretic was erased from the list of kings and queens, and all statues and inscriptions bearing his name smashed. A cult in his name still exists today. Its goal is to locate his earthly remains and return them to life so that he may start a new reign of terror.\nCult of the Black Hand\nThe Islamic sect known in the West as the Assassins were led by the Old Man of the Mountain. The Old Man was, in fact, an avatar of Nyarlathotep. None ever saw his full form, for it was wrapped in a voluminous black robe, save for his withered and blackened right hand. With a touch of this gnarled limb he could bestow his worshipers with supernatural abilities or condemn them to a grisly death.\nIlluminated Fraternity of the All-Seeing Eye\nWhereas many cults appeal to those at the lower end of the social spectrum, the Illuminated Fraternity counts among its ranks businessmen, politicians, and military officers, plus a few aristocrats. The cult has a single goal\u2014authoritarian world domination. Nations and religions will be swept aside in favor of worship of the All- Seeing Eye, a single global government, and a common language.\nBlack Scorpion Brotherhood\nFounded in Predynastic Upper Egypt during the rule of a king known to modern Egyptologists as Scorpion I, the vile cult not only remains strong today, it has spread beyond Egypt. The Brotherhood (which accepts women) has no real unity and no long-term goals. Instead, members are encouraged to engage in their wildest desires and perversions.\nElder Sign\nThe Elder Sign is a protective ward. Invoked as a hand gesture, it serves the same function as protection against the evil eye or crossing oneself \u2014comforting, but ultimately without benefit. Carved into something solid\u2014rock, glass, wood, or even precious metal\u2014enchanted with magic, and worn openly, it provides a defense against the minions of the Great Old Ones.\nWe understand that you may wish to get 2, 3, or even 4 sets of badges for friends, family, or fellow cultists! \nWe've got you covered with that! We've even given you a little saving on additional sets! How do you include add-ons?

As a setting book, Imperial Jupiter offers the detail, iconic NPCs, and story hooks you would expect from a Rocket Age product.\nLearn more about Rocket Age RPG from Why Not Games.\nAncient Artwork in Imperial Jupiter by ReOnna Smith\nExplore the sky islands of Jupiter, brave the terrors of the Great Red Spot, and descend into the fiery heart of the planet where the temperature and pressure can crush a rocket ship like a tin can. The Jovians are given some love throughout this chapter and the rest of the book, as is right since Jupiter is their planet. Or is it? Alien species are coming to Jupiter in small numbers, but once there they tend to stay. The Jovians have only recently emerged from hiding in the depths of the planet's atmosphere only to discover that they are not alone.\nWhen you're done return to the Anglo-American Air Docks to rest and refit, or find all new types of trouble in the hanging warrens of Down Below or the politically charged halls of diplomats and businesses. The Docks are the central hub for games set in the Jovian System, a place to seek adventure as much to find it. Tell Rainsong we said, \"hi\".\nImperial Jupiter is more than just a single planet, the major moons offer danger and adventure, wealth and death in equal amounts.\nEuropan Food Artwork in Imperial Jupiter by ReOnna Smith\nIo is a post-apocalyptic wasteland of marauding mutants and dangerous monsters. Explorers come here to loot the ruins of Io from before the Europans blasted the moon, and hope they do not fall prey to the toxic environment or the deadly creatures that inhabit it, not to mention the Ioites themselves. Some of the greatest dangers on the moon are weapons left over from the war that ended Io's rise to challenge Europa for supremacy.\nFungi Artwork in Imperial Jupiter by ReOnna Smith\nGanymede is a cool forested moon where all life is plant or fungus based. There is a war growing on Ganymede as the natives battle Earthlings and others who have come to exploit rich timber and mineral resources. Not only do we detail the moon, but also we give information about the native Ganymedians. Watch out for the thorn-elk.\nThorn-Elk Artwork in Imperial Jupiter\nEuropa is off limits to all other species, but in lieu of visiting that planet Imperial Jupiter reveals the secrets behind the Europans. Their origins, their government, technology, and even their fie separate sexes are detailed. Questions long asked, such as what the Europans are up to, why they are so odd, and what planet will they disintegrate first are answered.\nNew equipment and character traits provide something for everyone. There are new toys for Europans, Jovians, and Ganymedians to play with, and examples of the cutting edge of Earthling technology. Included in the latter are the deadly Volksuntertasse II of the Nazi rocket force.\nDeath Worm in Imperial Jupiter by ReOnna Smith\nThe life of Jupiter is bizarre and does not fit into the categories Earthlings have founded their science on. Then again, the walking and talking plants of Ganymede turn standard theories of biology and evolution on their ears. It might be best that we don't even talk about the strange and terrible mutant beasts that haunt the wastelands of that moon. Of course we discuss all of these and more, each creature offered with stats, story hooks, and stunning artwork by ReOnna Smith.\nFunds\nThe money we raise from this kickstarter will pay the artists, the editor, printing costs, shipping in the United States, and distribution fees.  Layout of the book is by Krystal and writing by Ken, co-owners of Why Not Games. From the day we bought back the IP and started Why Not Games, we have been looking forward to and working towards this next book of the Rocket Age series. \nFollowing the fulfillment of this kickstarter we will release Imperial Jupiter, a source book for Rocket Age RPG, in print and PDF though Drive-Thru RPG, Studio 2, and our webstore.\nShipping Information\nDriveThruRPG.com is our print on demand supplier.\nWe are working with Studio 2 for order fulfillment.

Out of those only 12 actually went through. For each failed refund we received a red (maybe orange) error message stating the card on file for the backer wasn't up to date."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "What went wrong?", "update_content": "What happened?\n\nThere will be no throwing people under the bus, finger-pointing, or deflection in this update. This is all from my, Shawn Hilton\u2019s, point of view, and the other creators can chime in if they disagree or clarify things if I am off base.\n\nI believe the single biggest reason for Legacies failure was its success.\n\nThe original idea was a 4-6 hour adventure with the potential to expand it to around 3 sessions of gameplay and possibly 4 sessions for some groups that really embrace roleplaying.\n\nAs the Kickstarter grew financially this fun, simple, relatively short adventure began growing and mutating into something completely different than the original vision. Which I take the blame for. As it grew and grew I fully encouraged \u201cand we can do this, and we can expand that, and we can revamp that portion into 3 new adventures\u201d. The snowball grew from something easily tossed around into one hand until it was an avalanche enveloping everything.\n\nThe original vision could have been done by four friends and easily delivered on time. What we wound up with would have challenged a full-time crew of professionals, in my opinion, who made their livelihoods from writing and producing gaming material.  It outgrew and outpaced our abilities. Yet, at the time I don\u2019t think a single member of the team could see that. We still thought we were handling that one snowball and tossing it around and didn\u2019t notice that the avalanche behind us was about to engulf us.\n\nWith the original idea I and the rest of the crew would have sat down at a blank screen and said \u201c10 pages here we go\u201d, and we could have and would have conquered that material in a week or two. Instead, we sat down at our computers and said \u201c120 pages for this one campaign which was always designed as an adventure, and then this extra adventure, and that extra adventure\u201d. The weight of those pages just became overwhelming as each day seemed to make it heavier, then the original deadline passes and the weight doubled, and each passing week it just gets heavier and heavier until you\u2019re fingers are completely immobilized, your brain is locked, and you\u2019re dreading even looking at a keyboard and monitor.\n\nThe growth also led to massive internal problems with the adventure itself. What started as a film crew accidentally stumbling upon the treasure of Dracula and at the very end learns the twist ending of what really happened to the man/myth (I was about to type up the spoiler ending and stopped myself\u2026maybe some point in the future it still happens) turns into a two-decade, globe-trotting, adventure that made no sense how one film crew would have done it all. Now keep in mind all the amazing art that we paid for upfront was based on those characters, and now, after months, we had to agree that it just didn\u2019t work as that fun romp for those characters. Instead, we had to create an entirely new theme that would fit a model that would allow the characters to age over 10 to 15 years, give them the ability and reason to begin travel in Europe, then head back to the U.S. for three adventures (and it turned into 4 and the 5 adventures before we were done), and then head back to Europe for at least another 2 if not 3 adventures before we finally got to the finale.\n\nThe Legacy of Darkness had taken on its own name as it grew from a single action-adventure romp into a massive campaign that would have been more akin to and Adventure Path instead of a single adventure.\n\nYet, we still hadn\u2019t thrown in the towel. We\u2019d create a version of the adventure where the players could play our favorite film crew during sections if they wanted as one-shots, but the main campaign would now be designed for a group of college students in the middle of their studies. A lead-in adventure would kick off in Europe where they would have a major historical find and bring it back to their college, and from their things would kick off with adventures spanning the United States (New York, Chicago, and Louisanna were all destinations, and then I was going to jump in with another adventure as well).  The college students would be from Miskatonic so that Cthulhu fans could enjoy playing around campus.\n\nAll of that evolves from changing the basic premise of a simple action-adventure to this behemoth campaign.\n\nThat then led to the fact that we had to have new art commissioned to make it all work, a character creation guide for a student who would age 10 to 15 years over the campaign, and the myriad of other things that one small change here would cause to cascade into chaos down the line of adventures.\n\nEven at this point, I think we were all still on board and thought \u201cwell it\u2019s not going to be easy, but we can do it\u201d. I had finished a first draft of the first European section, Mike had playtested his first adventure that would kick things off, and then we started playtesting Nich\u2019s adventure when we realized we had to tighten up all the installments so they could fit seamlessly together, but one minor change in one adventure would force major changes in another adventure.\n\nAdventure wise an ironclad outline would have helped, but as we added adventures tweaks had to be made and with the story now reaching out over nearly two decades as opposed to a weekend we had to figure out if character X had kids, how old those kids were, when did character Y die and did his kids keep the book that joined peoples souls to a master soul if they signed it in blood, and then it had gone from an adventure into a genealogy course.\n\nThen there was real-world stuff, but that\u2019s boring and everyone in the world faces the real-world stuff. Let\u2019s just say that the real world began to infringe on the time that was available to delve into Dracula\u2019s treasure and how it destroyed all those that possessed it.\n\nEventually, Mike had to bow out for very legitimate reasons. I still work with Mike nearly every week, we\u2019re all great friends, but he had to step back and leave. That shifted more work around and plates got heavier as they filled up with more writing chores. It also left us without our Savage Worlds guy to do the conversions.\n\nAt this point, the avalanche had fully enveloped us and we were now trying to swim out, and while I was still eager to make it happen the nuggets of doubt had finally crept into my head. In my own head I was hearing \u201cgame over man, game over\u201d, but I was going to fight it out some more. Eventually, I had to admit that I could do this. It could get done. However, it wouldn\u2019t be what you had originally envisioned, it wouldn\u2019t be the same adventure that you had sold (fun movie crew action-adventure romp to 15 years of college kids growing into the fields of expertise and traveling the globe), and at this point, you\u2019re not going to be able to deliver this thing until around December of 2022. I also knew that growth wouldn\u2019t stop there. At some point in an adventure, I was going to realize that Professor Armitages prot\u00e9g\u00e9 had left the key to the restricted section in his dorm while he was trying to impress that cultist dedicated to Vlad Tepes, and that meant this entire section had to be re-written.\n\nIt was and is time to admit that the idea of the creation had outgrown the ability of the creators to contain it, and much like Wilbur\u2019s brother in the Dunwich Horror things were going to end messy.\n\nI believe that success led to the failure of Legacy.\nI believe that the inability to limit myself to the original simple idea led to the failure of Legacy.\n\nMy piece of advice to others who want to go down this path: Keep it simple.\n\nWe have processed around 20 refunds so far.\nI checked the funds this morning and it shows as PENDING.\nI am not sure how long it takes to go from pending to completed, but I\u2019ll keep on this.\n\nHowever, nearly 1 out of every 5 refunds  were rejected by Kickstarter because they didn\u2019t have updated info from the backer. Please make sure your information is up to date with Kickstarter."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "REFUNDS", "update_content": "EVERYONE that wants a refund will receive a refund.  \n\nTo get the refund process going we ask you to request a refund in the comments and we will process them in the order they come in. The reason for this is simply due to the amount of money on hand versus what is owed. Some people are going to be more patient than others and some will want to make sure they get refunded as quickly as possible. It will just take a little time to cover the difference in what is owed and what money is on hand.\n\nEvery refund will be made before the end of the year (and we have every intention of getting them all paid much quicker than that).\n\nThat is the official Danger Magnet! Statement.\n\nNow from me personally (Shawn Hilton).\n\nA few people, mostly personal friends, have reached out to let us know we can have all the time we need to finish the project.  That is incredibly generous, but progress has faltered to the point that it is just embarrassing at this point and I would rather put it out of its misery.\n\nFor those hard-core friends and fans that want to stick around, I can offer up some hope for future adventures. I have until the end of the year to produce new material for the Ubiquity System or I breach (and likely lose) my contract there. This would activate a termination clause that would cost me more money. If you have an interest in continuing your backing and putting it towards that project more info will follow soon.\n\nAgain EVERYONE that wants a refund will receive a refund regardless if you\u2019re a stranger, a friend, or family. I will personally cover all refunds by the end of 2020 and highly likely sooner than that.\n\nA final note for this post.

Reign presents a world that isn\u2019t in immanent danger of being destroyed\u2014it\u2019s a world full of complex cultures, old grievances, religions in conflict and sullen old schools of wizardry that can crisp off your arm. In addition to the usual FRPG heroics and enchantment, it has a system for statting up nations, or cults, or secret conspiracies and resolving their broader conflicts, instead of just leaving the fallout of their clashes to GM narration.\nReign first edition was released way back in 2007, self published by Greg Stolze, with a stunning layout design by a then-new designer name Daniel Solis, and art by Langdon Foss. In the 11 years since it was first published, the hardcover edition is long out of print, and it's been supported by a series of PDF releases from Greg. \nThe time has come to bring it back, in an updated, expanded, polished, reorganized, full color version. The new edition of Reign contains the vast majority of the  supplementary material that Greg's created in the last 11 years, a decision which led us to split to the game into two books, Reign: Rules and Reign: Realms. Together, the two books constitute almost 500 pages of RPG goodness! \nIn addition to general cleanup, Greg has strived to modularize the rule and make it easier to get exactly the game you want. In this edition, we say \u201cIf your group wants highly detailed tactical combat with loads of options, use Options A and B. If they just want it to be one element amongst skullduggery and political intrigue and low comedy, just use C.\u201d You can pick what the rules magnify to make the rules right for your group\u2019s adventures. This applies to chase, intrigue and other rules systems as well. \nFinally, we're revising the layout (while absolutely striving to maintain the fantastic feel that Daniel Solis' first edition had) and going full color, with all new art! \nThis is Reign 2E. \nReign presumes you have a \u201ccompany\u201d\u2014some organization of followers and property that the PCs govern. It can clash with enemy groups in a way that a rag-tag team of heroes just can\u2019t, though the actions of the players\u2019 characters usually offer big boosts (or penalties) to company rolls. If you take a whole adventure to set up your roll to change hearts and minds in a rival country, you\u2019re far more likely to succeed. On the other hand, it also lets you play the kind of game you want by offloading some tasks onto your underlings. For example: Imagine a game with elements of investigation and elements of big hairy fights. One group that lives for detective work could do all their own spying, then have a mighty army for their company. Once they know where and what the enemies are, they just write a memo to the generals and have a lovely dinner on the back deck. A different group might LOVE the combat elements but find the spy stuff confusing or tedious. They could build a company that\u2019s full of spies and diplomats, and use them to ferret out the secrets, which they then dispatch personally.\nReign is powered by the One Roll Engine. You roll a pool of ten sided dice and look for matches. If you\u2019re trying something simple and straightforward, any pair (or set of three, or more) gets it done. With four dice, you have a 50/50 chance. But the neat part is that you can pull more information out of a single roll, because every successful set has two pieces of information embedded in it\u2014how many dice turned up in the set, and what the number is that they matched on. We call this \u201cheight\u201d and \u201cwidth.\u201d If you get three nines, the width is three and the height is nine. It\u2019s a bit like poker. A pair of tens beats a pair of eights, but three deuces beats any pair. In Reign, however, height and width can mean different things. Sometimes you want a wide set, sometimes you want a high set. Would you rather do a lot of damage to a target\u2019s leg, or a little bit to its unprotected head? The engine makes those sorts of decisions quick, easy and intuitive. It\u2019s particularly efficient for fantasy combat. You roll one set of dice and it tells you (1) whether you hit or missed, (2) how quickly you acted, (3) how hard your shot was and (4) where you hit the enemy. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the One Roll Engine.\nAs mentioned above, we've split Reign into 2 books to more efficiently present all of the material. The two books are Reign: Rules and Reign: Realms. \nReign: Rules \nThe game part of Reign consists of rules that balance complicated outcomes with simple inputs. Resolution is just one throw of the dice, but each result is rich in meaning, giving you a lot of options and meaningful choices without slow handling time. The centerpiece is a system for statting up your fictitious church, state or thieves\u2019 guild so that the important decisions are played out together, not left in for a Game Moderator to decide. \nReign: Rules will be an approximately 172 page full color book, 3-board smythe-sewn case-bound, printed on 70 lb. matte paper. UPDATE: Paper stock is now 80 lb. due to unlocked stretch goal.\nReign: Realms\nA sprawling, brawling, world of cultures in conflict and strange enchantment, Realms is the fertile soil from which the \u2018role playing\u2019 part of Realms can grow. It\u2019s a setting where even the geography is unexpected, where enchantment and superstition can undermine every social assumption, and where the players are not just the most interesting characters\u2014they can be the most important. Realms gives you enough stories for decades of gaming in a world that doesn\u2019t need to be saved, but desperately needs to be governed. \nReign: Realms will be a full-color book clocking in at roughly 304 pages, 3-board smythe-sewn case-bound, printed on 70 lb. matte paper. UPDATE: Paper stock is now 80 lb. due to unlocked stretch goal.\nWe're also going to produce Kickstarter-exclusive limited edition leatherette versions of both Reign 2E books. Rules will feature a red faux leather, and Realms will be bound in blue. They'll both be gold-foil stamped and embossed with Daniel Solis's evocative cover art from the first edition of Reign. \nReign: Realities contains all of the new settings and capstone essays that we unlock through the rest of the campaign, all in full color. We're making it available as an add-on for any tier, and we've settled on an add-on price of $20 (plus separate shipping billed in our pledge manager, as with the main campaign books). This price will stay consistent for Kickstarter backers no matter how large the book gets, it if goes hardcover, etc. The current contents and current estimated book characteristics can be seen below. \nFinal Estimated Book: 160 pages, hardcover full color. \nTo add Reign: Realities to your backer tier, just adjust your monetary pledge amount up by $20.00. It's that easy!\nOur initial funding goal of $35,000 is designed to cover the raw costs of the production process. It'll pay for all the brand new color art, the layout and design (done in house by Hal Mangold), and the printing of the book. We have our printer lined up, and the costs specced out. If we hit our initial funding goal, Reign 2E becomes a reality, with a projected publishing date of August 2019, just in time for Gen Con.\nWe hope you'll help us get there!  Please help us spread the word about the campaign on social media using the hashtag #HowWillYouREIGN. We'd also love to hear stories of how your games of Reign have gone in the past, how you've used or hacked the system, of how you'd like to do so in the future. \nWe're now basically funded, and ready to move on to stretch goals! We have two types of stretch goals, funding goals and backer goals. \nThe current funding stretch goals are listed below with blue banners. The first three all add more written material to the Reign, Second Edition project. Currently these are all electronic/PDF goals, but if we fund enough of them, a print version is a distinct possibility. Our fourth goal adds a optional cool slipcase/GM screen add-on to the project. \nAfter those goals, you'll see a set of backer stretch goals with purple banners. Those goals are tied to how many backers we get on board with the project, and add new cool upgrades and improvements to the books. \nBy Jose Garcia.

With that in mind, we're enlisting a variety of game designers and writers to pen a set of what we're calling \"Capstone Essays\". These are articles that basically spin off on what Reign might do as a capstone or alternate rule-set for a different game, genre or approach. They'll be included in both the electronic and physical print version of Reign: Realities. \nUNLOCKED Since we hit $55,000 in funding, we'll include the first three Capstone Essays from: \nRoss Payton, co-host of the Ennie Award winning Role Playing Public Radio (RPPR), and author of Base Raiders and Zombies of the World.\nRobert Bohl, creator of Misspent Youth: Teenage Rebellion in a Fucked-up Future.\nDennis Detwiller, an Ennie and Origins award-winning artist, writer and game designer who you may know from such RPG properties as Delta Green, GODLIKE, Wild Talents, and Better Angels.\nBy Allan Goodall Click here for descriptions of all unlocked Reign: Realities.\nUNLOCKED Since we hit $57,500 in funding, we\u2019ll produce Silver Pavilion as a fully illustrated PDF expansion to Reign, Second Edition, and add it to the Reign: Realities print book.\nBy Lisa Padol Play leaders in a modern magical school -- whether we're talking Utena or Harry Potter or Raven Boys. Lead a club or a clique as a student. Be a department head as a teacher. In this world, nothing important is ever just one thing. The student council secretly vies for control over the city or the world. The school's football team might be the foot soldiers counting coup against their opponents or they might secretly be cultists or an experimental group of golems or robots. The theater club might be made up of slumming fae folk on vacation. Perhaps the trophy for a particular athletic contest is also the Holy Grail. Or the giant diamond that the Physics Department uses to create new particles is also an ancient Sumerian artifact stolen from the History Department -- and the History Department wants it back!\nUNLOCKED Since we hit $60,000 in funding, we\u2019ll produce Enchanted Education as a fully illustrated PDF expansion to Reign, Second Edition, and add it to the Reign: Realities print book.\nBy Tracy Barnett Raganrok has stalled.

Over a century ago, a revolution shattered the arcane force powering the empires of old and scattered its pieces among the people. Now, in the bustling city of Hecantz, political machines known as Foundations battle for mystical superiority at the ballot box, and you and your friends will play those embroiled in the fight. Whether your Company chooses to join the Foundations or go it alone, winning the hearts and minds of the people of an ancient, living city will be tough. Dealing with the secrets that lie in its underbelly will be even tougher.\nUNLOCKED Since we hit $70,000 in funding, we\u2019ll produce Get Out the Vote as a fully illustrated PDF expansion to Reign, Second Edition, and add it to the Reign: Realities print book.\nBy Lochlan Sudarshan The year is 1999. Giving birth to live young is an eccentricity. If you hear someone is live-born at a party or as a rumor, you\u2019ll eye them with amusement, like hearing they make their own mayonnaise. You guess there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, but why bother? StorkCo\u2019s been prime-delivering funky fresh and flawless babies longer than anyone can remember without the need for stretch marks or waiting or the risk of Tay-Sachs or sickle cell or whatever you vaguely remember hearing about in history class. There\u2019s no more scarcity or hunger since anybody can download a StorkCo lab-grown veal Big Mac for a couple of bucks, but that\u2019s not to say no one has problems. In a post-scarcity world, information is king. People are always fighting over the rights to this or that in the news and some are even trying to block their own genetic templates from being copied and mass-marketed. \u201cInformation wants to be free,\u201d or at least that\u2019s what the reps from StorkCo say on tv. The Amish and the guys who yell at you on the subway feel differently. When you walk by ten people on the street with your face on the way to work, you\u2019re starting to think maybe they have a point.\nUNLOCKED Since we hit $72,500 in funding, we\u2019ll produce StorkCo as a fully illustrated PDF expansion to Reign, Second Edition, and add it to the Reign: Realities print book.\nUNLOCKED Since we hit $75,000 in funding, we'll include the final three Capstone Essays from these three game design luminaries:\nEmily Care-Boss: Creator of the ground-breaking games Breaking the Ice, Shooting the Moon, and Under my Skin (collected together as The Romance Trilogy) and has written for Hillfolk, Heroine, and collaborated on the ENnie award winning Bubblegumshoe, published by Evil Hat Productions.\nMatt Forbeck: New York Times-bestselling author and game designer. He has over thirty novels and countless games published to date.

Justin also co-created the Exalted RPG, and has contributed to Werewolf, Mage, Promethean, Trinity, Changeling, Ravenloft, and other titles. \nBy Caleb Stokes In a time before recorded history, the immortal masters of Nagalisitu blighted the world to fuel the dark ritual that transported their malignant kingdom of decadent sorcery into another realm. Locked away in a dimension of their own twisted design, the primordial wizards became gods outside of space and time, isolating themselves to study the profane, arcane mysteries free from the interference of the humanity they had left behind. It took centuries for the world to recover from the unnatural excision of the Nagalisitu lands, but their influence has haunted every civilization since. Every few decades, entire villages went missing in the night, gone without trace save burned buildings and slain elders. These unfortunates are the \"Reaved,\" abducted by the Nagalisitu to serve as slaves in their hellish kingdom. The disappearances have always been seen as unpreventable tragedy: the inexorable fallout of the sordid council\u2019s ascension, echoing forever through the ages. Until now.\nThe Nagalisitu have been felled by their own chattel. After generations of abuse and slavery, the descendants of the Reaved have revolted and slain their dark captors. However, the freed remain magically trapped in the Naglisitu realm despite their victory, unable to escape to our world and bereft of shared language, religion, and culture after centuries of oppression. The kingdom needs to import scientists, philosophers, generals, and merchants to build a new people before their shared trauma reduces the survivors to anarchy. Heroes from the outside world must bring aid, but culture is not easily stilled long enough to be engineered, especially amongst the weird distortions of the Naglisitu's corrupted time. The order in which assistance comes will shape the emerging people in drastic and unpredictable ways. Can the heroes grow a great civilization from the ashes of evil, or will their interference send its people collapsing into a new tyranny?\nUNLOCKED Since we hit $80,000 in funding, we\u2019ll produce Nagalisitu as a fully illustrated PDF expansion to Reign, Second Edition, and add it to the Reign: Realities print book.\nBy Paul Mitchener Early in the first century AD, a Roman legion vanished from the records. This legion, the Legio IX Hispana, took part in the invasion of Britain. Its last recorded presence in the historical records was in 108AD in Eboracum (modern day York). In the popular version of history, the legion vanished when it went north to put down an uprising of Picts in Scotland. \nBut that's not the real story. \nIn the Ninth Legion setting, the entire legion found itself transported to another world, which they called Arcadia. In Arcadia, magic and monsters are real, geography is sometimes fluid, and cursing an enemy is a dangerous thing to do. The Romans were not the first group to cross over- other Celtic tribes had already settled there. There was no way back, so the Romans also settled, and did their best both to continue their lives and impose their values in this strange place. A hundred years have passed since the Romans first arrived, and the city of New Rome rules a province of the Empire on another world. The player characters are Agents of the Ninth\u2014imperial intelligence operatives with the duty of dealing with threats to New Rome that the army can't deal with. Some of these threats are open, some covert, some external, some internal. Agents of the Ninth include people from throughout Arcadia, not just the Roman parts; New Rome and the people of Arcadia share enemies, though relations are often strained or hostile.\nThe world of Arcadia, home of the Ninth Legion\nIf we hit $90,000 in funding, we\u2019ll produce Ninth Legion as a fully illustrated PDF setting for Reign, Second Edition. Due to its size, Ninth Legion will be produced as a separate book, and not included in Reign: Realities. All backers receiving electronic stretch goals will receive the PDF of Ninth Legion. \nNOTE: If unlocked, Ninth Legion may not release at the same time as the other 3 books. It's a sizable project, and may take a little more time to get done properly. \nUNLOCKED Since we hit 650 backers, we\u2019ll upgrade the paper stock for all Reign, Second Edition books from 70# matte stock to 80# matte stock.\nUNLOCKED Since we hit 700 backers, we\u2019ll add decorative colored endpapers to all Reign, Second Edition books.\nUNLOCKED Since we hit 750 backers, we'll add a swanky spot gloss to all standard edition Reign, Second Edition books, and gilt page edges to all Special Edition books. \nWe're currently paying our writers a good rate for the hobby games industry...but we can always do better! If we hit 1150 backers we'll raise the per/word rate for all of our writers, whether for Reign: Realities or Capstone Essays.\nAtomic Overmind Press is committed to supporting brick and mortar book and hobby retailers. We fully understand how Kickstarter and other crowdfunding platforms create new challenges for traditional retail stores, so we\u2019re taking steps to encourage retailer support of our products. Here are a few things we are doing.\n1. We know cash flow can be an issue, and most retailers don\u2019t want to tie up capital while you wait for fulfillment. With that in mind, you can become a retail backer of Reign 2E at the \"Mercantyler\" level to let us know you\u2019re interested in carrying the book, and during the BackerKit process you can adjust your order to fit what you need at that time.\n2. You\u2019ll get Reign 2E copies early, and you\u2019ll be able to sell for at least 30 days before it hits distribution.\n3. In-store, freight-free pickup option for backers local to you: You\u2019ll have the option to add your store\u2019s name to our Retailer Backer List for in-store pickup (US stores only). If you do, any of our backers can save the cost of shipping their books by picking their Reign 2E rewards up at your store. Yes, we need their support pledge to make Reign 2E happen, but you will have the opportunity to expose a potential new customer to other products and accessories your store has to offer. Both you and the backers local to you will need to coordinate with each other ahead of shipment. We\u2019ll provide the list of participating stores in an update as we get closer to the release.\nShipping. It's the biggest wildcard and largest misunderstood cost of any crowdfunding project.\nWe've chosen not to fold shipping costs into the reward tiers for this campaign, and have reduced the pricing on those tiers accordingly. Shipping will be charged using Backerkit when we are finally ready to get the project physically into your hands. Our shipping partners, Studio 2 Publishing, have extensive experience with Kickstarter fulfillment and will be able to provide us with the most economical methods to get your rewards delivered to you in proper shape.\nFor overseas backers, costs will naturally be higher, but we are committed to finding the best-cost solution possible for you. This includes finding and working with localization partners to ship the final rewards if possible. We cannot offer guarantees on what those prices will be. But if you trust us, we promise do the absolute best we can for you.\nAnd well you should ask!\nProject Author - Greg Stolze\nMy name\u2019s Greg Stolze, and I\u2019ve been writing RPG stuff for pay since 1996 so\u2026 you might know me from a LOT of stuff.

The British Empire, passing through an interdimensional portal, has found a new world, the Gruv, chock-full of resources and land to be exploited. In the process, though, they've run headlong into the Samsut, descendants of ancient Babylonians who've been living there for over three thousand years. Now the might of the Empire clashes with the weird science of the Samsut. The Saurids, a reptilian race native to the new world, contest with both empires to retain their ancestral lands. Who will control the Gruv? That's up to your battles to decide! The 1879 Miniatures product line is proud to introduce the British and Samsut Forcebooks, and new minis to go with them!\nSamsut Light Cavalry Lancer and Railgunner\nWe\u2019ve completed the writing and layout of the British and Samsut Forcebooks, and are Kickstarting the art and printing costs, using the same model we\u2019ve applied successfully to three previous books for the 1879 roleplaying product line. This time, we\u2019re also offering the minis you need to play the game as part of the Reward structure.\nThis volume describes the British military in an alternate world, where an interdimensional portal has given the Empire access to a new land, the Gruv. All the details you'll need to field advanced steam technology, special forces units such as the Marines and the Shock Troopers, a broad range of artillery, and military spellcasters are contained herein. Unleash the full might of the Empire against the weird science of the Samsut, and the primitive but effective weaponry of the Saurids!\nCover Mock-Up for British Forcebook\nDescendants of the ancient Babylonians, the Samsut came to the Gruv thousands of years ago through an interdimensional portal from our world, long since closed. In their new home, they found the remains of another civilization, which gave them weird science technology ranging from rail guns to contra-gravity to the use of life itself as an energy source. Herein are all the details you'll need to field regiments of technological zombies and skeleton warriors, airborne cavalry riding pteranodons, contra-gravity sleds that ignore terrain modifiers, and terrifying creations of the immortal Amelites who rule the Samsut city-states. The Children of Samsuditana shall not relinquish their home to the British invaders without a fight!\nCover Mock-up for Samsut Forcebook\nVictoria and Albert rule over a steam-powered British Empire that spans two worlds. Thanks to the portal known as the Rabbit Hole, a train ride away from London lies the Grosvenor Land (\u201cThe Gruv\u201d), a new world of fertile plains, towering mountains, giant insects, and Babylonians with weird science zombies. Seems they got there first, three thousand years ago, and they're not exactly the welcoming sort. The Saurid tribes, lizard-like folk who ride theropods and pteranodons, complicate matters further. Back home on Earth, clockwork engineering has brought mechanical computing to the world, and micro-steam engines drive airships through the sky. Stranger things are afoot, too, as a bit of magic seems to have come into the world with the opening of the portal. People are changing. Secret societies are finding their ancient occult practices a bit more effective. Who knows what might be lurking in the forests these days, or in that shipment from China?\nBritish Troops with Miasma Masks\nThe British Empire, expanding into the Gruv, has run headlong into the Samsut, who\u2019ve been there for three thousand years give or take. The Samsut have battery powered undead, and take the idea of \u201cwaste not, want not\u201d to its logical extreme. The British get twitchy about what they see as desecration of the dead. The Samsut call the British halayqirim, or ravagers, based on British technology and its ecological impact. The British call the Samsut, well, let\u2019s keep this family friendly and say that \u201cburking\u201d is a term you might want to look up. Of course they went to war. There\u2019s territory for colonization at stake for the British, defense of their homeland for the Samsut, and deeper issues of culture that diplomacy has thus far totally failed to resolve. Each side is bringing successively greater forces to bear on the conflict. What started out with infantry and cavalry is now reaching the level of artillery and troop carriers. Soon there will be armoured vehicles on the battlefield, airborne cavalry, and who knows what else?\nFurther plans for the line include a Vehicles Sourcebook, to detail the steam-powered mobile armour and airships of the British, and the sky chariots of the Samsut. We\u2019ll be bringing out Forcebooks for the Prussians, as they enter the battle ostensibly in support of the British but of course with their own agenda. The Saurids, the native race of the Gruv, will get their own Forcebook, along with a new line of minis. Later on, additional factions will include the Ottoman Empire and the Russians, and of course the Gruv\u2019s inimical wildlife will get a Creatures book so that the giant fleas that destroyed New Wigan can get their turn on the battlefield.\nSamsut Heavy Gunner with Six-Legged War Pig\nYes, there will be Stretch Goals. The first will be revealed at $4000.\nIn addition to the listed reward levels, we are happy to offer several add-ons to our generous backers.

From Silicon Valley startups to industrialist Super-PACs, from Oregon anarchist collectives to alt-right activists, from the depths of Reddit to this morning's livestreams, American life has entered a labyrinth of twisty passages all alike. And while there are many ways in, there is no way out.\nWritten by Delta Green co-creator John Scott Tynes, this all-new collection of organizations presents ready-made sources of allies, enemies, mysteries, and surprises for your Delta Green campaign. Each group has its own story arc, progressing through three stages as it encounters Delta Green agents and the evils they fight. Some groups corrode, wither, and die. Others gain hideous strength and uncover profound new horrors. Each has connections to other groups, ensuring that players find fresh hells at every turn. But all are destined to change \u2014 and the journey each one takes holds up a mirror to the agents themselves.\nBecause things fall apart. The center cannot hold. And once you enter the Labyrinth, you will never escape.\nDiscussion\nHear the authors of Delta Green discuss The Labyrinth\nGeek & Sundry profiles John Scott Tynes and The Labyrinth\nBrie Sheldon asks five or so questions of John Scott Tynes\nJohn Scott Tynes discusses The Labyrinth with Ross Payton of Role Playing Public Radio\nDelta Green: The Labyrinth will be a sourcebook for Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game, about 192 pages long, hardback, in full color. Written by John Scott Tynes, illustrated by Dennis Detwiller, designed by Simeon Cogswell, edited by Shane Ivey, and published by Arc Dream Publishing, The Labyrinth will join the ever-growing line of beautiful and terrifying sourcebooks for Delta Green.\nThe Labyrinth will contain brand-new factions for players to encounter. Some will be sources of friendlies, allies, and aid. When their exposure deepens due to contact with Delta Green agents, however, those people\u2019s lives and realities will corrode. A group that begins as an ally may end as a foe. Others will be enemy cults and monstrous exploiters of reality. Even those that start small may metastasize under investigation, gaining power and influence.\nWhile this is a faction book, the combinations of story arcs for each faction, and the connections between factions, mean that it can also serve as a de facto campaign. For groups with more self-directed players who like to chase down their own clues, The Labyrinth will be a narrative sandbox they can explore in multiple directions at once.\nThroughout, the point remains the same: the mosaic of American life is schisming before us and when exposed to the unnatural, and to the best intentions of Delta Green, it weakens and shatters. The Labyrinth portrays America\u2019s march towards the End Times in microcosm.\nCORE GOAL\u2014$27,000 (UNLOCKED): The Labyrinth in PDF and full-color hardback.\n$35,000 (UNLOCKED): A kit of handouts and props for The Labyrinth in PDF: props and clues related to the organizations of The Labyrinth: web pages, photos, police reports, maps, brochures, and other elements that diligent players can turn into their own walls of clues.

Born of the U.S. government\u2019s 1928 raid on the degenerate coastal town of Innsmouth, Massachusetts, the covert agency known as Delta Green opposes the forces of darkness with honor, but without glory. Delta Green agents slip through the system, manipulating the federal bureaucracy while pushing the darkness back for another day \u2014 but often at a shattering personal cost.\"\nIn Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game, the cosmic horror of the Cthulhu Mythos meets modern-day technothriller conspiracy. Delta Green postulates a secret group of men and women dedicated to investigating and neutralizing inhuman and supernatural horrors, misappropriating the resources of the U.S. government to wage a war that they must at all costs keep hidden. Delta Green has explored this world of secret horrors in dozens of game books, novels, and anthologies for over 25 years, winning awards and acclaim all along the way. Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game and the sourcebook A Night at the Opera were nominated for seven ENnie Awards in July 2018.\nLearn more about Delta Green in the free quickstart rulebook, Delta Green: Need to Know.\nJohn Scott Tynes founded Pagan Publishing and the magazine The Unspeakable Oath in 1990. He first wrote about Delta Green in \"Convergence,\" a groundbreaking scenario that appeared in The Unspeakable Oath issue 7 in 1992. The idea of Delta Green immediately seized the imaginations of gamers around the world. Tynes expanded it with co-creators Dennis Detwiller and Adam Scott Glancy in the sourcebooks Delta Green (1997) and Delta Green: Countdown (1999), both of which won Origins Awards. Tynes' novel Delta Green: The Rules of Engagement also won an Origins Award in 1999.\nTynes continued to advise the Delta Green creative team over the years as Pagan Publishing and Arc Dream Publishing created Delta Green: Eyes Only (2007), Delta Green: Targets of Opportunity (2010), and Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game (2016 to present). Tynes also wrote Arc Dream Publishing's Origins Award-nominated RPG Puppetland, and co-created Atlas Games' RPG Unknown Armies.\nIn an encrypted message left in an unlisted voicemail drop, John told us: \u201cAfter completing the new edition of Puppetland for Arc Dream last year and contributing to the new edition of Unknown Armies for Atlas Games, I found myself haunted by strange dreams of an America plagued by discord, ruled by monsters, and slouching towards one of several moral or literal apocalypses. Fortunately, none of that is happening in the real world, so this seemed like the perfect time to explore these completely fictional ideas in the world of Delta Green.\u201d\nWe're very excited to have John back in the world he was so fundamental in shaping.\nIn late 2015, Arc Dream Publishing ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to launch Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game. For the first time, Delta Green is its own game system, fully customized for the uniquely suspenseful and fearful experience that Delta Green scenarios offer. That campaign funded a long line of sourcebooks and adventures, many of which have now been published. We have produced over a thousand pages of new material for Delta Green since that Kickstarter project ended.\nThe final shape of Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game inspired John Scott Tynes to write The Labyrinth, his first new game material for Delta Green in many years. At the same time, illustrator Dennis Detwiller's most substantial work from that Kickstarter, writing the King in Yellow campaign Impossible Landscapes, will be done by the time John has finished The Labyrinth. The timing lines up perfectly. Other books\u2014Deep State, PISCES, Falling Towers\u2014and scenarios are in development by other writing teams. \nFunding for Delta Green: The Labyrinth will pay for its writing, editing, illustration, and design, and for printing it as a full-color, hardback book with the same high quality as the Agent's Handbook, the Handler's Guide, and other books in the Delta Green RPG line.\nWe love working on Delta Green. We want every new book or scenario to be even better than the ones that came before.

We take pride in the incredible amount of work we put into every project. Delta Green game books have occupied the top two spots in RPG.net's index of game reviews for many years. They have won Origins Awards and ENnie Awards. They have earned passionate praise from gamers around the world.\n\nThe estimated delivery dates are our current best estimates. When it comes to Delta Green, delivery dates are always in flux, but we ALWAYS deliver what we promise and then some. The Kickstarter for Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game proposed a 300-odd page hardback rulebook -- and delivered a mammoth slipcase set with a 192-page Agent's Handbook and a 382-page Handler's Guide. Backers should expect delivery of The Labyrinth to occur when the book is ready -- and they should expect it to be more than worth the wait.\n\nMost backers outside the U.S. are accustomed to high shipping costs for hardback books, and this one will be no exception. Our warehouses in the U.S. and the U.K. have to charge backers what it costs to actually deliver their books.

While the video is 40 minutes long, the first 5 to 10 minutes are hyper focused on the game and the contents of the campaign (but you can listen to the whole thing if you want!)\nThe Iconic Hero and paragon of the GallantVerse, Gallant! Art by Nicolas Giacondino\nCharacter creation is simple, fast, and exciting. You pick your character archetype based on the exciting stories your Game Master is going to tell, you pick a few Traits or Powers that each grant a single benefit, and you're done!\nFor the first time ever, a TinyD6 game will have it's own detailed setting, as we bring the GallantVerse to you!\n You can read more about the GallantVerse below!\nRyker Swift, aka Velocity! One of our Iconic GallantVerse Heroes. Art by Nicol\u00e1s Giacondino\nSometimes as the GM, you don't have time to plot lengthy, detailed worlds, but you want that experience. Well, we've got your back, and that support comes in the form of micro-verses and our signature setting, The GallantVerse! \nMicro-verses are short settings filled with adventure hooks, and designed to put your adventures and campaigns into high action-adventure.  \nOur goal is to fund a softcover edition, a limited number of hardcover collector\u2019s editions, and the Tiny Supers dice. We\u2019ve planned several stretch goals which will increase page count, add more art, add more special rules but all of our goals will provide you with more fun and engaging superhero tabletop content!\nYou might notice that our funding goal is much higher than previous TinyD6 Kickstarters. One of our goals with this project is to fund a full-color book, replete with gorgeous art from the very talented Nicol\u00e1s Giacondino, with posters and covers by a variety of talented artists. \nAdditionally, the writing on the GallantVerse is being handled by top industry talent. We're set on paying all our contributors well, and our goal reflects our commitment to an ethical pay rate for our writers, artists, and team members. \nPulsewave, one of our GallantVerse Iconics! Art by Nicol\u00e1s Giacondino\nTiny Supers uses a simple, fast, and dynamic ruleset to handle actions. The game uses up to three six-sided dice as part of action resolution.   \nIf you roll a \"5\" or \"6\" on a die, your check succeeds. Most checks are made with two dice. However, if you are deemed to have \"advantage\" on a roll, you gain a third die to roll. If you have disadvantage, you lose a dice (rolling only a single die).  \nCharacters are made quickly and easily. You will select a superheroic archetype (such as Paragon, Gadgeteer, Defender, Mastermind or more), three traits or powers, and write down some basic information and you are ready to play!\nBastion, one of our GallantVerse Iconics! Art by Nicol\u00e1s Giacondino\nIf you're familiar with the TinyD6 ruleset, you're probably wondering how Power Traits are different than Traits?\nWell, Power Traits are new traits that gain better versions of themselves as you take them again and again. Let's use an example, like Super-Speed (Alan's favorite power.) Super-Speed has 3 Tiers. The first time a Trait choice is spent to select Super-Speed. \nTier One: Any turn in which you move, you also count as having taken the Evade action.\nIf a Hero were to select the Super-Speed Power Trait again with a Trait Choice, they'd gain the Tier Two Power:\nTier Two: You can take a move action once per turn, without using up one of your two actions for the turn. \nIf they repeated it a third time, they'd gain the third and final power:\nTier Three: When you take a move action, you can move three times. \nAll the PowerTraits in Tiny Supers function on a level similar to this. There is a wide swath of powers, making almost any super imaginable!\nDarklight, one of our Iconic GallantVerse Villains! Art by Nicol\u00e1s Giacondino\nThe GallantVerse is the standard superheroic setting for Tiny Supers! Conceived by Alan Bahr, the GallantVerse is a near-future setting, where superheroes have recently come into being! \nThe GallantVerse is a setting focused on heroic and exciting heroes, with a slight science fiction bent and a focus on hope and optimistic heroism! All your favorite comic book angles are here, from mystical occultists, to mutants, to paragons of science and technology, and massive cosmic threats! We're hitting all the notes!\nOur core of the setting is the coastal city of Sentry City! A technological hotspot, Sentry City is the birthplace of superheroes and the central piece of the GallantVerse. \nAs the first cohesive core campaign setting for the TinyD6 line, GallantVerse is being overseen by Alan, with writing by an excellent troupe of freelancers!\nThe Eagle!

We've been early or on time every time. We have one project that's are not out to backers yet, but it's are on track (digital rewards are already out) and this project will not impact that one. This is a straight-forward project with some nuances, but we're prepared to handle them, and we're shooting for the same exceptional success we've already had!\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished? \nA: The draft text of all the rules is 100% done. All the art that isn't tied to stretch goals is in and done. The only text we're waiting on is the \"micro-verses\" and our stretch goals, and as we depend on the backers to determine what needs to be written, those will come throughout and after the Kickstarter.\n\nQ: What if the complexity of the project overwhelms GKG? \nA: We have straight forward pledge levels to make it easy to manage, and we've budgeted our stretch goals up to our cap. In order to keep the project manageable for our small team, we've elected to minimize our stretch goals to text increases, and we've set a finite limit of page count.\n\nQ: What about delays in art? \nA: We've already contracted and finished the core art for the game. Isn't it great? We're really happy with our artists. We've got some stretch goals for more art, but our artists are professionals. If there's a delay on the art, we have back-up artists we've already done test runs and are ready to work with.\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs? \nA: Shipping costs constantly rise, and while we've projected them to the best of our abilities, there's not a lot we can do if they change. However, due to the limitations on the size of our product, we're confident this won't be an issue.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals? \nA: If something were to happen to Alan, or another writer on the project, we've identified our backups, and our team is spread all over the world. It'd take a really big asteroid, zombie apocalypse or alien invasion to wipe us all out. The files and plans have been communicated to the whole team, and a new project lead (who has been identified) will step up.\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\nWe hold rewards for a year from fulfillment start date, before we can no longer promise that we'll be able to fulfill your rewards. We're a small company with limited space, and while we've never had an issue, it's better to be clear about our practices so you're aware. Once we start shipping, if your reward gets returned, or your fulfillment info wasn't provided, we'll give you a full calendar year and ship that reward for you. If it's after that year, we might not have it, or we might have to ask you to pay new shipping charges (shipping goes up a lot!)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Super Dice!", "descp": "You get 3 of the Tiny Supers d6 dice!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign, in BackerKit, and we ship all packages from the US.

Each has a personal reason to compete in the tournament, but one thread unites them all \u2013 to put their fighting skills on display and earn the right to be called champion.\nSainome Colosseum R is an ultra-accessible tabletop combat game for 2-4 players where opponents fight for glory in free-for-all battles, duos matches, or intense one-on-one showdowns. Incorporating distinct Japanese visual elements and innovative mechanics, Sainome Colosseum R features a roster of ten playable heroes\u2014each possessing two forms and multiple unique abilities\u2014and one hundred \"Sainome Cards,\" which comprise the game\u2019s many items, spells, weapons, and armor.\nUsing action selection, hand management, card drafting, and dice rolling, Sainome Colosseum R expertly blends strategy, luck, and balanced replayability to create a PvP experience that can be enjoyed by players of all ages and skill levels. With a run-time of 15-30 minutes and a learn-time of just 10, players can get into the action of Sainome Colosseum R quickly without ever having to pore over endless pages of rules. This approachable yet dynamic gameplay leads to exciting and fast-paced bouts that players will be hard-pressed to forget.\nSainome Colosseum R is a remake of MR Entertainment\u2019s very first card game, simply titled \u201cSainome Colosseum,\u201d and was developed after they received positive feedback about the original game and fan desires to see an expanded version of it. Thus, it\u2019s best to think of Sainome Colosseum R as the complete, or enhanced, edition of the original title.\nSainome Colosseum R is being translated into English and published in the West by LionWing Publishing, a localization company whose focus is on bringing Japanese tabletop games to the English market.\nDownload a full pdf copy of Sainome's rulebook here!\nBefore a match begins in Sainome Colosseum R, players must first choose their fighter out of the available ten. Once each player has chosen their fighter, they then place them in the center position of their Play Sheet. After all players have done this, they each are dealt ten Sainome Cards face down; each card represents 1 HP, and a character is eliminated when they no longer have HP remaining. When a character takes damage and loses HP, cards equal to the amount of damage dealt to them are drawn from their HP stack and into their hand. Note: Sainome Cards comprise the game's many weapons, items, spells, and non-character-specific skills.\nFrom there, players are dealt five Sainome Cards to create a starting hand, with the one-time option of discarding and redrawing any number of cards. After this is finished, all remaining Sainome Cards are shuffled and placed into a common deck between the players, and formal play begins.\nA player\u2019s turn is divided into two distinct phases: the Action Phase and the Discard Phase.\nACTION PHASE\nDuring the Action Phase, players may choose to perform up to two actions from the options listed below, in whatever order they wish:\nDraw Sainome Cards\nAttach Equipment\nUse an Instant Play Card\nAttack an Opponent\nUse a Character Skill\nPlayers may NOT perform the same action twice during a single turn.\nThere are four slots to the top, bottom, right, and left of the character into which Sainome Cards can be socketed. Only cards with attachment symbols that match those found on the Character Cards may be equipped in these slots.\nAttacking in Sainome Colosseum itself plays out seamlessly, with players merely needing to roll a die to determine which of their four slots is activated for the attack, with the roll of a 6 granting a special ability. If there is no Sainome Card equipped in the slot corresponding to the die roll, the attack misses. Once this attack roll is performed, damage and any combat effects are determined and applied. After players have activated a card through the aforementioned roll, that card is then removed out of its equipment slot and from play altogether. If the player who has just attacked has not used their second permitted action and decides that for that second action they would like to refill the now-empty slot with another weapon/spell/item, they may do that.\nDISCARD PHASE\nDiscard Sainome Cards from your hand on top of the discard pile. During the Discard Phase, if you have more cards in your hand than your hand limit allows (the hand limit is usually five), you must discard all extra cards to meet your hand limit. If you meet or have less than your hand limit, discarding is OPTIONAL, and you may discard any number of cards from your hand.\nAWAKENINGS\nCharacters begin the game in their Normal Form but may enter Awakened Form once character-specific conditions have been satisfied, such as dropping down to a certain HP threshold, when certain items are discarded, or if a particular die result is rolled. When these conditions are met, the Character Card is flipped to the Awakened Form side, granting new skills and different equipment symbols. Existing equipment cards attached to a character remain in place after the character enters the Awakened Form. The Awakened Form side of each Character Card is printed using a holographic foil effect, which is not only beautiful but also really allows for the more intricate designs of the characters' Awakened Forms to really pop.\nYou can see both Forms under the Heroes banner above and can tell the difference between the two by noting the special effects surrounding the character. Those with special effects\u2014or in some cases, those more special effects\u2014signify the Awakened Form of the character.\nSUPPLEMENTARY RULES FOR 3-4 PLAYERS\nIn a game with three or more players (not teams), a defeated player must discard all cards in their hand and all equipment cards attached to their character. On each subsequent turn, instead of performing two actions, the defeated player must roll a die and perform a retired action as listed below: \nRoll a 1: A miss - do nothing\nRoll a 2: Discard one card at random from a player's hand\nRoll a 3: Put one equipment card attached to a character back into a player's hand\nRoll a 4: Put one equipment card in the discard pile into a character\u2019s matching equipment slot\nRoll a 5: Move one HP card from a player\u2019s stack to the discard pile\nRoll a 6: Choose any retired action from 1-5\nVARIANT RULES\nComing up with variations on the rules is part of the fun of Sainome Colosseum. We have included three variants in the rulebook, one of which uses the enclosed Sugoroku Sheet (seen below in the components) to determine starting HP totals. For those unfamiliar with sugoroku, it is a classic Japanese board game that is the equivalent of Snakes and Ladders in the West.

Adding them to your pledge is easy: just manually add the dollar amount per copy of each add-on you would like to your pledge in the designated pledge box at checkout, and when the backer surveys go out, simply let us know which add-ons you paid for. Easy as that!\nExtra copy of Sainome Colosseum R: $30\nA copy of the promo character the Mysterious Masked Fighter/King + his matching Play Sheet: $7\nOur goal is to begin manufacturing on Sainome Colosseum R within 6 weeks of the campaign\u2019s end. That should give us time to do our final editing pass and for the illustrator and graphic designer to take care of Kickstarter-exclusive items. From there, here's what our timeline looks like, according to our printing company:\nProduction: 7-9 weeks\nFinal Assembly: 1-2 weeks\nFreight shipping from China to the East Coast: 5-7 weeks\nWe'll need to factor in holidays as well, so we're adding an additional week for that. To that end, we'd also rather err on the side of caution and just assume it's going to take the full length of time for each of these steps, rather than assume we're going to zip through them. So, taking into consideration the initial 6 weeks we'll need to complete the art for backers, we're looking at a total of 25 weeks, or January, but we're going to call it March because we still have to factor in fulfillment and shipping to all of you. So that's how we've come up with our timetable. We'll be updating you all each time a production milestone is achieved, that way everyone knows exactly where we are on our timeline.\nShipping: Shipping costs will be added to your pledge via the Kickstarter shipping system as indicated in the drop-down menu labeled \"Shipping Destination\" when choosing your pledge tier.\nFor our US backers, shipping is a flat $5 for the core game (of course, other tiers are a bit more due to the amount of items packed in). While we have reduced the cost of international shipping as much as possible, there\u2019s an additional shipping charge based on your location if you live internationally. (This cost does not factor in any duty or VAT imposed on the import, which backers will be solely responsible for.) \nTo offset the shipping costs internationally, we encourage folks to partner up and add on multiple copies of the game to an order so as to get the shipping discount. We also encourage folks to talk with their local game shops to see if they would be interested in pledging to the Retailer Bundle, as this would really offset shipping cost.\nHere's a more comprehensive breakdown of the shipping totals:\nLionWing Publishing is a localization company whose focus is on publishing Japanese tabletop games for the West. The games we localize are known for their gorgeous art and engaging gameplay, and our mission is to present these games through top-notch translation and production. We at LionWing also believe that tabletop games have the power to unite people; people of the same interests as well as different ones. As such, part of our goal is to unite both the tabletop gaming community and fans of anime, manga, Japanese video games, and Japanese culture. We plan to do this through conventions, our website (LionWingPublishing.com), social media, and our Discord. So, if you see us around, don\u2019t hesitate to chat, play a game with us, or give us the ol\u2019 head-nod-of-acknowledgment! We love meeting fellow gamers!\nMR Entertainment is a Japanese game creator team that specializes in creating analog/board/card games. Their focus is to create games that can be played easily in short period of time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve brought Sainome Colosseum R to Kickstarter nearly finished. Translation wrapped on the project in January, and now we\u2019ve turned to crowdfunding to help get the game printed. It's important to note that the game is already completely developed and has been on sale in Japan since last spring. (Which means that we cannot make any alterations to the art or mechanics.) Thus, our primary job, aside from the actual translation, has been to modify the format to account for the English text; this too is finished. All that's left for us to do is a final editing pass to ensure nothing was missed and that there are no lingering grammatical faux pas.\n\nThat being said, tabletop games are complex to manufacture, and thus hiccups can occur both in production and shipping, which can create delays. We've done our best to mitigate these issues already through research and developing worst-case scenario plans, but really, you can only prepare so much for something that A. hasn't happened yet, and B. involves a plethora of variables outside of your control.\n\nWith that in mind, we're working with Studio 2 Publishing for our shipping and fulfillment, as we know this is an area where many issues can occur. Our partnering with them on this will help ensure that things go as smoothly as possible. Furthermore, we'll also say this: we are motivated to work to minimize any issues and confront them head-on if they do in fact crop up at any point in this process. More importantly, though, if such issues do arise, we'll be transparent and make sure you all, the backers, know what's happening every step of the way and how we intend to address the situation.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Gladiator", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCopy of Sainome Colosseum R\nAll unlocked stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["153 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Arms Master", "descp": "The promo character and promo play sheet are only available for the Arms Master tier and above, and will not be offered as add-ons.\nINCLUDES:\n\"Bride in Black\" playmat (14\" x 24\")\nPromo Character, the Mysterious Masked Wrestler/King\nPromo Play Sheet featuring the Masked Wrestler/King chibi art\nCopy of Sainome Colosseum R\nAll unlocked stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["63 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "Tournament Elite", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nExclusive \"Fight for the Princess\" playmat (14\" x 24\")\n\"Bride in Black\" playmat (14\" x 24\")\nPromo Character, the Mysterious Masked Wrestler/King\nPromo Play Sheet featuring the Masked Wrestler/King chibi art\nCopy of Sainome Colosseum R\nAll unlocked stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["50 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 160 or more", "title": "Retailer Bundle Pack", "descp": "Get 10 copies of Sainome Colosseum R!

I've been neck deep in one of our next projects, which allows rolled 6's to do certain things, and I'd gotten my wires crossed. As the rulebook states, rolling a \"6\" in Sainome allows you to play a card from the hand.

Although the game was originally set to leave port tomorrow, January 31st, there was a slight hiccup that pushed the shipping date back a week.

Now that's hard!\nAnd there is profit to be made on Irongate. Built atop the ruins of a former mining colony, the prison operates its own rellium mine. As long as the prisoners produce ore, JumpCorp supplies the inhabitants with food, medicine, and goods they can\u2019t get on the barren planet themselves.   \nBut something has gone wrong. Lately prisoners are escaping. Can your JumpCorp \"CorpSec\" team infiltrate one of the planet's most ruthless gangs and discover how they're performing this impossible feat?\nOr maybe your crew goes a different direction. Maybe they're guilty as hell and want to find a way off. Or run the place!

The lands of the world called Garin are covered in thousands of years of history and legend. They harbor numerous secrets and dangers, as well as the bones of generations, the victims of seemingly unending wars. Demonworld's miniatures war game lets you take command of the armies of Tinere, the northern-most continent of Garin, and create epic battles between Elves, Dwarves, Humans, Orcs, Goblins, and the races of the nefarious Isthak. \nWe here at FASA Games, Inc are producing a fourth book in our Demonworld Miniatures game this year. Previously, we had brought you the Core Rules book, and two army books: the Dwarf and Thain. Now we are pleased to announce the Elves!   \nThis project has been a long time coming, and we are happy to say that the Elf Army Book for the DEMONWORLD Miniatures game is almost ready! This 128-page book includes chapters on rules for play, stats for all of the Elven units, spells, a set of pre-generated game scenarios, options for customizing your game, and plenty of history and detail about the Elves of Tinere. The Units chapter includes photos for all 32 varieties of miniature packs, most with variant poses. The army consists of classic elf units, like centaurs, pegasus riders, and archers, plus a few new ones, like the Dragonfly Rider for example. \nDragonfly Rider\nIf you haven't played Demonworld 3rdE yet, let us tell you about some of the changes we have made from the previous edition. The new edition introduces a more open battle style. Rather than playing on a hexagon-based map, you move your troops around on an open field, making measurements and movement in inches. This form of play allows you to customize your battlefield in any way you choose; add buildings, lay out hazardous terrain, and create higher elevations however you want! The Core Rules Book also offers a guide for creating your own units and heroes, making the possibilities truly endless and 100% customized to your play style.   \nAlso included in the Elf Army Book is a new section of Heroes, complete with stats and photos. If you've been with us in Demonworld 3rd Edition before, you know that heroes are something that were sorely missing. We are pleased to tell you that there are 24 new Elf commanders included in the Elf Army book. This is a vital part of the new direction we are taking and heroes will be included in all army books from here on out. \nThinuviel the Swift, Elven Commander\nWe believe that Demonworld is like nothing else available today. Our 15mm pewter miniatures have incredible detail that you really have to see to believe. The miniatures are popular amongst painters who love the detail we offer and want to expand their collection and are used by gamers in other platforms as well. They make a great option for character figures in tabletop RPGs. There is a lot to love about this collection of figures, not to mention the game itself. \nWe just need to put the finishing touches into the Elf book before we are ready to get it to the printers and into your hands. We are proud of the work that we do and feel privileged to be able to bring you these products.\nWe have been offering previews and updates on our blog at that give insights into the world of Garin, the history between these races, and what new units are coming to the Elven army. \nYou can also view our full range of existing miniatures, both classic and new U18 editions, created and provided by Ral Partha Europe. \nThe world of Garin has been in a state of upheaval since the demons returned from The Void twenty years ago. The disparate races on the continent of Tinere were caught completely by surprise by the invasion and have been scrambling to defend their territories from the demons. The forces of the Isthak that control the northern end of the continent and are also bent on the utter destruction of the rest of Tinere. They work in concert with the demons to keep their enemies on their heels and unable to mount an assault. And not least of the races' worries are the bitter hatreds that run between the various peoples that have been the cause of bloody wars for as long as anyone can remember. Even with a common enemy, most are not ready to set aside prejudice and bad blood in exchange for dubious allies.  \nThe Elves have been the most harshly affected by the demons' return. Twice before, in ages past wielding power and influence unmatched, the Elves had beaten back the demons hordes. Now, having lived so long in isolated comfort and peace, they have been caught unprepared for a full-on attack by new demons that have never before been seen on Garin. Without any warning, masses of demons crawled up from the ocean and tore into the Elves' forest, shredding every living thing they could find as they went. The High Elves, known as the Ilah RI, were forced to evacuate, seal their capitol city of Llananrion against invaders, and flee from beneath the sheltering trees that had protected them from outsiders for so many centuries. \nElf archers with a Treeman protector\nThe Wood Elves, known as the Thanaril, fought valiantly against the onslaught of demons until it became clear that they could not prevail. Though they were not as quick to flee as the Ilah Ri, they too were soon forced from their homes and out into the harsh light where they met long-time enemies in the Empire from whom they were suddenly forced to seek sanctuary. The adjustments did not come easily, and many of the forest folk are still adamant in their resistance to the change.

(And treasonous, but you never read that.)\nPlayers will find rules for playing bots and elderly Troubleshooters, advice for committing treason and not getting caught, fun prescription drugs, and bingo cards for diagnosing teammates with entirely treatable disorders. No medical knowledge necessary!\nGMs will find locations to drop into missions, guides to the Underplex and the Outside, articles and tables to help up your Paranoia game, and three shiny new missions to really rack up the body count.\nYou will also see new cards, from Bestiary cards like the Feral Tree to R&D gear such as Hygiene Grenades \u2014 but only if you back this project before June 24th.\nImagine the sheer joy and devilish glee you\u2019ll feel upgrading your Paranoia RPG experience with this new set! Imagine the jealousy and dirty looks from others who did not back this project! \nParanoia is now more better. Other games are not more better. Back Acute Paranoia.\nWhat is Paranoia?\nParanoia is a darkly humorous roleplaying game full of mutants, secret societies, backstabbing, lasers, repeated death and a well-meaning but thoroughly insane ruler known as the Computer. Unlike other RPGs that take themselves rather seriously, Paranoia is all about having fun in a science fiction dystopia by encouraging skullduggery, betrayal, bootlicking and generally naughty behaviours.\nAt cons, you can tell where the Paranoia game is by following the laughter. This is your chance to make your Paranoia games even more hilarious (and deadly) with the Acute Paranoia box set. Be the envy of your neighbours, friends and random strangers!\nWhy Acute Paranoia?\nAfter the success of the Paranoia core box set, players have been asking for more ways to backstab, fight terrorism and cause terrorism in Alpha Complex. \nOur design goal was simple: Create a box full of cool things to do in Paranoia. We focused on what helps players and GMs take down their enemies so they can climb a mountain of skulls and smoking boots to proclaim themselves the One True Paranoia Gamer. In other, less scary words, everything was filtered through \u2018How can people use this for more fun?\u2019\nThe design team is lead by WJ MacGuffin, a game designer who worked on the Unknown Armies 3rd edition Kickstarter as well as the XP edition of Paranoia. Starting with the 2nd edition rules back in 1987, WJ played and ran more games of Paranoia than is healthy. \nThe team includes two other veterans of the XP edition days (Dan Curtis Johnson and Greg Ingber) as well as two designers new to Paranoia (Amanda Cherry and Ed Turner) for fresh ideas and blame if jokes fall flat. With invaluable guidance and imperious demands from Gareth Hanrahan and Ken Rolston (one of the Paranoia 2nd edition designers), the team has created rules, missions and more that fits Paranoia\u2019s unique themes and mood. Hunting down traitors, would-be-traitors and what-the-hell-they-might-as-well-be traitors-because-my-gun-still-has-ammo has never been this fulfilling!\nAcute Paranoia Contents\nAnd you thought your Paranoia games were already dangerously fun .... As with the core box set, Acute Paranoia is printed in high quality full colour. In the box set, you will receive:\nThe Troubleshooter Survival Handbook features healthcare plans, perfectly legal pharmaceuticals, disorder bingo cards, articles on getting away with treason and invaluable lessons from Teela-O. You also get rules for playing bots! (\u201cBzzzt bing sorry Troubleshooter but this arm needs to be removed beep!\u201d)\nThe Gamesmasters Despotic Power Book offers locations to \u2018drag and drop\u2019 into any mission, information on the Underplex and the Outside, articles on helping players get into the Paranoia spirit (aka backstabbing) and bot secret societies. You also get tables for randomly picking interesting (and likely deadly) bots, traitors and shops!\nMission Book 2.0 includes three brand-new missions featuring the Outside and the Underplex. How will your Troubleshooters handle a mysterious black rectangle, a missing Armed Forces regiment and a patch to the Computer itself?\nNew cards! Besides more Action and Equipment cards, you\u2019ll get cards for Bots, Relics from Before, completely safe R&D gear and those things that are like bots but not metal ... what\u2019s the term ... oh, right. Beasts.\nWipe-clean Bot Identity Forms, which are way better than the ones squishy clones get because you are made of metal.\nWipe-clean Disorder Bingo Cards to make sure your teammates don\u2019t have any issues that could degrade mission performance.\nRemember, you can download the complete Troubleshooter Survival Handbook right HERE to have a look at the kind of things we are putting into this box set!\nPledge Levels\nUnder CPU Mandate 883.03/b, this campaign\u2019s pledge levels have been simplified and clarified to make your loyal backing experience that much more enjoyable.

They are delivering what they say they will deliver, when they say they will deliver.\n\n* Most of the box set will be complete before the Kickstarter begins.\n\nAh ha, you say, but was that not said for the last Paranoia box set?

He was a dog of stealth, much preferring to sneak past enemies instead of getting his paws dirty with the rough stuff. But Spike wasn't able to take care of the Leechtongue, and it blocked his way into the crypt. Spike was a warrior dog, not a pioneer blessed with finesse and skill... and defeating a Leechtongue required a special touch. Jack was exhausted, even after Sister Picassa Collie had treated his wounds. Worse, Princess Yosha Pug had to retreat, leaving him without any magical backup. It was up to Jack to deal with this latest threat.\nThe Leechtongue was surprisingly quick, forcing Jack out of the shadows and into action. Luckily, his reflexes kicked in, and he was able to quick draw his magical bow, shooting several arrows at the threat. His natural skill and expert training were unerring, and the arrows landed in a precise strike, defeating the monstrosity. The Leechtongue gargled and fell over with a heavy thud. For now, he was out of danger. He had to avoid any more challenges so he could finish their mission. They all needed a moment to rest and recover before continuing on. Before they could finish their quest.\n\"I'm a good dog,\" Jack muttered under his breath. \"At least, I'd better be.\"\nFetch Quest is a family-friendly cooperative deck-building game.

These are the final sets from the initial production, and only available in limited quantity.\nDogs have inherited the world, building the kingdom of Pugmire untold centuries after the Ages of Man were over. These dogs have been uplifted to use tools and language, and they seek to rediscover the ruins of the Old Ones. Some have learned to use the leftover technology of humanity, but they believe it to be magic handed to them by their lost gods. Others seek to create an ideal civilization, using a Code of Man compiled from ancient, fragmentary lore left behind by humanity. The world is dangerous and mysterious, but good dogs will persevere. \nPugmire is a light-hearted and family-friendly fantasy world. It\u2019s one of the first of Onyx Path\u2019s creator-owned games, produced in a partnership with Eddy Webb and Pugsteady. Combining the ideas, passion, and creativity of experienced designers with decades of experience in producing quality roleplaying game products, these creator-owned games push the boundaries of the \u201cOnyx Path brand\u201d in new and diverse directions.\nAfter a successful Kickstarter campaign, the Pugmire roleplaying game Core Rulebook was released in 2017. The game featured a traditional fantasy rules system redesigned for streamlined play and easy creation of heroic dogs, with an emphasis on cooperation and action over competition and violence. \nSince the initial release, theRealms of Pugmire have expanded to include adventure scenarios and audio dramas, as well as a new game in the setting featuring the cat-based Monarchies of Mau. The recent introduction of Canis Minor, a community-driven digital content storefront, has further opened up the world for exploration.  \nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will unlock a new reward. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\nACHIEVED!- an Onyx Path classic Stretch Goal: A discounted Fetch Quest T-shirt will be made available on the Onyx Path Redbubble T-shirt store for a limited time.\nACHIEVED! - Monarchies of Mau Pioneer cards \u2013 3 cards featuring Cat Characters will be added to the Fetch Quest Booster Cards\nACHIEVED! - Monarchies of Mau Pioneer cards \u2013 3 additional cards featuring Cat Characters will be added to the Fetch Quest Booster Cards\nACHIEVED! - Community Content from Canis Minor can be added to DriveThruCards.com\nAt $23,000 in funding - A New Mission and Challenges \u2013 5 new cards will be added to the Fetch Quest Booster Cards\nThis is Onyx Path Publishing's 30th Kickstarter, and the company has learned how to maintain focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text and design for Fetch Quest is finished, and we are only looking at adding additional art to the game itself.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the boxed edition of the game.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our last ship-out, for Pugmire, started a month earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Stray Supporter", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive:\n\u2022 Print & Play Preview PDF\n\u2022 Digital Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Digital Dog Supporter", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive:\n\u2022 Print & Play Preview PDF\n\u2022 Pugmire Digital Bundle\n\u2022 Digital Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Pioneer Pooch", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive:\n\u2022 Fetch Quest boxed edition\n\u2022 All Booster Cards generated via Stretch Goals\n\u2022 Print & Play Preview PDF\n\u2022 Digital Wallpaper\nAdditional shipping charges may be added based on your location.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["296 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Digital Herding Pioneer", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive:\n\u2022 Fetch Quest boxed edition\n\u2022 All Booster Cards generated via Stretch Goals\n\u2022 Print & Play Preview PDF\n\u2022 Pugmire Digital Bundle\n\u2022 Digital Wallpaper\nAdditional shipping charges may be added based on your location.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["62 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Pioneer Pointer with Pins", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive:\n\u2022 Fetch Quest boxed edition\n\u2022 All Booster Cards generated via Stretch Goals\n\u2022 Print & Play Preview PDF\n\u2022 Pugmire Pin Set\n\u2022 Digital Wallpaper\nAdditional shipping charges may be added based on your location.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["67 backers", "Limited (33 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Pioneer Companions", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive:\n\u2022 2 copies of Fetch Quest boxed edition\n\u2022 2 copies of All Booster Cards generated via Stretch Goals\n\u2022 Print & Play Preview PDF\n\u2022 Digital Wallpaper\nAdditional shipping charges may be added based on your location.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "Double Digital Pioneer Pack", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive:\n\u2022 2 copies of Fetch Quest boxed edition\n\u2022 2 copies of All Booster Cards generated via Stretch Goals\n\u2022 Pugmire Digital Bundle\n\u2022 Print & Play Preview PDF\n\u2022 Digital Wallpaper\nAdditional shipping charges may be added based on your location.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Pet Shoppe", "descp": "** For Qualified Retailers Only!! **\nAs thanks for your support, you'll receive:\n\u2022 5 copies of Fetch Quest boxed edition\n\u2022 5 copies of All Booster Cards generated via Stretch Goals\n\u2022 Print & Play Preview PDF\n\u2022 Digital Wallpaper\n** Retail status must be confirmed prior to pledge.

This game gives players the tools to create their own gods and go on to tell dramatic, exciting, and engaging stories -- the kind only PTG2E can deliver! \nHere is the latest Q&A from Eloy Lasanta, creator of Part-Time Gods Second Edition.\nPart-Time Gods Second Edition is a roleplaying game about modern gods who must balance the mortal and divine natures of their new life. The game has many inspirations, from American Gods, The Almighty Johnsons, Thor comics, and the Percy Jackson novel series to name just a few. It can be used to tell a number of different stories: \nPersonal Struggles: Some stories explore more of the mortal side, how keeping a job is hard with monsters on your tail, and deal with exploring who the character truly is and what it means to be human.\nDivine Conflicts: Many times, a god's biggest enemy will be another god who wants what they have, whether it be their territory, relics, or even their mortal happiness. These stories erupt as god faces off against god in a back-and-forth that makes them thankful they have a pantheon to lean on. \nDefending Territory: Other stories involve an onslaught of monsters, called Outsiders, as they come to the god's territory to wage war or even just to live their own lives. Some Outsiders include hefty minotaurs, the unstoppable god-killers, or the blood-thirsty manananggal.\nQuests: Some may want to dive headfirst into quests for mythological artifacts and hidden portals to lost worlds with untold dangers. \nIn Part-Time Gods Second Edition, you\u2019ll explore what it\u2019s like to gain awesome divine power, battle world-threatening Outsiders, and develop relationships with fellow members of your pantheon. Of course, being a god doesn\u2019t pay the rent and it doesn\u2019t excuse you from missing your sister\u2019s wedding. You\u2019ll need to make tough decisions to make it as a divine being in modern society\u2014do you have time to help your fellow deities fend off impending doom before your sister walks down the aisle?\nThis game has a wealth of potential to explore stories about budding romances, the interactions of a pantheon making friends with enemies, and unlocking strange mysteries the universe would have preferred to stay secret. Every god has their good sides and their bad, each one creating a new window into who they are as people, but, when used correctly, opens the game to a host of story potential. \nLong ago, an entity known as the Source visited humanity and gifted certain people with divine power. For a time, the world existed in a state of balance between order and chaos, between life and death, between divinity and mortality. That is until the gods waged war against the Source and eventu\u00adally against each other to the point of near extinction.\nThe gods of today are shadows of what the old gods possessed. Their power has been heavily diminished and many choose to live a regular, mortal life, revealing themselves as gods only when absolutely necessary. Most have a job (or career if they\u2019re lucky), friends, family, and everything that comes with being human, and work hard to protect these from harm. On the other side of the coin, they also possess a Dominion to command and oversee, a divine Territory to defend from intruders, secret societies they owe allegiances to (called Theologies), and other gods in their pantheon to try to get along with. This becomes their life, the balancing of the mundane and the strange. The gods belong to neither world completely, and each of them knows that delving too deeply into one means losing pieces of the other.\nPart-Time Gods Second Edition delivers fully on it's premise, with players playing less \"all-powerful gods\" and more \"regular people who just so happen to be gods as well.\" The character is as balanced as the themes, as players can draw from either side of their concept to solve problems. After a while, they'll learn that being a god isn't all roses and fun. There are real responsibilities involved, and they still have to hold down a day job to make ends meet. Using the Chakra System (from Ninja Crusade 2nd Edition), players roll pools of ten-sided dice (d10s) to determine success, with lots of ways to gain bonuses (more dice) and lots of in-story causes for penalties (less dice). It is truly a system designed to be engaged with, and one that enhances the story when players do so. \nThere are also several components to help the gods oversee their divine duties and protect their territory:\nChoosing Your Dominion: A core piece of a character's concept is... \"What are you the god of?\" Part-Time Gods Second Edition doesn't limit players to a prewritten list of power. Instead, they can be the god of just about anything they can think of, from traditional concepts like the god of war or goddess of fire to unique Dominions like the goddess of whispers or the god of mourning.\nFree Time/Wealth: A unique mechanic for Part-Time Gods Second Edition is the addition of Free Time, used for wise gods to attend to their responsibilities, and Wealth, the thing that makes the world go round. The two resources play together in a symphony of storytelling, leading to dramatic scenes and hard choices. \nTerritory Grid: The players are assumed to be a pantheon of gods assembled for a variety of reasons (i.e. friendships, mutual survival, sharing responsibilities, etc.) and in charge of their city, represented by the new Territory Grid. This map lets your group know who is where in the city, and allows for a new way to uncover secrets in your area. \nDownload the Part-Time Gods Second Edition Preview for yourself and discover the depth of adventure at your fingertips! \nOur design team has worked tirelessly to bring this project to life. The final product is estimated to be 8.5x11, 275-300 pages, with black & white interior art (see Stretch Goals), available in hardcover. As of the start of this campaign, Part-Time Gods Second Edition is around 75% done and we are on track to debut the final product at GenCon 2018. The majority of the funds from this Kickstarter will be used on art commission, paying our amazing design team what they're worth, and to further develop future sourcebooks for release. The best part about becoming a backer, however, is you'll get it earlier than everyone else for helping us make it a reality in the first place!\nShipping is the bane of all Kickstarters, we will be charging shipping as we fulfill each item. YOUR PLEDGE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COST OF SHIPPING. Backerkit will be used to collect your shipping information, take any additional preorders, and charge you for your shipping down the line. What this does is clean up the process for everyone involved. First off, it means the funds raised by this Kickstarter will 100% go toward making Part-Time Gods Second Edition (and any unlocked Stretch Goals) as amazing as possible.\nEstimated Shipping Costs\nDomestic Shipping: For shipping within the US, expect around $5-10 per package. \nEU/AU/CA Shipping: The majority of associated countries are easy to ship to, such as EU, AU, and CA.

The purpose of this Kickstarter project is to print and release the book which will expand and deepen the game setting of Awaken. \nThe world of Awaken is full of constant strife and discord. It\u2019s a world where the Great Cities fight for supremacy and leadership over the Alliance; a loose political association holding the territories of Salvora united. A world where ancient powers have resurfaced, in the form of Vasalli; humans that have undergone a physical change that has blessed and cursed them with mythical gifts, powers that were not meant for humans to have.\nAnd with the world of Awaken still trying to recuperate from the fight with the Vargans, an ancient nemesis of all humankind; it is obvious that something in the world of Awaken is determined to test the survival instinct of all humankind.  \n\nBut Awaken is not just a world filled with endless battles but a world that is filled with exploration and several places that are just waiting to be discovered by the player.\n\nYou don\u2019t need the Blood of Salvora to enjoy Awaken, but having it will give you an expanded take on the world of Awaken as it describes settings and locations in much greater detail and further enriches your play in every way possible.  \nThe Core Rulebook version that is available through this campaign will differ slightly from the original one. We have made some revisions in the wording, structure and even some of the rules that can be found within its pages. \nThis is not a new edition to the game, so if you have the original book, these new changes won\u2019t render Awaken useless in any way.\nThe original Awaken Core Rulebook\nIf you are one of the original backers and already have the Awaken: Core Rulebook, but you find that you would like to choose from one of the bigger tiers through this Kickstarter campaign and would like to opt out of getting yet another copy of the Core Rulebook; be sure that you check out the Caveat Section that is found before the Add On Section .\nIf you haven\u2019t tried Awaken before, here\u2019s what the rumors are: \nWhat speaks most in favor of Awaken is the awesome artwork, an interesting setting which is its own thing despite being inspired by many sources and the rules-light mechanics. (Stragazer\u2019s World) \nAwaken boasts an interesting setting and an engaging background. The manual lets itself be devoured up quickly, given the magnificent illustrations and explanations regarding the Orders and Great Cities full of details. Personally, I recommend it to novices and experts because the former will have no difficulty and the latter will immediately fall in love with the dark and intriguing world of Salvora. (Andrea Sirombo - Teamnerd.it) \nAwaken is a great role-playing game, it has all the credentials to be appreciated both by D&D fans and by those looking for a valid alternative. The map of the game is huge and gives great freedom to the Narrator, in fact there are also parts not described in the North, unexplored lands that are waiting for a brave party to be discovered. Highly recommended, if you then have a really good storyteller, you can play for years without ever getting tired. (Ignazio Piras - ProjectNerd.it) \nThe setting of Awaken provides many ideas and levels of play possible. You can play campaigns on political matters or classic themes, based on the fight against the monsters of Salvora, up to deep topics such as corruption, human annihilation and the spirit of religiosity. No power is without effect in the world of Awaken and the players, to remain as human as possible, will have to find alternative solutions to the usual epic fights in order not to permanently lose themselves. (Veronica Maramonte - Justnerd.it)\nWe've been picked as Medium's Featured Project!\nAlso, feel free to download and check out the Awaken Quickstart Edition and check out the game yourself! \n The Awaken game system was designed from scratch and tailored for the game to bring out the strengths of the roleplaying without having the burden of the complicated mechanics that usually come with most roleplaying games.\nThe game emphasizes player interaction, has an immersive mood to it and is filled with narration.  \nFast, fluid and intuitive rules - we\u2019ve designed Awaken for new players and experienced RPG players\nWe only use common six-sided dice, making it easy for anyone to play Awaken. \nCharacter creation is quick and simple. The player has full freedom in choosing and mixing their skills, attributes, and Gifts (special powers of the Vasalli)\nThe character development is skill-based and depends completely on how the player uses their abilities.\nPicture Rule: For particularly creative descriptions, the player is rewarded with bonus dice or automatic success. \n  The Blood of Salvora will enable characters to find their place in the world by helping them to discover the details of the continent in which they reside. \nIt will allow them to participate in the power structure of the City that they have chosen to reside in and to even find their place in the highest echelons of the Order that they have chosen to pledge their allegiance to. \nAt the same time, the player will be able to traverse a world that is full of mysterious locations, unspoken secrets, and hidden roads.\nFull-color hardcover book, estimated to 216 pages (before the stretch goal expansion)\n\nAll this information can be in the palm of the player's hand, so the adventures that await them can be countless in numbers.  \nSo what's waiting for you in The Blood of Salvora? Let's find out!\n  Extended Great City Lore - Players can expect to get a ton of new information regarding history, power structures, districts, locations of interest and domains of the Great Cities. \nMemorable Characters -  Get to know the important figures of the Alliance, leaders of the Cities and rebels which elude them. \nDetailed History of Salvora. While everybody in Salvora knows their myths, a lot of the history has been lost through time or has simply been kept secret from public knowledge. Discover the past! \nMore Antagonists & Monsters - Fan favorite plea! We've got you covered with expanded options for antagonists, as well as new big and bad creatures that will fill Salvora in order to make it not only deadly but more beautiful than it already is. \nWhat lies beyond Salvora? - If the player dares to venture outside of the Alliance borders, they will not go in blindly but they will know backgrounds on the nations that have troubled Salvora before. But the player must be wary, as these nations are on the rise again! \nSuperior Gifts, Rituals & Expanded Rules - Who could say no to more power? We know we can't! And that is why we have included new Gifts and Rules which will allow players to explore and create their own Superior Gifts. Because everyone knows that a flying dagger isn't as good as a flying dagger on fire! \nSmaller Orders - \"Join the Order,\" they said. \"See the world,\" they said. Well with the exploration now available of new places and powers, players should feel free to explore new Orders. Of course, players will be frowned upon by members of the esteemed Great Orders of the Alliance, but no one can take the freedom of choice from the player.\nControl the Colossi -Who wouldn't want to be able to control a gigantic living weapon of mass destruction? We have developed the rules that will enable the player to use their Gifts to control Colossi. \nExpanded Items and Weaponry - Salvora is a vast continent that is filled with various types of people from all walks of life so it's only natural that players should have a selection of various items and weapons to use throughout their adventure.\nIn addition to a new book, we wanted to offer our backers something truly unique and memorable for this campaign. That's why we have teamed up with Winton Afric from Artefakt Miniatures to bring our backers a 25 cm (9.9\") resin figure of Awaken's apex antagonists: Vargans! This glorious figure shows a Vargan victory over Colossus will look great displayed on a collector's shelf!\nNEW!!! - You'd like the resin figure, while opting for digital version of other stuff? Check out the The Triumph of Vargans and Digital Books tier! \nThere are some more physical rewards, as well as digital, that we are offering to our backers as rewards for their support! Check them out below!\nThis Kickstarter is focused on making this project the best it can be and we want our backers involved with the process as much as possible. Although the structure, outline, and parts of the book have already been written, we are always looking for feedback from our players. \nWe love to hear back from players with any ideas that they may think we need to add or aspects that we need to expand upon throughout Salvora. Below is listed the stretch goals for this campaign so it is very clear what we are trying to achieve as an end goal for this Kickstarter. \nJoin our Inner Circle Group to discuss, have fun and develop the Awaken and its community! \n Add-ons are additional items that you add to your reward level by simply increasing your pledge by the appropriate amount for the item that you would like to receive.  \nAfter the campaign ends, we'll get in touch with you about the extra money that you pledged and what you would like it to be used for. Be aware that some of these add-ons will only be available through this campaign, so if you want any of the add-ons (if they aren't included in your pledge tier, originally) then be sure to add them to your pledge!\nORIGINAL BACKER CAVEAT: If you already have a Core Rulebook in your possession but you would like to receive any of The Fan Tier ($99) and above rewards without the book, read on!  \nWhen we collect all backer information after the campaign ends, please let us know that you'd like to pledge a level without receiving the Core Rulebook and you'll receive a $30 bonus instead! This can go towards the shipping price or any extra Add-ons instead!\nShipping is often the downfall of even the most thought-out campaigns. In light of this circumstance, we'll be able to offer free shipping only for US-based backers, but we'll be trying to cut the shipping rates for other countries as much as we can!\nWe will be charging for shipping through the pledge manager after the Kickstarter campaign ends based on its actual cost. We don\u2019t know exactly how much shipping will cost\u2014shipping rates change, we may gain some efficiencies that save us money, and it can vary dramatically by destination, shipping method, and how many rewards you\u2019re getting. \nShipping prices are estimated as follows:\nUS: Free\nCanada: $8 - $15\nEU: $8 - $15\nRest of the World: $12 - $20 \n We want to charge as little as possible, so thanks to fulfillment centers, backers in the EU won't pay any customs or VAT on their shipments.\nThe team behind the game  \n\nOnce again, The Games Collective stands behind the Awaken game, but this time we have reinforcement in the form of additional writers.  \nThe Games Collective is an RPG design team founded by Marko Matijevi\u0107 Sekul and Zoltan Le\u010dei.

Sinister sorcerers summon terrible forces in their crumbling towers. Treacherous rogues of the Thieves\u2019 Guild prowl the Plaza of Dark Delights. Assassins from the Slayers\u2019 Brotherhood work the Tenderloin District. And hunched figures skitter beneath the streets, waiting for their chance to rise.\nNow your party of warriors and scoundrels can expand their adventures beyond Lankhmar to the high seas of Nehwon. They might venture to the Sea of Stars to confront priests of the ancient and terrible Mokrath, or book passage to Rime Isle and fall prey to \"The Thing From Below.\"\nThe Savage Seas of Nehwon contains everything a Game Master needs to create incredible tales of high sea-based adventures for Lankhmar or ANY fantasy Savage Setting, including:\nThe Seas of Nehwon: Overviews of the Inner Sea, Outer Sea, Frozen Sea, Sea of Stars, Sea of the East, and Lankhmar's docks and harbors. \nCharacters: New Edges, Hindrance, powers, and Setting Rules dealing with ships and the sea.\nShips: Statistics for the various ocean-going vessels of Nehwon, Setting Rules, naval maneuvers, and rules for savage storms!\nAdventure Generator: A complete adventure generator for creating your own fantastic Savage Tales!\nSavage Tales: Sea-based adventures in Fritz Leiber's incredible style, such as \"Jewel of the Deep,\" \"Queen of the Sunken Realm,\" \"Bride of the Golden Isle,\" and more!\nDenizens of the Deep: New beasts to drag your heroes from the decks of their ships to the briny depths!\nPlease Note!\nA copy of the Savage Worlds core rules is necessary to play and is not included in these reward levels. You can get our core rules now for ALL your Savage Worlds games at www.peginc.com (and it's only $9.99! )\nAnd if you're looking for the other PDF books in the Lankhmar line from Pinnacle Entertainment Group, click here!\nWe want to support our settings after the core releases and have been trying to figure out how for a while. So we're trying a \"Booster\" as an experiment. You might think it's easy for an established company like Pinnacle to just put new product into the retail chain, but it's not (See  \"Why Kickstarter?\" below).\nRight now, Kickstarter is still the best place for many of our customers who don't have a local game store, or whose game store doesn't carry Savage Worlds, to find out about and pick up our games. We'll still do our big, full-on Kickstarters just like we've done before for our new settings and other big projects. But creating all the Stretch Goals and extra products we need to support those doesn't make sense for a follow-on book, so we're doing something a little different...the Booster.\nIf it works out, you'll see more of these. (We've got books for The Last Parsec and Savage Rifts\u00ae already in the works.)\nSo what does all that mean for you? Pledge for Savage Seas and we'll give you the Booster Rewards listed below (including a REALLY cool adventure written by Shane Hensley that follows on with the work he did on the original 1992 TSR boxed set for Dungeons & Dragons!)\nThe 1996 TSR boxed set for Dungeons & Dragons, written by Shane Hensley!\nIf you'd rather wait and get it from your local store, GREAT! You can pledge for the PDF here if you like, get the Booster Rewards, then order the print version of the book from your store later this year. Be sure to tell your store you're looking for this!\nBooster Rewards\nPlease note only backers who pledge at Savage Seas (Digital) and above receive these Booster Rewards.\nFree Archetypes: All backers get the existing Lankhmar archetypes.\nTable Tents: Form-fillable print and play foldable character cards, perfect for home or convention play.\nOne Sheets: Three brand new, ready-to-run One Sheets for Lankhmar that take place on the Seas of Nehwon!\nNew Archetypes: We'll add four new archetypes to the pack, including the Sea Sorcerer and the Ghoul Swashbuckler!\nNehwon / Lankhmar Map: Every backer gets a digital version of the Lankhmar and Nehwon map!\nA Night of Blood and Teeth: Shane Hensley was the original author of TSR's Lankhmar boxed set back in 1996 (the year he created Deadlands, coincidentally)! He's working on an adventure that hearkens back to the one he wrote for the Dungeons & Dragons box set so many years ago. Our heroes pilfer a strange, finned idol from Lankhmar and find themselves the target of a particularly deadly cult. The pursuit takes them beyond the crashing waves to the open waters, making use of the Seas of Nehwon book as they attempt to learn the secret of the strange idol and survive A Night of Blood and Teeth!\nWe released the Lankhmar: City of Thieves setting in 2015 (retail 2016), with multiple books, custom Bennies, maps, and a gorgeous Game Master's screen! You can check them out here!\nThe Savage World of Lankhmar debuted in 2015 (2016 for retail) and is available now!\nWe also created this gorgeous Lankhmar Collector's Set with all of the above inside!\nNow your barbarians and scoundrels can take to the open waters, searching for adventure from the icy waters of the Frozen Sea to the mysterious Sea of the East!\nAlong the way they might resist the deadly charms of the Drowner from the Deep, battle a blade octopus, pilfer the booty of ghost pirates, or skirt the edges of a sudden whirlpool whirling with sinister sea creatures!\nThe Savage Seas of Nehwon was written by Howard Jones and illustrated by some of Pinnacle's best artists, with a cover by the amazing Thomas Denmark!\nWe'll add the Lankhmar maps, Bennies, dice, and other accessories in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter, but we have a great addition for Lankhmar fans RIGHT NOW...\nOur good friend David Soderquist at Bronze Age Miniatures has completed what we think are the BEST versions of Lankhmar's signature rogues and their sorcerous mentors EVER! Check out these amazing sculpts!\nAdd a set of all four 28mm, metal figures to your pledge for $25!\nSheelba of the Eyeless Face, Gray Mouser, Fafhrd, and Ningauble of the Seven Eyes!\nThese will also be available in the pledge manager so you can update your pledge amount now or later...whatever's best for YOU.\nSculpts by the amazing David Soderquist!\n Please note only physical reward backers may choose Add Ons in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter. PDF backers will be able to upgrade to physical rewards. \nTommy's Take\n\"I would use this for the random adventure generator alone. If you want to replicate sea adventures for Lankhmar, the lean page count (96 pages) is used to great effect. If you're happy with keeping your adventures to the city streets, this may not benefit you so well. If you have the money to spend, you may well find the mechanical bits to be worth it for any nautical-heavy campaign.\" --Tommy Brownell's The Most Unread Blog on the Internet \nRead the entire review here!\nGamingTrend\n\"The Savage Seas of Nehwon gives you everything you need for adventures on the oceans of Lankhmar. Its support for naval encounters are admirable, if somewhat sparse, but this material is designed to be integrated into a complete product. With haunted sea travellers, treacherous waterways, and fetid beasts from beyond the ken of surface-dwellers, you can be sure to follow in the soggy footsteps of Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser with ease if you read through the Savage Seas of Lankhmar.\" --John Farrell, GamingTrend\nRead the entire review here!\nThe Gaming Gang\n\"One of the things I especially liked is the adventures tackle a variety of styles..There's a lot of flavor from the Nehwon stories in the adventures in the books, but they're not \"religiously following canon.\" And that also goes for the bestiary, because there aren't a ton of Leiber stories where the main focus is Fafhrd and Grey Mouser being on the seas\u2014or under the seas. There aren't a whole lot of different creatures or villains and things. Pinnacle Entertainment has created monsters and creatures and denizens of the deep that your player characters could encounter that are really within in the flavor of Fritz Leiber's stories. They're not taken directly from his stories (there are some, don't get me wrong) they're inspired from Fritz Leiber's tales. I thought that was very cool. I really dig it. \n\"If you are a fan of Fritz Leiber's stories...by all means pick up the Lankhmar books from Pinnacle Entertainment.\" \n--Jeff McAleer, The Gaming Gang\nWatch the entire review here!\nIf you're new to Savage Worlds or want a little taste of Lankhmar, you can check out our absolutely free Test Drive rules right now!

It's possible these prices may go down as we continue to seek out different options, but we won't charge you any more than what's listed below.\nWe are shipping from the US to the rest of the world, and are using local shipping centers in the USA, Canada, EU, and Australia to further reduce the costs for you. Those deals change constantly, depending on the postal rates and our volume.\nClick to expand.\n Merchant Shipping\nWe usually ship direct from our warehouse to your store so you can add anything else from our stock to the order! \nDomestic stores in the continental United States receive FREE shipping on this order, no matter the size. \nInternational stores receive discounted shipping. We handle each retail order individually to get you the best rate. If you prefer to be part of the \"friendly\" shipping instead, just let us know. \nPDF Delivery\nAfter the campaign ends and all money has been released from Kickstarter, we'll post an Update with instructions on how to access your PDFs from www.PEGinc.com. Shortly after that, we'll send links through RPGNow/DriveThruRPG.\nCheck out our products on DriveThruRPG now!\nSometimes people ask why an established company like Pinnacle uses Kickstarter. It's a fine question and we don't mind answering it.\nKickstarter began as a way to let individuals realize a dream they couldn't do on their own. We acknowledge and applaud that. Since then, of course, it's changed, and creators of all backgrounds have come to use it, from the largest to the smallest.\nWe're glad you think Pinnacle is a \"big\" company. ;) But we're not. We're two full-timers and a whole bunch of fantastic people who contribute to different projects in different ways.\nWe've been making games for a long time (since 1994!), and we still aren't carried by a large number of game stores. These days, the growth of board games and a few popular roleplaying games like D&D take up most retail stores' ordering dollars. Many keep our core Savage Worlds books in stock, and some carry most of our settings as well. We appreciate it and love 'em for it. But the vast majority of gamers who like to play our Fast! Furious! Fun! game can't find them locally, so they order them direct from our website where we've done most of our business for a long time.\nKickstarter has proved tremendously valuable for us and many other game companies our size because people looking for the latest blockbuster often see our games as well.\nStill, all of our books and most of our physical products are always offered to your \"Favorite Local Game Store,\" and we want to support them. (Our founder, Shane Hensley, owned and ran a game store for nearly a decade!)\nIf you want to support us and your store, skip the Kickstarter\u2014but maybe help us get the word out for those who don't have a great store nearby\u2014and then preorder from your store.\nRetailers can use the Merchant reward level to get their shipment before regular retail release. Domestic (continental U.S.) stores also get FREE shipping! \nHowever you choose to support this campaign for Lankhmar: Savage Seas of Nehwon, THANK YOU. We appreciate it when you share our work on social media, tell a friend, or pledge for the games we put so much love and effort into.

If you would like to get involved and translate the rules we are currently looking for German and French translations! \nEXPLORIANA is a competitive push your luck game of exploration and discovery designed by Miles Ratcliffe  with stunningly gorgeous artwork by Richard Dearing. The players control the fates of intrepid explorers travelling to the far off regions of the globe in search of unknown species of plants, fantastic animals, glittering treasures and incredible lost cities that have never been seen before!\nLate in the 19th century vast continents open up to exploration and a wave of interest grips scientists and explorers across the globe. Fantastic animals, strange and beautiful plants, fantastic treasures and ancient sites of lost civilisations all await discovery. Expeditions to far-off regions are always filled with peril, but the challenge is hard to resist. Brave adventurers in search of riches, scientists with a hankering for knowledge and recognition, and intrepid explorers with a burning desire to map the globe: all set out for these wondrous lands with hopes of gaining a place in the history books.\nBelow is a brief overview of Exploriana. To get a full understanding of the game we have several ways in which you can get more information!\nWant to try Exploriana? You can try our Print & Play versions or head over to Tabletopia for a virtual experience!\n                 Thanks to Tabletopia you can try Exploriana now with your friends\nPlay NOW on Tabletopia!\n   In Exploriana you decide the fate of brave explorers as they set out to far flung corners of the globe and trek deep into dangerous, uncharted wilds. Exploriana incorporates several game mechanics:\nresource management (money is the major resource in the game)\nvariable turn order (getting to play first can be a major advantage)\npush your luck (the core mechanic, drawing cards discovering treasure & avoiding dangers)\nan auction every round (winning auctions gains special item cards)\nset collecting (with the many card combinations available collecting certain cards will deliver more points)\nworker placement (placing your explorers is a crucial decision)\n Exploriana is played over a number of rounds split into four phases \nIncome & Auction phases\nEach turn the players collect some extra funding during the income phase, then they bid against each other in the quick fire auction phase to attempt to acquire some choice items from the items deck. Some items assist the players on their perilous expeditions and some help the players grab bonus victory points.\nSend Explorers phase\nNow it's time to send your explorers off on their voyages of discovery in the 'send explorers' phase. There are three regions to explore in Exploriana, South America, Africa and the Far East, all uncharted, filled with wonder and teeming with danger and the players must decide which of the regions they will brave. \nDiscovery phase\nThe discovery phase uses three very different region decks. Each deck is packed with fabulously illustrated discoveries but each also has an increasing amount of peril, from South America, to Africa through to the most dangerous region, The Far East. \nThe discovery phase uses an exciting push your luck mechanic to represent the expeditions heading further and further into the wilds. The players reveal cards until they either decide to stop and make some discoveries or to push on, reveal too many hazards they will get hopelessly lost instead.\nAs a player reveals discoveries, one card at a time, there is a chance that the card may have an associated hazard. Before revealing the next discovery the player may first hire a local guide, to cancel one revealed hazard, or use items that can help the expedition avoid disaster. However, if a player reveals any three hazards of the same type or all three different hazards, then the expedition is lost and makes no new discoveries.\nThere are three different types of hazards represented in Exploriana, the dangerous uncharted terrain the explorers must trek through, ferocious creatures that could attack the expedition at any time and simply losing ones way, forcing the party to backtrack and waste valuable time and resources.\nThe number of discoveries that an expedition can make while exploring is dependant on the types of discoveries revealed and how far the expedition manages to push into the wilds. A player can reveal up to five discovery cards for each of their expeditions and may choose to discover all of the revealed animals or any one of the others or they may even be able to rescue a lost explorer. If they were brave or lucky enough to have revealed all five discoveries without becoming lost, they may make one extra selection. \nVictory \nThe aim of the game in Exploriana is to accumulate the most victory points. There are various ways to get victory points in Exploriana and bonus victory points are also awarded at the end of the game.\nThe discoveries the players make can give them renown, wealth and victory points, some even give the player more than one type. Renown determines the turn order and awards some bonus victory points. Any money the players have accumulated during the game converts into bonus victory points. Some of the items may give a player bonus victory points, some enhance victory points awarded by discoveries and some are worth money. Finally, lost explorers that your expeditions have rescued can increase your wealth and also add a variable number of bonus victory points.\nThe various mechanics and hard decisions the players are forced to make at every turn ensure multiple paths to victory, making Exploriana exciting and really enjoyable. A game you will want to play again and again!\nInterested in a run through of the game?

Having successfully run 17 Kickstarter campaigns we know how to successfully deliver a KS project. \nCounters Out is the publishing arm of Chance & Counters the Bristol-based board game cafe. Exploriana will be their first published game.\nChaos Publishing has a track record of releasing quality boardgames and brought Exploriana to the team.\nIt benefits us to work together. It allows us to bring each companies unique skill set into the fold ensuring we have the combined expertise and experience to make this campaign a resounding success.\nThe team includes:\nMiles Ratcliffe\nMiles is our game designer from Chaos Publishing on this project.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll three companies involved in with the Exploriana Campaign are experienced with Kickstarter and the fulfilment process, each having run a number of Kickstarter campaigns in the past. Triple Ace Games alone has run 17 successful Kickstarter campaigns to date. \n\nThe game is complete and we have already self funded the artwork and design. There will be no delay in sending the game to the factory. The funding raised through this campaign is for manufacturing & bulk shipping the game.\n\nThe main risks faced with, when attempting to bring a board game to market, are usually problems associated with production, shipping and fulfilment. Delays in production can hopefully be avoided by using an experienced manufacturer. We intend to use Longpack, a well known and well established manufacturer and we also intend to have Longpack arrange delivery to the fulfilment company to ensure there are also no unforeseen problems with the shipping of the product. \n\nDue to the combined experience and determination of the team involved with the Exploriana campaign, we are confident that any challenges can be overcome and of course we will endeavour to keep our backers up to date with the progress of the project with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Team Glory\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nExploriana has been developed and produced by a collaboration of three separate games companies, Chaos Publishing Ltd, Triple Ace Games Ltd...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Show your support for Exploriana with a token pledge and join us on our Kickstarter expedition.\nBy making a small pledge you can follow the progress of the Exploriana campaign.

(Canceled)"}}, {"backer": "Jim Searcy", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "  Dragons Conquer America is a CLASSIC ROLE PLAYING GAME, with high adventure, monsters, and epic struggle between the mortal and supernatural worlds.\nIt will allow you to play stories about ADVENTURERS who explore the Mesoamerican lands, hunt devilish monsters, and discover ancient ruins. Create your character from one of the 17 available orders, cast powerful faith based spells, safeguard yourself from corruption and curses, outgrow your prejudices, and unravel long-forgotten mysteries! \nWith gameplay inspired by video games such as Monster Hunter, and a setting that draws from fantasy sagas as The Witcher and alternate reality novels like Temeraire, the game offers an honest depiction of the Mesoamerican world, its people and their lore.  \nDragons Conquer America takes you back to a warped, fantasy version of 1512 Mesoamerica, a few years after the first Europeans reached its lands. At that point in time, this region of central America is a melting pot of cultures and identities, bound by the might of the Mexica (a.k.a. the Aztec) empire and threatened by the terrible evils that lurk in the depths of the mossy jungle.\nRumors of foreboding omens seep through the grapevine and keep children up at night; dreadful monsters and decadent phantoms ignite fear and fury among peasants and monarchs alike; the promise of gold and glory forges the most unlikely hunting parties, as adventurers from different nations - and even continents - join forces to vanquish the darkness from the world. All this happens under the deceitful gaze of the Dragons, both American feathered and European scalebound, whose ultimate endgame - if they have any - is yet to be uncovered.\nOne of our most important creative goals when developing Dragons Conquer America was to draw an honest portrait of Prehispanic cultures and nations. Most accounts tend to be based either on the Mexica\u2019s biased narrative, which needed to justify their oppression of the dozens of cultures that shared their territory, or the even more biased Spanish accounts, which needed to justify outright genocide. Our setting tries to unearth the true, forgotten qualities and meaning of Prehispanic history and mythology.\nOther than the well-known Spanish reports of the war, and the less-known indigenous accounts of the Spanish domain, we went to the most trustworthy academic sources we could find, such as the work of Alfredo L\u00f3pez-Austin and Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla, to research the traditions, magic, symbolism and history not only of the Mexica, but also of the hundreds of virtually unknown tribes that populated Mexico in the 16th Century. This is not an anglicised, filtered, medieval fantasy world with \u2018Aztec\u2019 trappings. DCA is a setting rooted on the actual culture of the Mexica and their neighbours \u2013 such as we could barely glimpse, and often little more than speculate \u2013 as honestly as we could paint it.\nRead more about the writing process of DCA in this ENWorld interview with JC Obal.\nYou will be able to create your character based on one of the 17 CLASSES available: sage, tomb raider, aristocrat, Mesoamerican priest, pochteca merchant, courtesan, temple guard, eagle warrior, jaguar warrior, headhunter, conquistador, hidalgo, dragon rider, explorer, inquisitor and Christian priest.\nLearn more about classes in this update.\nWith these characters you may...\n... cleanse cursed lands!\n... kill the creatures that terrorize local settlements!\n... protect common folk from Spanish and Mexica raiders!\n... survive in the grimmest conditions!\nThe game is powered by the RPC Engine, a tried and tested, harsh and realistic core mechanic with a unique blend of luck management gameplay, player agency and tactical possibilities.\nSecondary systems such as tolerance/prejudice - which pits you against your inners demons - and a faith based spirit/corruption mechanic work hand in hand to make you feel the gritty and dark nature of a evil-infested world and the unfathomable powers bestowed in you by divine providence.\nWho is it for? This game is ideal for gamers who are looking for more player agency, an intensely flavoured setting and with a keen interest in combat, exploration, investigation, survival, and conflict resolution.\nThe Core Book presented in this Kickstarter (hardbound, 320+ pages) is the centerpiece of the DCA experience, and it gives you the tools to build your own adventures, PCs, NPCs, and places; which are exactly as varied as in any fantasy setting you\u2019ve seen before. If you are familiar with our previous core book (FAITH: The Sci-Fi RPG) you\u2019ll know that no expense will be spared to create a feast for the eyes, the brain, and the gaming table.\nTHE CORE RULES are an integral part of the book, but the RPC Engine system is lightweight enough to leave plenty of room for in-depth CHARACTER CREATION, including the 17 different orders (classes) you'll be able to choose from (brace yourself for dragon riders, tomb raiders, jaguar warriors, priests, and more). MAGIC AND SPELLS - mystical powers linked to the player's faith - will also be fully developed.\nA dedicated section focused on the titular DRAGONS will be one of the coolest parts of the book, and it will explore into topics such as dragon HISTORY, how to TRAIN them, RIDE them, and FIGHT with or against them.\nThe game master will have plenty of other tools at her disposal. The GM'S GUIDE section of the core book will allow them to understand every facet of the game and a rundown of specific cultural traits that will make the gameplay unique. The complete GEAR andNPC breakdown included will be essential to plan and execute adventures, while the special TYRANTS chapter will describe big baddies who not only have advanced stats, but inflict a pervasive effect on their surrounding areas (villages, jungles...) and are pretty much all-in-one adventures in and of themselves.  \nThe SETTING will be fully developed as well; the book will present a \"current state of affairs\" of Mesoamerica circa 1512, including all the relevant cultures present in the isthmus and their interrelationship. The lore (the folk lore: drowned deads, cipactli alligators, mixcoatl dragons...) will be factually presented focusing on their effects on local populations. \nThe Core Book will close with the Coatli Stone INTRODUCTORY ADVENTURE, a one shot adventure that introduces the basic concepts of the game.\nThe two campaigns featured in the Kickstarter are the perfect companions to the core book. Each campaign will focus on a different group of characters, from very different backgrounds, to introduce you to the sheer diversity of adventures you can experience in Dragons Conquer America. \nTHE EIGHT OMENS is the first of the two campaigns, and it will place you in the roles of a group of soon-to-be-sacrificed prisoners. Your mission will be to interpret the omens in the Netherworld and warn the Mexica Empire of the impending arrival of the Spaniards. \nTHE CONQUISTADOR'S GOLD is the second of the campaigns, and in it you will play as a group of Spaniards who must secure the bounty known as \"The Conquistador's Gold\". \nEach campaign is designed to last for 8 to 12 sessions and includes everything you need to play it: pre-gen characters, a full rundown of NPCs and pieces of gear, and even a GM guide to help you track your player's progress.\nTHE DAWN OF A NEW WORLD is the print version of these two campaigns, a 160+ pages hardcover book containing both campaigns, rivaled in quality only by the Core Book. With a 2-page spread illustration per chapter, it will be the perfect tool to immerse your players in the story.\nPlease refer to the Shipping section for more information on delivery dates and shipping prices.\nHow to include add-ons in your pledge\nClick \u00ab Manage my pledge \u00bb and add the amount corresponding to your add-on(s). You don't need to change your reward tier; just edit the amount you are pledging to account for any add-ons you may want.

Given the variety of classes available, you\u2019ll be able to form all kinds of groups on a wild range of adventures, such as:\nMexica heroes out to protect their land from European invaders.\nTlaxcalteca rebels out to protect their land from Mexica conquerors. \nA band of Europeans lost in the jungle, surrounded by terrible creatures.\nMaya explorers looking for the ancient secrets of a spirit cave in their quest to free their village from a terrible curse.\nMixed group of explorers from Mesoamerican and European origins, with equally disparate goals and backgrounds, trying to solve the mystery of disappearing children in a small village.\nAnd many more! \nDragons Conquer America is powered by the RPC Engine, a narrative-first, tactically engaging system that allows for agile, organic and versatile gameplay, and rewards effort instead of luck. A variety of subsystems add flavour to the game and merge it with the dark period it takes place in, full of prejudices, sickness, nimble weapons and an ever present demonic corruption lurking right around every corner. Everything contributes towards a gameplay experience that promotes combat, survival, exploration, and investigation as much as social skills and diplomacy.\nActions are resolved through CONFRONTATIONS between characters (or characters against terrible odds), in which COUNTERACTIONS can also be active attacks (the best defense is a good offense!) making the gameplay quick, dangerous, and always moving forward. \nHIDDEN CHECKS determine when to provide new information to players and when their senses will fail them. In a world full of magic, deceit, traps, and hidden treasures many things are kept in the dark. \nThe cards (or dice) that each player holds in their hands represent the STAMINA of the character. During confrontations, a number of cards (up to the amount allowed by the focus of the skill at use) must be tactically played, taking their VALUE and SUIT into account. The former will add points to the base Skill value while the latter will allow you to draw extra cards or dice. The GM may also play cards or roll dice representing non player characters or hidden checks; her values will be pitted against yours in order to resolve the outcome of the confrontation, counteraction or check.\nWe want you to experience and feel the setting to the fullest, and to achieve that we have added several layers of flavour to the base rules:\nMagic is rendered through a SPIRIT AND CORRUPTION system by which your faith will allow you to tap into magic powers through divine intervention. If you overreach - thinking yourself holier or more powerful than you truly are - you might instead tap into forbidden and demonic power sources that will trick you down a spiral of evilness and corruption. Additionally, some orders allow SHAPESHIFTING into monkeys, eagles, or jaguars.\nSocial interactions are shaped by a TOLERANCE AND PREJUDICE system. We want you to feel like your character belongs to this harsh era, so they'll start flawed and prejudiced, but the upgrade of the Tolerance skill can be used to create a natural arc away from bigotry.\nCombat is punctuated by two subsystems. One the one hand, INJURIES are handled in a realistic fashion so that the impacts your character receives have a direct effect on some relevant skill values. On the other hand, for advanced players who want to increase the challenge, the optional gear DETERIORATION system will add an extra layer of interest to campaigns. It is highly recommended when playing adventures based around the survival theme.\nCharacter creation is an exciting part of DCA and, like in other RPGs, will shape the adventures that you\u2019ll live. \nIn this section we'll take a look into the CHARACTER'S BACKGROUND and CHARACTER'S STARTING STATS, which will form the core of your starting PC:\nYour character's CULTURE (i.e. cultural background)will determine the society they grew up in or that they identify with. In the DCA core book we'll give you the full tools to create Mesoamerican and European characters.\nThe selected cultural background will potentially have an impact on other aspects of the character, such as their FAITH. Each set of beliefs (either Mesoamerican or European) gives way to a unique manifestation of magical prowess, and branches out the SPELLS and RITUALS your character will be able to perform. \nThe character's SOCIAL STATUS is another core element of character creation. You may choose between slave, commoner and noble, and it will determine the amount of experience points and gold you start with and, even more importantly, narrow down the orders you may choose from.\nThe order is the DCA equivalent of a CLASS. They are the gateway to unique TALENTS, powerful abilities that relate to a specific Skill and specialise your character in something.\nThese are the ORDERS you may choose from:\nSage: you can aid the party identifying information found in old temples or magic items, creating potions and drugs to magnify the characters\u2019 abilities, navigating complicated social situations...\nTomb Raider: yYou know there are better ways of getting your way than having to fight for it, and the best way is when no one else actually realises that you did.\nAristocrat: you have what your servants - ahem, fellow adventurers- need. You can get into places where no commoner is allowed, and you have contacts in the highest spheres.\nMesoamerican Priest: you can tap into the supernatural and use magic to protect, curse, change or adapt reality to what it oughts to be. Your party can count on you to push through what seemed impossible.\nPochteca Merchant: you will grant access to your party to better and cheaper gear, information and contacts wherever you go, and anything else only a first rated spy could obtain.\nCourtesan:  you are capable of making people do and think as you please. They\u2019ll tell you their secrets and they\u2019ll fall in love with you. Powerful enemies that would take several soldiers to take down will willingly become your puppets.\nTemple Guard: you have special synergies with spellcasters of your religion, and you are protected and rewarded by your Gods.\nEagle Warrior:  you can gain the attributes of an eagle and fly. You are an expert ranged warrior, capable of setting up the most deadly ambushes.\nJaguar Warrior: you can gain the attributes of a jaguar and perform incredible combat feats.\nConquistador: You are a mixture between a soldier with lots of tricks up your sleeve, and an explorer with a keen sense of direction.\nHidalgo: you\u2019ll be a fighting noble, capable of leading men into battle from either the front or the back line.\nDragon Rider: you are tasked with caring for and directing a dragon and its dragon-crew into battle or adventure.\nChristian Priest: you can call upon miracles and bring all kinds of godly favours upon your party.\nHeadhunter: As a headhunter you can use Spells that give you power upon the dead: the more you hunt, the more powerful you become. Turn your enemies into your minions and let them do your bidding!\nInquisitor: As an Inquisitor, your party can count on you to protect them from supernatural forces and from Corruption.\nExplorer: capable of going where no one else, daring as no other, the explorer will give wings to the party to dive even further into the unknown.\nCuahchic warrior: they are elite Mexica soldiers. If two players select this class, their PCs may form a very strong bond that will allow them to cooperate in extraordinary ways.\nYour SKILLS will determine what you can do and how good you are at it. The available skills are Melee, Shooting, Crafting, Athletics, Stealth, Riding, Charisma, Knowledge, Rites, Survival, Medical, Perception, Discipline, Tolerance, and Profession. \nDuring character creation, you must assign a set of values between 4 and 0 to different skills representing the character's core abilities, as well as a set of bonuses depending on your Order. You will then be able to expand your character's skills by developing TALENTS, unique abilities that relate to a specific Skill.\nTaking into consideration how much money you have from your Status and your Talents, you can purchase EQUIPMENT before you begin playing. This is gear that you have before the campaign begins.\nHEALTH, INITIATIVE (which will determine when you\u2019ll take your turn during a Round), and SPIRIT (equal to your Rites skill and used to perform magic) round up the character's initial stats and equipment. \nThe lands of this Earth are full of superstition and religious warfare; the conflict between the forces of humanity and evil creatures is seemingly unending. For millennia, civilizations have been vassals to monsters to whom they sacrificed their children and their livelihoods. \nIn Europe, it wasn\u2019t until the Romans that the continent became a land of the living; even then, as soon as this mighty Empire fell creatures thought dead surfaced again. The Christian Faith prospered against all odds, and it was with Saint George that it managed to gain back the reins of the continent: dragons, formerly the worst enemies of civilization, were now its mightiest weapon.\nIn America, the Mexica - one of the mightiest civilizations on Earth - have ruled over the land of the Fifth Sun unchallenged for nearly a hundred years, striking fear in the hearts of their enemies thanks to the divine power of their priests and the help of their Mixcoatl dragon allies, which terrorise and astonish the peoples under Mexica domain. \n It\u2019s 1512. \nWe place our looking glass firmly over the Mesoamerican region, and we take a look. \nWhat do we see? We see a melting pot of cultures and identities, going about their lives unaware of the threats coming from within and without. At this point in time, European explorers are numbered in the dozens and they do not pose a threat - they are the leftovers of the first few expeditions, led by people who thought they were going somewhere else - but a few bloody skirmishes have already taken place. Locals, living a live full of hardships under the rule of the Mexica empire, try their best to survive in an evil world, a literally evil one: beasts, spirits, demons, giants, ghouls and other monstrosities infect the lands, hearts and minds of the people.\nIf you look beyond the awfulness, you\u2019ll find plenty of reasons to discover this world: primordial jungles, left to be the nest of evil, are untouched, lush manifestations of Mother nature, warts and all; the long-lost temples, abandoned centuries ago, host forgotten knowledge and incommensurably valuable relics; the monsters, for all their prowess, offer the chance of glory to those who dare hunt them; the cities and villages, with Tenochtitlan crowning, are examples of advanced civic undertakings and offer; and, of course, the dragons: seeing a single feathered serpent fly overhead, sparkling a million bright colors in the sun, is worth all the hardships in the world. Just don\u2019t get near one without proper equipment.\nIn this world, the monsters, angels and demons of medieval mythology are a daily reality for the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic. What the ancient peoples understood as gods or saints are ancestral spirits that share the world with mortals \u2013 and often compete with them for it. In the Anahuac, elemental spirits peek over the shoulder of mortals and influence every event, from wars and earthquakes to individual fortunes. Meanwhile, deathless vampire clans are taking over the European royal lineages, as troll enclaves and roaming chimeras still resist the onslaught of the Christian era.\nThe upper and lower spirit worlds, the two sides of cosmic balance, keep seeping into the mortal world between them, piercing the veil of what mortals perceive as reality. These two worlds have worn many names across history. Today, Mexica people know them as Ilhuicatl and Mictlan, while Europeans call them Heaven and Hell. When a human being dies and becomes spirit matter, she may become a terrifying spectre or a helpful spirit serving one of these two worlds. The mightiest of these spirits are known as saints, revered on both sides of the world as agents of divinity.\nDragons are living, breathing things, that exist in the same world as humans. European and Anahuac dragons are, for all intents and purposes, the same species \u2013 some have four legs, some have two or no legs in their snakelike bodies; some have wings, some can\u2019t fly, and some fly without wings. Some varieties are more common in one continent than in the other, but all of them can be found everywhere.\nWhile some dragons may travel between the spirit and material worlds, they are not spirits or saints, but mortal creatures. In fact, European dragons accepted Christ as their saviour and converted to the European church after Saint Sabine subdued the Silene beast a thousand years ago. With a few exceptions, European dragons cooperate with mortals, and have largely agreed to the role of living weapons in human wars of conquest. Anahuac dragons, on the other hand, convinced humans of their divinity millennia ago, and have now adopted the role of deities, accepting worship and sacrifice from terrified mortals, and acknowledging no equal but their own kind.\n\"DCA positions itself as a narrative-first game that offers just enough mechanical granularity to remain tactically engaging.\" -- Dylan C., DrivethruRPG \n\"I have to say, given that I only had access to the Preview Episode Zero, I was quite impressed. The setting is interesting.

There is no overselling how beautiful and thematic these pieces are.\" -- Gaming Trend \n\"The game shows both sides of this conflict with historical references, and is written by parties on both \u201csides\u201d of the conflict (writers and producers are from both Mexico and Spain); we don\u2019t get that \u201csavage\u201d feel promoted in the work that we see in others.

We want to be fair to all our backers, and charge as little as possible to each of you.\nWe will ship the games to our fulfillment centres in the US and the EU at our cost, and you will receive your reward from one or the other depending on where you are in the world. Find below the approximate cost of shipping to your country if you pledge for a single book:\nUSA: \u20ac10\nWestern EU (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, United Kingdom): \u20ac11\nEastern EU (Bulgaria, Hungary, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Malta, Romania, Slovenia): \u20ac14\nCanada and Australia: \u20ac16\nRest of the World: \u20ac20\nSPIEL / Dragonmeet Pickup: free.\nOur pledge to you is to not charge you more than what is stated above in EUROS for a single copy. If the costs end up being higher, we'll pay for the difference, and if they are smaller you'll get to save a few bucks, which is always nice. Please keep in mind if you pledge for additional copies or many add-ons, the final shipping costs will end up being a little higher.\n The digital editions of the core book and the campaigns book of Dragons Conquer America will be fulfilled by DrivethruRPG.

He'd been only a few months out of the Heptagram when they first set out on the Hunt. River had noticed how young he'd seemed, then: tall and gangly, practiced but not yet polished, trying to find the proper line between self-assured hauteur and polite deference. Now there was a slump to his shoulders, as though he'd aged twenty years overnight. \nNext to Eshuvar, Kingfisher Swift leaned heavily on her mace, her unit's standard propped beside her. Her legion's talon had made up the bulk of the Hunt's forces, and now she was all that remained. Swift was a lost egg who'd taken the coin; she couldn't be more than a dozen years into her service. River might have asked if Swift wished she'd taken the razor instead, but, well. That wouldn't necessarily have kept her away from this disaster. River herself was proof of that.\nThe Immaculate Order had arranged this Wyld Hunt, mustered the might of the Realm and sent them on the trail of two Anathema who were preying on the people north of the River Province. The Order had provided the intelligence and placed one of their most promising monks in charge of the expedition. He'd been a solid leader, brave and competent, right up until the Wretched slew him.\nNow River was the last Immaculate still breathing, and it fell to her to finish the Hunt.\nSample Aspect-type spread.

Exalted 3rd Edition is set in a mythic world where spirits walk openly among men, warring demigods topple kingdoms, and the restless dead roam on moonless nights. Heroes granted power by the mightiest gods war and intrigue against one another for the fate of Creation. These are the Exalted!\n\nDragon-Blooded: What Fire Has Wrought introduces the Dragon-Blooded in 3rd Edition and all the rules necessary to feature them as player characters or NPC antagonists, including character creation rules and the Dragon-Blooded Charm set of powers. This book will give an iconic view of the Dragon-Blooded, from their mythic origins as the armies of the gods to their place in the current era. It features details of the Realm's Scarlet Dynasty, as well as Lookshy and other locales where Dragon-Blooded outcastes are prominent. Overall, it will focus on the legend of the Dragon-Blooded and the fires they have had to walk through to get to where they are, as Creation\u2019s premiere, dominant Exalted.\n\n\nThe Exalted 3rd Edition rulebook is required to make full use of the rules and options presented in Dragon-Blooded: What Fire Has Wrought.\n\nWith your help, we will work to create a deluxe hardcover edition of Dragon-Blooded: What Fire Has Wrought, featuring a red leatherette hardcover with 300+ full-color, silver-edged interior pages and a red silk ribbon bookmark. The front cover will be white/silver foil embossed with \u201cDragon-Blooded\u201d written in Realm script, and the spine will be foil-stamped. This book will be a perfect companion to the deluxe Exalted 3rd Edition rulebook.\n\nDragon-Blooded: What Fire Has Wrought features all of the rules options necessary to create and play a Dragon-Blooded character within the Exalted 3rd Edition roleplaying world. In addition to introducing new mechanics and Charms, this supplement also includes the martial arts of the Immaculate Order, heirloom artifacts of the Great Houses and their potent Evocations, and detailed write-ups of prominent Dragon-Blooded NPCs. The final book will contain the following chapters:\n\nChapter One: The Dragon-Blooded  \nChapter Two: The Great Houses \nChapter Three: Life in the Scarlet Dynasty \nChapter Four: Outside the Realm \nChapter Five: Character Creation \nChapter Six: Traits \nChapter Seven: Charms \nChapter Eight: Martial Arts and Sorcery \nChapter Nine: Heirlooms of Power \nChapter Ten: Princes of the Earth\nSample Martial Arts & Sorcery page spread.

Artwork and design subject to change.\nIn addition, this preview from The Realm, the very next supplement for Exalted 3rd Edition, focuses on a different subject but is directly related to the contents of Dragon-Blooded: What Fire Has Wrought and offered as an additional reward as part of this Kickstarter campaign.\nTHE REALM PREVIEW\nSample Great House page spread. Artwork and design subject to change.\nThe manuscript is written, awesome artists have been contracted, and layout templates are being built. An amazing digital PDF product will be created with this material. With your help we will be able to take it a step further and produce a deluxe hardcover version of Dragon-Blooded: What Fire Has Wrought for Exalted fans and collectors. The main goal and primary focus of this Kickstarter campaign is the creation of this limited edition book.\nBeyond that, we hope to illuminate the world of the Dragon-Blooded even further, by adding (and expanding) new topics that will be included in The Dragon-Blooded Companion: Heirs to the Shogunate, a rules and options expansion for What Fire Has Wrought that will be built via Stretch Goal achievements during this campaign.\nFinally, and no less important \u2013 we want to continue to acknowledge and cultivate the passionate and creative community that exists around the Exalted 3rd edition game. Together, we have faced challenges and adversity and weathered a few storms but have come out stronger on the other side. Onyx Path has learned much in the five years since the Exalted 3rd Edition Kickstarter, and we want to thank fans for their faith, demonstrate our development and growth, and celebrate how far we\u2019ve come. Tabletop roleplaying games have always been about community, sharing stories, and celebrating imagination. Our shared enthusiasm brings us together, and when you back this project, you continue with us on this journey and keep the fires of Exalted burning.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($60,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn exchange for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged.\nYour chosen Reward Tier lists the rewards that you will receive should this project fund. Reward Tiers are not cumulative - each Reward Tier is a distinct list of rewards based on a base pledge amount, though they can be modified with add-ons and other options (detailed below). It's important that you select the Reward Tier that best reflects your desired rewards and pledge amount.\nPlease note that rewards that include physical goods (such as the deluxe books) may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick Here for a Larger Version of the Reward Tier Chart\nTo help simplify matters, the basic reward chart lists the core reward (stay digital with just the PDF, or jump in on the deluxe hardcover) and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nBeyond the standard combination of rewards presented, there are also limited options available that allow some specially-customized interaction with the world of the Dragon-Blooded. From having custom Charms or Heirlooms specifically designed for you to having your character featured as part of the interior artwork or even on the cover of The Dragon-Blooded Companion: Heirs to the Shogunate, these limited rewards provide unique opportunities.\nWe also have a Reward Tier that offers the last remaining copies of the Exalted 3rd Edition Rulebook Deluxe Edition hardcover, if you missed out on the Kickstarter from 2015 and want to build your deluxe edition collection. When this Reward Tier is fully claimed, then all remaining Onyx Path stock will be sold out.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Two Princes Conjoined in Marriage and Sworn Kinship Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!)\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this deluxe version of Dragon-Blooded: What Fire Has Wrought, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (\"Master of Orphans\") will get 5 copies of the deluxe hardcover book, at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nBy selecting a specific Reward Tier, you are confirming to pledge the minimum amount (or more) in hopes of the project achieving its funding target and receiving the rewards listed. You can also add additional rewards to your overall reward list via Add Ons - simply increase your total pledge amount by the amount listed for each Add On you wish to receive (see the Add On section below), and after the campaign concludes, you will be able to confirm which Add On rewards you'd like via a BackerKit Survey. \nYour Total Pledge Amount will be the sum of your chosen Reward Tier plus any shipping fees plus any Add Ons that you've manually included. To reiterate, your Total Pledge Amount is not the same as your Reward Tier, as it may include shipping charges and Add On rewards.

Exalted 3rd Edition depicts both a revitalized and expanded Creation, and the triumphant return of the Solar Exalted\u2014but whether their rebirth will herald the salvation or destruction of the world, none can say.

Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will unlock a new reward. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\nThe project is funded! Dragon-Blooded: What Fire Has Wrought will get a Deluxe Hardcover Edition!\nHEIRS TO THE SHOGUNATE \u2013 ART UPGRADE - interior illustrations for the Dragon-Blooded Companion - as well as a future supplement for Exalted 3rd Edition - will be upgraded to full-color.\nHEIRS TO THE SHOGUNATE \u2013 REALM EXPANSION #4: War in the West Part 2 - noteworthy factions and characters involved in the War in the West get added to the Dragon-Blooded Companion PDF.\n At $335,000 in funding - HEIRS TO THE SHOGUNATE \u2013 WARSTRIDERS EXPANSION - two fully statted-out warstriders, one each for the Realm and Lookshy get added to the Dragon-Blooded Companion PDF.\nThis is Onyx Path Publishing's 29th Kickstarter, and the company has learned enough (sometimes painfully) to make some tweaks to goals, Reward Tiers, and prizes. Focus and Control will be the buzzwords for this campaign \u2013 manageable projects, reasonable additions, achievable results. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This book isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, sometimes painfully, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Dragon-Blooded: What Fire Has Wrought is finished, and we are only looking at adding additional art to the book itself.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the deluxe book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The book will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our last ship-out, for Pugmire, started a month earlier than estimated. \n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process. \n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support":

Storm Knights rise to battle High Lord Baruk Kaah and his invading edeinos hordes. These supplements help you continue and expand your table-top role-playing game experience in the evolving world of Torg Eternity. \nNew to Torg? Scroll down to the section LEARN MORE ABOUT TORG and back the \"Welcome to the Jungle\" pledge level!\nLimited Offer: Living Land Explorer\nWant to make your lasting mark on the Living Land? You get EVERYTHING in the Living Land Survival Box Pledge Level, PLUS we\u2019ll work with you to create an official Core Earth or Living Land Archetype! This includes custom Perks or Miracles, art for the character, and the character you help create becomes the \u201ciconic\u201d version of that Archetype.\nThese Archetypes become part of the game and are available as a bonus to all backers who receive the normal digital Archetypes. The archetype is the property of Ulisses and we reserve the right to refuse any names or other features of the character that we consider inappropriate (such as inflammatory or vividly \"against theme\").\nUltra Limited Offer: Living Land Destroyer\nAdd your Archetype just as Explorer above, and also bear witness to the destruction of city of your choice. The city must be within the boundaries of the Living Land, and there are a few exceptions we have plans for. Atlanta and New York are the main examples.\nPlus you earn a seat for yourself or a designated proxy at our very special GenCon event on Thursday night. Last year's event changed the map of the Living Land, the fate of the Goldsuns, and had another consequence that won't be felt until later in the war. What will this year's game hold? Note that this offer doesn't include travel, lodging, or tickets to GenCon.\nBest Value: The Living Land Survival Box   \nFor the best Living Land experience and the most value for your pledge check out the Living Land Survival Box.

Stretch goals may unlock these items for separate purchase, but by that time other new items in the box will have only made the value even better!\nThe Living Land is a realm of primitive peril, savage sensuality, and dangerous dinosaurs. It's ruled by High Lord Baruk Kaah and his army of reptilian edeinos. The Living Land has come to Earth and taken over both coasts of the United States, the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, and the mysterious \"White Zone\" in Canada.\nWhere the Living Land rules miraculous spiritual power is available, but technology rusts and fails. Ordinary humans, and even some heroes, regress and become ruled by their primal passions.\nThere are amazing opportunities scattered among the Living Land's perils. The Law of Wonders insures that lost treasures appear in the misty and unexplored jungles. These treasures might have disappeared from Earth long ago or they may be relics from cosms destroyed by the High Lords. Whatever their different origins, they are resurfacing here and now, for any adventurers bold enough to discover them!\nDo you dare traverse the treacherous jungles, murky swamps, and crumbling ruins of this mysterious realm?\nEven the plants of the Living Land pose a challenge to explorers.\nThe Living Land source book is an expansion designed for both players and Game Masters.

The God Box also includes expanded material and foes for the Land Below, handy for any GM's continuing campaigns.\nThe Living Land GM Screen has three panels. On the inside, all the most needed charts from Torg Eternity in addition to the new charts specific to adventures in the Living Land. The outside features a single, gorgeous seamless image and the axioms and World Laws players need to remember.\nThe Living Land Archetypes come with the GM Screen, and offer new stock heroes to draw from to fill the ranks of your Storm Knights. Meet the Blood Witch, a Core Earth native who has embraced the increased spiritual power of the Living Land, the Cartel Soldier, the Edeinos Wanderer, and more! \nWe've grouped some of our previously unlocked goals by category so that you can keep track of them more easily, and so we can focus on what's coming up.\nAny series of goals that is not yet finished has been left in the list below the summaries.

This game is inspired by tales of revolution such as Les Mis\u00e9rables and The Last Exile. \nStep into the hand-me-down shoes of one of the Empire\u2019s second-class citizens, members of society who have had their rights limited and their privileges stripped away, and figure out your place in the growing resistance movement. Do you believe in peaceful protest? The idea that change can come from within? Or does the only path forward involve violence? \nBring the fight to the Empire, if you wish\nCharacters will have to rely on the bonds they have made with their family as they walk the line between what is good and what is right during their struggle to bring change to their world.  \nGears of Defiance will be 200+ pages filled with black and white artwork as well as the following: \nRules for the Founding Session, during which the Empire and Family will be established. \nOver a dozen unique archetypes and traits, leading to countless character combinations.  \nRules for one-shots, short-term, and long-term campaigns, including maps to support each style of play. \nRules for creating a customized steampunk setting that is completely unique for your game.\nRules for controlling territory and reinforcing locations. \nThe Alignment Matrix, which will track your character\u2019s political and moral standing. \nPre-made settings created by top talent within the industry. \nThe game will also feature illustrations such as those featured on this page, with more artwork unlocked through Stretch Goals.\n...or peacefully Resist the Empire's Propaganda.\nEvery campaign of Gears of Defiance begins with a Founding Session. During this time the characters, the world, the Family, and the Empire will all be created following an easy-to-use world creation guide included in the book, full of both real-life and pop culture examples.  \nCharacter Sheet Prototypes subject to change\nGears of Defiance explores serious topics, but the game is meant to be an entertaining experience: sometimes dramatic, sometimes sad, but ultimately moving and exciting. This is why we give the power to create the world to the players. The Empire will always oppress, and the Family will always be oppressed, but the how and why is up to you. Our goal isn\u2019t to simulate events of real-world oppression and create uncomfortable situations; by giving the power to the players, you can create an Empire that feels right for your table. \nThe players at the table will decide the Methods of Control the Empire uses to keep the citizens in line. Do they rule with Fear by placing armed soldiers on every street corner and checkpoints at every bridge? Do they use Information Regulation to keep the citizens uninformed and pliable? These methods will also create the goalposts for the game. Information Regulation can be combated by printing illegal books and exposing the truth to the public. Armies can be disrupted by sowing chaos and disrupting the supply chain. The possibilites are endless and every campaign of Gears of Defiance will play out differently. \nThe players will also create their Family and build bonds between them.\nGears of Defiance takes notes from some of my favorite roleplaying games, such as Blades in the Dark, Fate Accelerated, Apocalypse World, and World of Dew. The influences of these games will be obvious, but Gears of Defiance has taken them and turned them into something new. \nThe game takes place over two phases: The Action Phase and the Season Phase. During the Action Phase, players will form plans and carry out their actions to destabilize the Empire. During the Season Phase, the Empire will reinforce their locations, increase threats, and try to hunt down the characters.  \nYou must do whatever it takes to keep your family safe\nGears of Defiance uses an Approach system, where the GM will detail a conflict or obstacle and the players will build and roll a Dice Pool of six-sided dice by choosing their best Approach and adding relevant bonuses from their archetype, scene tags, boons, and spent Plot Points. Every 4, 5, and 6 is considered a success, and players can spend these to complete challenges, add points of narrative control, create their own boons or complications, or turn them into Plot Points to be banked for later turns.  \nThese mechanics allow for a variety in pacing and action, as non-combat approaches are now as exciting and mechnically interesting as combat approaches and, by giving narrative control to the players, the players will have the power to change the direction of the story, even when their characters might not. Gears of Defiance also features a character advancement mechanic known as The Alignment Matrix. \nThe Empire always has its eye on its citizens\nThis matrix will track a character\u2019s political and moral compass from Liberty to Authority and Traditional to Radical. How a character is viewed by the Empire\u2019s citizens will determine what actions they are allowed to take, how wanted they are by the Empire, and how willing others will be to join and help their cause. \nPrototype of the Alignment Matrix\nIf a character sways too far, they may end up radical, taking actions that deem them a terrorist in the public eye, or they may end up an Authority on their own, ruling with an iron fist. Finding the balance is key to Gears of Defiance, and the tension created by Family members trying to take opposite paths is a main source of drama for your campaign. \nEvery backer will receive a PDF copy of the quick-start rules PDF that was released at Gen Con 2017 in order to get an early look at the way the game is played! \nGears of Defiance is a game about hard choices, the bonds between family, and bringing change to a world of oppression. \nMake hard choices: what will you do when the Empire comes for you?\nShipping will be charged after the campaign is ended as part of the BackerKit survey. We estimate shipping to be ~$10-15 depending on your pledge level and add-ons for US backers, and international shipping will cost around ~$25-35 depending on pledge level and add-ons.\nIf you wish to add more of a item to your pledge, simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. We'll sort it all out in the pledge manager. If you're in the US, there's no increase in shipping. If you're international, extra shipping for add-ons will be added in BackerKit after the project! (We try to keep it as cheap and reasonable as possible.)\nThe book will be a 6x9 size book. \nAdditional Softcover $20 USD ($25 MSRP)\nAdditional Hardcover $30 USD ($35 MSRP)\nThese beautiful custom dice for Gears of Defiance are only while stock and supplies last, and there is no guarantee they'll be available after the Kickstarter!\n10 extra six-sided dice - $12 USD\nDice image mockup\nThese metal tokens are only being produced as part of this Kickstarter, and will be a brushed antique bronze look. These coins will be manufactured by Campaign Coins, known for their excellent products and reliable service!\n 10 extra metal Plot Point Tokens - $15 USD\nPlot Token Mock-Up!\nPDFs will be fulfilled by DriveThru!\nWe have many planned Stretch Goals to add more value to this book, including settings written by some of the top talent in the game design industry. \nEach stretch goal is planned to make the book even better and filled with more artwork and quick start settings. \nWe will announce our mystery professionals as we unlock stretch goals, to show you what new settings you can look forward to. These settings will include pre-created Empires and guidelines to creating a family.

Working with Gallant Knight Games and using their resources and knowledge will help ensure a great release. \n\nGallant Knight Games has an outstanding track record of customer service, publishing quality, and on-time (or early) delivery. \n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished? \nA: A mostly final draft of the text is completed and a preview of the rules was released at Gen Con 2017. The only text we'll have to wait on are the stretch goal settings, which will come to us after completion of the Kickstarter. We have a reliable artist on standby to complete the artwork, but we have a vast pool to draw from if there are any issues. \n\nQ: What if shipping costs increase? \nA: Shipping costs constantly rise, and while we've projected them to the best of our abilities, there's not a lot we can do if they change.

This new book from Dreamscarred Press will provide everything you need to use psionic powers in your Starfinder RPG campaign.\nWhat's In It\nThe Psionics Guide will include the following material to expand your options in a Science Fantasy campaign:\nNew Races - 11 psionic races to choose from the curious astreidi, the insectoid dromites, the immortal elans, the serpentine ophiduan, to the powerful half-giants\nFour New Classes - the iconic Psion, the Aegis who shapes energy into armor and weapons, the Specialist who uses her psionic power to overcome obstacles, and the Integrator who joins minds together into vast neural networks\nNew Feats - new feats for the different psionic classes\nNew Archetypes - including a Wilder archetype and the Soulknife archetype, which use the Starfinder RPG archetype design\nPsionic Powers - with powers from 1st level to 6th level\nPsionic Equipment to outfit your character or augment their abilities\nNew Psionic Themes\nSample mock-up cover, not intended to be final cover\nWhy Kickstarter\nOur initial goal is to have enough funds to cover all artwork costs and fulfillment costs. If we exceed that, we're planning on expanding the book and adding some additional psionic content. \nThe Psionics Guide has already been written and is going through public playtesting to get reviews and feedback. What we need funds for is artwork and printing costs. If we want to get an affordable, traditional offset print run, we need to order at least 1000 copies of the hardcover to be cost effective. While we can go with on-demand printing, we still need to pay the authors and artists for their work. And a book of this size isn't cheap to create.\nStretch Goals\nIf we exceed our base funding, we have additional goals for higher funding.\n ACHIEVED! $6000 - Children of the Void: We'll add the Children of the Void motif to the Psionics Guide. This includes new character options and GM tools.\nACHIEVED! $7000 - Psionic Character Sheets: The current Starfinder RPG character sheets are great for the core classes. But they're geared toward spellcasters. Psionics works differently, so our goal would be to create character sheets with spots to record your power points, powers known, and other psionic abilities. These sheets will be provided as a PDF download to all backers at $10 and up.\nACHIEVED! $8500 - Raiders of the Endless Sea: We'll add the Raiders of the Endless Sea motif to the Psionics Guide. This includes new character options and GM tools.\nACHIEVED! $10000 - Bestiary! We will add a psionic creature book to the project! This will include new psionic monsters and new grafts of a psionic nature. The Bestiary will be a separate book, so as to not impact the completion and shipping of the Psionics Guide. For PDF-only backers, we will add a new $15 reward tier to get a PDF copy of the Psionics Guide and the Bestiary.\nACHIEVED! $12000 - Dreamwalkers: We'll add the Dreamwalkers motif to the Psionics Guide. This includes new character options and GM tools.\nACHIEVED! $14000 - Athanatism: The Athanatism discipline, the psionic art of manipulating souls and spirits, will be added to the Psionics Guide, along with new psionic powers, class options, and more.\nACHIEVED! $16000 - More Iconic Artwork: At this level, we will add more artwork for the iconic characters of the different psionic classes.\nACHIEVED! $18000 - Shadow Wars: The Shadow Wars motif will be added, detailing the spies, saboteurs, and revolutionaries of the psionic races, and the resources they use to hide and find information, manipulate extradimensional space, and get out alive to fight another day.\nACHIEVED! $20000 - Full Page Artwork: Artwork is one of the largest costs in creating a book this size. With this funding level, we'll add full-page images to the start of each chapter.\nACHIEVED! $22000 - Expanded Bestiary: At this level, we will add more psionic monsters and options to the Psionic Bestiary. While this will increase the page count, it will not change the price of the book for any add-on selections.\nACHIEVED! $24000 - Fleshwarping: The Fleshwarping motif details the modern practice of an ancient psionic tradition, including new augmentations, powers, and other player options.\nACHIEVED! $26000 - Additional Artwork: At this funding level, we will set aside additional funds for interior artwork in the book.\nACHIEVED! $28000 - Bringers of Peace: We will add the Bringers of Peace motif, which will give expanded information on the Noral Democratic Republic, the frenzied terraforming obsessions of the duergar, and the online culture of the Astreidi, including player options and GM tools.\n$30000 - Psionic Starships: If we reach this funding level we will write the Strangers' Armada supplement, detailing the starships of various psionic nations and organizations, the weapons and systems developed for them, and exploring the role of psionics and magic in starship combat.\n$32000 - The Lost Children:The Lost Children motif will be added, which includes examples of psionic societies that developed apart from their parent cultures such as lost Noral colonies, Ophiduan rebels, and the tools they developed.\nMore will be revealed as we reach higher funding levels!\nNOTE: The themes discussed for stretch goals do not refer to the Starfinder RPG term theme like the Ace Pilot, but instead a thematic group of character options and GM tools.\nBacker Stretch Goals\nNow that we have achieved initial funding, we have some bonuses based upon the number of backers for the project! This means if we have the number of backers indicated by the goal, that reward will be unlocked!\nREACHED! 150 backers - Mobile device wallpaper downloads\nREACHED! 200 backers - Each of the four classes will receive ONE reward for an iconic character design. Like the cover art reward, the character concept MUST be approved by Dreamscarred Press. Please check the FAQ for more details.\nREACHED! 250 backers - Desktop wallpaper downloads\nREACHED! 300 backers - Backers will get to vote on ONE additional psionic monster to be included in the Bestiary!\nREACHED! 350 backers - The Familiar Strangers motif will be added, incorporating the psionic traditions of many non-psionic races, as well as the powers and techniques they have developed and the history of psionics in cultures where it is more niche and less visible.\nREACHED! 400 backers - We will create a printable minis PDF of the iconic psionic characters. All backers at $10 and up will get this PDF.\nREACHED! 450 backers - We will create a printable minis PDF of the creatures from the Bestiary. All backers at $15 and up will get this PDF.\nREACHED! 500 backers - Backers will get to vote on a SECOND additional psionic monster to be included in the Bestiary!\nREACHED! 600 backers - We will add the Seekers in the Great Night motif, which will include content relevant to the mysteries of the psionic races, their colonies & outposts, and player/GM tools for 'frontier' stories.\n700 backers - We will produce an artwork PDF for all backers at $10 or higher.\nRewards\nBackers at $10 and higher will get rewards as our thanks of bringing this project to life! Since we cannot update reward selections once they've been chosen, we'll add to the list here if we reach stretch goals that add any additional rewards.\n$10 or higher - PDF of Psionics Guide, PDF of printable iconic minis, and PDF of psionic character sheet\n$15 or higher - PDF of Psionics Guide, PDF of printable iconic minis, PDF of psionic character sheet, PDF of Bestiary, and PDF of printable creature minis.\n$50 or higher - Standard full-color, hardcover copy and PDF of Psionics Guide, PDF of printable iconic minis, PDF of psionic character sheet, PDF of Bestiary, and PDF of printable creature minis.\n$100 or higher - Premium full-color, hardcover copy and PDF of Psionics Guide, PDF of psionic character sheet, PDF of printable iconic minis, PDF of Bestiary, and PDF of printable creature minis. See below for example of premium vs standard prints. \nStandard vs. premium printed books\nYou may be wondering what is the difference between the standard full-color hardcover book and the premium full-color hardcover book. Standard prints are done using our normal print-on-demand printing facility, using inkjet printing technology. Premium prints are done using more traditional offset printing processes, which are more expensive when done at smaller runs because of the setup cost. Premium prints will have more vibrant colors. Both use the same weight of paper.\nAdd-Ons  \nYou can increase your pledge to get additional rewards!  \n$45 - If you want additional copies of the Psionics Guide, add $45 for every standard additional copy you want.  \n$95 - If you're pledging at the $100 or higher tier, add $95 for every additional premium copy of the Psionics Guide you want.\nWith $10,000 in funding reached, we will also be producing a 64-page Bestiary of psionic monsters and grafts! All backers at $15 or higher get the PDF of the Bestiary as part of your rewards.\nIf you want a print copy, you can add the cost to your reward total based upon which version of the Bestiary you'd like: softcover full color, hardcover standard color, or hardcover premium color.\nSoftcover full color - add $25 to your pledge amount\nHardcover standard color - add $35 to your pledge amount\nHardcover premium color - add $50 to your pledge amount\nBecause the Psionics Guide may finish before the Bestiary is finished, we may ship these separately. For backers in the US, there is no additional shipping cost. For international backers, we will have an option in your survey to select if you want us to wait and bundle the two books or to invoice for the additional shipping costs. \nSample mock-up cover, not intended to be final cover\nFulfillment\nDigital downloads and printed book fulfillment will be done using DriveThruRPG. We've successfully used DriveThruRPG to distribute PDFs for our Patreon campaign, and we use DriveThruRPG's on-demand printing service for some order fulfillment already, so it only makes sense for us to continue to use them for this project.

Since then, seven adventures, three supplements and four accessories have been published for the game line. Siren's Call will be the largest and most ambitious to date!\nOnce the initial funding goal has been reached, additional stretch goals will be unveiled. These goals may either be unlocked at specified funding levels, or at a specific number of patrons for Tab Creations' accompanying Patreon project. The conditions for unlocking each goal will be specified in its description.\nUNLOCKED! - Siren Poster Map - $2000: Our first stretch goal unlocks a world map of Siren, the planet to be colonized by the ARC Project. This will be made available in print as a poster map, and digitally in a high resolution image format. The electronic version and an \"at cost\" code for the print version will be included in all reward tiers at THE GAME and up.\nUNLOCKED! - Player's Brief - $3000: The Siren's Call Player's Brief will be a full color PDF document containing all of the player-facing information and options from the Siren's Call campaign and sourcebook. Perfect for GMs to distribute to their players before the game! It will be included in all reward tiers at THE GAME and up.\nUNLOCKED! - Colony Ship Deck Plans - $4000: This stretch goal unlocks a set of deck plans for the ARC Project colony ship. These will be made available in print as a poster map, and digitally in a high resolution image format. The electronic version and an \"at cost\" code for the print version will be included in all reward tiers at THE GAME and up.\nUNLOCKED! - Product Upgrades - $5000: When this funding total is reached we will upgrade a number of Shadows Over Sol products to include the latest production options and information from Siren's Call. This includes adding a GM Screen Insert for the new Colony Building system, updating the Roll20 character sheet and revising the Quick-Start to include better art and an upgraded layout.\nUNLOCKED! - Double the Art Budget - $6000: At this funding level we can afford to double the budget the game has for art and layout, making the final sourcebook better for everyone!\nUNLOCKED! - Additional Scenario - $7000: When this funding total is reached we will add an additional scenario to the Siren's Call sourcebook, further expanding the adventure possibilities for everyone! This scenario will be one of the many optional \"side treks.\"\nUNLOCKED! - Prelude Adventure - 25 Patrons: Tab Creations has a Patreon where every three months we release an adventure or other short supplement. If we can increase our Patreon to 25 patrons by April 26, we will release a prelude adventure to Siren's Call free to all patrons and backers of this Kickstarter!\nUNLOCKED! - Pregenerated Colonists - $8000: At this funding level we will publish a set of pregenerated colonists, ready to use as player characters or as NPCs in your Siren's Call campaign. These will be released in PDF with ready-to-print character sheets, and will be available to all backers.\n\u201cLove the Saga Machine system... Going to adapt the system to other RPGs!\u201d\n\u2014James C., DriveThruRPG\nSiren's Call for Shadows Over Sol combines the wonder and mystery of science fiction with the intensity and danger of the horror genre.

Thanks to the portal known as the Rabbit Hole, a train ride away from London lies the Grosvenor Land, a new world of fertile plains, towering mountains, giant insects, and Babylonians with battery powered zombies. Seems they got there first, three thousand years ago, and they're not exactly the welcoming sort. The Saurid tribes, lizard-like folk who ride theropods and pteranodons, complicate matters further. Back home on Earth, clockwork engineering has brought mechanical computing to the world, and micro-steam engines drive airships through the sky. Stranger things are afoot, too, as a bit of magic seems to have come into the world with the opening of the portal. People are changing. Secret societies are finding their ancient occult practices a bit more effective. Who knows what might be lurking in the forests these days, or in that shipment from China?\nPlay as Aristocrats, Soldiers, Big Game Hunters, Weird Scientists, Airship Pilots, Mediums, and more! Explore the Gruv! Maneuver for favour in court! Perform deniable actions for firms that would like their rivals impeded! Confront the terrors of the spirit world, or face off against the lethal fauna of a lost world!\n  From secrets of Her Majesty's government, to descriptions of secret societies, to details of the inventions of the age, the Gamemaster's Compendium delivers a wealth of knowledge and information for the gamemaster to incorporate into their 1879 campaign. Contained herein are the game mechanics for traps and poisons, Engine hacking, airships, horses and other mounts, and gamemaster characters. A large chapter explains the alternate history of Earth, including how the Zulus and Maoris ended up in the regular Army, and how women got the vote generations earlier than in ours, both of which are still having repercussions. Another large chapter describes the Earth presence in the Gruv, from Fort Alice and the research camp at Mount Somerville to the settlements of the British and Prussians. Delve more deeply into the alternate history, challenge your players with complex, ongoing plotlines, and let slip clues of nefarious doings that will require true heroes to oppose and bring the scoundrels to justice!\nIt's done. It's written. The layout is complete. We will release the draft PDF, with missing art, to everyone who backs for a PDF or higher reward package, so you can see what you're getting.\nBut it needs art. We've only got full page chapter openers for a third of the book. There's no art of the Giffards, and how can you have a steampunk roleplaying game without airships?\nArtists have to be paid. We've got them lined up already. We send them the downpayment, they start drawing. When those drawings are done, we have to have the rest of the cash in hand, as it's due on delivery.\nDodgers scarpering while Smedley holds off the Peelers\nAnd there's printing. Books take the kind of rolls of paper you see on a flatbed going down the highway, the kind that takes an industrial crane to lift. Ink by the barrel. Cardstock for the covers, and color printing. Binding glue. Wages for the machinery operators.\nYou're interested in our game line, or you wouldn't have read this far. Chances are, you've played the game at a convention, or a Friendly Local Game Store, or a demo at somebody's house. You might already have the 1879 Player's Guide. You want the 1879 Gamemaster's Guide. We can make that happen. \nWe just need your help.\nLook to the right and you'll see the rewards. The 1879 GM's Guide, optionally bundled with the 1879 Players' Guide and the 1879 GM Screen, in softcover print, PDF, and combinations thereof. Pick your product, make your pledge. Make this book happen.\nThere's two worlds to explore, mountains to cross, battles to fight, and airships to fly. Let's get cracking!\nTally Ho!\nOh, yes, there will be stretch goals.\nAt $7500:\nWe strike the medal that's on the cover of the 1879 GM's Guide. If you've met us at a convention, or played in a demo, you've seen and probably received a medal or two from us. These are serious metal, enamel inlay, pinback ribbon, the whole bit, suitable for cosplay. We will strike 100 copies of the medal, and those will go out to everyone who has already pledged for a print copy. We'll make any left over a $5 add-on for any other pledges.\nAt $10,000:\nWe release a t-shirt with brand new art. We'll give the shirt to anyone who has pledged for either the All Books Print or Print+PDF bundle. The t-shirt will become a $20 add-on for any other pledge.\nThere's no secret stretch goals. They're all right here. If we hit some crazy number, we'll figure it out when and if it happens.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll projects carry risk.

Thank you in advance for understanding, please pledge responsibly.\n\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5\nKingdom Death Monster is an massive cooperative board game about survival in a nightmare-horror world. Survivors fight for their lives against an onslaught of bizarre and fearsome creatures. They will use the fruits of these battles to build a fragile civilization in a place where humans are at the bottom of a monstrous ecology. \nInitially, I brought the concept for Monster to Kickstarter in order to make a far-away dream into a reality. The runaway train of success helped pack the game with more original art, in-depth gameplay, and fantastically sculpted minis than even I dreamed of. A game this size could not feasibly be made without the community of supportive backers we found on Kickstarter. It's too expensive to produce and too vivid for distribution.\nThrough the experience of kickstarting Monster, I found a group of people that shares my vision for a blisteringly difficult game with a continually emerging story. I am truly humbled to share it with the world.\nNow there isn't a single factory sealed copy at KD HQ. There are still people asking if there will ever be more so I'm back on Kickstarter to launch a campaign for a new edition. I want to print updated rules, great new expansions, even more content and (with your help) many surprises!!!\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Changelog\nAdd-Ons\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Gambler's Chest\nGambler's Rolls\n                                                                                                                                                                                                     First Hero Expansion\nIn the First Hero Expansion, players take the role of 4 veteran survivors who have no settlement to call their own. They find and invade a settlement where they face the First Hero, a survivor so powerful, they do all the hunting by themselves! The purpose of this expansion is to help players start more advanced campaigns at Lantern Year 12 or 20. Instead of simply providing complicated rules to generate later settlements, your showdown with the First Hero will create the advanced settlement that you can take over.\n Kingdom Death: Monster\nShipping Details & Shipping Waves\nOne thing we've learned from managing the impossibly huge number of reward combinations from our first campaign is to strike a balance between timely delivery of rewards to our eager fans and being logistically responsible to our staff and partners. So here's what we've decided about shipping rewards for this campaign.\n\nWe have set the estimated delivery of all pledge levels to December 2020. This is a best case scenario, in case our campaign gets insanley huge! 3-4 years development, production & transportation cycle to 100% finish every promise we might make during this campaign is realistic.  \nRewards from this Kickstarter will ship in waves that will be determined by the final scope of this campaign. Each wave's shipping costs will be collected through a pledge manager (most likely backerkit) when the goods are ready to ship. Shipping costs will reflect the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you selected from that wave.\nLike our previous campaign, we will make our best efforts to ease the burden of shipping by fulfilling rewards from shipping partners around the world (projected as: US, CA, EU, AU.)\nBackers are responsible for any and all import fees, VAT, duties, taxes, post office fees, and or any other fees their country or government imposes.\n\n*Core Games Ships Separately!\nThe Core Game is massive. To ensure its safety, it is being package into its own carton with corner protectors. It is too heavy to ship with other rewards.

Shipments that could not be delivered due to an inaccurately provided address (including failure to update an old address) will have additional costs to be reshipped.

Not all my lessons were easy, but all of them were meaningful. Trying to bring such a staggeringly large game to life, we worked insane hours, fought lots of battles, and saw some unexpected setbacks. It's taught me how to look for ways to turn logistical, artistic, and fiscal difficulties into assets.\n\n\nI'm heading into this campaign with my eyes open. If this campaign meets with success we'll be on the hook to you guys for loads more quality content. The bigger we get, the more complex fulfillment will become. I will create a transparent, streamlined campaign from the outset and work hard to maintain the honest communication about our process and developments to make sure we meet everyone's expectations.

Lovecraft\n  The light of science has yet to banish the darkness of the supernatural from the Victorian world. Yet lurking beyond what is a mere shadow of horror is a far more darker and malevolent reality - a world where sanity can be shredded in an instant by the startling revelations that mankind is ultimately an insignificant speck of dust in an uncaring universe inhabited by immense and hostile beings from beyond space and time.\nInspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft, Leagues of Cthulhu explores the mind-rending terror of the Cthulhu Mythos.\nThis book is set a generation earlier than Lovecraft's works, which were primarily based in the 1920s and 1930s. Lovecraft's canon has yet to become reality for the fictional world of Leagues of Adventure, meaning it is your adventurers who have the dubious honor of being the first to explore risen R'lyeh, scale the Mountains of Madness, or locate the lost city of Sarnath.\nIs this a standalone RPG?\nNo.\nThis book is an expansion designed for use with Leagues of Adventure, a roleplaying game of Victorian exploration, derring-do, and steampunk weird science. The contents will be compatible with other Ubiquity-powered games, though. However, if you want all the rich background information on the Victorian world into which Leagues of Cthulhu snugly fits, you'll need Leagues of Adventure.\nRegardless of your Ubiquity setting of choice, possession of the Leagues of Gothic Horror core book is essential as we are not repeating the rules for using occult tomes or magic, nor the new horror-related Leagues, Talents, Flaws, and weird science devices, introduced in that volume.\nWhat's the difference between this and Chaosium's Cthulhu by Gaslight?\nWhile the two games are set in the same era, Gaslight, while a great book, focuses solely on Victorian Britain. Leagues of Adventure already covers the Victorian world, allowing us to focus the contents of this book purely on the Cthulhu Mythos of the late Victorian era.\nPreview\nWhile we've only done some preliminary writing for Leagues of Cthulhu, there is enough variation to put together a short preview. So that's what we've done! \nPlease note that this is a first draft, uses placeholder art, and doesn't have the final page background. The color image of \"Victorian Jeff Combos\" will be replaced, either by a backer of the Cthulhu Fhtagn level or someone from our artist's imagination.\nhttp://www.tripleacegames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cthulhu-Preview.pdf\nUnlike our previous Leagues of Adventure books, Leagues of Cthulhu will be printed in our new format of choice - 6.69\" x 9.61\" (170 mm x 244 mm). The book is 96 pages, with black and white interior pages and a full color hardcover.\nWithin the book you will find:\nAn overview of the Cthulhu Mythos as written by H. P. Lovecraft.\nA new skill for those brave enough to delve into the forbidden lore of the Cthulhu Mythos.\nNew weird science devices and a new League of Adventure suitable for those who have peered beyond the illusion of reality.\nSample characters (with art) and eight sample henchmen.\nMythos magic and sanity-shattering tomes.\nA tour of dozens of Mythos locations around the globe.\nAlien gods, terrifying monsters, and dastardly cults guaranteed to test even the strongest mind.\nAdvice on handling the Mythos, along with extra adventure seeds.\n  This project is designed to be simple for you to pledge and us to manage. As you can see, it contains only a few pledge levels. Unlike some of our earlier projects, there is no softcover option for this particular book - only hardcover or PDF. If you want additional physical copies you can add them to your pledge as Add-Ons.\nThe core pledge levels are as follows:\n  The cost of shipping will be calculated and collected after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via a pledge manager program. The following costs are estimates: UK \u00a34, USA \u00a35, EU \u00a310, Rest of World \u00a312.\nShipments will be sent from within both the US and the UK, thus minimizing any complicated customs or shipping issues.\nPlease be aware that customers are responsible for paying any customs duties for their country.\nSupporting our Kickstarter is easy! Just follow the steps below:  \n1. Choose the pledge level you want. We have all of our recommended pledges detailed below.\n2. Click \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" and select your reward level (called REWARD) on the page following.\n3. Include the value of any Add-Ons you want.\n4. Enter your total amount. Shipping will be calculated and added on after the Kickstarter ends.\nYou are free to amend your pledge at any time using the green 'Manage My Pledge' button.\nOur main aim is to fund this book. If we raise enough additional money, we'll unlock sanity-shattering stretch goals. Don't worry if your pledge level doesn't contain a free set of dice (or if you want multiple sets) or a physical copy of stretch goal books - you can procure them as Add-Ons once they are unlocked.\nFull Color Interior\n(\u00a36,500, app. $8,000)\nThe interior will be changed from black and white to full color (this includes the character archetype images). Every backer will automatically receive this stretch goal at no extra cost. For print reward backers, the paper will be upgraded to a gloss finish and thicker quality.\nRealm of Morpheus: The Dreamlands\n(\u00a310,000, app. $12,000)\nThis 64-page black and white, softcover comic book format book takes campaigns beyond the realm of reality and into the weird and wonderful land of dreams. Inside you'll find a gazetteer of wondrous places and strange denizens, rules for entering and altering the Dreamlands, and new character options.\nCthulhu-themed Dice\n(\u00a311,500, app. $14,000)\nAs every Ubiquity fan knows, the system requires only the counting of odds and evens to determine the success of die rolls. This level funds the manufacture of six-sided dice with three blank faces and three bearing an Elder Sign symbol. The dice will be bundled into packs of 10.\nCutthroats & Cthulhu\n(\u00a315,000, app. $18,000) \nThis 64-page black and white, softcover comic book format book blends swashbuckling pirates with the Cthulhu Mythos. Sail the high seas, plunder treasure, and fight the sinister Cthulhu cults! Contents include a tour of the Spanish Main AND Barbary Coast, statistics for sailing ships, dastardly foes and devilish cults, and new character options.\n  Choose your required add-on below and add the additonal price to your total pledge amount.\n  Unlike many of our previous Kickstarters, writing for this project (aside from some preliminary work) has not yet commenced - that will start as soon as we know that you want this book in your hands. Those of you who have followed Triple Ace Games for a while know that Wiggy is no slouch when it comes to writing. We're not asking you to fund the writing or layout processes, though. We need your support to pay for the art and printing costs, thus enabling us to turn this book from a dream into reality.\nShipping isn't free to us, so we've had to include it, along with Kickstarter's fees, in the base funding goal. Naturally, both of these \"extras\" result in a higher base funding target.\nTriple Ace Games began in 2008. The masterminds behind the company, Paul \"Wiggy\" Wade-Williams and Robin Elliott, had previously worked on The Savage World of Solomon Kane and Slipstream settings, among others, for Pinnacle Entertainment Group. Triple Ace Games has produced many popular settings, including Hellfrost, Leagues of Adventure, and All for One: Regime Diabolique, plus the Rocket Race and Cadaver card games.

If all goes to plan, we may even be able to deliver the project a little sooner.\n\nWe understand the printing process as we have printed a good number of books previous to this project, and we know how to communicate our ideas to the printer.

There are so many good answers as to why you should care that it's hard to restrict myself to just 20 or so. But let me try to limit myself to 3, while cheating egregiously.\nThe game doesn't take sides, but you must.\n1. Your character. Hi character!\nMAYBE you're one of The Fallen, \"a domestic terrorist\" with Extra Lives (CLONES!). Sure, they call you a terrorist, and of course, they would. Who's \"they?\" All the theys. The Colonial Confederated Republics (oppression, authoritarianism, nationalism - a \"Confederation\" ruled by a dynasty of Presidents for life). Great House Yamamoto, Great House Dresden, Great House Dallas (robber barons, one and all, just with different cultures and different colored war machines). \nDon't agree with them? Fine, they know what to do with you. Are you a manufactured Replicant? Shut up toaster, you're property. Are you a transhuman Celestial? Shut up, you're just a sleeper cell for the GAIA. Are you an alien Xel? You don't even LOOK human. \nIt's a shitty world, and no, the arc of history does not either \"bend toward justice.\" Justice comes out of the barrel of your gun. \nAnd it just might work out that way - you've chosen your cause and you've got the inside track, the knowledge, and the firepower to make it happen. You've already decided to die on your feet, not on your knees. But even if the cops, the goons, and the agents can't stop you, you might tear yourselves apart when the quick decisions have to be made. \nGood luck with that.\nExcept no, I FUCKING LIED. You don't have to be one of the Fallen, and in fact, you shouldn't. In fact, you should probably do everything you can to stop them, because they are omnicidial maniacs lead by an immortal posthuman monster, bent on destroying the Galaxy. As a matter of fact, maybe you're one of the \"cops and goons\" that are trying to SAVE THE GODDAMN WORLD(S). As a Republic Armada Colonial Marine or Jackhammer pilot, you don't care if the Fallen die on their feet or their knees as long as they die until they run out of clones. As an RIA Agent, you don't want them dead at all. You want them in cuffs and in custody... and you want them to flip. Except that just like you've got moles in their organization, you've got moles in yours.\nGood luck with that.\nAs a proud partisan of Great House Dresden, Great House Dallas, or Great House Yamamoto - the inheritors of enormous cultural wealth and worldly power - you obviously don't want the Fallen to burn down the Galaxy around your ears. You also don't want to remain a client state of the Republic forever. The only other problem is the other two great houses.\nGood luck with that.\nAnd it's not a matter of which side you join. It's a matter of which sides you join - because very likely, you belong to more than one of the above factions, as a double or triple agent.\nGood luck with that!\nAnd then of course there are the Redeemers... (but more on that later.)\n2. The Game Itself\nIt's called The Singularity System, I wrote it, and we published it in 2013. If you back this Kickstarter at any level in the double digit dollars, you absolutely won't need to buy it separately. \nJust one thing to say, from which all the rest flows: this game has no safety net for plot, and no safety net for your character. Except the clones, that is, but those run out too.\nThe micro version is, of the core rules you roll a number of six sided dice equal to your Skill or Attribute. Every die that comes up a five or higher is a hit, unless something's Easy - then 4s count too - or Hard - then only 6s count. The more dice you have in a Skill or Attribute, the more hits you're likely to roll, the better chance of success in whatever you're trying to do. \nPCs are special. They have Advent. This represents that they've been chosen by destiny to change the galaxy - it is NOT a guarantee that they'll survive doing it, not even with their \"extra lives\", but it is a chance to be BIG DAMN HEROES and to ACTUALLY CHANGE THE GALAXY, leaving the GM scrambling to figure out how to deal with the various factions' response to the fall out of your PCs destroying a fucking planet--or failing to prevent one from being destroyed.\nAdvent are not \"FATE Points\". They are not \"Bennies\". They are most similar to Edge, from Shadowrun, but they're not exactly that either. \n\nAdvent lets you post-hoc reroll all the dice on a test you failed. It lets you add a bunch of dice to a test before rolling. It lets you maximize your initiative in combat. It lets you declare a test to be 'Easy' before you roll it. It provides a ton of tactical options, but you have a limited amount of it. And the GM gets his own Advent pool too! \n3. Experience the fractured future of post-diaspora humanity as you've never seen it before:\nBe a cybernetically augmented human, a human psionic, an assimilated psychic alien, or one of four choirs of posthuman \"angels\" perfected by the AI that has abandoned them.  \nNo matter what your Origin, you're not confined to a class-and-level system, but can construct your character freely: for those who don't feel like going into that much depth, there are package deals ready to go for augmentation, gear, or vehicles.  \nThe Republic struggles to maintain the Status Quo. The Fallen are out there waiting to burn the system down. The three Great Houses want to maintain the status quo, but not as much as they want to come out on top of each other. Any given party could nominally all belong to any one of these factions, while each member SECRETLY belongs to another faction. Your conflicting loyalties WILL cause you to betray each other. These betrayals WILL be made more complicated by the following.  \n(Your first) death is not the end: YOU HAVE A FINITE NUMBER OF CLONES, I.E. EXTRA LIVES.  \nCharacters are made awesome by Edges. Edges are acquired during character creation by having Problems that complicate their lives, by taking on Secret Allegiances (see above), and by selling back Clones (i.e. extra lives).  \nThese awesome characters then engage in espionage, intrigue, and the most tactical, visceral, personal and/or vehicular combat you've seen in an RPG.\nIt is the year 556 R.T. (Republic Time) and humanity has long since fled a doomed Earth. A desperate exodus aboard a space station controlled by a mad Artificial Intelligence left humanity \u2013 along with the technologically enhanced \u201cCelestials\u201d and the alien Xel \u2013 stranded in a cold and empty galaxy. \nAlways resilient, humanity has survived, colonizing dozens of inhabitable planets, moons, and asteroids throughout several solar systems. \nAnd all these worlds fall under the jurisdiction of the Confederated Colonial Republics. \nA state of perpetual cold war exists between the three Great Houses, often erupting into small armed conflicts, large scale industrial espionage, and proxy wars. The Unificationist Church of Undying Faith, a monotheistic religious organization led by the living immortal messiah, Lady Mariah, draws in followers by the thousands each day to Bethlehem Sector.  \nTerrorist groups continue to plague the worlds of the C.C.R., including a violent anarchist/secessionist movement seeking to overthrow the Republic: The Fallen. \nThe destruction of the G.A.I.A. ended humanity's First Exodus: she was destroyed by one man, Armand Carter - forever enshrined as humanity's greatest hero - and one monster, Sigmus The Fallen, one of her Greater Celestials gone rogue. Armand Carter's descendants lead the Second Exodus to the Galactic Capital of Avalon, and have since ruled the galaxy in an unbroken line of democratically elected \"Presidents For Life\".\nBut men and Xel and Celestials and Replicants - the former two changed forever by Her, the latter two created by Her - have whispered in the five centuries since that the GAIA, fragmented into four distinct personalities, lives on. A secret high tech cult, lead by Celestials but including among its ranks men and Replicants and more, known as the Redeemers, bide their time and await Mother's return, to make the Galaxy whole. They know that in new forms they may not recognize that She is coming.\n\nThey are right.\nKickstarter, you said you want my story. You got it. It was a long time ago, in a universe far, far away. It was... College. \nFor three years and six scholastic semesters, from Fall of 2005 to Spring of 2008, I ran a live action science fiction roleplaying game called Systems Malfunction on the Campus of SUNY Purchase. \nThe game\u2019s plot took the form of one incredibly long, incredibly complex, more-or-less cohesive story. Playing two nights a week, or more, each game taking between four and eight hours to complete (we started at 10PM). We almost never took a week off. We played around thirty games a semester, each of them five hours long on average, for six straight semesters with irregular and occasional bonus games and events on weekends. The central story with all its sub-plots was, all told, about a thousand hours long. \nIt would have been my honor and privilege and joy and great relief to assure you that the story of Systems Malfunction is over and done with forever, the end complete, so to speak. But then there would be no Kickstarter. The story isn't over. It's not even close. And that's where you come in. Help us make this epic science fiction universe come to life!  \nInspirations are everything, there's no such thing as a 100% original story, and true plagiarism is vanishingly rare: instead, what does happen, is that everyone mines from the same influences that influence everyone else. \nThe Televator pitch: Systems Malfunction is: Aliens meets Akira meets Dune IN SPACE!

To say that I am impressed by this set of rules would be an understatement.

The mechanics are easy to learn and work well.\" \n -Daniel C., rpgnow review   \n\"Let's add another voice to the chorus of people saying: This is a fantastic achievement. A game every roleplayer should look at to see a great game does not need several hundred pages, sometimes two are enough. And I think the latter is much harder to pull off.\"\n -Markus B, rpgnow review\n\"A lot of games have tried to do the small, simple, but functional systems, but this has to be one of the best efforts I have ever seen. A very basic core, with modules (like Mass Combat and Scaling) to allow more flexibility, and multiple examples of how to further tweak for various settings, Adventurers! Revised is an impressive site to behold.\"\n-Tommy Brownell, reviewer\n Almost three years have passed since we at GRAmel published Adventurers! It was a gamble; could you put an entire game system in only two pages?\n\nThree years and a dozen published Adventurers! settings later, we can say: \u201cYes, you can\u201d.\n\nBut what is Adventurers? It is a traditional, old school RPG, with strong roots in Fighting Fantasy, Dungeons & Dragons, Savage Worlds and a bit of FATE.  \n  The system is very simple: characters have three Stats, Strength, Agility and Mind, ranging from -1 to 6 and a set of very broad and customizable Skills, available in Base and Advanced form.  \nActions are resolved simply by rolling two d6, and adding the relevant Stat; you succeed on 7 or more.\n  Looks simple? It is, but it is VERY customizable. \n\nIf you are interested, you can read review of two basic books here, on The Most Unread Blog on the Internet. Ever.\n\n You can download Adventurers! Revised for free HERE!\nAdventurers! is a living game, and like all living things, it grows and evolves, both from in-house development and from the suggestions of the many fans playing it around the world.\nWhat has changed? A lot and very little at the same time: for example, characters are now described by a Concept and the new Scale System allows you to handle characters, starships, armies, and even star-spanning empires with the same simple ruleset!\nIn a few words, we have a number of nifty ideas we want to introduce into the game, and we want to improve the presentation too, to make it more gamer-friendly and immediate.\nIn addition, a number of players asked us for a dead tree edition of the game, but, the game being  very concise, this was hard to do, because we want Adventurers to maintain the same denseness of content of the electronic version.\nSo, after a lot of pondering, we decided to do two Adventurers books, a Core and a Fantasy book, not just with the rules but packed with settings, a great number of them, and, with your help, additional settings will be unlocked!\n    In this 100+ page, black and white (or color and black and white - depends on pledge level) book you\u2019ll find:  \nAdventurers Revised Edition\nThe core rules of the game, including the Player Guide, the Game Master Guide, character sheet, Monster Cards and everything you need to play Adventurers!\n Space Rangers\n The exoticism of space opera meets space western in this setting: the heroes are Space Rangers, the last bastion of law in the Frontier Sector, protecting human colonies scattered among a number of far, untamed planets. They hunt outlaws and space pirates, bring medical help and advance the exploration of a largely unknown area of the universe.\nRemember the Old West? Well, this is the same, but in space. And now, as millennia ago, the motto is still true: \"One Riot, One Space Ranger\". So take your old, battered spaceship, bring your posse with you and be ready to protect the Galaxy. Space ship rules (with customization options) included!\nVoodo Pirates\n Avast, ye landlubbers! In this dark pirate setting, players adventure as swashbuckling heroes eager for fortune and fame on the Cursed Spanish Main.\nDrawing inspiration from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, players will sail the Cursed Caribbean as greedy pirates, rough privateers, hardy explorers, attractive governors\u2019 daughters, dark Voodoo priests or cunning merchants. Will you hoard piles of treasure, or will you be eaten by ravenous zombies or drowned by the alluring Mermaids? \nNew rules for handling naval battles and life at sea, severed limbs, eye patches, trained pets, sharp wits and dark voodoo practices make this setting a must for ye all, mateys!\n This book doesn`t include rules, but it is fully playable with free rules.\nIn this 100+ page, black and white (or color and black and white - depends on pledge level) book you\u2019ll find:\nGothica\n There is a road, deep in the Carpathians, bringing you to an ample vale, full of dark, misty woods. It is Gothica.\nThe ruler of the vale is Count Wolfgang Von Vurdalak, last heir of an ancient family which earned their power through bloodshed and slaughter. In the last few years nobody has seen Count Vurdalak by day, and his decrees are administered by minor nobles each with their own domain. There is a saying in Gothica: if you enter the dark vale, you\u2019ll never leave it\u2026 alive!\nGothica is the supernatural horror setting for Adventurers! Grab your black powder pistol and your rapier, wear your tabard and don\u2019t forget to bring a silver cross with you!\nKung Fu Adventurers! \n Unleash your inner energy! In this setting players will become animal heroes living exciting martial arts adventures in the fictional, far-eastern empire of Xi\u2019An. \nDrawing inspiration from the Kung Fu Panda movies, each player will hail from an \u201cAnimal Clan\u201d and fight cinematic battles defending their land against evil demons, Hong Kong movie style! Will you be a wandering monk hero of the Tiger Clan, a violent brute of the Boar Clan, a frightening Wushu sorcerer of the Mantis Clan or a heartless assassin of the Snake Clan? \nMany different martial arts schools, incredible cloud-walking skills, awesome Chi focusing abilities, a new Power sphere focusing on Pressure Points and a lot of exotic weapons await you in this wuxia setting!\nThe Dungeon\n This companion takes Adventurers! back to the real roots of gaming: fantasy dungeon crawling! \nAs a player, you\u2019ll find extra rules and options to lead the heroes into ancient ruins full of monsters and treasures, just like in the old 80s role playing games, plus rules for creating a heroes\u2019 company and building your own stronghold.\n As a Game Master do you have no time to design complex maps for your dungeons? Fear not: in the sourcebook you\u2019ll find a complete, abstract and map-less system to venture in labyrinths, plus rules for traps, crafting magical items, handling dungeon situations and much more!\n  Adventurers! is more than a simple ruleset. It is a philosophy of concision and denseness of information.\nAll our settings include:\nA player guide (with a description of the world, new Skills, gear and much more) \nA game master guide (with a mini-gazetteer, specific magic and monster rules)  \nA full-fledged scenario  \n6 Pre-generated heroes  \n20+ new monsters on Monster Cards (so you can easily consult them during the game)\nHere are some examples of upcoming settings - those depend on you!\n\nToy World  \n In this setting the players roleplay children\u2019s toys, living in a daycare center in a large mall. The toys spend their days playing with the kids visiting the daycare center, and at night, filled with the power of Joy, they participate in their own adventures. Teddy bears try to outwit the servants of the Rat King, master brick builders try to help the parrots in the pet store, and plastic paladins with shining swords maintain order. This is Toy World.\nEvent Zero\nWelcome to Event Zero, the street-level superheroes setting for Adventurers. In this setting you\u2019ll play a Special, a common person of Neopolis who suddenly discovers they have superhuman abilities! Will you use your powers for good or for selfish goals? Will you be a hero or a villain?\n Shadow City 2065\nThe year is 2065, the place was known as Hong Kong, but today, incredibly expanded and mutated, it is Shadow City, a free port, one of the biggest conurbations of the near future and the main access to the Lunar Colonies, thanks to the Space Elevator. The heroes are Nightjacks, highly trained specialists living on the razor\u2019s edge in a merciless world dominated by corporations. Will you survive the night?\n\n    Shipping \u2013 \u20ac15 (Whole world)   \nMonster Cards Deck \u2013 \u20ac10\nAdventurers! is only few pages long, but we know that, at the gaming table, a lot of time can be lost from the GM rummaging through the books to find monsters\u2019 stats. For this reason, Adventurers! introduces a deck of 55 Monster Cards, containing a selection of the most iconic creatures of each setting!  \nDice \u2013 \u20ac1.5\nWith a minimal expense you can have two d6 dice!\nCardboard Hero Points \u2013 \u20ac4\nA set of very handy counters to simulate the expense of Heroism without having to scratch the character sheets!\n                                   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAdventurers! will be published in cooperation with GRAmel/Fajne RPG, a Polish company known for Beasts and Barbarians, Nemezis, and Polish editions of Savage Worlds and Deadlands. 5 Adventurers! books have been printed for the Polish market already, and then reprinted, so our printers are ready.

You'll hear from us again!\nPlease visit www.7thSeaRPG.com for the latest news.\nVoyage of Fortune\u2019s Star is our single-player, 3D, story-driven, computer roleplaying game based in the rich world of Th\u00e9ah as presented in John Wick\u2019s tabletop roleplaying game, 7th Sea. We have a team of experienced storytellers, programmers and designers to bring you 10+ hours of incredible experience.\nHere's the story we want to tell!\nNow captain of the feared pirate vessel Fortune\u2019s Star, former Vodaccan duelist Anzolo Zorzi has a fearsome reputation, a loyal crew, and one of the fastest blades in all of Th\u00e9ah. But he also has a heart of gold. When he arrives at the scene of a naval battle to claim plunder from both winner and loser but salvages only an enormous stone sarcophagus that floats on the water, Anzolo has no notion that he\u2019s embarked on the strangest\u2014and most dangerous\u2014voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star. Anzolo expects to recover gold and jewels from the sealed tomb, but instead discovers a most surprising and long-missing clue that may allow the renowned Kreuzritter to defeat the legendary Schattenmann, a scissors-fingered creature that terrorizes that forests of Eisen. Unfortunately for Anzolo, and perhaps for the knights as well, the Kreuzritter require the pirate\u2019s assistance.\nFortunately, Anzolo has a guardian angel looking over him. Magdalena Salvaza is the Fate Witch currently entrusted with the generations-old duty of waiting for this moment. The Fate Witches of her line expected to guide someone of greater character than Anzolo Zorzi, but Magdalena\u2019s confidence in the pirate captain grows as she learns about his past and as she observes him in the present. Even as Anzolo faces dangers, forces allied with the Schattenmann understand that defeating Magdalena is the true key to foiling the Kreuzritter\u2019s ancient plans.\nCan we make this game for \"only\" $200k?\nAbsolutely!\nMy partners at Fuel.Tech wanted to provide a specific example of how we can stretch a smaller amount of money quite a long ways given 3D resources that are available. and below I present the result. They purchased a \"dungeon\" asset for $80 and spent about eight hours lightly modifying it before introducing our model of Anzolo Zorzi to create a gameplay scene. This process allows the team to avoid a lot of the heavy-lifting of building core assets and instead concentrate of modifying the asset to suit the specific needs of the game and story.\nThis is the brief description of the scene that Fuel.Tech opted to build:\nAlready in possession of a strange sarcophagus and its even stranger contents, Anzolo Zorzi, pirate captain of Fortune\u2019s Star, seeks a Syrneth artifact in the bowels of Iskandar.\nHere's the resulting gameplay clip:\nPLAY\n\nHere are some key elements of Voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star:\nYou primarily experience the story in the role of the captain of Fortune\u2019s Star, Anzolo Zorzi.\nWe hope to add the overlapping storyline of the Fate Witch, Magdalena Salvaza, so that for sequences of the game she becomes the primary character under your control.\nYou have a large crew of pirates and will be able to direct their actions as well.\nWhether you experience it only from Anzolo\u2019s point-of-view or if we can also add Magdalena\u2019s narrative, the story is our priority. Experienced, award-winning writers will craft a rich, dialogue-based narrative.\nThe game is built in Unreal Engine 4 and features action RPG gameplay.\nThe game is available as a digital release, as well as in standard and collector\u2019s boxed editions loaded with extras.\nWe\u2019re initially developing versions for PC, Mac and Linux.\nDigital release is to backers via Steam and also DRM-free.\nWe have many language options planned, including English, Italian, French, German and Spanish.\n  Update #1 reveals more about the Schattenmann!\nUpdate #2 shows our game budget and provides more information about Fuel.Tech, the team who will produce the game. \nUpdate #3 discusses the expertise of my partners at Fuel.Tech and why we CAN make this game. And there's a great new gameplay video too!\nUpdate #4 talks about the crew of Fortune's Star and diversity in 7th Sea TTRPG and our cRPG.\nOur first update also introduced six Social Stretch Goals to gain exclusive in-game items for all backers. Here is the progress on those:\nShare the Facebook post: 122/100 (SUCCESS!)\nBackers only will receive a Zephyr Bag in-game item!\nKeep sharing!

Note that you may now choose between sets of 3d6 or 3d10. The dice are pictured in Add-Ons below.\nThe two digital-only pledges for our project \u2014 Digital and Special Digital \u2014 offer two options: \u201cFirst Mate\u201d & \u201cCrew\u201d. The \u201cFirst Mate\u201d pledges offer a slight discount over the \u201cCrew\u201d pledges. We offer the \u201cFirst Mate\u201d pledge as thanks for those who back our project until it has funded. Once our project is funded, the First Mate pledges will be closed.\nWhy offer a First Mate pledge? There\u2019s a reason for you and a reason for us.\nFor you: It\u2019s thanks for your early support for our project. Some Kickstarter projects offer an \u201cearly bird\u201d reward, so this is a bit like that. We want everyone who helps us reach our funding goal to be considered an \u201cearly bird\u201d and this method allows us to do that.\nFor us: Early momentum is key on Kickstarter. If offering a discount on pledges to early supporters helps convince you to support the project, then it\u2019s worth offering the discount so that the project has a chance to grow even bigger over the course of the month.\n  7th Sea was reborn as a tabletop roleplaying game here on Kickstarter earlier this year. It was a huge success. In fact, it became Kickstarter\u2019s highest-funded, most-backed tabletop RPG of all time. The game is one of swashbuckling and intrigue, exploration and adventure, taking place on the continent of Th\u00e9ah, a land of magic and mystery inspired by our own Europe. Players take the roles of heroes thrown into global conspiracies and sinister plots, exploring ancient ruins of a race long vanished, and protecting the rightful kings and queen of Th\u00e9ah from murderous villains.\nTh\u00e9ah is made up of a number of Nations, each with its own character and personality. The concept of \u201cnation\u201d is new to Th\u00e9ah, only emerging in the last century or so. National identity has also begun to spread among the people, making culture more than just an expression of the monarch\u2019s tastes. The current Nations of Th\u00e9ah represent the whole of the civilized world\u2014as far as the Th\u00e9ans are concerned.\nAvalon: Green and enchanted, this union of three kingdoms has recently risen to the forefront of Th\u00e9an politics.\nCastille: Headquarters of the Vaticine church, this fertile Nation recently fought off an invasion\u2014their western neighbor, Montaigne, wished to seize their rich farmlands and plentiful mines.\nEisen: A proud land recovering from a thirty-year war. A Nation of veterans, Eisen is also a land of horrors let loose by three decades of mass murder.\nHighland Marches: To the north of Avalon are men and women made strong by a harsh land. The Highlanders\u2019 greatest desire is freedom at any cost.\nInismore: The Emerald Isle is the rebellious, misbehaving little brother of Avalon, led by a king who may be immortal and is more than certainly mad.\nMontaigne: One of Th\u00e9ah\u2019s most powerful Nations, leading the world in art and culture even as its Emperor crushes the populace beneath his thumb.\nSarmatian Commonwealth: Two Nations bound by a single crown, the Commonwealth is a democratic monarchy where all people are equal, even kings.\nUssura: A Nation torn between two ambitious rulers who will do anything to drag their Nation into the future, no matter the cost.\nVestenmennavenjar: A Nation of raiders and warlords who conquered the world\u2019s economy by hammering their swords and spears into coins.\nVodacce: The former cradle of civilization (and Anzolo's home!), now split between seven Merchant Princes whose complex schemes reach every corner of the world.\nMap of Th\u00e9ah\nSwashbuckling and Sorcery\n7th Sea is a world where an order of musketeers guards the lives of the nobility, but also the virtues of honor, integrity and fraternity. It is a world of sharp blades and sharp wits, where a cutting retort can be just as deadly as a sword\u2019s point. It is also a world where the nobility control the most powerful force of all\u2014sorcery. Powerful magic pulses in the hearts of the noble class, power that was given to them long ago. Some assume the forms of animals. Others rip through the fabric of reality or play with the forces of Fate itself. The hard edge of steel coupled with the shadowy substance of sorcery: that is the world of 7th Sea.\nPiracy and Adventure\nThe pirates of 7th Sea are united by a common cause: freedom. Freedom from the tyranny of sorcerers and kings. Freedom from the shackles of the Church of the Prophets. Freedom from greedy landowners and moneylenders. Pirates sail where they want, take what they please and live a life of freedom unknown by any other in the world of 7th Sea.\nDiplomacy and Intrigue\nIn the world of 7th Sea, kingdoms are on the verge of becoming countries. In the courts of kings and queens, diplomats dressed in powdered wigs, lace and silk try to resolve the disputes of Nations. A swelling tide of nationalism grows in the hearts of men and women, and a new kind of conflict\u2014covert warfare\u2014is finding its way into the world.\nArchaeology and Exploration\nBeyond the kingdoms of The\u0301ah lie the ruins of an ancient civilization, lost centuries ago: the vast cities of Lost Syrneth. Who knows what ancient secrets and treasures remain, unseen by human eyes, untouched by human hands? Men and women who call themselves \u201carchaeologists\u201d unearth these treasures and bring them back to noble hands.\nVoyage of Fortune\u2019s Star is first and foremost a story experience. We\u2019ll follow Anzolo Zorzi, a former duelist who is now Captain of Fortune\u2019s Star. Arriving at the scene of a naval battle, Anzolo and his crew are astonished to see a stone sarcophagus churn to the surface of the ocean. Clearly valuable, impenetrable to instruments at sea, and too heavy to load, the sarcophagus is set in tow. Thus begins the next chapter of Anzolo\u2019s life\u2026and sets in motion the centuries-old duty that has fallen to Magdalena Salvaza, a Fate Witch far-removed yet ever-present.\nAnzolo will discover that the sarcophagus offers not treasure but rather responsibility, but as a scoundrel with a heart-of-gold he\u2019s unable to set aside the task that falls to him. Dark forces descend upon him almost immediately, but if the Fate Witch who watches over him\u2014and who gradually falls in love with him\u2014upholds her ancient vows, Anzolo will have an opportunity to defeat an ages old evil that has stalked the land.\nThe legendary Schattenmann is an emaciated monster that stands twenty feet tall and inflicts horror on men and women who defile the forests of Eisen where it dwells. It seeks to inflict even more harm as the powers that have held its evil in check are fading. Even the renowned Kreuzritter (Crusaders) are caught off guard by the beast\u2019s sudden ferocity and brazen, horrific attacks on areas into which it never ventured before.\nOne of the Kreuzritter delivers a message by most unexpected means to Anzolo and steers the pirate captain onto a heroic path he\u2019s never before embraced. But as the bearer of hard-won knowledge, confronted by a murderous and seemingly unstoppable foe, and seeking to impress the strange dark woman who manipulates events to his favor, Anzolo embarks on his strangest voyage yet.\nMagdalena Salvaza, a Fate Witch\n  Built as a single-player experience, Voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star features Diablo-style point-and-click gameplay, though the play experience as a whole is story-driven. The story unfolds on board the Fortune\u2019s Star as well as at several different ports and inland locations. The number of locations as well as some specifics of gameplay will be determined by the final funding total of this project, but players will be able to assume control of a single character such as Anzolo Zorzi or other members of the crew. In addition, some sequences will require the player to control many characters at once in order to survive a threat or unravel a puzzle.\nBelow is the clip featured in the project video of Anzolo battling wraiths on the deck of Fortune's Star.\nPLAY\n\n    While our game emphasizes the story, we\u2019re not relying on that alone! The design team has vast tech experience from designing games and apps for entertainment and Fortune 500 companies. Voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star will be a 3D graphics-rich game built in Unreal Engine 4. We\u2019re already building and collecting assets. More samples of this preliminary work can be seen in the project video.\nMinimum System Requirements\nWindows\nOS: Windows XP SP3/Vista/Windows 7 & 8\nProcessor: x86-compatible 1.8GHz or faster processor\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\nGraphics: DirectX compatible 3D graphics card with at least 256MB of addressable memory\nDirectX: Version 9.0\nStorage: 10 GB available space\nMac\nOS: OSX 10.6\nProcessor: Intel-based Macs only (x86-compatible, 1.8GHz or better)\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\nGraphics: Modern 3D graphics card with at least 256MB of addressable memory\nStorage: 10 GB available space\nImportant note: Minimum system requirements are subject to change as hardware and software evolves over the next year or so.\n  The game will feature original music by the team of Steve Sechi (Composer/Sound Designer) and Kostas Varotsis (Orchestrator/Conductor/Composer). Steve has composed and produced over 200 albums of music for production libraries in the US, UK, and Canada and his music has been used on hundreds of TV shows and films. Kostas has won the Beethoven Award (Bonn, Germany) and a Gold Medal for Orchestral Conducting (Reims, France). Together they have recorded live orchestral projects, which may bear on a future stretch goal!\nWe're featuring music by Steve and Kostas in our project video. Here...take a listen:\nHere's a version with the choir:\nAnd here's a version without choir:\n    There\u2019s almost no wrong answer to this. Because pirates! Because adventure and romance! Because it\u2019s new (again)! And the truth is just as simple as these examples. Here are the three key reasons we selected 7th Sea as the property on which to base what we hope will be the first of many computer roleplaying games:\n1. 7th Sea is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game. Not only is TTRPG something Stewart knows a lot about, but it\u2019s also a proven basis for successful translation to computer games, e.g. Shadowrun Returns.\n2. Stewart Wieck and John Wick. Sometimes it\u2019s who you know! The fact that John knows Stewart and that John and his team trust Stewart and his team with this great property is not only a compliment, but also essential to produce a game of this size. John Wick Presents has already been a most gracious licensing partner.\n3. The 7th Sea TTRPG had a *huge* Kickstarter. We absolutely hope to convince a large number of the more than 11,000 backers of the TTRPG to support our cRPG project.\n  7th Sea Second Edition\n  Stewart Wieck founded White Wolf in the time when desktop publishing programs were very new to market. Suddenly, publishers on a shoestring budget could produce professional publications. We\u2019ve entered a similar era for digital entertainment. Sure, there are really big budget games that remain beyond the reach of new and small computer game companies, but suddenly a crew of talented and dedicated individuals can create games that used to be the province of larger companies and larger budgets only.\nKickstarter itself has narrowed this gap even further. We\u2019re not creating a $50 million blockbuster game, but even risking the several hundred thousand dollars required to create the game we envision remains a tremendous burden. Your Kickstarter pledge removes this risk and allows us to focus on making the best game possible knowing that we have an established audience waiting for the game.\nYour pledge means we don\u2019t have to be a developer beholden to a game publisher. Your pledge makes you the publisher! As any game creator will tell you, we make games because we want people to play them, and if our players are also our publishers, then we\u2019re paying complete attention to exactly the right set of people.\nWe are infinitely grateful to you for the faith you place in us with your pledge. Stewart has delivered on countless products throughout a thirty year career in gaming. The designers at Fuel.Tech have delivered multi-million dollar projects to some of the world\u2019s largest corporations.\n  The cRPG pledge levels at SPECIAL DIGITAL and above all include these two backer-only packages of bonus character moves and animations:\nCombat Moves Package \u2014 This is an assortment of a dozen bonus moves for Anzolo Zorzi. Execute these acrobatic attacks to achieve special results. We may add more moves as well as moves for other characters as stretch goals.\nMotion-Capture Package \u2014 We\u2019ll fly John Wick and other special guests to Houston to join Stewart Wieck and any backers who pledge at BOATSWAIN and higher for the opportunity for a green screen motion-capture session. All of these moves from zany to well-considered (perhaps including Walking the Plank) will become character animations available within the game and are included as rewards for everyone who pledges at SPECIAL DIGITAL or higher.\nIn-game image of Anzolo's lunging attack.\n  The pledge levels to the right do not offer every possible permutation of digital and physical rewards that you may desire. Therefore, please feel free to add an the amount to your pledge for any of these \u201cAdd Ons\u201d. To keep things simpler after the project, please only include digital add-ons for digital-only pledge levels. If your pledge level includes physical rewards, then you may add any of these rewards. (Note that physical rewards always include the digital versions too.)\nYou\u2019ll tell us the exact Add-Ons that you want in the survey later.\n  Gold Doubloon (1.5\"metal)\u2014 *art & design not final*\n  Custom d6 and d10 from left to right: Anzolo (swords), Magdalena (eye & web), Schattenmann (sun disrupts darkness) \u2014 *art & design not final*\n  Mock-up of the Anzolo Zorzi figurine. Final figure will be painted.\nFigure Scale: The Anzolo Zorzi and Magdalena Salavaza figures will be pre-painted 32mm figures while the Schattenmann figure (representing a 20-foot tall beast that roams the forests of Eisen) will be more than 3x that tall!\nBuried Treasure is a special Add-On available as digital-only or as a physical reward. Every other month for twelve months following the release of Voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star we\u2019ll create a treasure map and a story hook regarding how Anzolo Zorzi comes into possession of the map. Follow the map and clues in-game to discover bonus loot and additional game encounters. The physical version of this reward is a special leather scroll case (each one unique) in which we\u2019ll ship six sheets of parchment on which you may print the map that you receive digitally.\n  Voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star becomes a reality when the total of all backer pledges reaches $200k. If we continue to gain support for the project after the game is funded then we will use the additional funds to add to the game. More story. More features. More music. With enough support we\u2019ll even add completely new types of gameplay options, like VR. Everything added by stretch goals is at no additional cost to you!\n  Your ship: Fortune's Star!\n  All the physical rewards in this project ship \u201ccustoms-free\u201d to Europe, Canada and Australia/New Zealand. This means we\u2019ll ship them to you from distribution centers within those economic zones. Since we\u2019ll pay the fees for these rewards when we ship to the distribution centers, you\u2019ll owe nothing extra when you receive your package.\n  We\u2019re collecting the same shipping amount from everyone who pledges for a physical reward. This means we\u2019re collecting the same amount whether you live in the USA or New Zealand. Obviously, though, it will cost us a lot more to ship to the latter. We\u2019re doing this for two main reasons:\nShipping charges may go up in the year from now until we\u2019re ready to send your rewards.\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how much all of these rewards will weigh, so it\u2019s difficult to make an estimate even at current shipping rates.\nWe\u2019ll collect any additional shipping due when we send surveys for the project. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll tell us about the add-ons you want as well as provide your shipping address. We expect that the amount we\u2019re charging now means nothing more will be due from backers in the USA, but everyone outside the USA will owe a bit more, from about +$5 in Canada to +$40 for a destination like Brazil.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStewart Wieck has been in gaming since he began as an RPG freelancer in the mid-1980s and soon thereafter founded White Wolf in 1986.
