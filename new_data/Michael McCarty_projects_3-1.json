[{"backer": "Michael McCarty", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Stretch Goals:  \n JOIN ME ON A JOURNEY TO FIND THE TRUTH:\nMy name is Elijah. I believe miracles can happen. Also, I have a degree in philosophy as well as psychology, so when I hear claims of people being healed, I naturally have lots of questions. I'm convinced that if they're true, and God is doing this, then there should be a trail of evidence that corroborates some of those stories. \nSo I am going on an incredible journey to search for this evidence. Along the way we will talk to people from all walks of life, and pose hard philosophical, scientific, and theological questions to see if we find cases that we think are the real deal. Then we will give you the best testimonies we can find and the evidence to decide for yourself.\nINTERVIEWS FROM:\nand many others\u2026\nWHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW:\nI have always had a passion to know God and have incredible experiences. At the same time, I know that it\u2019s very easy for humans to see what they want to see. In my pursuit of reality, I have wrestled with the hard questions, such as:\n\u201cIf miracles are happening, where is the medical documentation?\"\n\"What do you do with natural phenomena like the placebo effect, or psychosomatic disorders that mimic miracles?\u201d\n\"How can I know God is really doing this, and not my imagination?\u201d\nSo to seek reality and be intellectually honest, I will research what both skeptics and believers are saying.\nA FIRST ATTEMPT:\nMy first effort was to start a website in November 2014 and see if I could collect testimonies. From here maybe there would be something to build a documentary on. Honestly, there were only a few hits, so I wasn\u2019t really sure it was something to go after. I was feeling like it was going nowhere and was about to let it all go.\nAND SUDDENLY:\nOne day while at home I received a text from friends. They were listening to a prophetic speaker named Shawn Bolz who was currently in town. Shawn was speaking to a large crowd at my local church and called out my name, so I rushed there. In front of 600 people, I recorded what he said on my iPhone.\nNOW:\nWhat would you do if a man you have never met tells you your name, birthday, home town, wife\u2019s name, wife\u2019s occupation and even family members' names? Well, I chose to listen. He continued to tell me that God is aware of this idea for the film and to make the film!\nFrom that moment forward, I have found myself on a radical journey. Testimonies have been flowing in. I have met doctors testifying to miracles they saw, and pastors who are pointing me to the right type of case for what I hope to film. I have started working with medical researchers who are providing great feedback on what works and what does not. God has brought an incredible film team into my life and momentum is gaining. It has been a risk for my wife and I. We have already put $17,000 into making this film. \nShawn Bolz\nWHY MAKE A FILM LIKE THIS?\nPeople have deep questions, and there are answers. \nFilm is one of the best ways to see rapid cultural transformation in the church and society. \nThe influencers of our day speak the language of science, reason, evidence, and logic, not just experience and the Bible. Talking about the supernatural without speaking in the language of culture is like speaking a foreign language. \nWe want to create a fertile path for the kingdom of God to influence the realms of science, academia, and medicine. \nThis is an opportunity to present the world with medically verified healings and legitimize the supernatural. \nFinally, I believe from the message above, the Spirit of God has made clear that I should do this film.\nPLAY\n\nTHE RISKS WE WILL TAKE:\nWe will examine the hard philosophical, theological, and scientific issues concerning miracles. \nWe will not only interview theologians, but scientists, philosophers, researchers that are skeptics and believers. \nWe will seek medical documentation. \nWe will film doctors who pray and report miracles. \nWe will partner with the Spirit, and go where He leads.\nBENEFITS TO YOU:\nPartnering with God: With such clarity, we expect God to do something huge. Wouldn\u2019t it be cool to be a part of this amazing documentary? You can. If you will give, I will go. I need your help. I can't do this without you. Let's partner with God together.\nGetting Informed: Have you ever wanted to see a miracle corroborated by medical documentation? Do you have questions like, \u201cHow do I tell a miracle apart from a natural phenomenon? What about the placebo effect, psychosomatic disorders, or Munchausen syndrome?\u201d Do you know how to respond when people ask hard questions? A film like this can help expand your awareness and knowledge.\nExamining Medical Reports\nHelp Others: Do you know a deep thinker, scientist, or medical professional with questions about miracles? A film like would be a great benefit for an open minded person. The world needs this very badly. Some people aren\u2019t convinced and it\u2019s not always their fault. While miracles happen, the evidence is often lacking. It's actually quite easy for someone to get the impression that all of this is just wishful thinking. Even a person who WANTS to experience the miraculous can often struggle with this. This doesn't have to be the case. \nTransform Society: Imagine the people who will be inspired to get prayer for their illnesses, and see God move in their lives. Imagine, the people who will come to Jesus. Imagine the doctors who will watch something like this and be inspired to pray for their patients. Imagine the professors who would be empowered to teach on this topic!\nPLAY\n\nOur Costs:\nResearch: $5,000\nCollecting Data | Fact Checking | Expert Opinions | Further Testing\nPre Production: $9500\nWeb | Legal | Accounting | Script | Directing | Coaching | Insurance \nHigh Quality Video Production: $36,000\nEquipment | Crew | Airfare | Lodging | Ground Transportation | Food | Reimbursement \nPost Production: $37,000\nEditing | Color | Graphics | Verification | Audio | Titling \nMisc: $29,000\nReward Fulfillment | Kickstarter Fees | Buffer | Other\nPLAY\n\nPray\nPray about the lives that will be touched.

Every dollar you pledge is voicing your support for seeing the intellectual and the supernatural come together. \nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFinding the Right Testimonies Will Take an Unpredictable Amount of Time:\n\nWe are still researching cases expecting the Lord to provide. Some people will not want to be on film. Others will not have the right type of before and after evidence. Some medical professionals will not want to be filmed because they fear the response of the insurance companies or medical boards. Every researcher I have talked with has said this is very difficult. That\u2019s okay. God has a plan, and we will work on His timetable. We will keep all backers updated. \n\nHigher than Expected Costs:\n\nBecause we don\u2019t know quite yet the exact testimonies we will use, we can\u2019t project the cost of testing, or travel expenses. We've done our homework, but will let you know if something comes up.\n\nBad Data:\n\nA film like this may attract people who want to see if they can get one by us in order to become famous or to discredit the work. I am surrounding myself with theologians, philosophers, researchers, scientists and medical professionals. We will do our best to fact check every testimony, and strive for intellectual honesty.\n\nEnsuring We Honor Those Involved: \n\nI deeply care that every person we film and encounter are treated with respect and love. We will take extra efforts to make that a reality especially with those in the film who may disagree with us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Update", "update_content": "There is a saying that I have come to believe is true.\n\u201cGod doesn\u2019t often call the equipped, but equips the called.\u201d\nWhen I began this project, I knew next to nothing about film, and researching miracle claims.\nWhere would I even begin to find them?"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "Update on Miracle Evidence Doc", "update_content": "I wanted to update you all on the progress of the documentary.

Phoenix Apparel is an independent lifestyle brand that was created through social media. Our specialty and what made us popular are our various print pocket tees. I like to think of a pocket tee as a simple re-invention of the classic t-shirt. With so many options for a pocket, anyone can express themselves with the pattern they choose without being too flashy, no one is excluded from our products.\nVarious Print Pocket Tees\nRoby came to me one day and asked if I could make him a pocket tee with a fabric he liked. After I made it, I told him how great of an idea it was and suggested he sell them somewhere. -Sylvia\nIG @phoenixapparel\nSo I then took some pictures, posted them on instagram and we got people purchasing almost immediately and asking for more designs. I realized that this could actually be a cool thing to do. I connected with some instagram celebrities and had them promote our tees and from there things just went even further. We added a ton of pocket tee designs, hats, bow ties and vintage items. Its been so amazing connecting with our followers and fans because without them we would not have come this far.  I\u2019m really thankful that this random project has turned into something so much more, as I\u2019ve always had a love for fashion and art in any form. We\u2019ve come a long way and we are ready to step out into the next phase of our brand.\nSocial Media Personalities who wear Phoenix Apparel\nSocial Media Personality Cody Johns\nSince we are so small currently, we have been limited to what we can offer in terms of products, and how much we can offer in terms of quantity , stock, colors, sizes. Each item is made to order which has made it difficult to continually bring out new products while filling orders.\nWe hope to accomplish our goal so that we could bring out new products like graphic t shirts, button ups, and of course more pocket tees. We\u2019d bring more hats, beanies, bow ties, accessories,  And bring them on a larger scale so that we can have items ready to ship. We would also offer more colors and sizes.  In addition we\u2019d re-vamp our online store for an easier shopping experience and possibly add new members to the Phoenix Team\n Since Phoenix Apparel, was created by its customers and fans we would continue to remain about them and for them.

Our illustrator is the wonderfully talented: Lauren Scott. Please find her website and biography in the link below:\nhttp://www.lauren-scott.co.uk/\nBELOW IS A TASTE OF HER INCREDIBLE WORK FOR THE GAME SO FAR!!!!\n Michael and Stephen created and designed this game with kids and families in mind. When they were growing up they used to play games like Candyland and Mouse Trap with their mom. Once they matured they became baby-sitters for family friends, and, from there, graduated to camp counselors.  (Stephen was also a teacher for several years, and still works with kids in his local church to this day) \nThey believe that they remained kids at heart because of this. Today, they have noticed that children are much more inclined to pick up an iPad or play a video game then they are to play a board game. While they have nothing against either of those means of entertainment, they know that board games bring with them a whole other element of quality time and community where modern technology falls short. So, one of the core mechanics of the game is that it is \"Your turn, every turn.\" The purpose of this mechanic is to keep children (and adults for that matter) engaged and focused throughout the entirety of the game!\nAfter, years of development, play-testing, and polishing they are finally ready to bring Mice & Dice to families everywhere....with your help of course!\nThis week is RAT WEEK!\n The Rat Card that we need a name for is:\n\"If you do not roll YOUR number on YOUR turn, lose a Mouse Card (active or inactive)\"\nBELOW IS OUR HOW TO PLAY VIDEO. PLEASE NOTE EVERY COMPONENT IN THIS VIDEO IS FROM OUR PROTOTYPE. THE ACTUAL PUBLISHED GAME WILL LOOK EVEN BETTER ;)\nMice and Dice RULES\nObjective:  The first player to Cheeseville (move 50 spaces) WINS!\nGame Pieces: \n6 Dice\n6 Point Markers\n6 Number Cards\n19 Mice Cards\n20 Rat Cards\n15 Cheese Cards\n1 Game Board\nStart of the Game:  Arrange the Rat, Mice, and Cheese cards in their own piles on the game board.  Before the game starts, each player takes a turn rolling one die.  The number rolled is that player\u2019s number for the game.  No two players can have the same number and some numbers may be inactive for the game.  The player who most recently ate cheese goes first.\nGame Play: At the start of their turn a player may play any Rat, Mouse, or Cheese Cards they may have.  Unless otherwise noted, all Mouse and Rat cards stay in play until removed by a player.  The player then rolls their die/dice.  Each non-rolling player moves one (1) space for each of their numbers rolled and the rolling player moves two (2) spaces for each of their numbers rolled.  If a player\u2019s number appears more than once in a roll, for EACH number rolled beyond the first that player may either: (1) Draw a Rat OR Mouse card; OR (2) Remove a Rat card played on them; OR (3) Draw a Cheese card IF the player has moved at least 25 spaces and is in the \u201cCheese Phase\u201d.  A player may do any combination of the three choices if their number is rolled more than once in a roll.
