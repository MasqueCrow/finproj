[{"backer": "Christa Wells", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "This is me...And I want to share me with you and you with me.\n\nAs most things do, it started with a bang, disorientation and a slow unfurling of understanding.\n\"I walk to the backyard, smoke and contemplate the stars\nSome vague sense of inconsequence\nSo small, but yet I am still here\"\nIn 2017 I wrote a song called \"Spit and Wire\". When it was finished I knew it was different than the songs I had been writing. There are still only a handful of people that have heard it. At the time I wrote it I thought I couldn't share it because it was \"too real\". I was a worship pastor at the time and I thought \"I shouldn't feel this way.\" \"What would people think if they knew the struggles I have, if they knew the real me?\" I didn't know it at the time but that song marked the beginning of a monumental shift in my life and I am so happy to be where I am now. I am happy to have come through the struggles I have faced, knowing that there are more ahead. Mostly, I am happy to share myself with the world and the songs that have come from this transformational experience in the last 3 years. \n\n2020...The year of the shift!\nIn the midst of writing songs, navigating my divorce and rebuilding my life I reached out to my brother in law, Miles Fuqua, about recording an album together. He is a super talented recording/mixing engineer and we had always talked about doing a project together and it was time to pull the trigger. After getting stoked about working together is when I discovered this project was going to call for more than a 10 song full length album. Once the ball started rolling I started connecting with other artists whose stories I resonated with. Thomas Bernardin, who produced the Kickstarter video is an inspirational storyteller/filmmaker who has a moving story of his own to tell. If the Kickstarter campaign is fulfilled, he is graciously offering to do an additional artistic video (video for a song, or mini-doc) on FILM! In the same spirit I reached out to Dustin Ransom, who is an astonishingly talented multi-instrumentalist here in Nashville, to play drums. Each of these collaborators will bring their own powerful layer of meaning, talent and energy into this project and I am so excited about the prospect of us all coming together to make this project a reality. \n\nThe most important part is YOU!\nAll these dreams and plans are nice, but honestly, I can't do this without you. You are the collaborator that I am most importantly excited about working with. If there is any lesson that 2020 taught us, it's that we need one another. With your help I will be able to record these 3 EP's that are so important to me and close to my heart. Let's make something beautiful together!\n\nThe Plan\nI have all the songs written for this project (and may even write a few more, who knows?) but at the least it will be 15 songs. Additionally, all the songs are demoed and the scratch tracks are ready and once the Kickstarter is fulfilled we will get to work! \n May - Rehearsals with musicians\n May/June - Track drums, guitars, bass, keys, vocals, and all the extra goodness\n July - Mixing commences\n Mid August - Send song off for mastering, compile artwork, duplication\n October - Send out pre-release of all 3 EP's to Kickstarter backers\nThe Budget\n\nRecording/Mixing/Mastering/Musicians/Duplication - $6,300 (Luckily I can keep this cost lower due to recording guitars/bass/keys/percussion myself)\nVideo/Art/Duplication - $2,700\nKickstarter Fees - $800-1,000", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI think the biggest risk is not taking one. Hey, but let's get down to brass tax! Asking for help is pretty vulnerable for any artist so not reaching my goal would be a bummer wave, but I really believe we can do it. Some of the challenges will be time management and getting things done as outlined because there are always curve balls to deal with. Reward fulfillment is always a challenge but I tried to make most of the rewards digital in nature to mitigate some of those challenges. The stories and stems podcast will be a lot of work, but I am excited to do it.

It came in a blaze of creative glory, and I spent two days chasing down what I knew was something special. It's hard to describe the feeling, something like lightning, something like stumbling upon a vein of gold in the river and you wonder, how am I the one who gets to find it? When I wrote Poetry, I knew I wasn't just writing a song, but marking the next season of creating. I knew an album was being born. \nSince RIVER HOUSE released in 2017, I've spent the last 3 years discovering the real joy of my work: you. I've logged a lot of hours in your homes and living rooms on house concert tours, meeting you at weekend retreats in the woods, hearing your stories each night after a show. The world can be a hard and lonely place, and yet, we can find each other across the chasm of isolation, we can reach out a hand and be met by another. The songs for me are just a vehicle for the real joy of my life, which is being together. I like to think when I'm singing you my story, I'm also somehow mysteriously singing yours. I'm blown away every time you show up for me. I can never thank you enough.\nI can't believe the caliber of folks coming alongside me to bring this record to life. At the helm is producer Lucas Morton (Jill Andrews, Jordy Searcy, Jon McLaughlin). We assembled a killer band, I mean, just wait till you hear these guys. The lineup: Will Sayles (Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors, Ben Rector, Carly Bannister) on drums, Tyler Burkum (Needtobreathe, The Cactus Blossoms, Ingrid Michaelson) on electric guitar,  Scott Mulvahill (Keb Mo, Joy Williams, Andrew Peterson), Justin Schipper (Kacey Musgraves, Tim McGraw, Shania Twain) on pedal steel, and Buckley Miller (Thad Cockrell, Mindy Mindy Smith, Katie Herzig) engineering, plus a heap of good friends lending their voices and talents. We are tracking all the songs on this album live, which essentially means we all get in a room together, push the record button, and see what happens :) It's how the best albums get made, in my opinion, and I knew I wanted this record to sound like the ones I've obsessed over: Emmylou Harris' Wrecking Ball, Alison Krauss & Robert Plant's Raising Sand, Brandi Carlile's By The Way I Forgive You.  You can expect an album that even in its moments of heady genius, is all feel, all personality, all heart.\nThe great news is, we've already gotten started! This February, before the world was thrown into a global pandemic, we packed in the B room at Oceanway Studios in Nashville and started tracking 4 of the 10 songs for the album. The original plan was to run a Kickstarter campaign in the spring and finish the album in 2020, but as we've all learned this year, some flexibility was required. To be honest, it's been a YEAR. I spent a good part of the last 6 months beat down and discouraged, not knowing when we'd pick the album back up, not knowing what was ahead for any of us. Through the encouragement of many of you, through some heart-to-hearts with my people, I remembered who I am and what I think I'm here on this earth to do. You reminded me  there IS a path forward, even if it's not the one we originally would have chosen. \"The impeded stream is the one that sings\" wrote Wendell Berry, and baby, we're singin.  \nIf you're reading this, thank you for caring about me and the music I make. Thank you for being with me all these years (or if you're new here, for taking a risk!) Wherever you are, I'd love you to come along for the ride on this one. I have a feeling it will be something special. Your Kickstarter pledge will go directly to music making, reserving studio space, paying for production, engineering, and the band, as well as printing, distribution, and marketing costs (see outlined budget below). To the right, there are lots of fun rewards exclusive to Kickstarters. Consider it my way of inviting you all the way into this project, cause DANG y'all, I couldn't do this without you.\nall my love & gratitude,\nTaylor\nBUDGET\nProduction Costs\nProducer fees, studio space, engineering, band rates, mixing, mastering ..... $25,700\nPrinting, Marketing & Promotion\nCDs, photography, videos, graphic design, advertising, promotion ..... $6,000\nKickstarter Fees   .......    $3300\nTOTAL BUDGET   $35,000", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt's a big ask to run a kickstarter at a time when we're all trying to get through a difficult year.

I can't believe this but we've hit our initial goal of $27,000...so now we get to reach for a stretch goal!\nStretch goal: $31,000 for two additional songs on the record !!!!\nI would love to be able to put more songs out into the world than we originally bargained for. But even if we don't raise one more dollar, I'm so incredibly blown away and grateful. Thank you, thank you, thank you!\nThis is it--the time has come to record a full length album! \nI even rollerbladed behind my car to tell you the news!\nAm I scared? Maybe!!! Should I be telling you that? Probably not!!!\nHere's the truth--my favorite thing about this job is you. Making music for a living is like making a career out of connecting. The songs I write that reflect my experience of loneliness, joy, questions, ~crushes~, are not complete until they are your songs too. Knowing that you are bringing your own story into these songs moves me to tears! real tears! What a deep breath that we both get to breathe, knowing we are not alone.\nIn light of, *gestures to 2020*, these last few months have been an all consuming experience of waking up to the grief of the world and to the urgent fight for change.  Learning how to live meaningful lives during a moment in history that is so brutally desperate for redemption is overwhelming to say the least. It's easy to fall into despair. My hope is that this record will help you fight that urge. That in a time of such chaos, you can find some comfort in these stories. I hope that these songs can walk along side you and cultivate some peace in your life while you continue to be that beautiful you. These songs are a direct result of my silliness, sadness, confusion, hope and sometimes my excruciating happiness. They are me :) And soon they will be all of ours!\nLucas Morton and Latifah Alattas are two of my dearest friends who will be co-producing the project. It's rare to find two people as thorough, hard working, and absolutely convinced of the magic in music. They are incredible musicians/producers/writers/creators/thinkers/innovators/you get it. Learning that I was going to work alongside them felt probably exactly the way that Jennifer Lawrence felt when she found out she would be in a movie with Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson. \nThey also both feel VERY confident that we will be winning a Grammy for this record!!!! (They haven't said this yet but I bet they will eventually. I'll keep you posted). \nI am thrilled to be able to use a platform that is as incredible as Kickstarter-- it provides a place for us to connect in such a unique way and offers rewards in exchange for your pledge. THANK YOU!!! for taking the time to read/watch/look into my Kickstarter page--I do not take it lightly that you would spend some of your valuable time on me like this! Bless you!!!\nSoooo??? You wanna make a record with me??? I would truly love for you to be a part of this project --you have been the most wonderful part of my career all along. You have made the whole thing worthwhile, and it would be an honor to continue making music with you!

The mini-doc would be shot while recording the debut album and released as promotional content for the record\u2019s released!\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 // $35,000 : We\u2019ll record a 4-song covers EP following the album, relying heavily on backers to choose which four (maybe more?) songs we record. \nHello, it\u2019s me! Jac. Thanks for being here...\nI\u2019m beyond excited to tell you that we are f i n a l l y recording my debut album! After a year of criss-crossing the United States on tour, and a decade of crafting, scratching and squeezing songs into being, I\u2019d say it\u2019s time. A mentor of mine, after a lovely string of superlatives, looked me dead-in-the-eyes and said, \u201cI hope you make this record before you\u2019re 40.\u201d ALRIGHT. I\u2019m 24, so we could be doing worse, but to his point--I\u2019ve been dreaming up this record since 2010.\nLet\u2019s build an 8-track album featuring world-class musicians and deep 70\u2019s pop influences with state-of-the-art production that matches the music\u2019s lyrical sensitivity and melodic depth. \n If you're new here and unfamiliar with my sound, I\u2019d encourage you to check out these live, one-take recordings of new songs I\u2019ve put out in the past few months. It\u2019s a little sample of what's to come.\nSpecs:\nOur budget is $25,000. Meeting this goal allows us to partner with a phenomenal producer (Quinn Redmond), record a full studio band, and craft a brilliant sound with mixing and mastering engineers. It also means I can illustrate, distribute, and promote the album as well as create those killer rewards listed to your right!\nWhen you support this record, you\u2019ll help employ artists from nearly every facet of Nashville's creative community: co-writers, illustrators, clothing printers (that's right - we're printing local), photographers, videographers, and everyone who walks in and out of the studio!  All these artists have lost self-employment and/or touring income due to COVID-19. There\u2019s no better time to be creating art. You need it. We need it. Your support goes directly to re-vitalizing Nashville's community of creatives. \nEvery pledge $55+ receives a graphic tee printed on a sustainable, repurposed tee by Brokeboys Clothing Co. with an illustration by Timothy Edward Carpenter. Note: Because we\u2019re printing on repurposed tee\u2019s, every shirt will be completely one-of-a-kind in color.\nThe Lyricisist reward contains the album\u2019s lyric booklet with handwritten insights from Jac into each song along with full-color studio images. This image is an example of an open booklet.\nIt\u2019s not slipped my mind that COVID-19 has made this campaign a big ask. Music-making and finances inhabit new contexts for us all, but I\u2019ve no doubt that this project and team of creators are going to successfully make a record that\u2019s worth every listener\u2019s time and love. I\u2019ve never felt so optimistic and confident in myself, my purpose, and my team. Much of my enthusiasm derives from you all. You\u2019re constantly inspiring us to continue this strange journey. I want you to know that I accept support in all forms. Already, I\u2019ve felt the warmth of mentors, fellow artists, house show hosts, and venues long before this kickstarter was even a thought. Thank you for your kindness and goodwill. :')\nAll in all, I\u2019m looking forward to sharing who I am with you in these songs. We\u2019re doing this\u2026 it\u2019s really time...

It didn't end up coming together before he made his arrival, so I accepted that it was not meant to be. A month into being a new mom, exhausted and dazed, my husband setup a Garageband session and talked me into recording while the baby was sleeping. A few demos (and naps) later, the beginnings of a new album began to take shape. I started to get a vision of what songs felt right and what kind of vibe I wanted this album to have. \nRecording demos in the basement\nPicking a team to help me record this album was something I that I wanted to consider carefully. I chose Juan Solorzano and Zachary Dyke to produce and engineer, and I am so grateful I did. Their collaborative energy and patience set such a good pace for the recording process. We tracked for a little over a week at Trace Horse Studio in Berry Hill (Nashville, TN). S/O to Scottie and Preston at Trace Horse who were so helpful and accommodating throughout the project. I also had some awesome musicians and vocalists who contributed so much to the sound of this album: Ross McReynolds, Caleb Hickman, Josh Rogers, Benjamin Kaufman, Katie Herzig, Betsy Phillips, and Lori Chaffer, Robby Hecht\nWanna get a preview of my songs? Here are some acoustic versions!\nJuan Solorzano and Zachary Dyke\nMaking a record after the birth of a child is a wild experience and one that opened me up to more vulnerability in my songwriting and recording. It has stretched me, and in many ways parallels the sacrifice, but immense joy of being a mother.  \nTo stay in touch with my son on studio days, I would send him little videos.\nPromoting The Record\nThe main reason I am doing this Kickstarter is to give my music a chance to make an impact and grow a larger fanbase. I'd like for more people to hear my music, to make that happen I need the support of a PR / Marketing team. This Kickstarter will also help me to afford the material costs to print CD's, Vinyls, and Merch! It takes so much effort, time, and resources to get off the ground with music as an independent artist these days, but the magic of independent music is that your direct support makes this music more than it ever could be on its own. Whatever support you can give, rest assured it will be used with purpose and a sober heart. Thank you for supporting a Momma and musician like me. \nKickstarter Budget\nI want to be upfront with where this money will be going! This is the breakdown!\nKickstarter fees $1,100\nPhoto shoot, Album and single covers: $2,500\nVinyl Printing at Memphis Record Pressing: $1,400\nVinyl Inscription: $400\nPR and marketing at Sideways: $14,000 - This is my biggest expense, but also the most important for getting my record out to more people. I've never done PR before, but feel like this is the project to pull a team behind!\nPrinted CDs: $540\n Live performance video: $400\n500 word biography: $375\nKickstarter Video: $500\nWhatever I have left will go towards making merchandise, like t-shirts, posters, etc. and towards the necessary means to get on the road and do some shows!

We had only officially started dating the day before we left for a week-long tour, and while we were locked in the car I began wondering if I was qualified for a relationship. Doubts and questions popped into my head, and like any musician worth his salt, I decided to process them through song. I wrote the first verse and chorus of Embrace at Crea's family farm in Oxford, Ohio, sitting on a bale of hay by the horses.\nA year later, I realized that this song wasn't meant for just me -- that Crea was apt to having the same doubts and fears that I wrestle with, so I asked her to take a stab at writing some lyrics. In a single day, she had finished the song.\nThis song is an acceptance of the fact that love is not a fully-formed thing. It's not a train you hop on once you're fully prepared. Loving her is a dance, a give-and-take, a development together. All of our fears and faults are merely parts of who we are and what we want a partner for -- to love us through all of it, to meet us in the middle, to embrace us in the chaos. \nIt is there, in the pursuit of love, that fear dissipates, and we begin keeping company with hope. I am so excited to share this song with everyone who wants or needs a reminder that we are not anchored by our fears; we are loved regardless.\n\nWhat are you supporting?\nWe realized pretty quickly that this song is a substantial step for us as partners, and that the song deserves the best that we can give it. We would love to:\nHire local strings magician, RJ Bracchiatta, to compose and direct a quartet on the recording\nProduce a live music video so you can watch us sing Embrace whenever you want\nGet this song in the hands of those who want it but don't know it yet by investing in modest PR\n\nWhy would you support us?\nWe realize that there are many things that you could support this holiday season, and honestly, there's much we want to see supported before us (cough, The Nashville Food Project, cough).

Thank you, thank you, thank you! So, without further ado, here's how we'll use any money we make ABOVE the $12K goal:\n$16K THE COMFORTABLE BUDGET. Like our last Kickstarter, the amount we set as a goal here ($12K) was a modest one. This extra $4K gives us the kind of budgetary breathing room that makes the experience of recording, and the outcome, that much better.\n$20K OTHER RECORDINGS- FREE TO ALL BACKERS! If we hit $20K, we'll finish and release digital downloads of (4) recordings we started before undertaking this new simpler acoustic approach, and we'll release those to ALL OUR BACKERS. That's like a free EP for everyone!\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING ADDED!\nWe added The European Union & Canada as shipping options for all tiers! Anyone else need to be added? Let us know!\nNOTE: if you choose VINYL in the PICK A NUMBER (#) tiers, add extra to your pledge for shipping (EU: add $23; Canada: add $18).\nYOU ASKED FOR IT, YOU GOT IT! CDS NOW AVAILABLE!\nAfter a groundswell of protest about our not offering CDs, we've decided \"You're right! let's make CDs!\" Now, you can get:\n(1) CD for $15\n(2) CDs for $30\n(2) CDs for $30 as one of the PICK A NUMBER (#) options.\nOn What Inspired This Album & How We're Approaching It\nOver the past few years, Lori and I (Don) have each taken turns sneaking out to our studio to record on a song or two while the other holds down the home front. But thirty or more songs later, we still haven't released any of mine, and only three of Lori's. Her three songs are beautiful, though. So, that's the first thing.\nThe second thing is that we've played more shows than usual this year, and recently, we discovered we were both thinking the same thing: that it feels especially good singing and playing together right now, and that maybe we should capture this moment.\nSo, we're setting those thirty-some other recordings aside, and starting from scratch. We'll sit down, choose our favorites from those and other songs, work them out together as a duo, and hit record. It doesn't have to be just two acoustics and vocals, but we do want to focus on those elements. After a quarter century of singing & playing together, it feels like it's time to document the simplicity of that sound.\nOn Vinyl\nWe've never released on vinyl, and this seems like an ideal album for it, but vinyl is both expensive to make and to ship (hence the shipping addition we're asking for in the multiple item tiers). Still, it does sound vibey, and setting a needle on a record is a romantic experience, so let's do it.\nOn Giving This as a Gift For the Holidays\nWhile we won't have these rewards ready in time for the holidays, this would still make a really great Christmas gift. That's why we'll have a downloadable PDF card you can print and give to your loved one to inform them of the super cool gift you bought them. They're gonna love you for this.\nOn Why We're Kickstarting\nFirstly, we love how kickstarter connects us with people early on in the making of an album, and we love the feeling that these songs are part of a communal endeavor.\nSecondly, there's the economics. As musicians we always live gig-to-gig, project-to-project. Nothing new there, but in the past decade, the record-making part of our industry has all but disappeared. Streaming just doesn't pay well. In fact, I ran our total Spotify payment history, and for 1,882,719 streams, we've been paid $7,385. Now, I'm not ragging on Spotify. I have it. I love it. I'm just saying Kickstarter is a godsend for independent artists like us, and fans like you. When you pay for these rewards, you're buying an album\u2013yes\u2013but you're also making this album possible. Without you, we literally couldn't do this. We LOVE doing this, and we can't wait to share these songs with you, so a thousand thank you's for partnering with us in this creative endeavor.\nGive Me The Scoop, The Skinny, The Lowdown on the Merchandise.\nPardon the twenties language, but no phonus balonus.

Can we agree that this world could always use more hope? I'd like to offer my voice as a conduit of hope and healing. By sharing my music in a more accessible way, I believe I can do just that!

My goal is to record 4 or 5 songs in a real studio with a professional producer.

I\u2019ve created memories with people I love, got married, moved across the country, and then across the country again. I\u2019m learning how to hold space inside myself for both peace and ambition to coexist. When I'm feeling stuck or unsure of what\u2019s next\u2014I'm finding that if I slow down and listen hard enough, it\u2019s there: the next true thing. Like a note on the trail saying, keep going. There is so much left to feel and find. \nI released my last EP back in 2016 and then booked a house tour\u2014driving my Prius up and down the West Coast playing in living rooms and small venues. That project felt like a rite of passage on so many levels, and I\u2019m feeling that fire inside to create again\u2014building on everything I've discovered since. I spent the summer in New York, and being there was the deep breath I needed as this next project came into focus. \nThese new songs are a snapshot of my life over the past few years, and the most personal I've ever written. The deep forest of my mid-twenties and the light through the trees. Love, uncertainty, growth, aching, feeling lost, and then the rare, beautiful moments when the fog lifts. My tracks on the trail. \nI\u2019m recording at The Smoakstack with Paul Moak this March. My studio time is booked\u2014 and over the next 30 days, I\u2019ll need your help to raise $21,000 to cover recording, distribution, promotion, and visual components for the record. \nI know it\u2019s a lot of money. But I\u2019m learning that art is a gift to us all because it nourishes, keeps us noticing, awake. Connected. And the truth is I can\u2019t create this alone. I\u2019d be honored to have you along for the ride. If you connect with what I'm doing, I'd also be grateful if you'd consider telling a handful of friends about the project and help me build some momentum online.

I am so excited to announce this kickstarter! I have been in the process of writing and recording this album for the last two years. As an independent artist, I've been paying for the production of this album out of pocket. But this process could be sped up by years with your help!\nA little about me and then a little about the album-- I am a Charlotte-based independent artist with strong leanings in jazz and soul. I love the romantic, lullaby-like songwriting style, which is largely influenced by my time spent growing up in Portugal.\nI love collaborating and have been creating new content with other local artists in Charlotte. Currently, I am in the process of recording my first full-length album with producer and dear friend Dylan Byrnes. The new album features songs I've written over the past couple of years. These songs are extremely personal and as honest as I can be about the last two years of my life. The new album will stylistically reference the cinematic jazz elements of my EP Endless released in July 2016. The new album will also has some songs that lean more RnB, Soul, and Pop. I am anxious to share such vulnerability from such precious moments of joy to seasons of aching grief. My hope is that this album speaks to you, that it pulls you into my experiences, but also reminds you of yours and allows you a space to re-enter into your own experiences. My hope is that this album is more than just me sharing my feelings. My hope is that there is some light seen is this, some hope, and some honesty. \nDuring the last two weeks of this kickstarter, my manager, producer, and I will be filming some music videos for the album in my home town in Portugal. I can't wait to share where I came from with you and how all the the songs on this album weave into the stories of my past.\nIf you would like to be a part of this process and be a part of the team that gets this album and music videos out into the world, you can do that through making a pledge for one of the rewards.\nREWARDS\nThese rewards are pretty awesome. We made sure to have a variety of rewards and pledge amounts to offer you. Rewards can be found on the right hand column. Below are some pictures of a few rewards.\nPortugal-Themed Playing Cards\nI Heart CLT Playing Cards\nBespoke Denim Bomber Jacket (Rough Mock-up)\nMargaret Burton Crop Top & Unisex Tee (Rough Mock-up)\nBUDGET\nThe budget includes recording costs for 10 songs. $9,650 would cover the producers, string arrangements, studio musicians, mixing engineer, mastering engineer, and equipment rental. The budget also includes the cost of production for the reward items, which is $1,650. This is why the total amount we are aiming for in this kickstarter is $11,300.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKickstarter is in itself a risk, because if we don't reach our goal, we don't keep any of the funds. \n\nThis project will get finished, it's just a matter of when. With your help, we will be able to fully fund the project, have it finished and out in the world by July 2019.\n\nLife throws you curve balls, so we're keeping that in mind and giving ourselves a time and budget buffer.

I've been playing music for most of my life and writing songs since I was in high school.\nOver the last several years I've released a couple of projects: first, an EP called Truest Things in late 2015, and most recently, recorded my song \"Behold\" for a collaborative EP called All Things New.\nNow I'm ready to dive into my first full-length record, RIVER HOUSE.

Without the backing of a label, it can be difficult to finance the production needs of making a record.

We fell in love there. We wrote our first songs together there. We cut our teeth as a band in this blue-collar city before moving to Nashville. Since then, we have played over one-thousand shows in forty-three states and have been privileged to make many friends along the way through the medium of music. So many of our memories are able to exist because of the overwhelming support from so many over the years.\nAfter the birth of our son, Wilder in September 2014 and six years on the road, we decided to pull back the reins. We needed time to reflect and decide what the next step was. Out of this process came several new songs, a renewed passion for our craft and a reminder of why we write and sing. We found ourselves refreshed and ready to turn the page into the next chapter. We just didn\u2019t know where to start.\nIt\u2019s funny how things have a way of coming full circle. One day, our friends and longtime tour mates in the Memphis band, Star & Micey asked us to come down to Sun Studio to sing with them on a few tunes. After we finished, we all stuck around in the studio. With no real plans, just for fun and almost by accident we began to create something special in that legendary room that would beg to be finished.\nWith our friend Curry behind the controls, we started into a new song that we had written. The magic of the moment was so real and electric from the first note. The light bulb had come on again. We left Memphis the next day with a clear vision to return and record these new songs completely live with the boys at Sun Studio.\nSo here we are. We\u2019ve been working on the album slowly but surely over the past year, going back to Memphis for a day or two at a time when it feels right and schedules align to chip away at our newest creation. We\u2019ve gotten ourselves to the halfway point and we want to bring y\u2019all into the fold to be a part of this alongside us. We\u2019ve partnered with Kickstarter to help see this through and to allow you guys to pre-order the new album. By contributing to the project you will be able to receive the new album before it is released, receive some unique incentives that we\u2019ve come up with for you, and you\u2019ll get behind the scenes updates from us along the way.\nEvery penny of the funds raised will be spent on necessities not only to finish the recording process but to be able to give the new album a proper release and a fair chance to succeed. We wouldn\u2019t have made it this far without all of you and we need your help to keep this thing goin\u2019. We look forward to sharing it with you. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\nBen & Emily\n Your contributions to this project will specifically allow us to pay for:\n- Recording time accrued at Sun Studio\n- Recording Engineer\n- Production\n- Mixing of the album\n- Mastering of the album\n- Publicist\n- Videographer to document the recording process\n- Photography\n- U.S. & European Americana Radio Promotion\n- Accompanying musicians on the album\n- Artwork & Graphic Design\n- Printing of the album on CD & Vinyl\n- Digital Downloads\n- Rewards for backers of the project\n- Shipping of project rewards\nA quick snapshot after a late night of recording at Sun Studio.\n  A little joke telling between songs.\n  Encore with the gang at Levitt Shell in Memphis.

I wouldn't ask for anything if there was any other way to create this record, but the truth is I need your help.\nIn the Spring of 2013, I released my first EP of 5 songs that I had written mostly during high school. I received the most encouraging responses ever from friends, family, and complete strangers, further solidifying that this is an area of my life I want to grow and pursue. \nSince then, so many events have happened that I can hardly wrap my mind around them. The only way I've ever known to cope with anything is to write music that just gets all of my thoughts and emotions out there. I have 10 songs that I am ready to share with everyone that I think are very relevant to all of us.  \nThe reason I'm entitling this record \"Journal Entries\" is because that's exactly what these songs are. \nI'm very proud to say that not all of these songs are about boys (a few are though..oops). These are songs about self-worth, growing up, coping with hurt, and life in general. Some of these were songs I wrote in difficult times and the only way to feel better was to sit in my room and play them over and over again. Others were written for dear friends to encourage them and let them know what they are worth. All this to say, I am confident that there are songs on this record that everyone can pull something from. My main goal is to say something that might resonate with someone and make them feel understood. I am only recording what I feel are my best songs from the past 2 years and I feel so lucky that we could possibly release them as a team! \nThank you for even considering investing in this project!\nThe fact that you are even reading this means the world to me.

One GREAT thing about being an indie artist is that you don't have to wait for industry \"gatekeepers\" to sign off on these ideas to get the ball rolling!\nI have the next 4 musical projects mapped out (and have started the writing and pre-production recording process on one of them) and need your help on the first three ideas.  So instead of making three similar but different sounding records every two years, I've decided to trim the fat and make them into three EPs over the course of ONE YEAR.  (Possibly less.  But we'll see.)  Here's the skinny:\nEP 1: Futureboy\nYes, the title is a Back To The Future reference.  But also the songs that I've been writing for it all line up with a common theme of time travel. Not necessarily in the literal sense, but in the way we let our minds wander to the pain and pleasure of the past, so often worry and wonder about the coming days, and lastly the struggle to be present in our every day lives.  The production on this EP will be really fun and different from anything I've ever done before...in a GREAT way!\n\nEP 2: Christmas collab Stacy Lantz\nThis past December, Stacy Lantz and I wrote a couple holiday songs and took them on the road to \"beta test\" the idea of making a record and doing more holiday themed tours.  Well the shows were a blast, and the songs seemed to go over great, so we decided to make an EP of these songs to release around the time when you're ready for Christmas music. \nEP 3: Strip It Down\nLastly, I've wanted to put out a record that was bare-bones production (acoustic, piano, and voices) for a while.  These are always my favorite types of recordings, the ones where you feel like you're sitting on the floor 2 feet from the players and hearing each line like it was just written.  Full of heart, stories, and honesty.

It's more or less a pledge, until it's successfully funded. Furthermore, if the project doesn't get funded NONE OF THE MONEY goes to the project, which is super sad. \n\nSo a huge challenge here is to have faith that you guys will help make the project(s) a reality, since the recording process is already started not the first EP.

The goal will be to have the book published by spring, 2015.\nYOU: Maybe you\u2019ve always wanted to write but never have the time. Maybe you\u2019re a passionate reader full of ideas. Maybe you\u2019d love to be a part of a project like this that will bring together a wide variety of people. Maybe you're a massive Travis Thrasher fan. Maybe you\u2019re simply a creative soul and this sounds like fun.\nME: I\u2019ve wanted to be a writer since third grade. I worked at a publishing company as Author Relations Manager for thirteen years learning what makes authors tick. I\u2019ve been a fulltime writer for seven years now collaborating with everyone from Blake Shelton\u2019s mother to filmmakers to the guys at Duck Dynasty.\nNow I want to collaborate with YOU!\nI want one person to select the premise for the novel. Another to pick the genre. Another to pick the setting. And so on.\nSure, those are the big choices. But you can contribute in small but still meaningful ways! Like thinking of a fun phrase to use. Or even a clever sentence.\nWho will our hero be?\nWhat clich\u00e9 must go into our story?\nIf you think the end result is going to be some sloppily-written novel, THINK AGAIN. This might be the best thing I ever do. Because I have brilliant people like yourself giving me ideas!\nThis is what I\u2019ve learned: collaborating is FUN.\nSometimes the more ideas you can get, the better the project can be.\nObviously my job will be to get all the ingredients in place and then make something awesome out of it.\nWHAT MAKES THIS AN AWESOME IDEA?\nNobody has done this.\nSomeone in California and Key West and North Dakota can all share in the process of creating a book.\nWe\u2019ll have a fabulous book at the end of this. Unpredictable. ZANY.\nYou get to watch as the story literally unfolds in front of you. A story that you're a part of. \nHOW CAN I BELIEVE YOU\u2019LL BE ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF?\nI don\u2019t know another author out there who can write a sweet Nicholas Sparks-style love story and then turn around and do a Stephen King-style horror novel. I\u2019ve done both and everything in between.\nMaking stories out of songs? Done that.\nMaking stories out of screenplays? Yep.\nMaking stories out of true-life situations? Yep again.\nGhostwriting? Sure I\u2019ve done that!\nAdventure? Thriller? Romance? Drama? Literary? Christmas? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes.\nThis project will allow me to do something wildly creative and FUN. And we will all be in this together!\nHOW WILL THIS WORK?\nI have no idea whatsoever. No, I actually have some idea.\nFirst we launch the campaign. People pick what they want to contribute. DON'T SEND ME THE IDEA RIGHT AWAY! Keep it until we see what happens after 30 days. I don't want anybody swayed by what the idea will be. \nIf we reach our goal, then I will begin to communicate with every person who is contributing. I will start with a premise if picked and go from there. Soon I will begin to create a story outline full of names and places and situations.\nI will assemble all the ingredients and then will share with all of you what I'll be writing. If there are contradictory issues (a situation not fitting into the premise, something like that), I will address it with the creator.\nI will be communicating with you all along the way, letting you know how the story is taking shape. I\u2019m sure there are going to be some major challenges. But that\u2019s the exciting part!\nConsider this to be a diary of sorts on the journey of writing a book, from the very beginning of the ideas to the final line.\nThe goal will be to finish the story by spring, 2015. To publish a piece that has every bit of input from all of YOU!\nWHY $15,000??\nMy goal is to approach this as if this is a regular trade book that will be edited, copyedited, proofread, typeset and designed by professionals. I work with all of those so I want to make this the best possible book it can be.\nThis won\u2019t look like a self-published book. This is going to look like something that Jimmy Fallon or Matt Lauer might hold up to the camera right before interviewing me.\nWait, you\u2019re laughing. Don\u2019t laugh. I\u2019m being serious.\nBUT WAIT\u2014THERE ARE NO T-SHIRTS?? NO GOODIES??\nThis is all about the creation and the collaboration. BUT . . .If we reach our goal, then we will start adding fun additional STUFF with the stretch goals. These can be adding more choices to the book along with materials related to OneStory.\nOOOHHHH. . . . STRETCH GOALS?! TELL ME MORE.\nIf this surprises all of us there\u2019s a vast array of resources I can use to create fun things associated with this. Yes, t-shirts. Stickers. Logos. Cool posters. Songs. Videos. If you know me, you know I'm FULL of ideas. \nBut look.\nAt the end of the day, this isn\u2019t about accumulating more STUFF.\nIt\u2019s about taking a journey.\nAND THE JOURNEY IS EVERYTHING.\nIt\u2019s about seeing what it\u2019s like to create a novel and write and finish it.\nYou\u2019ll be alongside me every step of the way.\nRULES\n1. Don\u2019t be vulgar or sacrilegious in any of your choices\n2. Do not use anybody\u2019s name or story without their permission\n3. All ideas submitted will be the property of OneStory for the author (me) to use them in whatever capacity he deems fit. (If you really have that home run idea, save it for yourself)\n4. If two ideas directly contradict themselves (meaning they make no possible sense no matter how hard the author tries), the author will use the idea with the higher value and go back to the other contributor to get another idea.\n5. Dream sequences are totally viable. Yes, we\u2019ll probably see lots of dream sequences. And surely a character losing his mind (like every other Travis Thrasher novel).\n6. No animals or small children should be injured in the idea building for this book.\n7. Any rules broken here will result in the idea not being used. But let\u2019s break the rules for how a novel is created and craft something that\u2019s incredible!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe unique aspect to this project doesn't involve technological issues or manufacturing difficulties.

But recognizing this situation is an opportunity for a new beginning, a genesis moment. As with nature, human culture can recover and thrive when people exercise their creative gifts in stewardship.\nLast winter, Mako introduced Culture Care with a little booklet, \u201cOn Becoming Generative.\u201d Culture Care is a vision for presenting our culture with a bouquet of flowers\u2014for reconnecting our culture with beauty. It is an invitation to join a constructive conversation with fresh categories, and a call to cultivate the soil of culture so that it can flourish. Culture care is for everyone: artists and cultural catalysts, academics and activists, church and government workers, business and civic leaders. Everyone has a role in restoring beauty to benefit ourselves and coming generations.\nThe award-winning booklet has already sparked responses from people in academia, the church, and the business and nonprofit worlds. Now the same team (designer/artist Lindsay Kolk, artist and culture shaper Makoto Fujimura, and editor Peter Edman) is ready to move to the next level with a book on Culture Care\u2014and we need your help!\nThe Culture Care book includes constructive chapters and illustrations to launch conversations on topics including beauty, the care and feeding of the soul, crossing borders and building bridges, overcoming poisoned language, caring for artists, nurturing true competition, and nonviolent resistance to the culture wars.\nThe goal of this campaign is to raise funds for International Arts Movement (the parent nonprofit of the Fujimura Institute) to self-publish the book. Proceeds from the sale of the book will support and propagate the ongoing Culture Care effort. This is an opportunity for you to support Culture Care by pre-purchasing the book (and saving money!), and to help us to gauge how many copies can be printed.

That\u2019s cool. It\u2019s been nice, though, you know, chatting.\nUs: Oh, man, for us too. Thank you\u2026 (voice cracking) for everything. (\u201cYou\u201d and \u201cUs\u201d hug, tears forming in both of \u201cOur\u201d eyes.)\nSTRETCH FUNDING GOALS\nHere are the things we plan to do with our money if we make even more amazing amounts than the amazing amounts you\u2019ve already given us. Mind you, I should probably set aside some cash first to look up more superlatives. As amazing as the word \u201camazing\u201d is, I bet it\u2019s getting old.\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 ($25K) RESUME WORK ON ALBUM \u2013 GOAL MET!\nWe\u2019ve already started working again on the double album because of your generosity. We're thrilled.\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 ($28K) REACH THE SECRET BUDGET NUMBER \nWe\u2019ll have hit our original goal, the \"secret\" one we made, before we got nervous and lowered it. At $28,000, we'll be able to make the process better for both ourselves and others (i.e. pay musicians and designers better, take a bit more time on things, stuff like that). And when we're done, you'll hear a better album than $20,000 would have given us. How cool is that?\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 (35K) MAKE A VIDEO ON A NEW CAMERA \nWe\u2019ll go out and buy a camera, tripod, and, like, maybe a lens cloth, and make another video. It\u2019ll either be a short documentary on the \"Making of\", or it\u2019ll be a music video. Not sure yet which.\nSTRETCH GOAL #4 (40K) MAKE ANOTHER VIDEO ON OUR NEW CAMERA\nThe camera will still be new, and we\u2019ll make the other video\u2026 the one we didn\u2019t make for the last stretch fund goal. Like, if we made the music video for GOAL#3, then we\u2019ll make the documentary for GOAL#4. If we made the documentary for\u2026\nLori: Don, they get the idea.\nDon: Okay.\nSTRETCH GOAL #5 (50K) TO INFINITY AND BEYOND\nI started to spend a lot of time budgeting out other things we might do if we make more than this, and then Lori\u2013who is, as many of you now know, the voice of reason in our family\u2013suggested we just let people know what some of those other things might be, and cross that bridge when we come to it. She\u2019s right, as usual. So, here are some of the things we discussed:\nDon Chaffer \u2013 An Unfinished Tale, Vol. 3, Strange \u2013 a Spoken Word Album\nI would record some more readings of my poems, like I did on the first two Unfinished Tale solo albums; maybe also a small chap book of all the poems from the first three volumes.\nWaterdeep Theater\nWe would produce a theatrical Waterdeep show involving: actors, musicians, lights, costumes, and maybe puppets. It\u2019d be a cross between a regular Waterdeep show, Late Night with David Letterman, and the musical, Wicked (which, technically, I have never seen). Rad. We\u2019d run the show for several weekends in Nashville, and possibly take it to other town(s) as well, for weekend runs in small 100-200 seat theaters.\nSon of a Gun Full Musical Recording\nMy first musical, Son of a Gun (co-written with playwright, Chris Cragin Day, as well as Lori, on additional music) premiered in NYC in November, 2012. A few of you got to see it. Most of you didn\u2019t. Due to Actor\u2019s Equity Union issues, we were unable to video it for you. However, what we can do is record the entire musical in audio form\u2013both the songs AND the dialog.\nMore Shows and Touring\nIf we make a bunch of money, we could finally afford a minivan, instead of the Honda Accord we presently use for \u201ctouring.\u201d I put \u201ctouring\u201d in quotes because our show schedule has been miserably sparse the past few years. \nGet that minivan.\nChange the touring schedule, and change the world!\nRight now. With us. Together.\nWHAT FOLLOWS HERE IS THE ORIGINAL KICKSTARTER TEXT:\nOn Our History (Briefly, With an Apology For the Word \"Farewell\")\nAbout twenty years ago, my wife (Lori Chaffer), and I (Don Chaffer) formed a band called Waterdeep. We used to tour a lot. We made a lot of records, and people used to buy them, back when people bought records. We were even on a record label for a while, back when people used to be on record labels. In 2004, we took a break from touring (a.k.a. had a kid). That's when we had our famous \"Farewell To Touring Show.\"  I'd like to take this moment to admit that I am indeed the one responsible for choosing the phrase \"Farewell To Touring Show.\" As it turns out, \"Farewell to Touring Show\" sounds a lot like \"Farewell Show.\" So\u2013while we've released over ten records since then,\u2013we continue to have people ask, \"Didn't you guys break up?\" Well, no. We didn't. But I did once use a phrase that made it sound like we did. Sorry about that.\nOn How We Make a Living\nAfter I sabotaged the public perception of Waterdeep's existence, I moved on to other areas of the music business. For the past ten years I've earned my living by: running a studio, producing other people's albums, writing songs for and with others, making instrumental music for film &TV, and doing musical theater jobs (from composing/writing/arranging down to bits of amateur acting). Lori, meanwhile, has cared for our two kids and home,  run the books for and administrated the business, written songs for and with others, collaborated on the musicals, and sung a heckuva lot of background vocals on people's albums.\nOn This New Album (And On Two Solos Verses One Double)\nDespite all this, we still write songs for ourselves, and they get to banging around inside of us. So, about once a year, we gather these songs together in the studio. Voila. Waterdeep album. This past year, when it came time to record, we each had enough songs to fill an album individually. So, we started two separate solo projects, but realized they were still artistically connected to each other. Voila. Waterdeep Double Album.\nOn Why We're Inviting Your Participation\nWe couldn\u2019t finish it. Right now, the songs are just sitting, lonely, on a hard drive. Meanwhile, all around Nashville (a.k.a. \u201cMusic City\u201d) studios are closing; labels, downsizing; and publishing companies are letting long-time writers go. Record budgets have shrunk; royalties, diminished; and film & TV doesn't pay what it used to. So, while my schedule has been extremely busy, our financial life's still mostly gig to gig. Furthermore, we never make money on a Waterdeep album until after it's finished. That's where you come in. If you support us through kickstarter, we have enough up front money to get the album done. We can feed ourselves, the songs are no longer lonely on their hard drive, and you get a new album. You can also get a whole bunch of other stuff (see rewards at right).\nOn Why This Whole Thing is Worth It (And Other Existential Concerns)\nWe can't shake the feeling that these songs are important. As life goes on, it gets more difficult: parents grow ill, loved ones pass on, marriages crumble, finances get tight, children find their own life problems. Of course, in the midst of all that, there are a thousand mercies and wonders, from daily sunlight, to the ocean of interactions we have with one another. Lori and I have talked often about how these new songs salute complicated realities, and embrace both wonder and sadness. They remind us that this is just human life, and it's pretty great to be alive, even when it hurts.\nOn Why You're Important To Us, and to This Album\nHaving not toured as much in recent years, our interaction with all of you has sadly dwindled. We still stay in touch with some of you through social media, and you with us, but we used to have such times together out there on the road, didn't we? I know we're all busy, but this is a chance for us to re-connect, to re-capture some things, and for you to remind your friends that we didn't break up after all (\"No,\" you say, \"They called it 'Farewell TO TOURING'... I know. Bad name.... Yeah. They know that\"), and for us to bond over a new set of songs at a new shared time of life. We hope you want this as much as we do.\nOn the Budget, why $20,000?\nThe budget includes all of the costs of: hiring musicians, finishing the recording and mixing, mastering, package design, manufacturing, promotion, and of course, the money we need to cover the bills while I turn down other work. It's a pretty low number for a double album, by the way.\nOn Having the Room to Choose\nIt recently occurred to me that I spend more time and energy making other people's albums than I do our own. Having this money set aside will give us the room to make more deliberate artistic decisions. We will still be insanely efficient with your money. I can run Pro-Tools-Hot-Key circles around most people. Seriously. I don't play.\nOn \"Inflexible\" funding And The Importance of the Goal\nThis is NOT a flexible-funded project. If we don't make the $20,000 goal, we don't get anything at all. That's how kickstarter works. So, when it comes to giving to this project, our livelihood is in your hands. No pressure.\nOn Stretch-Fund Goals\nIf we get more than the $20,000, we\u2019re going to use that money for Waterdeep-related work:\n-We'll promote this record more. We've made the joke before that we release a record by whispering into our closet that it's out. Sad, but true. Real promotion takes both time and money. So, let's create some of both.\n-We'll buy a video camera, so we can make more videos like this one. Dang. That was fun. Music videos, sketch comedy, poetry readings, Pro Tools tutorials, Cooking with Lori. All sorts of crap.\n-We\u2019ll write and record more songs. No explanation necessary. I'm guessing you know what songs are. Man, we love songs.\n-And then if you surprise us, and the money just keeps coming, I may write a book of Waterdeep poetry. Lori may score a Waterdeep film. We may actually hit the road. There may be some kind of weird hybrid Waterdeep/theater piece I may or may not have already started working on with or without having told Lori about it. Oh, and I'll probably start method acting classes, and keep honing my acting chops\u2026 every night\u2026 upstairs, in the room over the garage\u2026 where I will become the new Daniel Day Lewis... and probably do the definitive bio pic of Millard Filmore, America's underrated 13th president.\nThanks in advance, everyone. We love you. Really. Even those of you we don\u2019t know yet, or whose names we forgot. When we meet you, we\u2019ll apologize for forgetting, and then... A big group hug. Yes. A big group hug to all of you.\nSincerely,\nWaterdeep\nDon & Lori Chaffer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause we record in our backyard studio, it's hard to imagine that anything\u2013barring a natural disaster or major sickness\u2013would get in the way of completing this record. I've never failed to deliver a record I said I would make, and that's been true of over 100 albums.

Would you like to hear an un-produced, stripped down, solo, electric, live album? Or would you like a fully produced, fancy, beautiful, full length, studio album? Or, would you like both? This is the project that lets you decide the answer to those questions.\nHere's the story:\nI have been kicking around ideas in my head for over a year now, champing at the bit to record another full length album, as it's been over SIX YEARS since I've released one of those. I've had a lot of fun over the last few years, recording and releasing my music more frequently (with EPs, not full length albums), working with different producers to get different sounds, meeting new people around Nashville, and growing further as a writer and singer. It's been a great few years, during which I recorded and released the four aforementioned EPs, the last three of which (referred to as The Trilogy), I raised support for through generous fans like you on a previous Kickstarter campaign! I've worked with awesome folks, toured around the country in support of those projects, and found new friends, fans and supporters along the way. \nEver since finishing up The Trilogy project in 2012, I've had a strong desire to record another full length album. I feel like it's time- like the season of EPs is over. And I've been wanting to do something different, too. I'd like to set up a mic in front of me, and a mic in front of my electric guitar, and sing these new songs live, with as little re-do's and overdubbing as possible. I think that sounds like great fun.\nBut, since it's my first full length album in SIX YEARS, I also have a strong desire to get into a great studio with a great producer and some great musicians and turn out an awesomely polished piece of work.\nI have been torn between these two desires for quite some time, trying to determine the best course of action. Then, washing dishes at home one day, I had the thought- Could I do both?! And then I thought, why not try? So here we are. I have a lot of new songs and I want to record them. There might be some overlap, if particular songs lend themselves to both stripped down and produced versions, but for the most part they will be two separate full length albums with different songs- put together as a double album.\nThe goal of $16,000 is the budget- It includes recording costs for both albums, mixing and mastering fees, album artwork, CD duplication, and reward fulfillment costs. Anything we raise beyond the goal will be put to good use for press campaigns and promotional costs. So, check out all the rewards to the right, see if this is something you're excited about being a part of, and pick the reward package you like the most! Thanks for checking this project out, you're time and attention are appreciated.\n**VINYL REWARD DETAILS: On several levels you will see the \"limited edition vinyl compilation album\" listed- this is a a 12\" vinyl record, each copy is numbered and signed. It is a compilation album of my favorite songs from the EP Trilogy, here is the track listing:\nSide A- 1. Little Bit, 2. All My Love, 3. I'm the Moon, 4. Telephone Wire\nSide B- 1. The Reason Why, 2. Just Like Him 3. To the Swift, 4. O Black River\nThe vinyl! It's green.\nHearing these songs on vinyl is really special. It gives them an old, \"lived in\" feel.

In my musical endeavors, it's never been a goal to record a \"worship album\" (you know, the \"songs you play in a church\" type of worship.)  My music, highly influenced by where I am in life, has always been an expression of worship.  I am so grateful to many people have found a familiar place in my honest, sometimes gritty 'God-music.'  I assure you, there is more of that right around the corner. \nHowever, over the past 2 years, I've been writing \"worship songs\" - songs that transcend circumstance and life-stage, that thrive in a corporate worship setting - songs of God, that simply tell of what He's already told us.  \nIn the months I've spent preparing for this project, it has become increasingly clear that these 10+ songs, should be given away, asking nothing in return.  This is not an indicator of how I will do future projects, nor a statement that all worship music should be free.  But this little group of tunes - these are a gift.  And I'm going to pass them on.  \nBut wait, you want us to pay for something that's \"free\"?  The reality is that funds are required for any music project.

But it was then that she steered her shopping cart in reverse and looked back to us and said, \"I feel like today Im supposed to tell y\"all to NEVER GIVE UP!\"\nNearly 500 shows, 36 states, and two countries later, those are still the words that keep us going. We've heard those words numerous times through significant, ordinary people who've come across our music. Whether it was a show filled with people or a show where there were only 2. Its people who keep inspiring us over and over again.\nCarolina Story has always been the two of us at the very core, but so many, many more people make up our story and now for the first time we have an opportunity to reach so many more people with this next record and not only that but to include the people we've met along the way in the process of making this next record.\nWe're gonna do it right, we're gonna do it the way we've always wanted to release a record and use this money to hire a publicist, a radio promoter, release a music video, record in a great studio with grammy award winning producer, Blake Chancey, hire world class musicians, etc.\nWe are nervous and excited all at the same time but we know that this is bigger than ourselves. We know we are exactly where we are supposed to be and this monumental project is the next step in our unfolding story. We need your help to make this happen. We love you and hope we make you proud.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe kickstarter process is an amazing thing to be a part of. Watching a community come together to support someone's dreams is simply amazing.\n\nThere are some obstacles along the way though. We are thrilled to send you our record once it is finished and send you our limited edition silk screen posters and even build you suitcase kickdrums, but all of this is a lot of work and we are fulfilling these on our own. This is the challenge of doing a record without a label, but we are excited to take it on.\n\nThe moving pieces in a record are endless and many snags can come up along the way. From manufacturing problems to unexpected studio delays, there is no telling what might be thrown our way. We are more than confident that we can do this, but we ask for your support in patience in this process.

The Rose Factor is a band that was formed 5 years ago in Nashville for the express purpose of music ministry.  We travel all around the southeast--and even across the ocean--to spread the Gospel through our music.  \nA DREAM OPPORTUNITY\nWe are now taking a gigantic leap of faith because we believe God is opening up the door to an incredible opportunity that could only come about through Him.  Although The Rose Factor is an independent band without a recording contract, God has orchestrated a dream come true for us to record a new album with one of music's most incredible producers: the Grammy-Award-winning Tedd Tjornhom, aka Tedd T.  Producers of Tedd's caliber and credentials don't usually produce albums for independent bands, but he believes--as do we--that God has brought our paths together for this unique purpose.  In order for us to secure time on Tedd's very full studio schedule, we stepped out on faith financially and placed a deposit for the project. \nThe new songs that we are aiming to record are ones that we love, brand new ones, and some we have had the privilege to use in our ministry.  These are songs that cradle God's message of healing, redemption, and love.  Songs of rescue, unity, purpose, and surrender. In saying that, I also realize that this project is not just about our music.  It's about each of our stories joining together as we are embraced by the Creator of the universe.\nWhy Tedd T? \nTedd is a producer who believes in this message that God has placed on our hearts. For that reason, and the fact that he loves our music, he  jumped on board to record and produce our project, even as an independent band. Chemistry-wise, he also knows how to capture the sound we are aiming to express, and that is so important.  He can so beautifully translate all the wonderful sounds that I hear in my head but can't get on your iPod.  This is why it is such an amazing collaboration!\nWhy $17,771? \nYou maybe saying to yourself $17,771 is an odd goal to set.  I love the symbolic stories of numbers and these numbers all represent importance in the Bible. So, whether we look at the numbers 1, 3, 40 or 7 they all hold extreme Biblical significance.   In the same way, each of our lives are extremely significant, and full of meaning.  We all play a vital part in this existence.  So that is why this amount and time frame is so significant.  Also, this amount is how much we need to cover the cost of production, recording, rewards, fees, and CD duplication.\nPlease Join Us\nYour joining us in this endeavor would mean so much to us! It will give us the opportunity to continue traveling around the US and the whole world sharing the Gospel through our music to many generations.  It would assist us in sharing God's message of love, forgiveness and reconciliation with people no matter what their circumstance or situation.  We are humbled by the opportunities that we've had to share our music with Barefoot Republic Camp, Lifeway: Centrifuge/M Fuge, Masterpiece Camp, churches, rehabilitation centers, homeless shelters, coffee shops, and prisons.  We've also been to S. Korea and will continue to go wherever God leads us to minister.\nBottom line: we have been blown away by so many stories from people who have been blessed through our ministry--for which we give and will always give God the glory.  Your participation would help us continue to tell how our stories have been permeated by God's love and expressed through our music and relationships.  Please help us to take advantage of this amazing opportunity.\nWe sincerely thank you.\nThomas Rose of The Rose Factor\nA Little Extra Update for everyone ( a taste of Backer-only updates to come) \nHello Kickstarter Family, Here is a song Dita and I wrote that was used as an online resource for a Beth Moore Bible study entitled PRAYING GOD'S WORD.

I am trying to record my second full-length studio album while finishing my Master's degree (and keeping my job) -- and I don't have a lot of time to work with!

I am excited about this Kickstarter model of arts patronage that allows art-lovers (even those of modest income) to support the creation of art -- in this case, music -- in a specific and meaningful way. You will quickly see that your contribution makes a tangible difference: Give money towards music....Wait a few weeks....Then voila! Receive the music that you helped make happen!\nThe crucial catch with Kickstarter, though, is that I have to raise ALL of the target goal, or I will receive NONE of the funds.
