The finished book is expected to be in print by July 2021, will feature adventure generators, settlement/space station builders, a galactic setting featuring over a dozen planets and their controlling factions.  It will be available in  both hard and soft covers, and expected to be over 100 pages long.\nSOUL is a sci-fantasy setting for the Savage Worlds game system, set in the far future. The scope of this setting is broad. Travel anywhere in the galaxy or hop over to another if you want to explore. It's a high tech world with a dash of magic. The setting takes on some dark themes. Slavery is permitted almost everywhere, but more concentrated in certain realms. The universes universal currency is the souls of the dead.\nThe scope of play is galactic with room for all types of adventures. Need some Dune like sandworms? Convoys through the desert? High tech floating cities? Massive android armies? You got it. World eaters? You bet!\nIt is the year 9135 on Earth. Humans lay claim to hundreds of thousands of worlds in the Milky Way, but humanity is not united. Three significant factions wrestle for power and territory while hundreds of minor factions fight for the scraps.\nWhat are they fighting for?...\n Shade is a multidimensional particle used for hyperspace travel and powerful incantations. Shade or soul dust is a currency throughout the galaxy. To the average citizen, shade funds their way of life and is a means of freedom. To factions, shade is power, plain and simple. This stuff moves armies.\nHow do you get shade? It needs to be reaped from living material, usually plant life or animal and quite often slaves and the less fortunate.\nSOUL the game is going to be about 80-120 pages of content. Rules for hyperspace travel, tables for adventure building and random encounters for on land and in space.\nThe finished product will ship by fall 2021. Balancing gear, weapons, edges, and hindrances take some time. Also, any editing that needs to be wrapped up. I have artists lined up and have already gone over my budget on the few pieces of original art I have. Much of the raised funds will be for artwork and editing.\nWhat is SOUL? It's an attempt to bring a few awesome themes together. It is inspired by other settings like Interface Zero for its high tech futuristic atmosphere, Star Wars for its epic storytelling, Star Trek for flying starships as a team, and starship troopers for its grittiness. Soul is a setting that gives much creative license to the GM and also keeps them on their toes. There is plenty of content to lean on and room for injecting material from other settings.  The final release should include lots of roll tables, gear porn, and a full beastiery.\nThree significant factions rub against each other, always on the brink of war. The only thing stopping them is the incredible cost it would have. So instead, they hire smaller factions or mercenaries to perform black ops and spycraft against one another.\nRuled by Tiberia Abadons iron fist.\nDoing what she can to maintain her position in the empire. She puts down repeated rebellions as quickly as they crop up.\nThe empire has an abundance of slaves, much more than anywhere else. However, it is becoming a problem. Recently a law was passed saying any slave can be reaped for shade by the age of 20. The law was passed to help control the population but backfired somewhat, and now many planets are in full revolt, and the slaves are in an uprising.\nThe will of Abadon is to rule the galaxy by force if necessary. She is building a Dyson ring around a star, the first-ever to prove her godhood. It will make the empire beyond rich with landmass available to grow their population and grit farming capabilities.\n\n\nMark Five\nPresident of Dynamus.\nMark has spent the last 200 years involved in politics, climbing the ladder to where he is now. The best schools in Dynamus taught him. He comes from an elite family who sells some of the most popular androids in the galaxy. His family has monopolies on several planets, some of which they own.\nDynamus is home of the wealthiest inhabitants in the galaxy. Like the other major factions, Dynamus has extensive farm planets growing algae, rodents, and other lower forms of life to be reaped for their shade. Dynamus' strength though is in its lively market and advanced tech.\nIt's also known as the empire of sharks because of its loaning practices. Smaller factions will find themselves in a bind trying to procure military or advanced tech, and Dynamus lends a hand. Dynamus usually loaning the tech they need or the funds to acquire it. The interest rates are intense and sometimes unpayable, which leads to the sharks owning the smaller faction and turning their worlds into shade farms. The most substantial loans Dynamus has out are to the Astras Empire who is paying through the nose for the tech to build their Dyson ring.\nDynamus seeks to rule financially.\nStarMecha controls fewer systems than either Dynamus or Astras. Humans have no roles in government here; a machine runs the nation. AB is its name, and he has ruled since the bloody founding of the nation more than 4000 years ago.\nAB is a mysterious character that few have seen in person. He has been a mediator to many conflicts in the galaxy. He seems to value peace almost as much as he values his chosen few.\nThe big three avoid all-out war with each other. However, that doesn't speak to the minor factions who are often clashing with armies and weapons of mass destruction. Spycraft and black ops are the norms. Every faction is trying to get a leg up on each other. The smaller factions are less cautious going into open war with one another. Planet killing weapons are available but highly regulated by a treaty between the big three. This keeps the weapons out of the hands of most other factions.\nShade is harvested from any organic material, from trees to people. It is abundant but also in very high demand. It's used as a catalyst for opening wormholes into hyperspace and also in casting powerful mystical incantations. Once in hyperspace, you can travel anywhere in days, weeks, or perhaps months, instead of thousands of years.\nAlthough most of the galaxy being discovered, much of it is not habitable.\nMagic is used widely throughout the Astras Empire. Almost every ship has at least one magic user. They are there in place of an auger engine which is used to open wormholes into hyperspace. A navigation computer than takes over until they reach the other side and a hole is needed to leave hyperspace.\nMagic is rarely used and even looked down upon in places like Dynamus who see it as inferior to technology. Some minor factions have outlawed the use of magic. They believe it's evil at its very core. Users are locked up and placed on prison planets.\n \u201cThis game references the Savage Worlds game system, available from Pinnacle Entertainment Group at www.peginc.com.

Frank Baum's classic World of Oz. The events of Baum\u2019s original stories are over a century in the past. The original Wizard and Dorothy are long dead although many of their friends and companions are still around. A new Wizard from Dorothy\u2019s world has conquered half of the land of Oz and a new sea has overcome the once deadly dessert that isolated Oz from the rest of the world. Players can take the role of a freedom fighter, mercenary, pirate, privateer, or countless others to explore Oz on land or sea. Join the fight to liberate a wartorn Oz or join the many that profit from it.\n\nMay 17, 2020, marks the 120th anniversary of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, by L. Frank Baum. We at Pirate Press couldn't imagine a better day to launch our Kickstarter for this new book. Join us in celebrating over a century of wonder and delight, compliments of this amazing American author. Thank You, L. Frank Baum, may your legacy continue another 120 years and beyond!\nBattle for Oz: Pirates is a complete game setting custom-built for the award-winning Savage Worlds rule-set published by Pinnacle Entertainment Group. You will need the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition core book to play the game. If you are not familiar with the Savage Worlds RPG, check it out at Pinnacles website HERE.\nBattle for Oz: Pirates will be professionally designed by Fat Goblin Games, artist Rick Hershey, and published through drivethrurpg.com as a print on demand product. It will be available in hardcopy and softcopy in two different affordable print quality options.\nThe Battle for Oz: Pirates core book will not replace the original Battle for Oz book that was designed for the Deluxe Edition of the Savage Worlds core rules in 2014. It will UPDATE the setting for SWADE (Savage Worlds Adventure Edition) as well as add a large amount of new material centered around the new Oz sea. Battle for Oz: Pirates will convert all of the existing NPC's and creatures into SWADE as well as tweak the Oz setting rules to flow seamlessly with the new core rules.  It will include an updated timeline to account for the last six years of conflict, new maps, updated city descriptions, as well as new playable races. In essence, Battle for Oz: Pirates will be a sequel, game companion, and SWADE conversion all rolled into one setting core book. \nWhat is Battle for Oz: Pirates\nIt's the land of Oz, but not the one you remember. Oz is no longer a free land. For the last six years, Oz has been subjugated by a new Wizard from the outer world that calls himself, Ozymandias. Glinda the Good and many of her allies have been captured or killed, and over half of Oz is a military state. Ozymandius is using a forgotten magical discipline called Technomancy, and its energies are literally shaking the foundation of Oz itself.  From the Emerald City, the new dark Wizard commands a legion of soulless Tin-Men soldiers and ferocious flying monkeys to enforce his will. Anyone who dares to speak out or organize against him is met with a silent end at the hands of Scarecrow assassins that live in the night.  The only real resistance comes from the north in the nomadic country of Gilikin.  It is there that Amber Gale, daughter of Dorothy Gale, rallies the Beast-men and scattered few against this new evil. Most have lost hope and turned a blind eye, while others such as privateers, and mercenaries have chosen to profit off of the constant conflict. Our modern-day Oz is a darker, less friendly place than Dorothy Gale encountered when she first crossed over from Kansas over a century ago. After six years of bloodshed, a stalemate has developed as neither side has the resources to continually wage an all-out battle. Ozymandias\u2019s forces still occupy three of the five countries of Oz and a large portion of Munchkin country has become a demilitarized zone.\nThen about a year ago, a change in the landscape of Oz further complicated the cold war. An unexplained phenomenon magically transformed the deadly desert that surrounds Oz into a sea. The transformation engulfed the coastlines of Oz and the accompanying storms ravaged the cities and towns for over a week. In the aftermath, the residents of Oz had to contend with and adapt to a new unexplored seascape. Even Ozymandias was forced to commit resources to the exploration of the new sea in a race to control it before his enemies did. Against the backdrop of war, a new era of commerce, trade, smuggling, and piracy, is unfolding carried by the strong tides of the magical sea. Sapphire City, the second-largest city in Oz next to the Emerald City, has become the center of this new wave of commerce and exploration. What no one knows, is that lurking in the depths of the new sea is an ancient creature that was once worshipped as a god. This new sea terror is beholding to no one, and will not discriminate when consolidating his power of the sea and the land dwellers that trespass on it.\nBattle For Oz was a successful original setting published in 2014 for the Savage Worlds Deluxe Edition. It set the familiar fiction against the backdrop of war and revolution. The initial concept was simple, a modernized version of Oz with a rich history that extended largely from Dorothy Gale's arrival in the year 1900 to modern-day times with the introduction of a new tyrant, that did not arrive in a state fair balloon.  The plot point campaign threw the players directly into the crossfire as agents of the resistance working directly for Dorothy's daughter, Amber Gale. \nWe have been planning a sequel for some time but with the arrival of the new Savage Worlds Adventure Edition core rules, we knew it was the right time to move forward. Battle for Oz: Pirates will do the same thing for Oz that SWADE did for Savage Worlds, make the game even more- fast, furious, and fun!\nI've broken the rewards down incrementally as easily as I know how but in essence there are three basic pledge level types available.\n1-The OZ DECKHAND is the PDF only pledge level available and will not only include the NEW Oz Pirates setting book in PDF, but also the original Battle for Oz setting book (2014 Deluxe Edition) in PDF as well as ALL digital-only stretch goals that are unlocked during the campaign.\n2- All of the pledge levels beyond the OZ DECKHAND will include the New Oz Pirates setting book in PDF AND softcover print, with the exception of the following pledge levels that include an upgraded hardcover book: Oz Freedom Fighter, Oz Merchant, and Oz Sea King.  If your chosen pledge level includes a softcover book and you prefer a hardcover book, see the ADD ON list and simply add the total amount listed to your pledge amount. There is also an option in the ADD ON list to pay an additional amount to upgrade your book printing quality from standard to premium printing. Drivethrurpg.com has examples of the difference in the two print qualities HERE.\n3- Lastly, the contributor pledge levels that include, OZ MARINE,  OZ PIRATE CAPTAIN, SHIFTERS POINT VIP, SAPPHIRE CITY VIP, OZ MERCHANT, OZ NAVIGATOR, and OZ SEA KING, are limited premium pledge levels that allow the backer to actually have a hand in creating content for the new Oz Pirates book. We had similar pledge levels in our 2014 campaign for Battle for Oz, and they were extremely popular. These contributor pledge levels include all physical and digital stretch goals unlocked during the campaign, original custom artwork, special contributors credit in the book, as well as a limited 3D printed dice roller only available to pledge contributors. Please note that since the artwork and 3D dice roller will be produced and delivered by Pirate Press, a separate shipping fee will be generated and become the responsibility of the backer. If stretch goal items like Oz Dice, or Oz Bennies, are unlocked during the campaign and included in your pledge level, ALL ITEMS- including the original artwork and dice roller- that are produced by Pirate Press will be consolidated into one total shipping charge and shipped together. \nContributors gift, 3D printed dice roller.\nBacker book upgrade options \nFrom Standard Softcover Print quality to:\n- Hardback Cover Upgrade Standard Print Quality; + $5.00\n- Softback Premium Print Quality Upgrade; + $10.00\n- Hardback Premium Quality Upgrade; + $15.00\nNOTE- For more information on the difference between the standard print quality and premium print quality, click here to be directed to drivethrurpg.com to see some great examples.\nBattle for Oz setting book (2014 original Savage Worlds Deluxe Edition), Special Kickstarter only prices:\nBattle for Oz setting book in Softcover Standard Printing; $ 30.00 plus shipping\nBattle for Oz setting book in Softcover Premium Printing; $ 35.00 plus shipping\nBattle for Oz setting book in Hardcover Standard Printing; $ 35.00 plus shipping\nBattle for Oz setting book in Softcover Standard Printing; $ 45.00 plus shipping\nAdditional copy(s) of Battle for Oz: Pirates setting book (Savage Worlds Adventure Edition), Special Kickstarter only prices: \nBattle for Oz setting book in Softcover Standard Printing; $ 30.00 plus shipping\nBattle for Oz setting book in Softcover Premium Printing; $ 35.00 plus shipping\nBattle for Oz setting book in Hardcover Standard Printing; $ 35.00 plus shipping\nBattle for Oz setting book in Softcover Standard Printing; $ 45.00 plus shipping\n\nAdd-On List (all items are in preorder status)\nOz Creature Catalog (Through DrivethruRPG); $15.00 (PDF Delivery, physical book cost TBD)\nOz Figure Flats (Through DrivethruRPG):  $7.00  (PDF Delivery)\nOz Action Deck (through drivethrurpg.com); $10.00  plus shipping. \nOz PIRATES Dice (pair of d6); $3.00 per set of two, color is a blue and green.

Successful funding will allow us to complete the writing, the art, and fund the layout and design of the book. The COVID 19 quarantine has had a definite impact on our production schedule. Our adjusted schedule includes a finished rough draft of the book with all contributor material supplied by the Kickstarter campaign by July of 2020. We want to give Rick at Fat Goblin Games plenty of time for design and layout with an expected completion of November 2020. It is our plan to send out PDF's in November, as soon as they are available, giving our backers time to help us perfect the read. After all, a few hundred editors are better than the four we have. Once it has gone through a reasonable period of nit-picking, we would like to have a printed book ready to ship by December of 2020, hopefully before you ring in the New Year. All unlocked physical and digital stretch goals will work on independent schedules but it will be our goal to have those shipped out well before the book is complete.\nThis Kickstarter will be delivered with the help of  Backerkit \nAll pledge levels include FREE SHIPPING of the Battle for Oz: Pirates setting book to residents of the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, France, Germany, Greece, Finland, Belgium, and Australia.  These countries are known to the publisher based on our previous Kickstarter campaign. If you live in a country not listed above, contact Pirate Press at piratesinoz@gmail.com to see if your home country qualifies for free shipping. Brazil does not qualify for free shipping. Some unlocked physical stretch goals or pledge rewards may require additional shipping costs and will be noted if separate shipping costs apply. For example, all contributor pledge levels include a piece of custom art and a 3D printed dice roller. Both of these items would incur a combined separate shipping charge. If you pledged at a level that includes an additional shipping charge, or purchased an add on or expect to receive an unlocked stretch goal that requires additional shipping, you can email Pirate Press at piratesinoz@gmail.com to receive a free shipping estimate based on your location.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPirate Press has learned a great deal from the success and failures of the original Battle for Oz Kickstarter campaign. Mistakes in selecting printing options, unrealistic shipping costs, unorganized stretch goal fulfillment, and unreliable vendors are just a few of the shortcomings experienced in the first campaign. Though we feel we delivered a fantastic high-quality book, we let several small details fall through the cracks, specifically on stretch goal fulfillment. Those missteps are being corrected and will not happen again. Some of the things we are doing to ensure that is to commit fully to print on demand and drivethrurpg.com as our sole source of printed material. By the conclusion of this campaign, we hope to have a new setting book, three companion books, and several PDF adventures and GM material available for Battle for Oz: Pirates, all through drivethrurpg.com. \n\nWe have found a local artist in Fat Goblin Games to spearhead all of our book design which we hope will enable us to put out regular updates and new adventures for Savage Oz, something we did not have before. We will also be using Backerkit to fulfill our backer's pledges and add-ons on this campaign. If you are not familiar with Backerkit, it is a recognized industry leader on Kickstarter and other project funding sites that does an outstanding job organizing pledges, add-on orders, and assisting the project creator in collecting funds and shipping product. Their website can be viewed at Backerkit.com. \n\nTo ensure we don't lose time or material we have partnered with Savage Worlds vets like, Charles White of Fabled Environments to fulfill PDF stretch goals and included book content. We are also pulling from a multitude of local talent for art, editing, writing, and social media promotion. We believe that a combination of some amazingly talented writers and artists combined with the best version of the Savage Worlds RPG ruleset to date will make the ultimate Savage Oz experience!

If you don't recognize any particular parts on this page, chances are they are in development and will appear on the site in the future!\n\nQ: When are you going to add X part? Will Y feature be available when color launches?\nA: We process all feature and part requests through the following survey, so please feel free to fill it out to have your request added to our official user wish-list: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HeroForgeRequest. Our user request wishlist has many hundreds of unique entries, so we cannot provide estimated dates for specific additions.\n\nQ: Will Hero Forge 2.0 be backwards compatible?\nA: Yes! All of your existing characters and saves will be fully compatible with our new tools. You will be able to revisit old designs and add color.\n\nQ: Will digital download .stl files be available in color?\nA: No. Not initially, at least. File formats which support color are less widely supported by 3D printing software platforms, as color is not yet common for home 3D printers. While we expect to one day offer textured, color 3D model files, for the time being we will continue to distribute digital download model files in .stl format: the most commonly supported format for 3D printing software platforms.\n\nQ: What Printer are you using for your color prints?\nA: We plan to manufacture full color prints using the Mimaki 3DUJ-553 full color printer. We have experimented with a wide range of color printers, and have found this technology to offer the most vivid color, cleanest gradients, and best quality at miniature scale. At Hero Forge, we are always exploring the latest and greatest materials, and have historically added to or updating our material options as 3D print technology improves--this is always a possibility for the future.\n\nQ: Do I have to use all my rewards at once, or can I order figures one at a time?\nA: Backer tiers include one instance of shipping. If you'd prefer to redeem your backer rewards one at a time, you will simply need to pay for any instance of shipping after the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1x 3D Printed Color Mini", "descp": "Receive Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on a full-color, 3D printed tabletop miniature!\nINCLUDES:\nCustom FULL-COLOR 3D PRINTED miniature\nGet early access to full color design tools\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17,577 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1 Year Access to Token Maker Unlimited", "descp": "Get a full year of access to the new Token Maker.\nINCLUDES:\nGet early access to full color design tools\nReceive 1-year access to the Token Maker Unlimited\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["834 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Print and Paint Yourself", "descp": "Receive special Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on 10 digital download .stl files for 3D printed tabletop miniatures!

We wouldn\u2019t have made it this far without you!\nSo if you supported either (or both!) of our previous Kickstarter campaigns (5-Minute Dungeon, and Curses! Foiled Again!), we have a special gift for you: a free upgrade to the Mastermind Edition! \nHow do you claim this fabulous gift? It\u2019s easy! Here\u2019s how:\nBack the project for the Standard Edition. If you managed to get the Early Bird version, that qualifies too!\n  After the campaign ends, BackerKit will e-mail you a survey to complete your pledge. If you were a previous backer, your survey will include an offer to upgrade your pledge to the Mastermind Edition for free.\n  Click \u201cYES!\u201d and grab a pipe and deerstalker cap. You\u2019re now a Mastermind!\n  Limit one free upgrade per returning backer.\nNo problem! Each game you add to your pledge will be at the regular pledge price, plus a nominal $5 CDN shipping charge per extra game. Just add the amount when you make your pledge. \n Add Standard Editions: +$40 CDN for each additional copy (This includes shipping costs)\n Add Mastermind Editions: +$50 CDN for each additional copy (This includes shipping costs)\nPlease note that only one Early Bird discount and one Returning Backer Gift can be applied per pledge. Additional copies are at regular price.\n\n\nFor this campaign, we've decided to focus on community involvement rather than stretch goals. We wanted to make sure that no matter how funding turned out you got everything we envisioned for this game: upgraded materials, extra scene cards, more suspects & culprits, and plenty of additional case files to keep the game fresh. Everything that we were planning as stretch goals have already, automatically, been included in each copy of the game!\nSo instead, we've got some great stuff planned: several polls so you can help to shape the finished game, sneak peeks at game content and components, and contests to win cool prizes!\nOnce again, we're partnering with BackerKit to make it much easier for backers to manage their pledge choices and shipping information at the end of the campaign.\nWhen the campaign ends, you'll receive a BackerKit survey asking you to provide your shipping information so we can get your rewards to you. As part of this survey, you'll have the opportunity to add more copies of the game at regular price plus $5 shipping per additional game.\nWe are partnering with depots in the USA, Canada, Europe, China, and Australia to minimize the chances of additional duty and taxes being charged to you. Shipping to areas outside these regions may result in additional charges out of our control. Please research import regulations to learn about these potential costs for your country before  placing an order.\nEach pledge must be shipped to a single delivery address. Unfortunately, we cannot split pledges to ship to multiple addresses.\nCurrency Conversions\nRemember that your pledge is in Canadian Dollars, and your card will be billed in Canadian Dollars when the campaign ends.

Together, Rick Rollz America will shine a spotlight on everything great about tabletop gaming and grow our communities by creating captivating videos that show what everyone else has been missing out on!\nWith Rick at the wheel, The ROAD WARRIORS will go behind the scenes with some of the biggest names in the tabletop industry and see how they\u2019re bringing more games to more people.

There, they will encounter the cosmic horrorthat is taking over the darker side of the forest.\nThe gang does their best to escape from the abandoned house, but in their flight one of their members is snatched.

The last photograph taken shows an absolutely dreadful nature.\nThey quietly return home and begin to prepare the rescue of their kidnapped friend.

The members of the sect cannot allow this enigmatic individual to continue meddling in their affairs.\nThe kids, already equipped and prepared for their mission, go out to confront the cosmic horror.

Ten (10) generic bases will be provided as part of rewards that include a Gameboard-1 unit. Games can also be played with purely digital pieces. \nOur display refresh rate allows fast-paced gameplay with low latency, from multiple contact points, when using physical or digital objects. \nWe've also designed the Gameboard-1 to connect to your personal electronic device for private screen game play or augmented reality applications.\nWIFI and Bluetooth integration allows personal electronic devices to create virtual interactions with the board environment, with or without internet access.\nTo increase screen real estate, the Gameboard-1 can even connect multiple gameboards for a multi-screen gaming experience, using NFC sensors and internal antenna arrays to make wireless connection seamless and fast.\nConnecting multiple Gameboard-1 units is a snap! (This image is a render to illustrate multiple-board functions.)\nGorgeous hardware isn't enough. We're gamers and we know what we want: more games! \nThis campaign will help us finish building a single marketplace that will offer thousands of individual titles a la carte and an optional monthly subscription service for unlimited access to that vast library of games and gaming tools. \nIt's like Netflix for games, including everything from classics like chess and checkers to modern strategy games to interactive and original creations from partner game creators, with networked game play similar to PSN or Xbox Live.\nWe are building partnerships with some of the biggest names in the hobby and gaming industry to create a robust library... and we're excited to reveal more partners over the course of this campaign.  \nWe want anyone to be able to bring their games to the platform. Our open developer SDK means that it is simple for developers to add and update their games in the ever-expanding games library.The Last Gameboard marketplace isn't restricted to board games. Developers can make any game or content they want: from purely digital board games to games that interact with physical pieces, cards, and dice in ways we haven't even imagined yet.\nWe don't take the term \"Partners\" lightly.  We provide GitHub, Architect and Engineer access to help drive innovation and product roadmap.  We are building a community. We are the community.   \nThe Last Gameboard technology is fully compatible with Unity and Unreal.\nThe Developer Edition includes everything you need to start creating your own games, programs, and innovations for this platform.   \nGameboard-1 is beautifully designed from the inside out. It's a sleek console with real world game play informing every element of design. \nWe have our prototype in the lab right now and cannot wait to share the first unit from the manufacturer in the coming weeks!    \nHere are just some of the hardware features we plan to include with every Gameboard-1 unit we ship:\nThe Gameboard-1 is designed with thin edges to maximize playable surface area, chemically strengthened glass and a plastic housing designed for durability.\nThe 1920x1920 LCD display exceeds the specification for high-definition, so that every detail is crisp and clear.\nPlus, at only five pounds, the device remains lightweight and portable. The on-board battery allows up to four hours of game play, so the game can continue by candlelight if the power goes out.\n Two USB-C ports support not only peripheral devices, but with a USB-C to HDMI adapter you can output the contents of the screen to another device, making Gameboard-1 perfect for Twitch and YouTube streamers who want to embed or overlay the game within Wirecast or OBS.\nPlay online with networked play, or download your game and enable the Gameboard-1 local WIFI network to connect private screens and peripherals when offline.\nFour speakers and microphones let sound become an integral part of your game play, while WIFI and Bluetooth connectivity makes syncing with your personal mobile device a breeze.\nAn onboard 64 GB eMMC hard drive stores your key files locally, while a 64-bit CPU and 4GB of RAM keep everything running smoothly on our custom-built The Last Gameboard OS (TLGOS).\nFAMILIES:  From your living room to visiting grandparents, now your entire game library can travel with you. Enjoy a family game with the kids, then stay up late with the latest strategy game.\nGAMERS: Thanks to full compatibility with D20Pro, now included in your subscription, gamemasters can direct the action with every tool available in a multi-player virtual tabletop... on a real tabletop! Interactive maps, combat management, and access to tabletop systems\u2014from Dungeons & Dragons to Pathfinder and beyond\u2014make Gameboard-1 a crucial part of your weekly campaign.\nGAME STORES: Immediately demo many of the games on your shelves for customers, helping to increase sales, then bring out Gameboard-1 again for open game night. Game stores are all about community and The Last Gameboard helps you focus on creating the extraordinary experiences that keep bringing regulars back to the table.\nSTREAMERS: An essential tool for tabletop streamers, Gameboard-1 lets you bring the details straight to your online audience. Forget trying to set up an extra camera above the table and lighting the board properly: now you can display partial or full game AV output right inside your favorite streaming software, while you focus on the interactive play that your audience loves.\nDEVELOPERS: Whether you're adapting your classic board game for TLGOS or creating an innovative new experience that merges tabletop with the unique capabilities of Gameboard-1, you're at the cutting edge of new technology, bringing games to a new generation of gamers.    \nWe've designed Gameboard-1 with the following technical specifications that we intend to meet or exceed in manufacturing:   \nA successful Kickstarter is just the first step in the process of bringing the Gameboard-1 to your door! \nFollowing the Kickstarter we will prepare and launch surveys on BackerKit, where you will be able to manage your pledge, update your shipping address, and where we will charge market prices for shipping and fulfillment. Please DO NOT add money for shipping during the Kickstarter, so that we can keep those costs as accurate as possible for each pledge level prior to shipping.\nWe are excited to use BackerKit for pledge management, where you will be able to select add-ons, update your shipping address, pay fair market prices for shipping, and track the status of your rewards.  \n The initial development of Gameboard-1 was funded thanks to a seed round of private capital, which allowed us to complete design of our prototype and finalize our manufacturing partnerships. Now we're bringing Gameboard-1 to Kickstarter to raise money to fund:\nManufacturing Testing (including beta boards)\nThe Manufacturing Run\nPackaging\nGameboard-1 Case Development\nWith your help we'll be able to transition our product from prototype to retail-ready.\nMost importantly, this limited-edition Kickstarter helps bring together the core community of gamers, streamers, and developers who will receive first access to the Gameboard-1.  \nAbout the Company\nIn 2018, avid hobby gamer Shail Mehta met with hardware guru Rob Wyatt over beer to discuss the fundamental flaw with touchscreen devices: why couldn\u2019t any digital device recognize physical objects for varying shapes and sizes, especially the types of objects that are needed for hobby gaming.\nGameboard-1 was born out of the need to address the analog problems of hobby games while maintaining the essence of why gamers love to play. Gameboard-1 solves the problems of set-up/take down, learning/teaching new games, inability to explore games before buying, games that cannot be easily saved, finding someone to play with and much more.\nIn January 2019, The Last Gameboard, Inc., was formed. They began to establish relationships with game makers all around the world, incorporating both Unity & Unreal to bring the best hobby gaming content to TLG\u2019s upcoming platform.  \nShail Metha - CEO / Co-Founder\nShail has a passion for gaming. When she immigrated to the US in the 90s, Shail encountered a group of children in her apartment that were playing chutes and ladders. Shail, not knowing English, just began to play. The role of gameplay in creating community and fostering human connection has been central to Shail\u2019s work at The Last Gameboard.\nIn her professional life, Shail has a financial background working for hedge funds and venture capital funds. She has consulted for the Nuclear Regulatory Committee, City University of New York, City & County of Denver \u2018s projects, and Triunity Engineering. Has managed teams and executed projects throughout her career. Shail is the driving force for the vision and future for The Last Gameboard.\nRob Wyatt - CTO / Co-Founder\nRob moved from the UK to the US nearly 20 years ago. Known as the \u201cGuru of Hardware\u201d in the industry, Rob loves creating new technologies in gaming and is an avid skydiver. He was the system architect of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox console and went on to work at Playstation, Atari and Magic Leap. Ron owns several patents in AR/VR including a patent on multiple app sparse pixel time warp in AR headsets and processing. He is a visionary, designer and maker of The Last Gameboard\u2019s incredible technology.\n Dustin Hatchett - Business Development\nDustin has been an avid gamer since he first played TSR\u2019s Boot Hill and FASA\u2019s Star Trek RPG in 1983. In his 25 years in the gaming industry, Dustin has managed multiple retail game stores in Denver, Colorado and owns a production company producing live action role-playing games and multiple game conventions. For the past 20 years, he has worked in technical and project management roles for large telecommunications companies.\nDustin will bring his extensive game industry knowledge and background in project management as co-owner of Rocky Mountain Games (a pre-visualization and development company) to The Last Gameboard as Business Development Coordinator.\nMike Horn - Advisor\nMike is a recent inductee into the Pop Culture Hall of Fame who grew up in the collectibles business. After college, his first job was as a buyer for Diamond Comic Distributors, the world\u2019s largest wholesaler of comic books and supplier to thousands of comics and hobby shops. His job was to line up and buy trading cards (initially) and later all licensed merchandise.\nIn 1994, he left Diamond to form his first company, Palisades Marketing. Originally a marketing consulting agency, he evolved it to become a leading manufacturer of licensed collectibles. By 2005, Mike had grown Palisades to nearly $7 Million in annual revenue with 20 full time employees. Afterwards, Mike formed SwagDog and Power Up Factory, two successful ventures in the collectibles industry, before returning to consulting with the formation of Golden Strategic Development in 2019.\n Lys Galati - Marketing\nElysabeth \u201cLys\u201d Galati was seven years old when she finished reading the leather-bound silver foil edition of Frank Miller\u2019s The Dark Knight Returns. Still overwhelmed by the book, her mother asked \u201cLys, your math is getting better. Do you want to come up with the adults and play D&D?\u201d. Nothing was the same after that. A simple game night became an origin story.\nAfter a stint with Diamond Comics doing everything from customer service to buyer, Lys saw a gap in the industry. Lots of incredibly creative people who put their heart and soul into products who often didn\u2019t have the time and (sometimes) skills to promote themselves properly. Sphinx Public Relations started in 2000 and has been an ongoing business ever since. The company was founded on the idea that all geek voices, regardless of budget, deserved a chance at the spotlight.  \nGet Your Project Funded Today!\nADDITIONAL PARTNERS\nBackerKit\nZombie Orpheus Crowdfunding Management\nArrow Electronics\nWant to stay on top of all the latest news about Gameboard-1?

It is a game of urban guerrilla fantasy, and players choose one of three factions.\nThe Gronman Empire is the official power in the city. They have large numbers of soldiers, reinforcements on call at all times, and the legal authority to arrest and imprison their enemies.\nThe Nacaraj is a \u201cshadow army,\u201d made of warriors from the local population who loathe foreign oppressors and foreign gods. They cannot beat their enemies in a full-on war, so they ambush, assassinate, and kidnap the invaders, in the hopes of liberating their homeland.   \nThe Church of Leshnah is a powerful vampiric cult that draws on the inequality in imperial society to recruit new members. Leshnites have used the political turmoil to infest the city and prey on its inhabitants.\nFor a taste of the Gods and Masters, see our free JumpStart, which features seven pregenerated imperial characters and their mission to shut down a black market arms dealer that goes terribly wrong.\nAs of the first update after launch, backers of the Raider level and beyond will have access to the beta of the player's guide and faction guides. It will be missing the cover, table of contents, some of the art, and so forth, but the beta version will be totally playable.\n How is Gods and Masters unique? Do I really need another fantasy game? \nGods and Masters is certainly fantasy, but it was not inspired by pastoral European history or traditional fantasy tropes. We drew our inspiration from the urban guerrilla conflicts of the last century. Dokaro is a city controlled by legionaries, war drakes and winged dragoons instead of riflemen, tanks, and helicopters. But the setting has more in common with the Battle of Fallujah or the Spanish Civil War than any conventional fantasy setting. Dokaro's soldiers, partisans, and religious fanatics are all armed to the teeth and ready to spill blood in their war for control, with civilians caught helplessly in the middle.\nThe faction system provides a totally separate game feel for characters on each side of the conflict. Each faction receives its own gear, Edges, Hindrances, and a host of other unique bonuses. None of the factions will play the same, and each promise their own individual game experience.\nThe natives of Dokaro have an established tradition of necromancy in their culture. They use reanimated creatures and warriors in their struggle for independence.\nThough ferocious and able to turn the tide of a skirmish, drakes and other beast mounts are not easily directed. Beast riders are constantly at risk of losing control of their creatures, and being thrown from their saddles, attacked, or eaten.\nMany game masters want to know how much a new setting will offer to their existing campaigns. Besides the new Edges, Hindrances, and gear, the following features and mechanics from Gods and Masters will be especially useful in many Savage Worlds settings:\nInterrogation Rules\nThe Interrogation mechanic provides a means for player characters to extract information from NPCs. While the skills of the interrogator are paramount, there is no surefire way to guarantee that all the information they get is totally reliable. \nLikewise, player characters who are imprisoned and facing interrogation will have to rely on their iron will to keep from breaking an spilling their secrets. However, clever characters have at least a small chance of giving some false information to their captors. \nDramatic Stealth\nDramatic Stealth is a subsystem in the same vein as Dramatic Tasks or the Chase Rules from Savage Worlds. Dramatic Stealth provides characters with a mechanic for sneaking around heavily guarded areas, in order to infiltrate enemy bases, assassinate foes, or abduct hostages. As the heroes slither through the shadows, any careless or clumsy actions can raise the alertness of the nearby guards, and eventually lead to some characters losing their cover and being attacked by swarms of enemies. \nElemental Magic\nThe elemental magic system of G&M provides mages with a selection of elements with which to imbue their powers. Each as its own power modifiers, providing some advantages and disadvantages in different tactical situations. \nArcane Background (Occult)\nG&M includes three faction-specific arcane backgrounds. The most unique and generally applicable for other settings is the Arcane Background (Occult). The occult is far more accessible and powerful than other magical paths. It requires no special bloodline, nor do characters need to follow a moral path. This black magic is fueled by incalculably old beings with no care for petty human constructs  such as morality. As long as their devotees are willing to pay for their power with sacrifices, the ancient masters are happy to oblige. \nMost of Gods and Masters is set in the urban environments of Dokaro. Nonetheless, PCs will encounter some of the savage creatures that inhabit the surrounding jungles from time to time.\n Why are we using Savage Worlds?  \nSavage Worlds is the best rule system for Gods and Masters. It allows for fast, dynamic combat, and unique non-combat situations and encounters. The rules are streamlined enough for game masters to improvise and create their own scenarios and encounters without getting bogged down in stats and figures, but crunchy enough to give tactical gamers an interesting challenge, all while keeping the story moving.\nGods and Masters is compatible with the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition, the newest version of the Savage Worlds rules. The creators have been playing Savage Worlds for over a decade, and understand the rules well. And since it was designed from the ground up with this rule system in mind, there will be no clunky translations from other systems.\nThis game references the Savage Worlds game system, available from Pinnacle Entertainment Group at www.peginc.com.

Thompson walks through some of the main features of G&M in the following video: \nAfter the Kickstarter campaign is concluded and the book is finished, Gods and Masters will be sold online through DriveThruRPG.com, as a PDF and in hard copies with the print-on-demand option. The setting includes the following features:\nFull color layout and artwork \nAn expanded gear list that makes fights more strategic and tactical\nA new playable species, the reptilian anir, divided into three races\nFire, Earth, and Water Anir are the gods' favored creations, blessed with longevity, natural weapons, and elemental immunities. It is only through the benevolence of their rulers, the immortal Elders, that humans have been granted equal legal standing.\nFive species of exotic beast mounts (with multiple subspecies), from the burrowing Sandsquirmer drake to the nimble Demonhorn kirin\nSetting rules for Interrogation and Dramatic Stealth\nAn expanded list of power modifiers, to give each form of elemental magic its own unique kicks and limitations\nThree playable factions, each with their own Advantages, Disadvantages, unique gear, Arcane Background, and goals, providing a totally individual game play experience for each side of the Dokaran conflict\nVarious sections of the book are emblazoned with a color-coded banner on the right page for easy reference. The general parts of the Player's Guide and Master's Guide are brown, while the Faction sections and Savage Tales sport red for the Imperials, green for the Nacarajin, and purple for the Leshnites. Even the sidebars and tables are colored to match.\nA full set of Edges and Hindrances for the Corruption, a disease that can gradually turn mundane humans into predatory vampires\nTen gritty Savage Tales, at least six of which are compatible with each faction\nThe Master\u2019s Challenge: An optional difficulty mode for experienced and tactically-minded players\nAn adventure generator and reputation system that rewards character success and punishes failure with a variety of social and legal consequences\nA bestiary with a dozen creatures that infest the wilds around Dokaro\nA selection of NPCs, providing plenty of enemies for every faction to fight\nA Rogue\u2019s Gallery of heroes and villains in each faction\nThe beta version of  the Gods and Masters Player's Guide is already complete. This includes the text, art, proofreading, and layout. A little bit of the art still needs to be colored and the table of contents still needs formatting, but that is the only thing holding us back from releasing the final version. Backers of the Raider level or higher will gain access to the beta Player's Guide (which includes the Faction Guides), during the first couple days after campaign launch. The Master's Guide still needs a little bit more work, but should be perfectly presentable and playable by the end of the Kickstarter campaign, if not completely finished. \nAfter our crowdfunding campaign is over, we will immediately release the full beta version in PDF (the combined Player's Guide, Faction Guides, and Master's Guide). Once the artists are finished coloring everything (and inserting any artwork for backer rewards or stretch goals), we will update our product and give a link to the completed version. This is also when we will place the product on sale at DriveThruRPG for general customers.

We will be releasing the beta of the full PDF to all our backers within a couple of days after the Kickstarter payment clears.\n\nWe will spend a month after release updating any flaws that we missed during the editing process, and responding to customer feedback. Roughly one to three months after the crowdfunding is over, we will release the final, updated PDF to all our backers, and put it on DriveThruRPG for retail sale.\n\nBarring the untimely deaths of several of our project creators, this book will come out very soon. We have contingency plans for just that occasion, too.\n\nThe only real challenges we could potentially face are in meeting the stretch goals.

They handcraft twenty-sided dice, build their own campaigns from scratch, even wage legal battles against the United States prison system to assert their right to play.\nFor decades, role-playing games like D&D and Pathfinder have been banned in many United States prisons. Some wardens claim these games are demonic and foster fantasies of escape.\nYet even when books and dice are banned, incarcerated players have found creative workarounds. They band together to battle monsters and overcome obstacles, in virtual worlds as well as real life.\nInmates say these games are rehabilitative and are helping them prepare for life on the outside.  Recent research studies agree: Cooperative gaming builds skills like teamwork, critical thinking, and creativity.  Even more importantly, games like D&D bridge racial divides. In California, the gaming table is one of the only places where prisoners of different races and gang affiliations set aside their differences to do something cooperatively.\nLET'S PLAY is told primarily from the perspective of inmates who have waged legal battles for the right to engage in gaming rehab. Some lost; others--like Kevin--changed the system forever.\nHandmade prison D20\nFor eight years, Kevin battled the California Department of Corrections. It all started when he returned to his cell to discover that his gaming materials had disappeared, including hundreds of pages of handwritten campaigns and elaborate maps that adorned his cell from floor-to-ceiling. \nDuring Kevin's jury trial, the legendary creator of Dungeons & Dragons, Gary Gygax himself, flew out to testify on his behalf.\nExcerpt from Gary Gygax's letter to Kevin after the trial.\nThanks to Kevin's lawsuit, role-playing games are now an official activity at several California prisons. But the battle is not yet over. Though Kevin won the lawsuit and the right to play, his novels, maps, and campaigns were never returned to him. Do they still exist in the basement of some courthouse? We want to find out.\nThrough the story of the lawsuit and the players, like Kevin, who were impacted by it, LET\u2019S PLAY aims to get to the root of the national controversy around role-playing games in America\u2019s prisons and explore philosophical questions around inmates rights, the rehabilitative potential of role-playing games, and the purpose of the criminal justice system.\nFinally, LET'S PLAY is a film about perspective and identity\u2026 about using role-playing to see the world through the perspective of different characters and building empathy.\n                                                                           >>>-<<<\nPERSPECTIVES FROM THE PLAYERS ON WHY ROLE-PLAYING GAMES ARE SO IMPORTANT IN PRISON...\n\"We were hardcore. We\u2019d play from soon as we got back from breakfast to lockup. Saturday or Sunday\u2014all day long.\" - Mark, former inmate, California \n\"We used to run underground games with no books or anything. It was pretty L33t.\" - Melvin, Inmate, Colorado\n\"Rehabilitation in the Department of Corrections is structured in a way that gives no alternatives. Not everybody is built the same. Dungeons & Dragons is my rehabilitation that I can deal with to escape into my own reality to solve my own problems.\" - Aaron, former inmate, Colorado\n\"Our rules are no evil characters, no leaving the team behind. Selfish players will usually die.\" - Carlos, Inmate, California\n\"Prisons are the most segregated places in the world. The D&D table is one of the few places where you can have blacks and whites playing together without fear of reprisal.\" - Jared, Founder, Prisoner Reentry Network\n\"It became more than just Dungeons & Dragons at that point. It started that way, but it became about the first amendment in prisons.\" - Kevin, former inmate, California\n                                                                        >>>-<<<\nA.K.A... HOW MY CAREER DEVELOPING CRIME SHOWS CAME TO INTERSECT WITH MY LOVE OF D&D\nThe creator and brainchild of LET'S PLAY, Elisabeth de Kleer, brings to the table(top) over ten years of production experience in the 'true crime' genre. While directing shows for CBS, Netflix, National Geographic, the BBC, VICE, and the Discovery Channel, Elisabeth has interviewed hundreds of inmates in prisons across the united states.\nAn interview at a maximum security prison in Texas.\nWhen not investigating cold cases or interviewing inmates, Elisabeth can be found at the gaming table or writing articles about the rehabilitative impact of role-playing. Some of you may have already come across one of her articles in VICE:\nDragons in the Department of Corrections\nHow Inmates Play Tabletop RPG's in Prison where Dice are Contraband\nOr the following award-winning documentary she produced for VICE in 2017 about a couple cellmates in Colorado who played together both inside and outside of prison.\nElisabeth has also partnered with a San Francisco-based organization called the Prisoner Reentery Network that is using gaming as tool to help recently-released inmates reintegrate into society. This is where she met Kevin and uncovered the story of his lawsuit against the Department of Corrections. \nA beautiful piece that was filmed by ABC News on this group.\nHowever, while her articles and short film have brought attention to the topic, Elisabeth believes a longer form documentary is the best way to do justice to this controversial topic.\nOver the last couple years, Elisabeth and her team have filmed dozens of interviews with inmates and former inmates who have played role-playing games at prisons across the country. So far this film has been self-funded, which is why we need your support. Here are some of the ways your money will be used to help us finish the film:\n Fees for accessing and copying legal materials related to D&D cases. This will allow us to take a deep dive into some of the most interesting lawsuits, like Kevin's, and attempt to  track down the gaming materials that were confiscated from him.\n Cost of putting together a professional camera crew so we can film gaming groups inside prison. (We've already done the most difficult part, which is getting soft approval to film in the first place. Now we just need funding to make the most of this special opportunity.)\n Funds for hiring an animator to breathe life into hand-drawn inmate fantasy art and to create a visual style for the film. The art will be used to illustrate the story in a way that weaves together magical elements with real life. For example, the warden of the prison might be depicted as a dragon or \u201cboss\u201d and the prison itself, a dragon\u2019s lair. These visual intersections of gameplay and real life show how the game becomes a platform to express and explore their inner struggles and demons.\nCreating a marketing and distribution plan that will promote both the film as well as recreational therapy behind bars.\nWith $60,000, we believe we can create a short film that takes a deep dive into one of the most interesting prisoner rights cases in history, but it will be tight. Each additional dollar we raise makes it possible to include additional content and improve the production quality of the film so that it can compete against the Hollywood heavy-hitters at film festivals around the world. If necessary, film grants (which are very difficult to obtain during pre-production but much easier when the film is nearing completion) are also an option we're considering for down the road if expenses surpass the money we raise through crowdfunding.\nTo bring this project to life, we've put together an awesome team of filmmakers, gamers, and experts.\nAnd we're partnering with the following organizations...\n Hawke Robinson, a Department of Health Registered Recreational Therapist, founder of RPG Therapeutics LLC http://www.rpgtherapy.com/ and RPG Research  https://www.rpgresearch.com/, uses role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, Doctor Who, No Thank You Evil, and others as tools for rehabilitation.  He has been researching the effects of RPGs on participants since around 1985, and developing programs using RPGs in all formats (tabletop, LARP, computer-based, and solo) to achieve educational and therapeutic goals for various populations since 2004. When he's not lecturing and teaching workshops on gaming-as-therapy, you can find Hawke driving around the country in an RPG gaming bus.\nHawke Robinson will serve as an on-camera expert and advisor to the film.\nThe Prisoner Reentry Network, founded by attorney Jared Rudolph, is an Oakland-based nonprofit that supports successful transitions from incarceration to the community. Jared works as a trial lawyer at the San Francisco Office of the Public Defender, and regularly speaks about mass incarceration and its history. Every other weekend, he runs a Dungeons & Dragons game called \u201cSecond Life\u201d to help recently released inmates build community and reintegrate into society.\nJared Rudolph and the Prisoner Reentry Network will be featured on-camera, and Jared Rudolph will serve as a criminal justice advisor to the film.\nA PRN-facilitated \"Second Life\" game in San Francisco.\nKanaka Endeavors is a 2D20 gaming system developed by Danny, an inmate in the California Department of Corrections. Danny has been testing the system with his gaming group behind bars as well as players on the outside and hopes to roll it out when he's released from prison in 2019. \nDanny will be featured on-camera and Kanaka Endeavors will help fulfill some of the crowdfunding rewards.\nDanny and the other D&D players pictured in an article entitled \"Nerds United\" that Danny wrote for the prison newspaper.\nMusic for the Kickstarter video was provided by: https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music \nFINALLY...\nIf you can't help us monetarily, please help us by spreading the word through social media. The more people know about this documentary, the better we can get the word out about the rehabilitative potential of role-playing games in prison.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy far, our biggest hurdle is getting on-going access to film games behind bars.\n\nGetting IN to prison is harder than one might expect. Both state and federal facilities have extensive rules for media visits. Additional staff must be brought in to accompany the production crew. Some states prohibit cameras entirely.\n\nFortunately, Elisabeth de Kleer has extensive experience navigating prison media rules. Over the last 10 years, she has filmed at dozens of maximum security prisons around the country (primarily for Discovery Channel shows) and developed relationships with the administrative staff that approve filming requests.\n\nWhile we've received soft permission to film games we've been following at a couple different prisons, where we ultimately film will depend on how much access we are given. The ideal scenario would be one where we'd film a game over the course of many months, following the trials and tribulations of the inmates both as characters inside the game and in real life. To do that, we need to show the administrators that we have enough of an audience to warrant the additional time and effort on their end to host us, as well as to pay our professional film crew for their time.\n\nPut simply, the more backers and funding we have, the better our chances of getting prolonged access to some of the subjects of our film.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Kleer Creative\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nKleer Creative was founded by Elisabeth de Kleer, an award-winning documentary filmmaker with expertise in interviewing and crafting...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Public Shout Out", "descp": "Welcome to the game!

While the love this project has received has been inspiring, we've raised only half of what we'd need to carry it out. Our chances of being funded are very slim indeed.\nAfter much reflection and several consultations with crowdfunding experts, we've come to realize that the campaign would have had a better chance of succeeding with more pre-launch promotion and a stronger social media presence. A couple naysayers have also told us the topic is too 'niche' to capture the attention of a large audience. We don't agree. The themes of empathy, identity, and the purpose of the criminal justice system affect all of us, whether we are amongst the estimated , or not. We believe that if we retool the campaign, double-down on the pre-launch promotion, and build our social media presence, we can easily blow past the $60K minimum to bring this worthy documentary to fruition. In other words, we want to leave the doors open for the possibility of a relaunch."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "The Nail-Biting Final Week", "update_content": "I've tried not to bombard you with loads of updates, but it's the final nail-biting week of the campaign and we wanted to let you know what we've been up to.

New and perspective players tend to feel overwhelmed by an hour long video and those looking to just brush up on a single mechanic don't want to sit through an entire explanation of the system in hopes of a video covering what they need.  Games like Dungeons & Dragons have seen growth by leaps and bounds thanks to embracing multiple forms of education will well produced, highly polished, and easily digestible online educational content. Savage Worlds for Beginners aims to do the same and will be a 15 episode series designed both for new players and those looking to brush up on less used rules.  Each episode will only be 10-15 minutes and cover a very specific portion of the rules such as chases or social conflicts.  Backers to our Kickstarter will get access to exclusive items as well as the ability to purchase the entire season for download to view online, offline, or even share with curious gamers.  Together we hope to help the Savage Worlds community grow even larger and bring even more new players and GMs into the fold while also providing a useful tool for those that might need to brush up from time to time. \nLearn Savage Worlds, One Video at a Time\nIf you're new to the Savage Worlds game system, or just looking to brush up on a few rules, this is the Kickstarter for you! Our goal is to produce a 15 episode series of 10-15 minute episodes, each dedicated to a different aspect of learning the Savage Worlds sysyem. The thing is, proper production isn't cheap, and if we want something worth sharing all over the community to get even more people interested in playing, we need to have the professional polish the gaming community has come to expect!\n\n\"This game references the Savage Worlds game system, available from Pinnacle Entertainment Group at www.peginc.com.

Plus, you might just need a refresher on how chases work, or have a friend that wants to try out the game before investing the time and money on a book. Short videos have been proven to be a great tool for not only teaching the rules, but also spreading the popularity of a game.\nTabletop RPGs have a long history of being taught to new players by one experienced player, or the GM. The thing is\u2026the biggest obstacle to growth of the hobby is a prospect player not having a friend that already knows the game. The hurdles to learn a game on your own are often just too much to handle. The explosion of already popular games such as Dungeons & Dragons owe a lot to the online communities that make easily accessible videos that teach only what a new player might need at any given time. This project aims to provide that same experience for Savage Worlds players, which currently is severely lacking.\nNow that you know why making tutorial videos is important, you're probably wondering who we are and why WE should be the ones to do it.\nIf you are not familiar with our work, we are the people behind the YouTube channel known as The GM Table. In addition to making podcasts dedicated to Savage Worlds (such as SWADEcast), we also have been the first to break major news for the system, like when the writer of Savage Worlds, Shane Hensley, gave us an exclusive interview detailing many of  the products coming in the next year.  Our channel is already a trusted authority within the Savage Worlds community, with working relationships with many Savage publishers\n We also have done this before, with great success. When The GM Table first premiered, we had a show titled \u201cLet's Run Savage Worlds\u201d, which became the primary source for many new players to learn the system. But, having just started out, and not having any equipment, the quality wasn't always great. \nWith the new edition of Savage Worlds coming out, we thought this would be the perfect time for a new take on learning Savage Worlds. Just as the new Adventure Edition took 15 years of experience, we're putting our experience to use and completely start from scratch on a polished, professional series. We currently have 15 episodes planned for our first season of \u201cSavage Worlds for Beginners\u201d. These are arranged to, step by step, introduce players into everything they might need to know to play a game. Starting with only the rules you\u2019lol need to know if you\u2019re given a pre-generated characters in a one-shot or con game, before advancing into the basics of character creation. We'll round everything off with the Chases Tutorial that more experienced players have been asking for for a long time. \n We currently have 15 episodes planned for our first season of \u201cSavage Worlds for Beginners\u201d. These are arranged to, step by step, introduce players into everything they might need to know to play a game. We supply pre-generated characters so players can feel comfortable playing in a one-shot or con game, before advancing into the basics of character creation. We'll round everything off with the Chases Tutorial that more experienced players have been asking for for a long time. \n\nEpisode List:\nEpisode 1: Savage Worlds Introduction: Will introduce the series to new viewers, give viewers an idea of what they will come to learn in the coming episodes, explain why Savage Worlds might be right for you, and introduce many of the characters in the series.\nEpisode 2: Getting Wild: In this episode, we will break down the basics of dice in Savage Worlds including TN4, the \u201cWild Die\u201d, and \u201cAcing\u201d.\nEpisode 3: Your Attributes & You: In this episode we delve deeper into the different attribute scores, as well as the concept of dice size as level of ability.\nEpisode 4: Hard Core Skills: In this episode we will take the time to look at each of the different Core Skills and their uses.\nEpisode 5: One Roll to Rule Them All: In this episode we will start teaching the system in practice, with the Quick Encounter rules, including dangerous encounters, staged encounters, and networking.\nEpisode 6: Getting Social: In this episode we will discuss how social skills are used in Savage Worlds, as well as how Social Conflicts work.\nEpisode 7: Don't be Dramatic: In this episode we break down dramatic tasks and their many uses.\nEpisode 8: Wanna Fight About It?: In this episode we cover the basics of combat in Savage Worlds for initiative, parry, range, cover, tests and movement.\nEpisode 9: I've Been Hit: In this episode we cover the second half of combat, specifically taking damage, soaking, and wounds.\nEpisode 10: Patch It Up : In this episode we cover the basics of healing including the golden hour, healing checks, injuries, and walking wounded.\nEpisode 11: Powered Up: In this episode we cover the basics of powers, including arcane backgrounds, power points, and casting modifiers.\nEpisode 12: Watch for Hazards: In this episode we cover the many hazards in Savage Worlds as well as Fatigue.\nEpisode 13: It Builds Character: In this episode we begin looking at character creation with edges and hindrances.\nEpisode 14: My First character: In this episode we wrap up character creation with a step by step \"Quick Character Process\" that is designed to help new players not feel overwhelmed. \nEpisode 15: Catch Me if You Can: In our Season Finale, we cover everything you need to know about the Chase rules. \n\nWe hope that, at this point, we\u2019ve piqued your interest in seeing our series dedicated to teaching Savage Worlds get made. In all honesty, we could make this series at a kitchen table with a cheap webcam and get the basic information across, but to really help Savage Worlds grow and spread, a professional looking product will go much further outside of our existing community. \nThe problem is a professional product has professional costs including gear, a crew, and most importantly, insurance.  Below is a basic breakdown of the bare minimum costs to hire the services of a small crew, rent gear, and more.\nMinimum Production Costs\nSkeleton Crew: $1,000* \nProduction Gear & Location Fees: $1,000*\nPost Production: $2,000\nArtist Fees: $500\nKickstarter, Website, & Swag Fulfillment: $1,000\nTotal: $5,000\n*This cost is literally calling in favors and friendships while working off the books with personal, but professional, gear.\nAs you can see, even a small production adds up fast and this is the main reason we are doing this Kickstarter. While these videos will be free on YouTube for anyone in the gaming community to see, and we could run ads on them\u2026we'll likely be dead of old age before we would even break even. Let alone being able to pay for everything up front!\n\nIt's a lot to ask to help fund something that anyone in the community will be able to see online for free once it's finished. That's why we are doing our best to offer some exclusive items only available to those that helped support this season.\nThe Wylde Button*: Show off your Savage Worlds support with a button of our mascot, \u201cWylde the Wild Die\u201d!\n\nThe Wylde Tote*: We've done buttons for special guests and giveaways before, but never have we done a canvas tote bag. Big enough to carry all the essentials to your game table.\n* Notice: As of right now, all physical rewards have shipping included for US backers  We are currently calculating the best costs for international backers.\n In addition to the 15 planned episodes we have options to either unlock or flat out purchase additional episodes called Crash Courses. When Savage Worlds Adventure Edition was first revealed, we created three episodes in an attempt to show off the basics of the system. Learning from that experience, we were able to plot out the 15 episode season that would actually do the system justice. But, we also realized that the crash course format could be best used to introduce players and GMs to different savage settings. In less than 15 minutes we will run down the basic pitch for a setting, what makes it special, and any key rules specific to that setting, all in the same style and humor of the core series. As you\u2019ll see in the Stretch Goals below, we already have plans to feature  Deadlands and ETU in their own episodes, but we hope to unlock even more. \n We want every penny we raise to go straight into making Savage Worlds content and experiences for the community. With that in mind,we have already plotted out some exciting stretch goals if we exceed our $5,500 goal. \nAt $6,000 we will be able to get more props and, yes, even puppets for our episodes to add even more fun and humor to each episode.\nAt $7,000 we will make a Crash Course episode dedicated to the East Texas University setting.\nAt $8,000 we will also make a Crash Course episode dedicated to the flagship setting for Savage Worlds, Deadlands!\nAt $9,000 we can upgrade our crew and pay them their actual fees, not the costs they are charging for being friends from college, as well as go through the proper channels to rent better gear and insure all of it properly. \nAt $10,000 we will take the crew to Genghis Con and have a \u201cThe GM Table\u201d booth, where we will be giving out free swag to fans, as well as running Savage Worlds games specifically to teach people the system.\nAt $12,000 we will produce a documentary covering the history of Savage Worlds, it's impact on the gaming culture, and interviews with many people in the industry about their experiences with the system.\nAt $14,000\u2026in addition to Genghis Con, the \u201dThe GM Table\u201d crew will also get a booth at ChupacabraCon, with even more free swag and tutorial games!\nStarting at $15,000 and every thousand after we will produce another Crash Course episode, and will let backers vote on the setting!

Be sure to watch the \"Upcoming Events\" section above as well as our social media channels to make sure you don't miss a thing! \nSHIPPING\nIMPORTANT: WE CHARGE FOR SHIPPING AFTER THE CAMPAIGN IN BACKERKIT, NOT IN KICKSTARTER.\nDo NOT add shipping fees to your pledge now. \nAnything that you pledge over the cost of a reward level will not count as credit in BackerKit and will go directly to the JourneyQuest 4 production. Only give more than a pledge level if you want us to spend your additional contributions making JourneyQuest 4 even more awesome.\nFULFILLMENT\nThe JourneyQuest 4 campaign will be fulfilled by our partners at Ship Naked, who maintain shipping depots in the United States, Canada, Germany, and Australia. Barring circumstances outside our control (like tariffs or trade wars) we will fulfill physical rewards from those depots.\n What will shipping cost in BackerKit?\n International Backers: expect to pay around $7.75 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\n United States Backers: expect to pay around $5.75 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\nAll shipping estimates are subject to change but will reflect the best market rates we can find when fulfillment begins.\nJourneyQuest is created by an ever-growing team of talented and passionate actors, producers, crew, and support staff. Together, we've not only produced three seasons of JourneyQuest, but the ongoing Gamers series, Dark Dungeons, Demon Hunters, Attacking the Darkness, Strowlers, and much more. \nWhile our budgets are still a fraction of what Hollywood spends, doing it right means taking care of our cast and crew. Your support is what lets us keep telling original stories that you can't find anywhere else!\nWe are excited to shoot this season in British Columbia with talented Canadian director Joanna Gaskell, the co-creator of Standard Action.\nShowrunner and writer Matt Vancil has once again lent his talents to a hilarious season four script and will oversee production.\nProducer Tony Becerra returns to oversee production. He is joined by Mike Waverecan, a producer from M1 Films. M1 Films joins Zombie Orpheus for production of this season.\nSocial media coordinator Lee House will add his considerable talents to spreading the word about this campaign far and wide.\nOf course, it wouldn't be JourneyQuest without our phenomenal cast. This season we're thrilled to bring back Christian Doyle (Perf), Alyssa Kay (Nara), Fran Kranz (Silver Tom), Kevin Pitman (Glorion), Brian Lewis (Carrow), Emille Shimkus (Wren), Jesse Lee Keeter (Rilk), Bob Sapp (Karn), Samara Lerman (Assassin), and many more! \nZombie Orpheus Entertainment is pleased to team up with The Fantasy Network, a fan-supported, creator-distributed streaming service, to broadcast every JourneyQuest episode. In addition to works from Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, The Fantasy Network distributes original programming from Arrowstorm Entertainment (Mythica), The Forge Studios (The Rangers), Recursor.tv (Nina Unlocked) as well as numerous independent producers (AFK, One Hit Die, Ren the Girl With the Mark). While many titles are available on The Fantasy Network for free, your pledge of $10 or more unlocks one month of Fantasy Network subscriber-exclusive access.\nWe will be using BackerKit for pledge management after the campaign. A BackerKit survey will be sent to all backers several months after the Kickstarter campaign has completed. You will be able to update your address, add shipping fees and shop our pre-order store for any additional items from our back catalog that you would like to add to your shipment. \nOur shipping partners at Ship Naked will be handling warehousing and shipping for our campaign from their warehouse in the US. If we have a sufficient number of international backers, we will utilize their warehouses in Canada, Germany and Australia as well.\nWorld of Fartherall is available for your storytelling and art under ZOE's new Shared Cinematic Universe License Agreement (the SCULA).\nWhat does this mean?\nIt's like the Open Gaming License and Creative Commons had little license babies: it's an agreement that gives you permission to create, adapt, and release your own derivative works within the world of Fartherall!\nCheck out the web page for the full details, but the fast and dirty summary is that as long as you abide by the terms of the agreement, you have the freedom to create non-commercial AND commercial Fartherall derivatives. Make a roleplaying game. Shoot a web series. Create your art. Sell it if you want. Or give it away. It's your choice.\nYou, the fans, have made these works possible and this new agreement helps us give back. Come and play, you're invited!\nJust remember to Share Alike, Transform (don't copy), provide accurate Attribution, and don't break the law.\nPlus, if you want your creations to become a canon part of the world, we offer a path to make them official. And a cool seal. It's pretty awesome. \nZOE and JourneyQuest are committed to cultivating healthy, inclusive communities where everyone is welcome. We extend that mission to improving representation both on screen and behind the camera. We're stronger when we work together to achieve common goals!\nWe welcome fans old and new to the community that will come together during this Kickstarter campaign and remind everyone that hate speech is not tolerated in this space. \nOur moderators are trained to help if you experience harassment in any ZOE-managed social arena. If we happen to miss it when it happens, please don't hesitate to reach out and let us know, so that we can take action to resolve the issue.\nWe are always happy to assist! If you have a question that was not answered here, please send us a message through Kickstarter or via the contact form at zombieorpheus.com.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we work hard to mitigate our risks, the unforeseen can always throw a curve ball. Sometimes we have to recast a role at the last minute. Sometimes we have to redo work in post if it doesn't meet our standards. Sometimes product gets delayed at the manufacturer. And any time international travel is involved, we have to be prepared to adapt and adjust with circumstances outside our control. But with a nine-year track record of crowdfunding success at Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, our reputation should speak for itself. \n\nAdditionally, we now have excellent relationships with manufacturers, our fulfillment partners at Ship Naked, the team at BackerKit, and everyone else who's part of making sure that our campaigns are completed to your satisfaction. \n\nOur pledge to you is that we will always do our utmost to deliver on our commitment to excellence.\n\nNOTE: We have budgeted for rewards and production based on current treaties, exchange rates, and tariffs. Given political volatility in the USA and elsewhere, we want to make special note that our plans may require significant revision should domestic or global turbulence affect the production of JourneyQuest Season Four.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Tip Jar", "descp": "Receive access to backer-only updates and the post-campaign BackerKit store.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["197 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Stream it First!", "descp": "Stream JourneyQuest Season 4 when it premieres on The Fantasy Network with a one-month subscription.

It's been completely rebuilt from the ground up in Unity. Read on to find out what this all means and why we are excited for this project.\nFantasy Grounds is a popular system for playing a host of different roleplaying games online.  It is used by more than 130,000 gamers worldwide to connect and play popular games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, and more.  This type of program is commonly referred to as a virtual tabletop, or VTT, due to their ability to emulate various part of an RPG session in a digital form.\nWhat makes Fantasy Grounds different than competitors is how we expose character sheets and automate large portions of gameplay specifically for each system we support.  This is done through rulesets.  Your experience playing Deadlands Reloaded will differ from D&D and will be unique to that environment, contain custom graphics, character sheets, and automation specific to that game system.  \nOne feature shared across most game systems is maps.  Some may use hexes while others use square grids and some may not use grids at all.  Facing is important in some and less so in others.  While FG has featured maps for many years, they have been primarily focused as reproductions of maps in existing adventure modules from our many licensed publishers. We believe that we can enhance these to provide dynamic line of sight, fog of war, and even map building support with painting and tiles.\nWhat you get for backing this project will be a license for Fantasy Grounds Unity (or FGU). This new game engine has all the great features of current version of Fantasy Grounds (soon to be called Fantasy Grounds Classic) along with new enhanced features. \nOriginal Features Supported:\nMultiplayer support for playing tabletop games of Dungeons & Dragons (2E, 3.5E, 4E and 5E), Pathfinder RPG 1, Pathfinder RPG 2, Starfinder.\nBuilt-in content for D&D 3.5E, 5E and Pathfinder 1\nOfficially licensed add-on content available for D&D, D&D Classics (2E), Pathfinder, Starfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, Basic Roleplaying, Castles & Crusades, Mutants & Masterminds, 13th Age, W.O.I.N., Traveller, and Rolemaster Classic\nGeneric system support through our CoreRPG ruleset\nBrilliant Campaign Management\nIntegrated character sheets with lots of automation built in for playing and leveling (depending on ruleset and content owned)\nCombat Tracking\n3D dice\nFantasy Grounds Unity Enhanced Features Include:\n64-bit support to allow for more content (quality and quantity)\nNative support for Mac, Linux and Windows PC\nNetwork lobby for easy hosting and joining of games (no port forwarding required)\nTile based map building\nEnhanced Drawing Tools\nAdditional Dice Macros support\nA new FGU only skin\nDynamic Line of Sight with enhanced toggle blockers\nPaint with images, such as walls\nAnimated image effects\nBackward compatibility with all existing campaigns and DLC from FGC\nIn addition to these features, we are now poised to add even greater functionality going forward. We have lots of ideas for new features and this rebuilt engine will make it easier for us reach those goals and deliver consistent updates for free. \nTile based Map Building\nDynamic Line of Sight (LOS) and Fog of War (FOW)\nLine of Sight - Doors and Terrain\nMap Fx Layers\n New Grid Options\nAdvanced Dice Expression Support\nWe have already devoted over 4 years and 10,000 developer hours to this project. Any funds raised will help us push it over the edge and begin work on new features and functionality. If the project does exceptionally well, this may even allow us to add even more resources to the team.\nWe have over 1200 existing DLC and add-ons. Our goal is to prioritize these by popularity and work on enhancing as many of these as we can. Without enhancements, they will continue to function as they always have in Fantasy Grounds Classic. You will be able to add dynamic line of sight to maps and begin using the new features straight away. As we work through this large back catalog of DLC, we will do all the enhancement and upgrade work for you so you can just load it up and begin using the advanced features without having to define any Line of Sight blockers yourself. \nLink: www.fantasygrounds.com\nGreat! We anticipate that a large number of our backers will already be fans and users of our software. For you, we have added discounted Upgrade tiers available to get you up and running on the new engine as soon as possible. A lot of the time spent building the new engine was devoted towards making sure that everything you've already bought or created will continue to work in FGU. The only difference is that now you will be able to further enhance them.\nOver time, we will begin going through older products and enhancing them for you. Just look for the Update Available button to light up and stay tuned to our newsletter for regular updates on which products have been newly Enhanced. \nWhich Upgrade option do I choose?\nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license in 2018 or 2019, then pick the Rookie Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate. \nIf you bought your 1-time purchase license before 2018, then choose the Veteran Upgrade for the license type you own: Standard or Ultimate.\nIf you are on a subscription, then you will be able to subscribe to the new version once it is released on the store. If you want Beta or Alpha access, then you would need to get a Newcomer tier option on the Kickstarter. \nHow do I upgrade multiple license keys?\nIf your account has multiple license keys, it is possible that some of them are newer and some are older. Pick the tier that best fits your main license key that you personally use and then increase your pledge level for each additional license you have based on the age of that license.  Our survey system and fulfillment will allow some corrections there later on and we can always help on a case-by-case basis through our support email at the time of fulfillment.\nDo I need to pay a subscription going forward?\nOur newcomer tiers are 1-time purchase licenses for Fantasy Grounds Unity. No further subscription is required. If you had a subscription to Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may want to maintain that as long as you want to continue using that version. \nYes, Fantasy Grounds Classic will remain a viable product for many years to come. While the data is backward compatible, we chose to separate the data paths for FGU and FG Classic so that changes to one won't be reflected in the other. You can copy campaigns over to FGU to try things out there and maintain your original copy back on Fantasy Grounds Classic. \nOver time, we expect most users will migrate fully to FGU.\nDo I get access to Fantasy Grounds Classic if I buy Fantasy Grounds Unity?\nNo. If you already have a license or subscription, then you can continue to use that. The licenses will be different even though they share the same add-ons. \nStandard licenses can host or play in a game with other licensed users. An Ultimate license allows the GM to host a game for any number of players and those players can use a free Demo license of Fantasy Grounds. Initial copies will go out to backers only, but we will try to  send out the demo license links to backers at some point prior to launch so those can be shared with players for your game.\nWe have over 1200 DLC items available -- an entire gaming bookstore worth of games. It's too much to feature in the Kickstarter, but we have a select list of bundles below that you can choose from when we send out the backer surveys. Just increase your pledge amount for the add-ons you want from the list below. \nAlso -- Anything you already own on your account at fantasygrounds.com will continue to work with FGU, so you won't have to re-buy any of those. In fact, you can go shopping at fantasygrounds.com if you see anything on sale there during or after the Kickstarter and those items will unlock automatically for your account once you gain access to FGU during the Alpha or Beta.\nWhat if I bought my add-ons from Steam?\nYou will be able to use those in both versions: Fantasy Grounds Classic and Fantasy Grounds Unity. Our system will know what purchases you have made from either location. \n*Note: We have some unknowns about how the Steam Store will reflect purchases across the two versions of Fantasy Grounds. If you bought bundle items on Fantasy Grounds Classic, you may need to buy new additions to the bundle there instead of on the new FGU store page on Steam.  \n\nNew portraits commissioned from the Ultimate Gamemaster level by amazing avatar artist, Mates Laurentiu! \nArtist Bio: Born in Dracula's lands, Mates Laurentiu is a Romanian freelance artist with a love for fantasy, horror and science fiction.

We make notes on things that we know we need to check into for Mac and Linux support but we have not yet attempted builds on those platforms. It is possible and expected that there will be a delay between releasing versions for Windows PC and Mac and Linux. In the worst case scenario, Windows PC users may complete the entire Alpha and Beta process before the Alpha and Beta process begins for other platforms. \n\nWe will lock down the FGU Alpha Launch Party by the start of June. If there are significant delays in getting you access to the Alpha, we will still have some hands-on stuff for you at the event but we may delay access to the Alpha keys until a later date.

Instead, we gave general responses that we would be looking into that and other features once we completed the initial port to Unity.\nI am now happy to announce that we have released this feature into our TEST channel for people to play around with and experiment.

The GM can then approve or reject movement on a per token basis. Once enabled on a map, any attempted move by players will need to be confirmed by the GM.

It\u2019s also an art fair, with a large selection of talented artists in attendance and an amazing abundance of fantasy, science fiction, horror, and geeky art and art activities. Oh, and it\u2019s The Mother of All Marketplaces, with more than 60 vendors showcasing a wide variety of jazz, snazz, and zazz, boosting the geekonomy like old school Robin Hoods but without the stealing and the archery (ok, not like Robin Hoods. I failed analogy class in Kindergarten). Don\u2019t forget the parties\u2026Did I mention the parties? There are parties. A LOT of them. Also there are other things, like amazing special Guests, the Children of the Cob, the Comedy Music Extravagasm!, a Drag Show, a Burlesque Show, Karaoke, a super sweet Auction, Food Trucks, a Games Library, free snacks in the Con Suite, Panels, Workshops, and Demos, a whole track of Cosplay and Fandom related activities, and a massive horde of potential friends and peeps who dig the same things you dig!   \nWhy Kickstarter?\nThis Kickstarter fundraiser will allow us to bring more value to your Con on the Cob experience.

In the past, such names as Jeff Easley, Larry Elmore, Jamie Chambers, Shane Hensley, and Eloy LaSanta have graced the halls of Con on the Cob. Could one of them return? Maybe someone equally famous will attend. You will be involved in the decision making process, should the goal be attained...\nAndy will get a Coblin Tattoo ($10,000): Andy will get a tattoo of a coblin, hopefully at the con in front of everybody. \nMore Stretch Goals to come... \nThis year's theme is a weird one. Robots and giant monsters is a familiar and perhaps overdone genre but ROBOTS VS GIANT MONSTERS BUT ALSO EVERYTHING IS MADE OUT OF PRETZELS is something completely new and original! See, every year Con on the Cob has a different theme. This theme carries into many of the activities and parties, as well as the decorations, badges, and other such subtleties. In the past we've had some doozies (Cyberfunk Invasion, Cosmic Circus, Rise of the Elder Cobs, Cobs and Cobbers, The Gawds of Coblympus, Some Sort of Enchanted Fairy Forest or Something, etc...). Guests at Con on the Cob get to vote on the theme for the following year and Robots vs Giant Monsters won by a slim margin. However, it wouldn't be Con on the Cob if we didn't weird it up, so there you go... \nCoins on the Cob are special collectable plastic tokens we use to reward game masters and others for their exemplary participation in Con on the Cob. To read more about these wondrous artifacts please follow this link. \nCOB CRATES are special boxes (sometimes bags) of awesome jazz we give FOR FREE to Con on the Cob attendees who meet a few requirements. They are stocked with some really great stuff (board games, card games, jewelry, candy, books, geeky stuff, etc...) donated by our sponsors and by our incredible friends at Alliance Game Distributors. Last year's COB CRATES contained items with a combined average value of over $100. They're a fantastic prize for pretty much doing something you were probably already planning on doing anyway. Here's all you have to do to nab one:\nBack this Kickstarter for at least $45 (at least one 4 Day Badge).\nBook your stay (at least two nights) at our host hotel (Days Inn & Suites in Richfield, Ohio) by June 8th and be sure to tell them you are with Con on the Cob. Here's the phone number to call:  (330) 659-6151. \nSend me a message on Kickstarter with your reservation number or the name the reservation is under so we can verify your qualifications.\nYou must attend CotC 2019 in order to claim your COB CRATE.\nIf you already qualify for a COB CRATE because of actions taken before this Kickstarter launched you will still receive it. No worries.\nWe reserve the right to limit COB CRATES to the first 50 qualified backers, so pledge early! We'll make as many as we can, but we can't promise more than fifty.\nThe contents of the COB CRATES depend on what our generous contributors send us and how many people claim them. If you are interested in contributing to the COB CRATES please send me a message.\nCon on the Cob is an Includicon, which means everybody is welcome! Please familiarize yourself with our Rules and Policiesbefore attending the con. \nTestimonials\n\"Con on the Cob is the best convention since sliced convention!\" \nHarrison Hunt, The Wild Die Podcast\n\"I was honored to be an artist guest at Con on the Cob in the very early start of the convention many years ago. The simple fact that it is run by and created by the genius, kind hearted, artist of all things disgusting, vile and fun, Andy Hopp, wife Heather and daughters just adds to the guarantee of its success all these years later. This con is the most all inclusive, family friendly and loaded with talent event you can be a part of. All hail to the Coblin King!!\" \nEd Beard Jr., artist \n\"Con on the Cob is the perfect blend of family friendly and wild abandon. Games galore, zany entertainment, and just the right size for hanging with friends both new and old.\"      \nRobert Turk, Wicked Clever\n\"Con on the Cob, has been hands down the single best con I've ever attended. Quality people, and an inclusive atmosphere, with enough to do to ensure you only have a bad time if you try to.\"\nChad Crider, Foolish Media \n\"Dice Squad gives Con on the Cob two corn cobs up!\"\nAdam Campbell, Dice Squad\n\"Con on the Cob was my first convention to ever perform at! Andy was incredibly gracious and supportive of my career, and continues to be to this day. He helped cultivate a great group of friends and fans I have the honor of calling my convention family! I hope to perform at his convention again soon, and am so grateful for his generosity and family fun quality that his show provides. The entire Hopp family is the best!\" \nDestini Beard, Singer\n\"Con on the Cob is legit my favorite con. We've been to all of them, and I intend to keep going to all of them! Do not attempt to ingest Con on the Cob though, it's too big to eat even if you've got 4 days. Maybe get a friend and a couple extra plates and forks or something. Goes well with ranch dressing, hot fudge, or wasabi.\"\nKay Steele, Internet Personality and Miniature Painter\n\"I attended my first Con on the Cob a little over three years ago. I barely knew anyone walking in, but by the time the first day ended I felt like I found a whole new family! Everyone is so nice and welcoming. Especially the owner, Andy Hopp! He immediately noticed I was new on the scene and treated me exactly like an old friend! I love this convention with all my heart and soul. I can 100% say that Con on the Cob is my favorite convention and no matter what, I'll always be there!\"\nDoris Rachson, 24 Hour Ninja Exterminator (unsubstantiated)\n\"I recommend Con on the Cob to all aspiring artists and parents who want to be as young as the children they can take with them.\"\nSherry Dees, CotC Attendee \n\"It's like a freak show, in the best way.\" \nLee Garvin, Righteous Knight of Fawndr...\n\"I've been coming to Con on the Cob since 2012, after a long hiatus from going to conventions, and this convention renewed my amazement and wonder at the arts, games, and good convention FUN. New friendships, great events, and an amazing amount of activities await the young and old. If you want to venture into the wonderland convention known as Con on the Cob, you will be extremely amazed!\" \nRyan Cribley, Guy who has been coming to Con on the Cob since 2012, after a long hiatus from going to conventions.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCon on the Cob has been an ongoing adventure since 2004.

As the Revolutionary War progresses, you develop new superpowers, such as shape change, energy weapon, elemental mastery, transmute, disguise, state shift, or weather control, and fight supervillains with powers such as puppet, hunter's path, witchsight, gift of luck, or gate. In Legion of Liberty, your actions may change the course of history, for better or worse! \nGreat RPG setting books have great illustrations, so great books need an art budget. Happy Monster Press is a two-person operation. Scott's background is in business and physics; Joy is a writer, with a few traditional watercolor skills and a basic grasp of Photoshop. When the Happy Monster creative team put their heads together to make a piece of custom art, the following masterpiece was the result.\nJacoby Barnes, the Boston Lobster Man, battles Greycoats at the Salem Willows. ZORP.\nSome of our friends have said, YES, DO THE WHOLE BOOK THAT WAY! (For you folks, we've added in a stretch-goal; if this project funds at $10K, we'll produce a special edition, fully illustrated by Scott and Joy, for anyone who thinks this is a good idea.) Otherwise, we'll be hiring professional artists to illustrate Legion of Liberty. For Children of the Apocalypse, our first setting book, we hired Yihyoung Li to make custom illustrations.  \n\"Illuminated,\" \"Aleulama,\" and \"Bastelin\" by Yihyoung Li.\nPaying for these images consumed Happy Monster's entire art budget, so for the rest of the Children of the Apocalypse, we had to use royalty free stock images. Happy Monster Press believes that professional illustrators should be paid pro rates for their work, which is why we're Kickstarting Legion of Liberty. With a larger art budget, we can pay illustrators like Yihyoung Li to create professional cover art and custom characters like Jacoby Barnes (the Boston Lobster Man), Philomon Smith (the Plymouth Rock Boy), and Deganawidah (the sonic Wampanoag warrior). Adventures such as the Battle of Salem, where Paul Revere (the Silver Speedster) faces off against were-porcupine Jane Goode (aka, \"Mauler\"), would be even more awesome with full-page illustrations. Please help us bring Legion of Liberty to full-color life with great art.\nBackground\nIn the Americas, a tiny percentage of young people (~age 12) develop superpowers. North American Superhumans are a new resource that the European powers are fighting over; whoever rules the most colonies, and commands the most superhumans, will surely gain supremacy across all of Europe. Those superhumans loyal to the British join the Royal Superhuman Regiment (the Greycoats), whereas those siding with the resistance join the Sons of Liberty, who are conspiring to cast off the rule of King George and establish an independent government.\nPlot Point Campaign\nYou, as a young superhuman, will fight historical battles, such as Bunker Hill and Yorktown, but your victories and defeats will affect the course of the American Revolution. The Legion of Liberty Plot Point Campaign includes traditional battles, from early conflicts in Massachusetts to the final confrontations in Virginia; however, the Plot Point Campaign includes several alternate histories the gamemaster can put into play if, for instance, the heroes win a battle that was historically lost. In these alternate histories, for example, the Continental Army might conquer Canada; or General Washington could be captured while crossing the Delaware. Legion of Liberty has been structured to maximize flexibility for the gamemaster and increase the stakes for the players.\nFor gamemasters wanting to go beyond the American Revolution, Legion of Liberty's new Edges, Hindrances, and Powers provide a framework for other historical or present-day low-power superheroes campaigns, all fully compatible with the new Savage Worlds Adventure Edition.\nGame Play\nInteract with historical figures like Washington, Hamilton, Franklin, and Sam Adams.\nExert political influence to support the Declaration of Independence.\nFoil a secret society of superhuman villains (the Order of the Seventh Circle).\nTrounce Redcoat forces in traditional, close-quarters, black powder battles.\nPit your superpowers against elite British superhumans (the Greycoats).\nFight mass battles with custom rules for superhero skirmishes.\nNew Tools for Players and Gamemasters\n18 new Powers (bomber, conjuration, elemental mastery, energy transformation, energy weapon, gate, gift of luck, hunter's path, immunity, implant memory, legion, mimic, nature bond, state shift, stretch, transmute, weather control, witchsight).\n22 new Edges and Hindrances for heroes with superpowers.\n10 Savage Tales set in the colonies, Europe, and Native American territories.\nAn adventure generator for raids, battles, reconnaissance, and skullduggery in the American Revolution.\nFor a sneak peek of Legion of Liberty, download the Jumpstart free at DriveThruRPG today!\nLegion of Liberty requires the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition Core Rules to play.\nAt the Patriot level and above, backers will receive a PDF copy of the Legion of Liberty setting book and any digital stretch goals unlocked during the Kickstarter. Backers at higher levels will receive softcover or hardcover print copies and any unlocked digital and print stretch goals.\nA limited number of backers have the opportunity to be Tuckerized; non-player characters (both heroes and villains) could be named after you!*** For General(s) of the Continental Army (the highest backer level), the co-creators at Happy Monster Press will run a custom session of Legion of Liberty for you and four of your friends, using the Roll20 online platform!\nAll PDF and print books (other than signed copies) will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG.\n***All Tuckerizations are subject to the approval of Happy Monster Press. The Happy Monster Press Party Poopers(TM) reserve the right NOT to have a superhero called WonderFly McSuperface, because that would only be funny for ten seconds. \n$4000\nIf funding reaches $4000, we will add two custom digital, printable Chase Decks (Wilderness and Urban). These Chase Decks add obstacles players must negotiate during escape/pursuit scenarios. For instance, after freeing Paul Revere from house arrest so he can run at super speed to alert the colonial militia that the British Are Coming, you must escape a unit of angry British Regulars. But wait! The Chase Deck says there's a cart full of Sam Adams beer kegs blocking the alley! What do you do now?\n$5000\nIf funding reaches $5000, we will provide all of our print backers with print copies of the Chase Decks!\nIf funding exceeds $5000, we will add additional digital and print stretch goals. \n$10,000\nIf funding reaches $10,000, Joy and Scott will produce a special digital edition of the Legion of Liberty core book featuring all original Sharpie/watercolor art!

Humans never evolved on Terra--instead, the world is dominated by floral life and saurians. Humans exist on Terra, however, drawn from the legendary world of Earth.\nOn Earth, humans number in the teeming billions, unaware of their magical potential and heroic birthright, but when Terra's fate hangs in the balance, it draws human champions across the Warp of space. These champions can act for good or ill, but theirs is the power to change the fate of a world.\nFive years ago, the Dragon Empire subjugated the peaceful Mandragoran Kingdom, slaying the Sunflower King and sending his daughter and only heir, the Peachblossom Princess, into exile. The barbarian kappa and their fungal berserker allies run roughshod over the mandragoran people--and the land can no longer bear their pain. It calls for champions!\nWhether Earth-born or Terran, it matters not! What matters is a hero's spirit. You will need power, wisdom, and courage to face the dangers of the Mushroom War.\nTerra needs heroes!\nHeroes of Terra: The Mushroom War is a role-playing game using the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition rules by Blackwing Productions. Come adventure in a world of floral sorcery and saurian savagery!\nHeroes of Terra is a pulp-fantasy setting in the vein of classic sword-and-sorcery literature, with a world that pays homage to classic video games of the early 1980s. It's also strongly influenced by the isekai genre of Japanese anime and manga. You can think of the world of Terra as Conan the Barbarian, but the main character is a mustachioed Italian plumber instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Or The Lord of the Rings with characters from Super Smash Brothers as the Fellowship.\nInfluences on the setting include Super Mario Brothers, The Legend of Zelda, Elric of Melnibon\u00e9, Conan the Barbarian, John Carter of Mars, the Lankhmar novels, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Donkey Kong Country, KonoSuba, and more, all thrown into a blender on high speed.\nJump high, grow huge, and break open chests filled with gold coins and flowers that give you magic powers. The various wink-and-nod references throughout the setting help Heroes of Terra work on two levels: first, as a semi-parody of beloved classic video games; and second, as a semi-serious pulp-fantasy setting where the stakes are as high as the survival of nations.\nHuman Channeler\nArt by Jen\nTerra is a parallel world, created 65 million years ago when a rogue asteroid came hurtling from the void of space. The life force of the world burned hot to save itself from destruction, but the effort spit the fabric of reality in two.\nIn one world, the asteroid struck the world; while life was spared by the world-spirit's power, the life force of the world-spirit was irrevocably damaged, slowly draining away magic. That world was Earth, a place with almost no magic remaining by the modern day. Humans have evolved to utilize what little magic remains to its fullest potential, though they remain largely ignorant of their potential.\nIn the other world, the asteroid missed by the slimmest of margins. This world, Terra, remains a highly magical place. Dinosaurs remained dominant and mammals remained small and unimportant. Modern Terra hosts dozens of sentient races, the most numerous of them descended from saurians or from plants and fungi.\nUntil five years ago, the greatest nation in the world was the mighty Mandragoran Kingdom, a peaceful land of flowers and floral sorcery. In a devastating attack, the kingdom was toppled and is now occupied by the forces of the Dragon Empire, a barbarian horde of saurian warriors and fungal berserkers united by the mighty Dragon Emperor.\nWith the Sunflower King dead and his daughter either imprisoned or in hiding, the kappa have begun to exploit the kingdom's land to the breaking point. The land has begun to awaken, calling out for heroes and giving powerful gifts to those who will aid it.\nThis initial setting book is designed to introduce players to the world of Terra and the return of humans during a time of great crisis, the Mushroom War.\nMandragoran Floral Sorcerer\nArt by Jen\nHumans and their return to Terra are the focus of the game, but they are not Terra's only heroes. Join the peaceful mandragora, quick quetzal, clever pudica, and even renegades from the dreaded kappa and myconite hordes as they seek to overthrow the Dragon Emperor and end his reign of terror!\nThis Kickstarter is designed to fund the first book of the setting line, Heroes of Terra: The Mushroom War, a setting book specifically focused on the continent of Lemuria and the conflict between the Dragon Empire and the Mandragoran Kingdom. This book will give you everything you need to adventure in the pulp-fantasy world of Terra and explore its wonders, mysteries, and terrors.\nAdditionally, one of this Kickstarter's major stretch goals is the writing of a Plot Point Campaign about the rebellion against the Dragon Emperor. Even without that campaign material, the Heroes of Terra setting book will give you all you need to run epic sword and sorcery adventures in a world where the dinosaurs never died out and magic still reigns.\nKappa Warrior\nArt by Jen\nAll rewards for this Kickstarter are digital in nature, as well as vouchers for at-cost printing through DriveThruRPG's print on demand service. This is being done in order to avoid many of the pitfalls of role-playing Kickstarters, which often over-promise physical rewards and then have a hard time delivering on them. By focusing on the game itself--the setting, the plot point campaign, and adventures--it is my hope to be able to provide everything in a timely manner.\nThe writing for the setting book is around 90% done as of the beginning of this Kickstarter, barring additions from the reward tiers. The proceeds from this Kickstarter are primarily being used to pay for editing, professional layout, and art.\nEveryone who pledges at least $1 will have access to the 12-page Heroes of Terra Jumpstart that was originally included as part of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition Kickstarter! This 12-page document gives a brief overview of the world, the role of the players, mechanics, and a short adventure, \"The Plumber's Dilemma.\" This jumpstart is intended as a preview of the setting to help $1 backers decide if they want to upgrade their pledges to get the full player's guide or setting book. Even if you cancel your pledge, feel free to keep the jumpstart!\n(The Heroes of Terra Jumpstart will be included with Update #1 of this Kickstarter.)\nEveryone who pledges $5 or more will receive a copy of the Player's Guide to the Mushroom War, a primer on the world of Terra, character creation for Terran heroes, and the magic of the land. This product currently exists in a \"rough\" version--fully written and edited, but without much in the way of art or layout. A finished version of the Player's Guide (in pdf) will be distributed to every person who pledged $5 or more upon successful completion of the Kickstarter!\nQuetzal Wanderer\n Art by Jen\nThe most basic stretch goal is for the writing of a Plot Point Campaign for Heroes of Terra: The Mushroom War, entitled \"Our Princess is in Another Castle.\" This campaign will take members of the Peachblossom Resistance through a whirlwind adventure to find and rescue the Peachblossom Princess, restore her to the throne of the Mandragoran Kingdom, defeat the seven generals of the Dragon Empire who rule the subjugated kingdom, and overthrow the hold of the mighty Dragon Emperor.\nEven if that stretch goal is not achieved, the basic setting book will include plenty of plot hooks, adventure seeds, and ideas for campaigns, but the plot point campaign will take those ideas, expand on them, and deliver a full-length campaign for immediate use. Since this portion of the book is in outline form only right now, the additional cost above the basic rewards is to set aside the time to complete writing, as well as additional costs for extra layout, editing, and art.\n$4000: The plot point campaign gets written! Backers will receive a .pdf copy of the Plot Point Campaign \"Our Princess is in Another Castle\" as well as a random adventure generator and random encounter tables for adventuring in the world of Terra.\n$5000: A set of eight pre-generated characters will be included with \"Our Princess is in Another Castle,\" as well as bundled separately into lavish .pdf character folios as part of the Player's Guide. All characters generated through the Mandrake pledge tier will also be included in the character folio!\n$6000: A full-color poster map of the Mandragoran Kingdom and the surrounding territories will be created as part of the Kickstarter campaign. A high-resolution .pdf of that poster map will be added to all digital reward tiers (Wildflower and up).\n$8000: The amount of full-color art in Heroes of Terra will double, including character illustrations for the eight pre-generated characters from the Plot Point Campaign. This is the stretch goal needed to ensure lovely art for the Plot Point Campaign!\n$10,000: \"Our Princess is in Another Castle\" will include a series of Savage Tales to round out the adventuring possibilities of the world of Terra, increasing the overall length of the plot point campaign!\nPudican Artificer\n Art by Jen\nAs mentioned above, the basic writing for Heroes of Terra is virtually complete, requiring only editing changes, plus whatever additional materials are added to the setting as part of this Kickstarter. Should the stretch goals be met, some amount of additional time will be needed to complete the plot point campaign, commission the extra art, and so on.\nIn order to give everyone plenty of time to get everything done, I'm noting full completion as being by February of 2020, though everyone who pledges for $5 or more will receive a pdf of the rough-cut Player's Guide at the Kickstarter's completion and funding, as well as the finished Player's Guide as soon as it's done.\nMyconite Scavenger\nArt by Jen\nPlease spread the word to help the world of Terra come to life!\nLegal Stuff\nDisclaimer\n\u201cThis game references the Savage Worlds game system, available from Pinnacle Entertainment Group at www.peginc.com.

It's yours just for taking the time to peruse. Thank you! \nThis thing shows what the original illustration looks like compared to the coloring book version.\nPLAY\n\nFriends and fans have been requesting a Low Life themed coloring book ever since we first plopped printed coloring sheets featuring Low Life artwork in the Children of the Cob room at Con on the Cob over a decade ago. My goal is to provide a highest quality, fun and whimsical artistic and literary experience for people of all ages and experience levels. \nClick to enlarge.\nAlthough absolutely no previous knowledge of (or interest in) the Low Life game is needed to enjoy this book, certain things in After the Wipe expand and expound upon material in various other Low Life publications. \nWill your enjoyment of this book be increased if you enjoy Low Life? Absolutely, it will. \nWill your enjoyment of Low Life be increased if you have this book? Again, it most certainly will.\nDo you need to have one to enjoy the other? Nope, you do not. It's kind of like how you don't have to read the entire spectrum of superhero comics in order to enjoy a superhero coloring book.\nWhat does After the Wipe add to the Low Life game? In addition to creating a narrative that helps the reader explore and understand various peeps, creeps, and locales on Mutha Oith, this book features new monsters and, if the proper stretch goals are attained, new playable character species and other extremely interesting things.\nAre other Low Life items offered as part of this Kickstarter campaign? Yes indeed, they are. Some are already included in various pledge levels and others are described in the Add-Ons and Extras section below.\nLow Life is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG), which uses the amazing Savage Worlds rules system by Shane Lacy Hensley and Pinnacle Entertainment Group. All of the books in the Low Life line are written as if they are actual books created by a denizen of Oith. All game references and material are in the appendices at the back. This means you can read and enjoy the books on their own merit without even caring that it's a game at all. Similarly, they can be used as props in-game and referenced by players. The rule is, if you have the book so does your character (unless the Boss decides otherwise).\nDownload a FREE 113 page preview copy of Low Life by clicking this link! \nLow Life is an official Savage Setting!\nThese features will be added when the requisite funding level or happenstance occurs. Some are attained when a particular dollar amount is reached. Others are dependent on various criteria described below.   \nATTAINED! If we reach the initial $3000 funding goal within 24 hours of launch every coloring book sent to kickstarter backers will be SIGNED AND PERSONALIZED by the author and every backer's name will be included in a special The Whole Hole Benevolence Society Thank You section in the book.   \nATTAINED! In honor of International Women's Day the first 100 backers who pledge at least 30 dollars by the end of the day on March 8 will receive a free 4x6 inch art print of Rabboasloth Kangarooster and Mr. Grumbles.\n ATTAINED! The book will feature a special metal coil binding that will allow it to lay flat for easier use. Additionally, we will be producing a number of LEFT-HANDED books with the binding on the right hand side so left-handed people won't get sore wrists.  \nATTAINED! Pages will be perforated along the spine to facilitate easier removal from the book.    \nATTAINED! Sixteen additional pages will be added to the book!   \nAnother batch of sixteen pages will be added!   \nAn exclusive new monster for the Low Life game will be included in the book.   \nThe pages that face the coloring pages will feature greyscale versions of those same images. The greyscale images offer a varied coloring opportunity.  \nThis reward happens when we reach 500 responses (Interested or Going) visitors on the After the Wipe Facebook event page. I will produce a live video of myself coloring a brand new Low Life drawing. The drawing will appear in the upcoming The Whole Hole - A Gadabout's Guide to Mutha Oith - Volume 03: The Incredibly Huge Monster and you'll be among the first to see it. The video will be posted here as well.\nAll $30+ backers will receive a FREE 5\"x7\" print of the Litter Bug and his horde of contanimants.  \nThe kickstarter backers and I will work together to create a new playable character species for the Low Life game. It will be featured in the book as a colorable line drawing and a grayscale illustration. If the $20,000 stretch goal is attained the character species will appear as a full color illustration as well.   \nYet another batch of sixteen pages will be added to the book.  \nThe sixteen pages added by the $12,000 stretch goal will instead be FULL COLOR and will include new content for the Low Life game (the backers will get to help me decide what to include). In PDF form this will be a separate book. In the printed version it will be a new section of the coloring book. \nThese things can be added to any pledge level. To do so, simply increase your pledge by the listed amount and either send me an email (andy@andyhopp.com subject =Coloring book extras) letting me know what extras you added or include that information in the survey you will be sent after the campaign ends. Everything listed here includes FREE DOMESTIC SHIPPING! For international shipping please add a total of $40 for shipping regardless of what's added.\nYou get THREE sheets of plastic shrink paper printed with a total of at least eighteen different Low Life characters for you to color. Pop them in the oven and watch them shrink and harden. You can turn them into jewelry, magnets, suncatchers, fetish totems, or whatever other wacky things your mind can conjure.

I'll even include the images as PDFs so you can nab more shrinking paper on your own and print as many as you want.\nWe will work together to create a really cool peep or creep. The drawing I make from your character or monster concept will appear in After the Wipe as a colorable line drawing and, if the $20,000 level is attained, as a full color illustration. If the $20,000 pledge level is not reached your color image will appear in the upcoming The Whole Hole - A Gadabout's Guide to Mutha Oith - Volume 03: The Incredibly Huge Monster. The best part is YOU GET TO KEEP THE ORIGINAL DRAWING! \nFeel free to email me (andy@andyhopp.com subject =Creep or Peep Ideas) or message me to discuss ideas.\nThis is an exclusive set of SIX custom made slog shaped crayons. Each set is unique and includes a random assortment of colors and slog shapes. Sure, you can draw or color with them, but they're much cooler as collectibles. \nThese customized linen bags are emblazoned with a random peep or creep and are ideal for holding your crayons, dice, and other such whatnots. They feature a drawstring closure and full color artwork. \nI'm plopping the entire catalogue of Low Life jazz here at a significantly discounted rate for all you lovely people.

To our surprise, people went crazy over the box! There were actually some people who bought our early test version of the game just for the box, without even trying the game! We knew we had something special on our hands.\n\"I love the box!\" - Jordan Rudess\nHowever, it was definitely not feasible to handcraft all the boxes! And the cardboard version wasn't durable enough. Most people told us to just go with a normal cardboard box since it would be easier but we wanted our backers to feel the same sense of amazement we did so we're glad to announce we've found a great manufacturer in China who's working with us to design the box!\nAdd-ons\nStretch Goals\n\n\n\nGameplay\nThere's a small mistake in the video - can you spot it? ;)\nCheck out our rulebook here, it's currently a work in progress hosted on Google Docs.

We created this game because we want to transform that terrible experience into a terrific experience, and we believe we can - with your help! \nWhile this is our first Kickstarter, all 3 of us have backed Kickstarter projects before and we each bring strong complementary skills to form a great team. From video filming to digital marketing to game design to publicity outreach, the three of us have been hard at work daily to chase our dreams. We've tried to do as much of it by ourselves as possible so that we can ensure that every part of this campaign and journey retains the style, humor and quality that we've promised with the game.\nIf you\u2019re into geeky Musical references and epic Composer puns, Pliszt Bach us and help us to make this game a reality. \nCheck out Jonathan's Medium Article for the detailed composition of our bach story, filled with lots of be-haydn-the-scenes action and accounts of our crazy sustained hustling.\nThank you! - Keith, Jon and Jun Yu\nAdditional Notes\nWhy support us on Kickstarter\nWe need your help to fund the production of Lord of the Chords and make it the best music card game ever. As a backer, you'll also help us unlock stretch goals that will improve key components of the game for everyone.\nIn return, we're offering major discounts for both the Minor and Major tiers from the MSRP and we'll make sure that all backers get their copies before retail release. \nWork together with us! Music theory can be complicated and downright different between countries and cultures. We love hearing your feedback and advice and we've already been receiving lots of advice from supporters pre-campaign that has helped us made many useful changes to the game.\nTranslations and Musical Variations\nAll of the below options will be available as choices on the backer survey we will send out at the end of the campaign. Select the options you want and we will make sure you get the best version of the game for you!\nLanguage options available:\nEnglish (default)\n Spanish\nGerman\nGame content options available:\nDefault version (with crotchets and Bflat)\nEU version (Bflat becomes B and B becomes H)\nAmerican version (Differences in rhythm terminology - \"crotchets\" become \"quarter notes\")\nIf you know of other differences or things we should take into account, please let us know! Here is a Google Sheet with descriptions and translations for the Minor Edition. Feel free to add translations in your own language!\nManufacturing, Shipping and Pledge Manager\nManufacturing\nWe are currently working together with WhatzGames (King of Tokyo, Krosmaster Quest, Antidote) to produce our game components and IdealHard (Robo3D, Body Boss) to manufacture our box - both in China. Both companies have great records of working with Kickstarter campaigns and we have been in close communication with the companies pre-launch.\nShipping\nShipping will not be charged during the campaign. It will be charged through the pledge manager after the campaign based on the actual costs incurred to ship. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will be working with various experienced fulfillment centers. We are offering tax-friendly options for US, EU, Canada, Australia and Mexico.\nThe shipping rates below are an estimate but they will be the maximum possible value charged to the pledge manager at the end of the campaign. We have slightly overestimated some of the rates so as to give ourselves some leeway to work with unforeseen circumstances. \nDelivery is expected to be in October 2019.\nPledge Manager\nWe will be working togther with CrowdOx. For those who are new to Kickstarter, a pledge manager will help us to manage the orders and information more effectively. About a week after the campaign ends, all backers will receive an email with a survey to confirm shipping address, shipping costs and any additional add-ons or purchases that they'll like to make.\nRetailers\nPlease email us at hello@lordofthechords.com.

Humankind has expanded into the universe. We have discovered not only wonders without, from the remains of ancient civilizations to a dizzying array of habitable worlds, but also wonders within: the inherent power of consciousness called psionics. Despite its expansions and advances, however, humankind remains ever at war, and in the far future those wars spread across the cosmos powered by billion year old weapons of mysterious origin.\nREVOLUTION by Eugene Marshall\nSet in France in 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution, Revolution features swashbuckling musketeers dueling in the streets, alchemists concocting strange compounds in their alchemical labs, and intellectuals, spies, and members of secretive, occult societies plotting and plying their revolutionary ideas in the salons of French aristocratic Paris, all while the heady draught of revolution brews across Europe.\nVIRULENT by Aaron Acevedo, Sean Bircher, Darrell Hardy, Eugene Marshall, Brain Reeves, and John Wick\nThis is a post apocalyptic setting of dark survival in a world ruled by three plagues: vampires, werewolves and zombies. The players take the roles of survivors trying to find a way to close the Door: a gateway that links their world to our own.\nThe Bride by Brian Reeves (Sword & Sorcery Savage Tale)\nWhen a prince's bride-to-be is kidnapped by a vile sorcerer, the heroes ride out to her rescue, only to find things are not always as they appear.\nBrimstone Messiah by Matthew Cutter (Modern Horror Savage Tale)\nThey once followed Grimes on his path to magical revelation.

We're still working on the final line up however, because we have limited space for additional content.\nOur creative team includes Aaron Acevedo, Carol Darnell, Ian Eller, Min Lungelow, Eugene Marshall, Brian Reeves, Alida Saxon, and a host of Sigil's talented creators. \nOur team has produced the official art for Savage Worlds products since 2012, among numerous other projects like Deadlands Classic, Torg Eternity, and Unknown Armies. We have won multiple ENnie and Origins Awards for our previous work. \nWe've also got contributions from Savage Worlds veterans too: Matthew Cutter (Deadlands), John Goff (Deadlands Noir), Darrell Hardy (Irongate), Sean Bircher (Rifts), Sean Roberson (Rifts), Darren Pearce (Suzerain/Shaintar), and Zach Welhouse (Suzerain).\nSavage Worlds is a tabletop role-playing game published by Pinnacle Entertainment Group. It is the core ruleset for all Pinnacle\u2019s current roleplaying games, including Deadlands, Rifts, Flash Gordon, Lankhmar, and more. It has everything you need to play narrative or miniature-based games, with quick, simple, yet comprehensive rules for everything from combat to Dramatic Tasks, Chases, and Interludes.

The entire series to date is streaming on The Fantasy Network and Amazon Prime. Go on, check it out...we'll still be here!\nDid we mention that JourneyQuest is epic? It's so epic that it should be impossible to produce. And we've solved that by ruthlessly cutting what we couldn't afford to shoot.\nFor three seasons.\nShowrunner Matt Vancil has delivered the scripts for Seasons 4 and 5, which will complete the story. And they're good. Really freaking good. So good that when we realized that we were going to have to cut scenes and characters who we love...and that we might never see how their stories resolve...we stepped back and said \"Not today, The Budget. We want to tell the complete story!\"\nThis campaign will fund the scenes from JourneyQuest seasons 2, 3, 4 and 5 that would otherwise be lost. We'll shoot them, we'll share them with you, and then we'll cut them into Seasons 4 & 5 when we fund and produce them.\nPlus, this is the perfect time to create something that fans have been begging us to create since Season One: a comprehensive Fartherall world bible and campaign setting! And yes, this world bible is your chance to help Matt name and create the heroes, demi-gods, guilds, and kingdoms that will fill the world of Fartherall!\nFinally, we're bringing Matt Vancil on board to run several story canon Livestream Roleplaying events, where he'll explore the early days of the questing party with Christian Doyle (Perf), Brian Lewis (Carrow), and more!\nThere's a ton of information in this campaign, so if you want to jump ahead, here's a guide to where to find what you want to know.\nJourneyQuest Season 3.5 (What we'll be shooting)\nThe Team (Who's making this)\nThe World Bible (What's in the book)\nThe Livestream Adventure (How to watch)\nThe Rewards (So Many Cool Things)\nShipping (We charge shipping in BackerKit after the campaign)\nThe Shared Cinematic Universe License Agreement (Tell your own story)\nRisks and Challenges\nAnd coming soon, the campaign FAQ\nDue to budget constraints and time, we\u2019ve been forced to cut important scenes from JourneyQuest since the very beginning. And the full scripts that Matt Vancil writes for each season suffer every time we have to make these hard choices. Plus, months are spent going over the script deciding what has to stay and what can be cut. Frankly, it\u2019s awful. Cutting characters or scenes that we have fallen in love with is one of the hardest things we, as a company, have to do. \nBut you deserve the whole story. \nThanks to our Patreon supporters, the scripts for JourneyQuest Seasons 4 & 5 are complete...and epic...and need to be cut down...and rather than leave some crucial scenes out, AGAIN, we decided to create JourneyQuest 3.5\nJust like one of our favorite roleplaying games, this is where we make some important fixes and upgrades. It\u2019s where we catch up with moments that we couldn\u2019t afford to shoot for seasons 2 and 3 and preemptively shoot what we would otherwise have to cut from Seasons 4 and 5.\nScenes vital to the overall story arc of JourneyQuest. \nWhere did the Orcs go when they used Silver Tom\u2019s \u201cmagic device\u201d? Where is Karn? Will Rilk wake up before winter?\nCompleting these story arcs are important because you, the fans, the lifeblood of JourneyQuest, deserve to see the entire story from beginning to end without cuts. \nSO HOW DOES IT TIE TOGETHER?\nWe'll release Season 3.5 as a backer-exclusive (yes, that includes Patreon!) miniseries that follows the orcs and Karn. It will play like a shorter season of JourneyQuest. This is the version that will appear on the DVD and download.\nThen we will cut these scenes into where they belong in JQ 4 & 5 as we shoot those seasons. (The scripts have moved some scenes that were cut from JQ 2 & 3 into 4 & 5. We won't recut 2 & 3.)\nJourneyQuest is created by an ever-growing team of talented and passionate actors, producers, crew, support staff, and showrunner Matt Vancil.\nTogether, we've not only produced three seasons of JourneyQuest, but the ongoing Gamers series, Dark Dungeons, Demon Hunters, Attacking the Darkness, Strowlers, and much more.\nThe team also needs to support their families. Shows of this scale can't operate under volunteer effort. While our budgets are still a fraction of what Hollywood spends, doing it right means taking care of everyone. Your support is what lets us keep telling original stories that you can't find anywhere else!\nFor Season 3.5 we're bringing in...\nMatt Vancil - Writer and Director\nTony Becerra - Producer\nRennie Araucto - Producer\nMaggie Doyle - Kickstarter Manager\nBen Dobyns - Executive Producer\nBob Sapp - Karn the Unpleasant\nDarlene Sellers - The Oracle\nJesse Lee Keeter - Rilk\nLuke Amundson - Yart\nJeremy Spray - Grellnock\nAnd a few more surprises who qualify as massive spoilers\nEveryone on this team has delivered excellent work in the past and we're confident that the show will continue to evolve in their competent hands.\nNot only do we want to give you the entire JourneyQuest story by creating Season 3.5, we also want to introduce the Fartherall World Bible!\nA beautiful 8.5x8.5 volume modeled after our Strowlers World Bible, this will be the definitive guide to the world of JourneyQuest and The Gamers.\nJoin writer Matt Vancil on a trek through a world of many ages, ancient gods, mysterious wyrms, interstellar travelers, and so much more!\nYou'll learn the history of Fartherall, the major and minor gods and religions, the sentient species (past and present) who vie for dominance and survival, systems of magic, geography, kingdoms, organizations and factions, and all the backstory you could dream of.\nPlus, at the $100 reward level and up, backers will have the opportunity to make their own official contributions to the world in the Heroes of Fartherall section, where you will have a chance to create and share your own character. Then, from $250 and up, Matt will work with you to gather information about your hero or villain and write them into the history!\nYou can check out the Fartherall Wiki for core information and a taste of everything that Matt has planned for this book.\nBIBLE STRETCH GOALS\nBackers at all levels will benefit from stretch goals that will expand the scope of the bible considerably, adding tens of thousands of words of additional content. Plus, backers at $100 and up will see stretch goals that transition the book to hardcover, upgrade to premium paper, add foil stamps to the cover, and other physical changes that will make this a unique, deluxe collectible!\nAfter our experience publishing the Strowlers World Bible this year, we're excited to bring similar upgrades to this book as well.\nStrech Goals: \n$137,000 \u2013 The History of Fartherall, Expanded (First through Ninth Ages), approximately 32 additional pages\n$144,000 \u2013 The Peoples of Fartherall, Expanded, ~30 additional pages\n$150,000 \u2013 The Epics of Fartherall, ~20 additional pages\n$152,000 \u2013 Locked\n$161,000 \u2013 Locked\n$169,000 \u2013 Locked\n$172,000 \u2013 Locked (would complete all additional possible materials for the world bible!)\nAfter over a year of broadcasting weekly tabletop adventures with our friends at HyperRPG, they moved to Los Angeles and we opened our own livestream studio, where we're currently broadcasting Masters of the Metaverse on Twitch.\nFor this campaign, Matt Vancil has written an original adventure that will feature Christian Doyle as Perf and Brian Lewis as Carrow, exploring how their party began the quest that had been going for five years when we joined the story in JourneyQuest Season 1. Barring unforeseen technical difficulties (which could move us to a backup broadcast on Twitch), the first episode will air on Kickstarter Live on September 22nd, then be available for replay afterward.\nBut we're not just going to livestream. We're planning on involving you, our backers, in the adventure! Your pledges will not only reserve you fantastic rewards and help fund JQ 3.5 and the world bible, but they will help affect the livestream adventure. As we reach funding, social media, and backer milestones during the campaign, you will unlock buffs and trolls that our heroes will be able to use in the adventure. Plus, you'll have the opportunity in chat to offer input and feedback in real time at key moments!\nThe biggest reward for pledging, of course, is that you help us continue the story! We're committed to putting over 70% of dollars received straight into our production budget. And the rest? It goes towards Kickstarter and credit card fees, campaign management, and creating some kick-ass rewards!\nHere's what you can reserve with your pledge:\n CREDIT - Your name, in the credits. Yes, it's a lot of names. Yes, it's worth it to thank every one of you for making the show possible. (Just don't, you know, try to sneak something evil or defamatory past us. We read every name. EVERY. NAME.)\n STREAM  - Watch the new video content first with a private link to enjoy what the public will need to wait until Season Four to see.\n THE FANTASY NETWORK - We'll give you a month of free access to our new video streaming platform, The Fantasy Network, where you can watch all of our shows, plus incredible shows from other fantasy producers from around the world. Available in your browser and with apps on iOS, Android, Amazon Fire, Roku, and more, this is an awesome  way to catch up on everything. And it comes with your pledge of $10 or more!\n DOWNLOAD - A digital video download of JQ 3.5 and our livestream adventure. Always DRM-free. Just what it sounds like. Comes with all pledges of $20 or more!\n WORLD BIBLE PDF - The complete digital edition of the Fartherall World Bible!\n DVD or BLU-RAY - A backer-exclusive disc (your choice of format) of Season 3.5 and the Livestream adventure. (We may have to edit the livestreams to fit. More comedy in less time!) Available at $30 and up.\n WORLD BIBLE SOFTCOVER - A unique 8.5\" square format that will fit perfectly next to our recently released Strowlers World Bible. Available at $50 and up. And at $100 and up we'll also sign it!\n CREATE A HERO OF FARTHERALL - We'll ask you for NAME, SPECIES, CLASS, LEVEL, and a 30-character description of your hero, then we'll put her in the World Bible and on a...\n ETCHED METAL HERO CARD - Remember the awesome metal cards from JQ Season 3 that had your Orcish word, definition, and name on them? Now you can carry a hero in your pocket. And you have our permission to whip out the card every time you need a character for your next tabletop campaign! Available at the $100 level!\n CREATE AN EPIC HERO (OR VILLAIN) OF FARTHERALL - This is where Matt Vancil starts writing about your character. You get everything from the $100 level, plus a much longer character description and history that integrates your character into the world more fully. Yes, she's canon. She'll be a part of the official lore forever. Available at the $250 level!\n CREATE A DEMI-GOD OF FARTHERALL - A child of a god and a mortal, the demi-gods stride larger than life across the history of Fartherall. And now you can make Matt Vancil turn your character into one of them. These heroes (or villains) are legendary. And to reflect that legendary status, they also come with...\n A LARGER ETCHED METAL CARD - The same size as our Red Cards, these will be limited, etched with your unique character information, and did we mention that they're larger than the other metal cards? Available at the $500 level and up.\nTHE HIGHER LEVEL REWARDS\nIn the immortal words of Darkwing Duck, let's get dangerous!\n $1000 LEVEL - You're going to create a guild. Or an organization. An alliance. A group of people who exert power in Fartherall. Maybe a thieves guild. Or a merchant caravan. An adventurers club. And then you'll make yourself into a key character from that organization. Yes, Matt Vancil will write all of this into the world bible. But then we'll invite you to visit the JQ 3.5 set to APPEAR AS YOUR CHARACTER in the Bard College. This isn't a speaking role, but as an important guest of the bards, this will show how vital your story is within Fartherall.\n $2500 LEVEL - Why lead an organization when you can create a kingdom? Matt Vancil will write the history of your kingdom. Then fantasy artist Rob Carlos will paint you as its ruler. We'll display your painting in the series, then you get to keep the original artwork! Plus, you'll receive Associate Producer credit for JQ 3.5 and  JQ 4. (You're also welcome to visit set, although a ruler likely wouldn't appear in the bards college.)\n $5000 LEVEL - Create a god. Receive a larger original painting, again by Rob Carlos, of the god. Affect the pantheon of Fartherall forever. Also comes with Co-producer Credit on JQ 3.5 and JQ 4. (You too are welcome to visit set, but not as the god.)\nIn other words, Matt Vancil is going to do a whole lot of writing. And yes, he gets the final say on how to execute your ideas. He has to make the world work effectively! \nA second time, because it's important: the creator of JourneyQuest will decide how to write and present your character. We can't predict what he will do. And we'll all choose to enjoy his interpretation! Cool? Cool.\nWe will charge for all shipping after the campaign in BackerKit. In order for your rewards to ship, you will need to pay shipping fees at that time. Do NOT add shipping fees to your pledge now.\n International Backers: expect to pay less than $9.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\n Domestic Backers: expect to pay less than $5.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\nThe JQ 3.5 campaign will be fulfilled by our partners at Ship Naked. If we have enough European pledges we will fulfill from the Ship Naked shipping depot in Germany. If not, we'll fulfill from the USA in as EU-friendly a way as we can manage.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Our policy for excess funds pledged during the campaign is to spend them on producing JourneyQuest 3.5. Any amounts that you gift over the cost of a pledge level will not count as credit in BackerKit. Only give more than a pledge level if you want us to spend your money making the show awesome.\nIf you're a creator who loves JourneyQuest, this may be the most exciting news of all: we're releasing the World of Fartherall under ZOE's new Shared Cinematic Universe License Agreement (the SCULA).\nWhat does this mean?\nIt's like the Open Gaming License and Creative Commons had little license babies: it's an agreement that gives you permission to create, adapt, and release your own derivative works within the world of Fartherall!\nCheck out the web page for the full details, but the fast, dirty, and legally-nonbinding summary is that as long as you abide by the terms of the agreement, you have the freedom to create non-commercial AND commercial Fartherall derivatives. Make a roleplaying game. Shoot a web series. Create your art. Sell it if you want. Or give it away. It's your choice.\nYou, the fans, have made these works possible and this new agreement helps us give back. Come and play, you're invited!\nJust remember to Share Alike, Transform (don't copy), provide accurate Attribution, and don't break the law.\nPlus, if you want your creations to become a canon part of the world, we offer a path to make them official. And a cool seal. It's pretty awesome.\nIN CLOSING...\nThank you for supporting more creations within the world of Fartherall! We're thrilled to bring back JourneyQuest and to help make Seasons 4 & 5 easier and faster to shoot. And to tell the complete story.\nWe are a fan supported and creator distributed company and we exist entirely because of the support from fans like you.\nWe also know that money isn't the most important part of your pledge. A pledge is an emotional investment in a shared goal. You're a key part of our community, whether you're giving one dollar or a thousand.\nAnd a pledge is only part of the process. We succeed when we work together: to fund the campaign, to spread the word, to encourage the creators, and to create a community where everyone is welcome.\nWelcome to the ZOE family!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we work hard to mitigate our risks, the unforeseen can always throw a curve ball. Sometimes we have to recast a role at the last minute. Sometimes we have to redo work in post if it doesn't meet our standards. Sometimes product gets delayed at the manufacturer. But with a nine-year track record of success, our reputation should speak for itself.\n\nAdditionally, we now have excellent relationships with manufacturers, our fulfillment partners at Ship Naked, the team at BackerKit, and everyone else who's part of making sure that our campaigns are completed to your satisfaction.\n\nWhile the story that we create may not match the one in your head, we're excited to move closer to the epic conclusion of JourneyQuest in Season 5, where all of the pieces fit together and resolve.

If you'd like to grab a copy of Olympus Inc in .PDF or print or even the entire Fabled Environments catalog, check out the \"Add-Ons\" below! To learn even more about the book, keep scrolling! \nTo add onto your pledge to grab these items, simply use the \"Manage your pledge \" button once you've pledged or add the amount of the \"Add-On\" to your initial pledge. :-)\nWelcome to the Kickstarter for The Pelion Report. Thanks for checking us out! This is the Kickstarter for the second setting book for Olympus Inc. Just to be clear you need both the original Olympus Inc book(Need a copy? Look above for \"Add-Ons\")  and the Savage Worlds core rulebook to play. For a test drive of the Savage Worlds rules, click here \nSo what is the world of Olympus Inc like? I\u2019m glad you asked! Unlike most settings that have tackled the concept of demigods in the modern world, we are a bit different. Olympus, Inc answers the question of what would happen if the Olympians were kicked out of the heavens by Gaia and the Titans ruled instead. \nAfter she ejected them from the heavens, Gaia was also kind enough to use the Lethe River to cause all humans to forget that the Olympians existed. This nearly killed the Olympians, who began to fade away. However, the Olympians realized that they could draw from our obsession with the almighty dollar and gain power. Therefore, the Olympians traded their stone temples for towers of glass and steel. They formed the world's largest corporations. Now the Titans and Olympians fight a battle for control of the Heavens and Earth with each wielding incredible power. In the midst of all of this are normal humans who are asleep to everything that is around them.\nGaia has put a few rules in place to ensure that the Titans and Olympians don't tear each other apart as well as the rest of the inhabitants on Earth. This safeguard is known as the Nemesis Effect. The Nemesis Effect prohibits the use of visible supernatural abilities in front of sleepers (normal mortals). It also prohibits mythical creatures from appearing in front of a sleeper in their true form. If anyone breaks the rules, the Goddess Nemesis punishes them. It can be anything from being wracked with intense pain to death. It really depends on the severity of the infraction. \nTherefore, the Titans and Olympians fight a secret proxy war in a world identical to our own. However, most humans don't know that the gods exist and they certainly don't know that monsters and demigods with superhuman abilities roam the earth.\nThe Pelion Report is slated to be roughly 120 pages and adds to the already rich Olympus Inc setting by presenting five new Paragon bloodlines (Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Hephaestus and Hera) and two new Demihuman bloodlines (Cyclospawn and Centaur). Like the Minospawn presented in our first book, Cyclospawn are human size versions of their mythical cousins. In the case of Cyclospawn, each member of this bloodline is a human size Cyclops. \nEach of the new bloodlines has its own set of powers. In the case of the Paragon bloodlines, the book presents new corporations and subsidiaries that reflect the parent Olympian's spheres of influence. Not to be forgotten, The Pelion Report also presents new powers for existing bloodlines as well.  On the Titan side, we do present new corporations that GMs can utilize to make life more interesting for their players.\nAlong with new bloodlines and powers, the book contains a plethora of new edges and hindrances as well as new NPCs, IMBs Slosi and more! In addition to new equipment and weapons, The Pelion Report has rules for working with Orichalcum. Skilled PCs can infuse Orichalcum with properties that allow them to craft better weapons, equipment, ammunition and more!\nAs far as artwork is concerned, we plan to use a combination of top-notch color and B&W artwork. To get a taste for the feel and some of the crunch and the artwork in The Pelion Report, check out the sneak peek available through DrivethruRPG.com. Click here to take a look! \nIn our stretch goals, you may notice some minor Greek deities listed. Minor deities do not have Paragon bloodlines. Instead, they have powers that Protean bloodlines can draw from. We wanted to do something to make the Protean bloodline more appealing to players and this is one way that we have envisioned to do this. Minor deities have a much shorter list of associated bloodline powers than their Paragon counterparts, but these powers are still quite interesting and effective. In addition, minor deities don't have their own corporate conglomerates. Instead, many spearhead subsidiaries under the control of one of the major Greek deities.\nGilbert is an experienced Tabletop RPG writer with several projects to his credit including Mythos and related supplements, Olympus Inc and Rockopolis.

It isn\u2019t your lives that are at risk. In Nexus you and your friend will be playing the role of a Lanista. Think Don King, but instead of Mike Tyson, the two of you will be commanding genetically engineered gladiators called Helots. Just like Don, you don\u2019t care if they live or die, win or lose, as long as it entertains the fans! Your fame and fortunes are all that truly matter.  \nPeople's Champion\nHigh atop your Aeries, a kind of hovercraft that sits above the action, you both shout out commands to your hapless servants. Your Helots have the attention spans of goldfish and these space barge arenas are rife with distractions. The thunderous crowd noise coupled with the smell of rotting flesh from previous bouts do nothing to help a Helot\u2019s concentration. Needless to say not every command gets through.\n Your Helot will use these points to perform numerous actions such as movement, attacks, grappling and in some cases acrobatic feats such as standing up. You will receive bonuses for positioning relative to your opponent and could suffer disadvantages based upon your positioning relative to the environment. Be mindful of your surroundings.\nHoarder\nEach Lanista marks off the values from one to six on their individual Turning Point Counters as they are achieved during their Action Point Rolls that begin each action round.\nTurning Point Counter\nOnce all values from one to six have been rolled a Turning Point is achieved and a respective card is drawn. These cards can be beneficial or detrimental to your Helot. Some are neither and only good for a laugh.\nTurning Point Cards\nA barge arena equipped with floor saws is certain to elicit excitement. When a Lanista tosses an Action Point Roll and finds that he has previously rolled that value the spectators cheer and both Lanistas brace for something extraordinary. It is time for a Floor Saw to scream across the barge arena floor indiscriminately ripping flesh and limb from any Helot unfortunate enough to find itself in its path.\nTo determine a Floor Saw\u2019s starting position the Lanistas use NEXUS RPO (Randomly Placed Object) rules. Each Lanista rolls a d8 and uses its value along with the numbered board grid to determine the Floor Saw\u2019s starting location. After the Lanista triggering the Floor Saw roles a directional die the floor saw is off to do the rippin\u2019 and the tearin\u2019.\nWeapon Crates \u2013 Bust them open to equip a Helot with a random weapon card.  \nRadioactive Waste Barrels \u2013 Eats away at a Helot\u2019s Action Points the closer it gets. \nBraziers \u2013 Kick them over and watch the fire spread across the arena floor. \nThe Creature Pit \u2013 Complete with its own AI deck. \nThe Barge Beast \u2013 150 mm of pure AI deck destruction roaming the arena. You must decide if your Helot will team up or does it kill its opponent and try to take on the beast alone?\nand Many More...\nThe board is made of sturdy plastic with grooves that when combined with the custom bases keep the pieces from being knocked around by table bumping do to aggressive shit talking and high fives.  \nThe beautifully illustrated cards are made of PVC plastic. So, no need to sleeve.  \nThe coins have a middle finger on them and are made of metal.  \nJust about the only cardboard you will receive is the box the game comes in.\nThe book is hard-cover faux leather bound with over 200 pages of lore, artwork and RPG rules for developing your Lanista and its troupe of Helots. Gain additional influence cards, bribe barge captains and get your Helots access to better weapons and armor as you profit from their brutal existence.\n       While we include the rules for the one-off game for you to download and review we do not include the PDF of the NEXUS RULEBOOK for the same reason any RPG wouldn\u2019t. While it isn\u2019t entirely an RPG in the traditional sense there is a great deal that has gone into this 200+ page rulebook. The book is packed with Illustrations, lore and loads of additional rules that will maximize your enjoyment of game. Below is an overview of some of the enhanced game mechanics you will find within its pages.  \nBarge Beast\nYou will continue to play the role of the Lanista and track your progress with the included character sheets. You will keep track of your character's\u2026  \nBitcoin (finances) \nInfluence (EXP) \nProminence (level) \nTroupe of Helots \nWin/Loss Records\nBloodthirster\nAs a starting Lanista you will begin with a troupe of 3 Helots. Each of your Helots will have their own character sheets. You will track your Helots\u2019\u2026\nRep (EXP) \nFame (Level) \nInjuries and Insanites \nEquipment Win/Loss Records\nCritiqueur\nEach bout will have its own rewards for each of the participating Lanistas as well as their Helots.  \nLanistas will earn Bitcoin and Influence based on bout purses that are established before the bout begins. These purses are calculated based on the Fame of the competing Helots.\nHelots will earn Cred during the bout itself. Cred is achieved by performing various actions during the barge bout. This takes the focus from simply defeating an opponent and shifts it to putting on a show. At the end of the bout any Cred achieved from each participating helot is translated into Rep. \nFamished\nAs a Helot rises in Fame it not only rewards its Lanista with additional Influence and Bitcoin during the bout purse phase, but it also opens access to better weapons and armor to be used in future events.  \nSadist\nAs Lanistas rise in Prominence they begin to unlock additional Influence Cards, their maximum troupe of Helots increase, Influence and Bitcoin rewards compound and increase as their Helots add your Prominence to their Fame calculations when checking requirements for their weapons and armor.\nSupremacist\nThis version of the game also features\u2026  \nBout Fees \nHelot Repair Costs \nHelot Purchase Costs \nBout Wagering \nThe Fame Action Group \nHelot Weapons and Armor \nRaids \nUnique Turning Point Cards \nZealot\nWith the first expansion already being developed including\u2026  \nCybernetics \nThe D-Mart \nMutations \nSanctioned Barges and Hazards \nSpecialty Motivations \nAnd Much More!\nWe have worked hard to find a way to service everyone wanting to back the project. We realize that our game is bringing in different people from different genres and you have all been attracted by different things. Some of you have been drawn in by the artwork, some by the humor, some by the lore and many of you by the miniatures.\nWe are also well aware that there are many different types of miniature hobbyists out there. Some of you prefer to assemble and paint resin miniatures, because you want to see every bit of detail from the original sculpts. While others would love that , but would much prefer the savings that plastic brings and find that level of detail satisfactory. \nThere are also those of you that just want to play the game and are either sick of having to paint miniatures or simply have no desire to.\nAnd then there are some who just want a copy of the rule book.\nWe did our best to have you all covered.\nSome things to keep in mind...\nPlastic sets will be manufactured in bulk and will all be delivered at the same time.\nPlastic is lighter and less expensive to ship than the resin miniatures.\nWe will fulfill resin orders on a first-come, first-served basis with resin sets having priority over a la carte resin miniatures.\nAs resin figures are cast by hand and it is a labor-intensive, time-consuming process, there may be a delay in filling your order if demand is great. Please be patient!\nWe have made the decision to not use stretch goals as a marketing strategy in this campaign. The only way to make stretch goals work without exposing ourselves is to pull stuff out of the box, then start putting things back in as funding hits certain marks. Instead of doing this, we put everything in the box already and have planned timed-releases.\nWe will be posting a different miniature add-on as a timed release every 3rd day of the Kickstarter! These will be previously unseen alternate Helot Motivation miniatures and will only be available in resin. Again, a new resin miniature will be released as an add-on every 3 days regardless of funding amount!\nWe also have a lot of cool stuff planned for the pledge manager after the campaign. Pin-Ups, T-Shirts, Original Artwork, and even an opportunity to collaborate with us in the creation of custom Turning Point Cards along with other goodies which will all be available to backers after the campaign in the form of add-ons. We will be releasing more information about these items as the campaign progresses.\n<SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN RELEASED SO FAR>\nPLAY\n\na series of articles and interviews with the creators\nTHE D-VERSE and ITS NEXUS\nThroughout the infinite expanse of time, every intelligent race eventually realizes their universe is expanding. Upon discovering this, it becomes apparent that while there is no end to space, there is, in fact, a center of it. For those possessing the technology and an adventurous drive, reaching this \u201cmiddle\u201d of their universe becomes an ultimate goal. Once there, they find an inter-dimensional gathering of the most advanced species in the multiverse and are considered to have \u201carrived\u201d as an esteemed and respected member of the D-Verse. The D-Verse, as it has come to be called, refers to the seemingly infinite dimensions that share this junction at the center of their respective universes. \nLANISTAS\nAt this central meeting point of all known dimensions, a brutal and no-holds-barred bloodsport known as Nexus is held. For eons, countless beings have converged to pit their greatest champions against one another aboard bloodstained barges. Nexus bouts have become the most popular form of entertainment across the furthest corners of time and space. And overseeing it all, permeated with the stench of death and decadence, are the masters of this pandimensional dynasty\u2014the Lanistas. \nHere is where we find you, a young entrepreneur looking for fame and fortune, out to make a name for himself and his species among the legendary ranks of the Nexus Lanistas. The long-storied history of Lanistas is filled with rags-to-riches tales of interdimensional nobodies and their ascent to power. Those among this Nexus elite are without equal in the prestige and influence they command. With success comes anything imaginable (universal fame, near-infinite wealth, endless political and judicial favors, etc.). Count yourself lucky\u2014whether good luck or bad\u2014to even be given this opportunity.  \nWelcome to the seedy, salacious, and oh-so-profitable underworld of Nexus! \nREGISTRATION WITH THE INC\nThe Interdimensional Nexus Commission (INC) is the regulating body behind Nexus. After you file the proper documentation and bribe the necessary high-ranking board members, the INC will issue your Lanista License. The INC oversees everything from barge inspections to Helot cloning standards. If you are looking to be a major Nexus player, then there is no way around dealing with the INC\u2026 except for when there is, of course. INC-sanctioned barge bouts broadcasted across blood.stream are the most viewed events in the D-Verse. It is there that your legacy will join the ranks of legend or fade into obscurity.  \nNEXUS BARGES\nINC-sanctioned barge bouts take place on Nexus barges. When entering the D-Verse nexus the first thing you will see are hundreds of these barges tethered together. Some are quite ornate and massive while other seem hastily made and designed to draw as little attention as possible. Species from across the D-Verse are gathered here, placing bets, haggling with Gnoems, or looking for marks. You will see INC officers everywhere looking for, and raiding, unsanctioned matches in hopes of making arrests (but more likely collecting bribes). Nothing prepares one for this strange sight of countless beings spread across hundreds of barges that are infested with violence and bustling with activity.   \nGNOEMS\nSo, you want to buy a Helot? Then you\u2019re looking for the Gnoems. Gnoems were the first race to discover the D-Verse nexus. Ever since, they\u2019ve been traveling between dimensions collecting and analyzing DNA from countless species. Their accumulated knowledge coupled with their familiarity with pandimensional lifeforms has earned them the nickname \u201cToy Makers,\u201d and makes them the only source of Helots that are worthy to compete in Nexus. Gnoem expertise, while unmatched, is still limited. Some of the nuances of other lifeforms tend to escape them. Gnoems, for example, have no gender, so their attempts at breeding species could get a bit unsettling. In fact, nothing is quite as terrifying as watching two males attempt to conceive a child for fear of torture by the Gnoems\u2019 devices. Due to this, the INC established guidelines instructing Gnoems to sell genetic clones of only the samples they have collected and discouraging them against further abduction of lifeforms from their home worlds.\nHELOTS\nThe official term for a Nexus fighter is a Helot, although they are more commonly known among Gnoems as \u201cMamluk\u201d (the Gnoem word for \u201cmeat\u201d). Helots are grown by Gnoems in what are known as the Meat Gardens. For a reasonable fee, aspiring Lanistas can purchase their future champion from the Meat Garden\u2019s weekly harvest. Gnoem Helots are in large demand; unless you\u2019re paying premium prices, you just get the next one off the line. No refunds. If you don\u2019t like the result, kill it and buy another. If you\u2019re squeamish however, the Gnoems will gladly destroy your unwanted Helot for you (but they keep the leftover organic matter).\nGnoems have already handled everything concerning your new purchase. Helots come out of the Gardens ready to fight. From an early age, they are given a series of tests to determine their motivation to survive. These tests involve analysis as subjects are exposed to extreme mental and physical stimulus. Gnoems will always find a way to motivate a Helot. Upon purchasing your Helot, you will receive his Biometric Species Analysis. This sheet will give you a comprehensive explanation of not only your Helot\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, but also how to care for your Helot. Be sure to keep the sheet and the information on it updated, as it will be handy if you are given the opportunity to sell any organic matter after the Helot expires. This, however, is very unlikely; the Spleen Team is very thorough.  \nTHE SPLEEN TEAM\nThe official cleaning service of the INC. After any officially INC-sanctioned barge bout, there is a wealth of equipment and biological matter left behind. The Spleen Team is there to steal\u2026 err\u2026 \u201cclean up\u201d the mess. Any disregarded Helot and their belongings are collected by the Spleen Team and redistributed by the INC\u2019s charitable Weapons for Tots program\u2014furthering their mission of putting a weapon in every child\u2019s hand. As far as leftover biological matter, Gnoems are always interested in collecting whatever the Spleen Team doesn\u2019t eat.   \nTHE BOOK\nIf Helots engage in a barge bout and nobody is betting on it, did it ever really happen? Gambling on Nexus outcomes is far and away the number one moneymaker in the D-Verse, making \u201cThe Book\u201d the nexus of Nexus. The Book is the official odds-maker and bookie of Nexus. Not much is known about what goes on behind the scenes of The Book. That said, The Book is the only organization that the INC fears. While the INC has spoken in the past about the Nexus\u2019 \u201cintegrity\u201d and how the Nexus must steer clear of gambling connections to eliminate any nefarious actions (fixing bouts, etc.), its actions suggest otherwise.   \nWhile nobody (at least, nobody alive) can draw a direct line between the INC and The Book, many rumors suggest the two organizations are, in fact, one and the same. One extremely vocal propagator of such information is the interdimensional hacker and pirate broadcaster known as Crypt. Crypt has been a thorn in the side of both The Book and INC for the last millennia. Recently, many of Crypt\u2019s sources have found themselves conducting interviews in Gnoem torture devices, but Crypt has thus far eluded capture.\nD-MART\nWhoever said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the weapon; it\u2019s the Helot behind it!\u201d was an idiot. They have obviously never seen what a Krillion Forearm Blade can do to an opponent\u2019s flesh. The right weapons and armor can make or break a Helot in the barge arena. While weapons aren\u2019t cheap, they are necessary. An investment in your Helot\u2019s equipment is an investment in your Helot\u2019s future. The Nexus Dimensional Market, better known as D-Mart, is your one-stop-shop for the greatest weapons and armors in the D-Verse.   \nManufacturers from across the D-Verse compete here for profit and exposure. They sell everything from tried-and-true classics to cutting edge, next-gen, and highly experimental weapon systems. Their armors\u2014commonly known as \u201cMeat Packaging\u201d\u2014are detested among Gnoems, having been blamed for the first decrease in Helot sales in four centuries.\nBe warned! These vendors won\u2019t just sell to anyone. A Helot getting destroyed in a particular vendor\u2019s equipment is never good for that vendor\u2019s sales. The more established vendors require the Helot and their Lanista to have a bit of notoriety and experience before they will consider selling their wares. For these same reasons, vendors may also require a Helot to have a specific skill set.  \nMORE ABOUT BARGES and BARGE BOUTS\nThere are a dizzying number of barges in the nexus, with new ones being flown in every day. It is every Lanista\u2019s dream to one day have their own officially INC-sanctioned barge. The amount of money and resources involved is steep, and that\u2019s not accounting for the equally pricey under-the-table costs. This hindrance to free market violence means there are many unsanctioned barges to be found in the nexus. This is most likely where you will begin your career as a Lanista. Not by owning an unsanctioned barge, mind you, but by having your Helots compete on these floating piles of\u2026 well, sub-quality vessels.   \nThis does, however, have its advantages. First off, you make far more bitcoin when avoiding the INC\u2019s bout fees. You usually must hire your own cleaning crew\u2014that\u2019s good news because that means no Spleen Team involvement! You can collect all your dead Helot\u2019s equipment and biomatter. And think of all the interesting people you\u2019ll meet!  \nNow for the downsides.  \nFirst, unsanctioned bouts don\u2019t bring anywhere near the exposure of an officially INC-sanctioned barge. While you might grow in popularity among the \u201chardcore\u201d fans, nobody important will know you or your Helots exist\u2014except the INC, which disapproves of not getting their cut.  \nThis brings us to the second problem: Raids.  \nINC officers take their duties very seriously. They\u2019re quite vigilant in their search for rogue barges to shakedown for bribes. Whenever your Helots engage in an unsanctioned barge bout, there\u2019s a chance of a raid. If this happens, you\u2019ll find the INC cut to be quite generous in comparison. It\u2019s a small comfort knowing that you\u2019ll have no choice in the beginning of your Lanista career. Your crap Helots will most likely die on crap barges after raids bleed you dry and you\u2019ll fade into obscurity like billions before.\nGood luck!\nNEXUS is the result of 2 guys, who grew up together in Detroit, working on their passion while also holding down full time jobs, raising 6 kids between them, attending soccer games, baseball, and a myriad of other activities. Imagine what other things we could create if this was our full-time job. When you back Nexus, yes you are buying a game, but you are also funding a company who will bring you innovative, smart, and nostalgic projects like this for years to come.   \nOur purpose is greater than ourselves. We want to elevate the real rock stars in our eyes \u2013 those are the artists, the writers, the guys that stay up all night developing unique game mechanics, and many more of the talented people who have a passion for the tabletop gaming industry but just haven\u2019t had the chance to make a living from it yet.  \nWe believe this expressly fits the spirit of Kickstarter and is why we have chosen it for our funding platform. There have been many people that have helped us along the way to where we are. We are very thankful for each and every one of them and it is our hope that with the success of the NEXUS Kickstarter will also come the success of many talented individuals who will get to do the things they love as a means to earn a living.\nall of our CUTE & FLUFFY Super-Fans!\nDavid Benson - Eddie Bianco - Clint and Jodi Black - Sax Carr - Lizzy & Derek Funkhouser - Robert Geistlinger - Matt Kaminski - David Kartzinel - Becca Scott Kerns - Ryan Lang - Logician TIm - Teri Litorco - Jake Michels - Adam Minton - Jeff Neckermann - Doug Rosenthal - Jeremy Salinas - Ryan Schoon - Mark Streed - David Waybright - Daniel Zayas\nof course all of our friends and family\nand last but certainly not least...

This is our first Kickstarter and we have done a lot of research. Having backgrounds in project management, we know that research can only get you so far, it is real experience that delivers the best outcomes. Knowing this, we have brought on board Kickstarter veterans that have been mentoring us and providing sound advice through the process and will continue to do so after the campaign. Very few campaigns are immune to issues such as shipping delays and customs and we are doing the best we can to get the very best in the industry to help fulfill those needs and ensure delivery as smooth as possible. \n\nNEXUS is close to completion. The rest of the touch-ups will take place during and after the Kickstarter taking into consideration backer suggestions and feedback. These shouldn\u2019t cause any problems and after everything is fully complete and polished, production will begin as we continue to keep a keen eye on quality, since that is very important to us. You can expect regular and informative updates after we have funded, monthly at a minimum. Thanks again for your time and consideration.

The number one request, by far, was Fireball Island. After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome!

See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

I grew up loving those shows--where a cast of not-quite-human outcasts protect the world from nefarious threats and costumed maniacs. But outside of some long out of print books, no RPG has managed to capture the fun, excitement, and sheer oddity of those stories.\nI want to change that.\nSo I'm creating KUNG FU ANIMALS (SAVE THE WORLD) using the fast, fun, and furious Savage Worlds roleplaying system.\nI'm a huge fan of Savage Worlds, having played it for years and even using it for my own neo-noir crime setting, Streets of Bedlam.\nAward-winning Savage Worlds plus award-winning Jason L Blair equals Saturday Morning Awesomeness!\nWhat is KFA(STW)?\nKUNG FU ANIMALS (SAVE THE WORLD) is a setting for the hugely-popular and immensely-fun Savage Worlds roleplaying system. It's a book that gives players the tools to create their own wild universes where semi-human characters become the world's greatest heroes. We start with your character's Origin--did they come to being by accident? Experiment? Are they an alien? A machine?--and then build from there. Each step, you get Edges, Hindrances, and Skills that help shape your unique character.\nPlayer groups are encouraged to build groups together as the best source material revolves around groups of diverse personalities who work together. Pick the size of your group, from lone wolf to dynamic duo to a sprawling troupe of heroes. The size of the group determines the dynamic--and the roles within the group. Is your character the jokester? The leader? The rebel? Or maybe they're the mascot? Or master? You have tons of options, each granting specific bonuses that help your character stand out for their unique qualities.\nAs with all Savage Settings, KUNG FU ANIMALS (SAVE THE WORLD) is all about getting you to the table and playing as soon as possible. Character creation is quick--and you can shortcut the process even further by selecting a pre-made archetype, adding a few points, and being ready to roll in minutes.\nOne night in the lab, Dr. Emil Ratzenberger experiences a life-changing accident due to blatant OSHA violations.\nWhat's Done? What's Left?\nThe player rules text for KUNG FU ANIMALS (SAVE THE WORLD) is done and ready for review the moment you back this project. You can find a Dropbox link in the first backers-only update.\nAll that's left for me to do, text-wise, is the introduction and the game moderator chapters that finalize the toolset for anyone to create and run their own series. I'm working on those concurrent to this Kickstarter. I aim to have this all wrapped up by early Summer.\nIn addition, I am creating the first supplement KUNG FU ANIMALS (HIT THE ROAD) which will introduce FIFTY Kung Fu Animals archetypes--one unique to each of the fifty United States!\nAlso! I will be creating a PDF-only setting called \"Universe of Monsters.\" This setting will only be available through this Kickstarter as an add-on in the reward tiers to the right.\nReally, this Kickstarter's main focus is on securing some amazing artwork for the final book. I've already commissioned a handful of illustrations that you can see here but I need more--a lot more! I've taken great care in finding talented folks and getting the best artwork I can for my projects. I am very happy to say I've lined up some amazing new talent and some industry vets to help bring this book to life.\nDr. Ratzenberger now faces off against his unscrupulous former employer as the vigilante called Ratzman.\nWhat's the Final Product?\nKUNG FU ANIMALS (SAVE THE WORLD) will be available as a illustrated 7\"x10\" softcover book with a full-color cover and black and white interiors. The digital version will be a PDF export of those same printer files.\nSetting Books, such as the Kickstarter-exclusive \"Universe of Monsters,\" will be PDF-only supplements.\nPhysical copies will be ordered, signed, and mailed by me.

But your friends took a peek and now they all want to grow their own god. You\u2019ve got your trusty twelve-gauge handy to blast a tentacle here and there and make sure your creature grows to completion first. To do otherwise would be madness!\n  Building An Elder God is a fast-playing card game of Lovecraftian construction for 2-5 players ages 8 and up. The rules are easy to learn and a typical game takes from 15-30 minutes, depending on the number of players. Build a Cthulhu-esque tentacled monstrosity to completion before the other players, using damage cards to blast your opponents\u2019 creatures (and slow down their progress) in order to win! There are 115 standard cards in the set, plus 10 Necronomicon pieces. A full-color rulebook is included.\nGameplay: Draw a card, play a card. You either choose a tentacle card to grow or heal your own beast, or play a damage card to blast off the tentacle of an opponent's monster. The Necronomicon and Elder Sign pieces provide additional options to heal yourself or punish your foes!\nThe game is complete, and in fact sold through its first printing a few years ago! We're running this crowdfunding campaign to bring Building An Elder God back to gamer shelves and into stores while making a higher-quality product the second go-around.\nWhat's Changed? We are making sure the stock and coating will make the cards sturdy yet easy to handle and shuffle right out of the box. The Head and Body cards now have alternate sides so that everyone's monster can look unique at the table. The Necronomicon pieces are now punch-out cardstock rather than cards the players are expected to cut themselves. And we've done a light rewrite of the rules for clarity and are printing them in full color.\n  Building An Elder God got a shout-out as Best Kids Game of 2011 in episode #239 of The Dice Tower podcast by Chris of The Secret Cabal.

In addition I have run three Kickstarter campaigns in the past\u2014all funded, and all shipped out the primary rewards to backers. But I discovered how easy it can be to underestimate the time and expense necessary to deliver stretch goals and secondary rewards. It's important to avoid those pitfalls, so I'm implementing the following for this campaign:\n\nSimplicity: It's tempting to chase a high-dollar total by adding lots of stretch goals and extra rewards. Being a one-man company working with a talented-but-busy freelance artist, I'm going to keep the focus on the core game. We may add a few stretch goals but they will likely be digital rewards or improvements to the core product.\n\nTransparency: I'm separating the funds from this crowdfunding campaign in a separate account, and will create a backer-accessible spreadsheet that shows each expenditure and explains what the funds are being used for. This will remain live until all rewards have been shipped.\n\nThe only delays to delivery I can foresee would include unexpected hold-ups from the printer, overseas shipping, or delay in customs when the product enters the United States. We've built-in some time to help account for those and give us enough resources to get things shipped to our backers!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jamie Chambers\n5 created \u00b7 137 backed\nJamie Chambers is an award-winning, best-selling tabletop game designer with nearly two decades of publishing experience.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Can Gallant Knight Games handle this project? \nThis is Gallant Knight Games sixth Kickstarter, and we learned a lot from the first five. We've been early or on time every time. We have two projects that's are not out to backers yet, but one is currently printing and preparing for fulfillment, and the other is exactly on track and this project will not impact that one. This is a straightforward project with few nuances, but we're prepared to handle them, and we're shooting for the same exceptional success we've already had!\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished? \nA: The draft text of all the rules is 100% done. All the art that isn't tied to stretch goals is in and done. The only text we're waiting on is the stretch goals and some of the newer adaptation of the latest books into the text, and as we depend on the backers to determine what needs to be written, those will come throughout and after the Kickstarter.\n\nQ: What if the complexity of the project overwhelms GKG? \nA: We have straight forward pledge levels to make it easy to manage, and we've budgeted our stretch goals up to our cap. In order to keep the project manageable for our small team, we've elected to minimize our stretch goals to text increases, and we've set a finite limit of page count.\n\nQ: What about delays in art? \nA: We've already began to contract out the art, and some of the art is already here. Isn't it great? We're really happy with our artists. If there's a delay on the art, we have back-up artists we've already done test runs and are ready to work with.\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs? \nA: Shipping costs constantly rise, and while we've projected them to the best of our abilities, there's not a lot we can do if they change. However, due to the limitations on the size of our product, we're confident this won't be an issue.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals? \nA: If something were to happen to Alan, or another writer on the project, we've identified our backups, and our team is spread all over the world. It'd take a really big asteroid, zombie apocalypse or alien invasion to wipe us all out. The files and plans have been communicated to the whole team, and a new project lead (who has been identified) will step up.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "Coin Only!", "descp": "This pledge level is for folks who want the challenge coin and the challenge coin only.\nThe coin will only be produced if we raise $70,000, but folks wanted to \"pre-order\" it to help us get there, so we're allowing that!\nShipping will be handled in BackerKit after the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["164 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "PUFF Level 1", "descp": "You get all the digital goodies for the campaign!\nIt's that simple and to the point.\nINCLUDES:\nMHI:RPG - Savage Worlds Edition PDF\nMHI Action Deck PDF\nAll Digital Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}], "stat": ["221 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "PUFF Level 2", "descp": "This is the basic physical level.

Titan Effect is set in a contemporary world where psychic spies clash with genetically enhanced soldiers in a secret war in which the future of human evolution is at stake.\nTake on the role of a trained operative gifted with psychic abilities. Perform dangerous missions all over the world for the international clandestine organization known as the SPEAR, and fight against dangerous creatures and organizations. Survive long enough, and maybe you will be able to make a difference.\nTitan Effect RPG requires the Savage Worlds Core Rules and the Super Powers Companion (2nd edition). \n         Softcover mockup\nThe world of Titan Effect is like ours but darker and stranger. Psychics and augmented humans are used as spies and soldiers on behalf of criminal organizations, private military companies, and secret societies in a secret war that has been raging for decades. Some are fighting for control and power, while others seek to shape the future of human evolution.\nIn the middle of this conflict, stands the worldwide clandestine organization known as the Special Executive Assault and Recon or SPEAR. Its mission: to track and neutralize eugenics and psychic threats, and to prevent the world from falling into chaos. To succeed in its mission, the SPEAR hires people with unique sets of skills and possessing powerful psychic abilities. Its agents come from different nationalities and backgrounds.\nPlayers take on the role of psychic operatives trained in black operations, and working for the international clandestine organization known as the SPEAR. They have the task to perform dangerous missions all over the world and fight against dangerous creatures and organizations. Some are there to make a difference, others for the thrill or because they have no other place to go.\nTitan Effect RPG combines biopunk, spy thriller, and superhero elements. Imagine Tom Clancy meets Metal Gear Solid meets the X-Men. Titan Effect RPG plunges you into a world filled with conspiracies, secret organizations, dangerous biotechnologies and psychic phenomena. A world where the boundary between \"good\" and \"evil\" is blurred...\nIllustration made by Vargasni\nWhat's inside?\nTitan Effect RPG will be available in two versions: \nA low-resolution PDF version adapted for screens and tablets. It will also be bookmarked, searchable, printer-friendly, and DRM free.\nA printed version available in Softcover and Hardcover that will be released in a 7\"x10\" format. \nThe interior of these two versions will contain a mix of black-and-white and full-color illustrations. We estimate the final version of Titan Effect to be around 132 full-color pages.\nSoftcover mockup\nYou will find inside:  \nNew Edges and Hindrances; \nNew Setting Rules, including fast modern hacking rules; \nNew gear, gadgets, and weapons, compatible with other modern settings;\nAn exclusive Equipment Point System (EPS) to easily and dynamically handle the \"gear-up phase\" of your teams before each mission;\nBackground and rules to play psychics with the Super Powers Companion, including new powers; \n6 new pre-generated characters.\nInformation about the SPEAR;\nAlternative timeline with historical events that shaped Titan Effect's universe;\n6 major enemy organizations and how to use them in your campaign;  \n40+ NPCs and creatures;\nCampaign ideas and adventure hooks;\nA Mission Generator to help you build quickly adventures;\nA full introductory adventure following Operation: Sharashka (see Demo Kit). \nOther cool stuff! \nPlease note: a copy of the Savage Worlds Core Rules and the Super Powers Companion are necessary to play and are not included in any reward level. You can buy both of them now at www.peginc.com or on DriveThruRPG for $9.99 each! If you aren\u2019t familiar with Savage Worlds, you can directly download the Test Drive Rules on Pinnacle Entertainment Group\u2019s website.\nOptional Rules: For those who don't own the Super Powers Companion and who still want to get Titan Effect RPG, we will provide a short PDF with optional rules to play psychics with only Savage Worlds Core Rules. However, we highly recommend you use the Super Powers Companion if you want to capture all the flavor of Titan Effect RPG and enjoy the gameplay as it was initially designed.\nYou can download for FREE an alternate version of the Demo Kit with these new rules here! \nCurrent State\nTitan Effect Beta\nTitan Effect RPG is the result of a very long development and has been the subject of many avatars, including an aborted animated series project and a comic book project (still in development), before becoming a role-playing game. Today, we are proud to finally show the result. Titan Effect RPG is 75% complete, with most of the texts, the layout, and some of the illustrations.\nWe have been running playtests for more than a year and launched a closed beta with a dozen gamemasters. The feedback from our testers helped improve our campaign setting a great deal.\nTestimony:\nI had the honor of playtesting Titan Effect with my group, and we all liked it. I am a big fan of sci-fi kind of settings. This game is not your hardcore sci-fi, but it hit the right spots for me. I love the cloak and dagger feel of the game and love some of the new edges that they made for this game. I mean who doesn't want to play a gun carrying spy that can also throw something at you with his mind or make you think that there is a big baddy standing behind you? I love the system that they used for gear; it makes getting ready for the game so much easier and faster to get into the thick of things when you don't have to spend an hour buying gear. Great Game all around guys.\n\u2014 Robert B. Hensley III\nDemo Kit\nTitan Effect Demo Kit & character sheet\nYou can already download and test for FREE our Demo Kit for Titan Effect at drivethrurpg.com and our form-fillable character sheet.\nInside the Demo Kit you will find:  \nAn introduction to Titan Effect's universe. \nAn excerpt of Titan Effect setting rules.\nA short adventure.\nFive pre-generated characters.\nThe goal of this campaign is to help us complete our RPG by adding the final texts, more illustrations and to edit the book.

I can't say much about it, but it's going to expand Titan Effect's universe and will add a lot of mystery and new dangers. We have three major books planned for the moment: a sourcebook that will focus on the SPEAR with new rules and gear for the players (including rules to create HQs and rogue bio-augmented soldiers). Another sourcebook that will focus on the shadow war and all the enemy factions. Both will have campaign ideas and thematic, with probably tons of adventure hooks and a short campaign.

But when the unexpected threatens humanity, only an unlikely band of heroes can unravel a deadly conspiracy and try to avert the Fall!\nThis is what early reviewers have been saying about the game:\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the usual Firefly-meets-Star Wars space opera, it\u2019s more like The Expanse\u2026 Overall rating: 5 out of 5.\u201d  \u2013 Halfway Station\n\"A wealth of sci-fi that seems much more plausible than most sci-fi\" -- Roleplayer's Chronicle\n\"The Space combat system is diamond-hard\u2026 top-notch work!\" - Atomic Rockets.\n\"[The Seven Worlds Campaign] would make a pretty good TV series\" -- Halfway Station\nSeven Worlds has also received the Atomic Rockets Seal of Approval for Scientific Accuracy. This award, given to products that have shown strong adherence to science, fills us with pride and shows we're serious about science!\nThank you for supporting the Seven Worlds Kickstarter!\nWhat makes Seven Worlds special? Do we need yet another science-fiction setting and campaign for Savage Worlds? We believe there IS a niche for a new, unique setting, and here are some reasons why:\nThe Campaign is Epic!\nThe core of Seven Worlds is its awesome, world-shattering campaign! The setting was designed around the story, rather than the story around the setting, making for a rich environment where everything fits together. Inspired by classic science fiction books like The Expanse series and TV series like Battlestar Galactica and Babylon 5, as well as by such grand episodic RPG campaigns as the original Dragonlance saga, this is a story arc the players will never forget!\nThe campaign will be available as seven PDF-only modules and (after the modules have been released) as a single-volume 253-page Campaign Book. For more information on the campaign, check this Designer Diary on our blog site.\nIf you want to use the setting as a sandbox and ignore the campaign, you can do that as well! Check out the bios and character sheets for the sample characters Maricelle, Duarthe and Seela to see how deep the setting is!\nThe Science is Real!\nFrom star systems to technology and science, Seven Worlds is one of the most realistic SF settings this side of the classic 2300AD role-playing game, with a few concessions made when necessary to keep things fun (Psionics and FTL, for example). Plus, the Seven Worlds Setting Guide includes dozens of sidebars that explain off-the-wall scientific concepts and facts in plain language. If you ever wanted to know what space smells like, or why the Space Shuttle kept its cargo bay doors open while in orbit, then this is the book for you!\nAn example of the many scientific sidebars in the Seven Worlds Setting Guide\nThe Starmap is 3-D!\nIf real space is three-dimensional, how come we only role-play with 2-D, printed-on-a-page space maps? Not anymore! Seven Worlds comes with a digital 3-D map of known space in the year 2217, viewable on most compatible computers and tablets. Based on actual, real star positions and locations, and intimately tied to the plot of the campaign, the Seven Worlds 3-D starmap allows GMs and players to navigate the starmap to the setting in 3D and feel they truly are adventuring in space. Of course, the game also includes 2-D starmaps for those times when cracking open the laptop is overkill.\nCheck out a YouTube video of the Seven Worlds 3-D Starmap.\nThe Seven Worlds 3-D Starmap. Click to see a video demo!\n  The Space Battles are Unique!\nWhere would a realistic science-fiction game be without unique and innovative space combat rules? Seven Worlds contains extensive rules for scientifically-sound space combat. This is no WWII-dogfight-in-space (you know what movie we are thinking of)! From lasers to particle beams, from cloud projectiles to point defenses, from inertia movement to heat accumulation and radiation, live the challenging experience of combat in space!\nAnd we haven't even told you about the dozens of new Edges and Powers, gear, setting rules, assistants, and much, much more!\nWant to try out Seven Worlds before committing?

Check out this special bonus edition of The Wild Die Podcast with a detailed interview!\n  The Table of Contents for the Setting Guide. Lots of awesome content for you!\nWhat is Savage Worlds? If you're new to role-playing games (RPGs), or an old hand but are not familiar with Savage Worlds, this is what you need to know: Savage Worlds is a system for playing role-playing games in any genre: Fantasy, science-fiction, westerns, horror, you name it. You have to learn the simple rules once and then you're ready to play. You need a copy of Savage Worlds to play this game. Fortunately, there are many ways to get familiar with Savage Worlds!\nSeven Worlds is a product created by Intellistories, an official Savage Worlds Licensee!\n Watch a five-minute video review of the system here.\n Read this beautiful web-comic tutorial on Savage Worlds.\n Download the free Savage Worlds test drive rules. \nGet the print or PDF copy of Savage Worlds for less than $10, at the publisher's site or at most physical and online book and gaming stores.\nNote that Seven Worlds DOES NOT require the Science Fiction Companion to play, just the standard core Savage Worlds rules.\nLet's start with the good news: The game is 100% complete, the art is ready, the books are laid out and ready to go. What this means is that, assuming the Kickstarter funds successfully, backers will receive the complete PDF Setting Guide very shortly after the KS ends.\nThe Seven Worlds product line-up: Setting Guide, seven campaign modules available separately and as a one-volume Campaign Book.\nWhat's the Kickstarter for then, you ask? I'm running the Seven Worlds Kickstarter for two main reasons:\nTo recoup the art and layout costs for the almost seventy pieces of art for the game, including the gorgeous book covers by Aaron Riley and interior art and maps by Chiara di Francia and Keith Curtis.\nIf we get to fund the Kickstarter AND reach the $15,000 stretch goal, I should be able to change the printing process from Print-on-Demand (POD) to an offset print run. This will help get the Seven Worlds Setting Guide into shelves at stores everywhere, thus increasing the number of players who see, buy and play it; and giving the line a much better chance to thrive long into the future. As a thank you for helping me fund a print-run, every backer who ordered a  softcover POD Setting Guide should get a HARDCOVER Setting Guide instead at no extra cost (with the possible exception of a change in the shipping costs).\nRewards\nSo, what backer levels are available? Glad you asked!\nCitizen of the Seven Worlds ($7): (Seriously, could it be anything other than $7?) This is the level of those of you who want to help us be successful but are not interested in receiving any product, digital or otherwise. Thank you for your support!\nAlpha-level Officer ($15): This is for digital players, and includes the full 217-page PDF version of the Seven Worlds Setting Guide. The PDF is finished and ready to be distributed shortly after the Kickstarter campaign funds. NEW: Every previous and existing backer at this nd higher levels will also get listed in a new \"backer credits\" page in the Setting Guide PDF and printed book!\nBeta-level Officer ($40): This level includes the PDF Seven Worlds Setting Guide as well as a beautiful print-on-demand (POD), softcover copy of the Setting Guide, provided by DriveThruRPG. Shipping costs are not included (I'll contact you after the Kickstarter with the details on the process we'll follow to collect payment for shipping). The book is also ready to go and therefore you will also receive a communication with shipping payment information very shortly after the Kickstarter funds successfully (but please note that the $15,000 Stretch goal changes this! See below!)\nGamma-level Officer ($50): This is the ideal level for digital-only GMs, and includes the 217-page PDF version of the Seven Worlds Setting Guide; seven module PDFs covering the seven chapters of the Seven Worlds campaign, totaling 307 pages; and a single-volume 253-page PDF compilation of all seven modules, called the Seven Worlds Campaign Book. This represents a total of 777 pages of content (how's THAT for a great final page count?)! Note that you will receive the Setting Guide PDF very shortly after the Kickstarter successfully funds, and then you will receive the PDF modules at the rate of about one per month. Approximately one month after the last module is released you will receive the full PDF of the Campaign Guide. This should be around May/June 2018.\nDelta-level Officer ($75): This level is for GMs who like part of their stuff printed, and includes everything the Gamma-level has, plus a beautiful print-on-demand (POD), softcover copy of the Setting Guide, provided by DriveThruRPG. Shipping costs are not included, and see below for specific changes to the format and delivery date of the printed book that might occur if we reach the $15,000 stretch goal.\nEpsilon-level Officer ($110): Our premium level for want-it-all GMs! Includes everything the Delta-level has, plus a beautiful, print-on-demand (POD), softcover copy of the Campaign Book, provided by DriveThruRPG. This book will be distributed around the same time the final PDF of the Campaign Book is distributed (estimate around May/June 2018). Of course, Shipping costs are not included, and if we reach the $25,000 stretch goal things might change again (see below). On top of that, backers at this level also receive two Print-on-Demand 12\"x18\" posters of the Seven Worlds starmaps, provided by DriveThruRPG! There are two Starmaps in the game, a Detailed and a Simplified starmap, and at this level you get physical copies of both to put at the center of your table and have the players plan their routes! Shipping costs are not included.\nTwo 12\"x18\" posters of the Seven Worlds starmap, to help GMs and players navigate the stars during their campaign!\n  A printed version of the poster, on my kitchen table, next to a beta POD printing of the Campaign Book.\n  Delivery Dates:\nSince almost everything is already written we plan to give you access to stuff as soon as we can! This is the delivery schedule for Seven Worlds:\n Almost immediately after the Kickstarter successfully funds (December): You should receive a link to download the PDF of the Seven Worlds Setting Guide. If the $15,000 offset-run stretch goal was not reached, then backers who ordered the POD, softcover book will also receive information on how to pay for shipping so I can send you the book via Drive-Thru RPG and RPGNow. Backers at the Epsilon-level Officer level will also receive information on how to pay for shipping for the 12x18\" printed Starmap posters.\n(If the $15,000 Stretch goal is achieved) February/March 2018: You will receive a link to complete the order process for the color, hardcover version of the Setting Guide. Shipping will be calculated and charged at that time.\nNovember 2017-May 2018: We will be releasing each of the seven modules in the Seven Worlds campaign, at the rate of one approximately every two to four weeks. At that time backers will receive a link to download the PDF of each released module.\nMay 2018-June 2018: Around this timeframe the last of the seven modules is published, and the one-volume compilation Seven Worlds Campaign Book is released. If the $25,000 offset-run stretch goal was not reached, then backers who ordered the POD, softcover Campaign Book will also receive information on how to pay for shipping to get the book via Drive-Thru RPG and RPGNow. If the $25,000 offset-run stretch goal was reached, then backers will receive a link to complete the order process for the color, hardcover version of the Campaign Guide. Shipping will be calculated and charged at that time.\nThe Print-on-demand books are real, and they look awesome! Here you can see some samples, taken on my kitchen table.\nStretch Goals:\nWe need your help to fund Seven Worlds! But the fun does not stop when the project is funded. That's when the STRETCH GOALS begin!

It'll make sense when you read or play it, I promise. In the meantime, aren't we always in need of more fantasy maps? Here's your chance!).

That's right, Every backer who ordered a POD softcover copy of the Seven Worlds Setting Guide should get a Hardcover instead, at the same price! IMPORTANT: Shipping is still not included. Shipping prices might also change because of book weight and source/destination considerations. Dates might also change significantly because of the delays in offset printing. Additionally, every backer will receive a free PDF with conversion guidelines for running Seven Worlds using Evil Hat Publishing's popular FATE Accelerated rules. This very light document is a great way to experience the compelling story in the Seven Worlds campaign with a story-focused set of rules!\n$20,000: At this level we'll write and release a new short adventure for Seven Worlds, free to all backers.\n$25,000: THIS IS EVEN BIGGER!

As before, all backers who ordered the softcover POD Campaign Book will get a hardcover, premium color copy instead! Shipping is not included, and shipping prices might change. Dates might also change significantly because of the delays in offset printing.\nIf we're still here after that, we'll add more goals!\n  Some of the campaign battlemaps that will be available through stretch goals!\n  A project as ambitious as Seven Worlds requires a top-notch team to become a reality. Allow me to introduce the amazing Seven Worlds production team:\n Aaron Acevedo (Art Direction): Aaron Acevedo is a full-time artist, art director, and game designer living in New York.

All of that is located at http://www.aaronjriley.com/ \nThomas Shook (Layout): Thomas Shook started role-playing in the early 80s with the D&D Boxed Sets and has been an avid gamer since.

I've been involved in roleplaying for many years now. I have  written several one-page adventures for Triple Ace Games, two full adventures for Sundered Skies, one full Daring Tales of the Space Lanes adventure, and I've statted some adventures by Modiphius, including the Achtung! Cthulhu mega-campaign, Assault on the Mountains of Madness. Originally from Peru, I now live in Seattle, Washington.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough I have been a freelance writer for several role-playing game supplements before, this is my first foray into publishing and into Kickstarter. This means that I expect to make a lot of mistakes, and so should you. To mitigate that risk I'm running a Kickstarter with the basics for the game, and keeping it simple!\n\nSomething could happen to me, personally or physically, that affects my ability to complete this project. I sincerely hope it doesn't.\n\nThe PDFs for ALL the products are 100% finished, so the risk of you not receiving a digital product is very low.\n\nThe POD print tests have completed successfully, so the risk of you not receiving a POD print product is also very low\u2026 HOWEVER, if we reach the 15K stretch goal (and again if we reach the 25K goal) I plan to change from POD to offset print runs. This in my opinion represents the biggest risk in the project, since I've never dealt with the intricacies of printing, distributing and warehousing before. If I find I am not able to do a print run after all I still plan to fall-back to POD printing, which is very low-risk given the experience DriveThruRPG has with this. Plus, I'm still figuring out how to collect shipping for the books. All in all, this is the biggest risk in the project.\n\nI have tested the 3-D starmaps using VRML plugins for several platforms. However, technology changes so quickly that maybe by the time this is out the 3-D maps might not work correctly, or at all. I'll do my best to fix anything, of course, but can't guarantee there won't be issues, or support for a particular platform won't disappear. In short, I'll do my best to get 3-D starmaps working for you, but your mileage may vary.\n\nIn all cases, though, I plan on handling communications as openly and frankly as possible with all my backers. Fingers crossed, we're all in for an awesome ride!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 7 or more", "title": "Citizen of the Seven Worlds", "descp": "Get the satisfaction of having supported a project that is bringing science-fiction fun (and a huge and healthy dose of educational science!) to role-playing fans everywhere.

Grown-ups can\u2019t see \u2018em. When something gets smashed up, they blame us. When somebody goes missing, they blame someone from out of town, or maybe the Russians. The monsters are real though, and it\u2019s up to us to do something about it.  \nThat\u2019s right, between babysitting your little sister, dodging bullies like Scotty Mangrum, and surviving middle school, you also have to figure out how to fix the monster problem.  \nYou can\u2019t phone home, and there\u2019s nobody you can call.

It is being brought to Kickstarter by Applied Vectors Ltd. \nThe 120 page book is written, what we need is artwork that accurately brings the setting to life, and for this to happen, we need you! The funding goal gets you a combination of colour and black and white art. if we hit the first stretch goal, it will be a full colour interior!\nFacebook\nWe have a group on Facebook: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/FrozenSkiesRPG/\nIn which we talk about the game, share ideas and ask for your input. Please come along and join in!\nImportant Update!\nIf you back at the Raw Recruit level or higher, you will receive an exclusive adventure in PDF format, only available to the Kickstarter backers.  \nThe Remnants of the Past On an expedition with a professor investigating some Ancient Terran ruins the heroes find that they're far from uninhabited ...\nALL Backers of Alyeskan Explorer and higher pledges will receive a free PDF with the Frozen Skies Bennies, which they can print themselves on cardstock for use in their games.\nFulfillment\nA June 2018 fulfillment date seems a long way away, and it is. We have to commission artwork, approve it, add it to the book, order proof copies and make sure they're fit for purpose - if this happens at a faster rate, then you will get the rewards earlier, I wanted to make sure we have a good lead time in case of any issues that might arise.\nThe setting of Frozen Skies is the continent of Alyeska, the most northern landmass of the world of Darmonica and is often referred to as either the \u2018rooftop of the world\u2019 or \u2018Darmonica\u2019s Crown\u2019. It is an icy frontier plagued by savage beasts, cut-throat sky pirates, harsh weather and eons old dark secrets. It is a barely tamed land where the most basic of utilities are hard to come by and tend to lie on the good side of unreliable at best. But despite all this there are opportunities for a man to make a name and, more ideally, coin for himself.  \nAlyeska itself is dominated by savage beasts known as Wulvers, wolf like creatures that\u2019ve plagued Alyeska since its earliest Colonial days. The Commonwealth had troops stationed in Alyeska to defend its fledging colony against the beasts, though they were steadily whittled away to satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s war efforts. As the defenses were weakened the Wulvers gradually overran more and more territory, in the end the Alyeskans were forced to hide behind fortified walls and increasingly rely on air travel to maintain contact with far-flung outposts.  \nDespite the Wulvers the other great powers of Darmonica have their own interest in Alyeska, chiefly for the ruins and artefacts of the Ancient Terrans buried beneath the ice and for a mineral by-product of the Blast known as Glimmer Rock. Until it was altered by the energies released in the explosion it was a previously unremarkable mineral, now it is the fuel for a new Industrial Revolution that the world finds itself on the cusp of....but only if the new technology can be made viable.\n If we fund, we have a number of Stretch Goals: \n More will be added should we get that high.\nIf we reach various Stretch Goals, we will unlock Add-Ons which you can purchase, simply by increasing your pledge by the specified amounts. Here is the closeup of the Bennies:\n Here are the closeups of the dice.\n Remember these can't be ordered until we have reached the Stretch Goal that unlocks them.\n All rewards will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG.  \nThe pledges for the print version are at a lower amount because backers will need to later pay at cost the base printing and shipping costs of the book at DriveThruRPG. When the Frozen Skies RPG is ready (estimated June 2018 at the latest), backers who pledged for it will receive a code to print their books on DriveThruRPG. They will be able to choose between the Softcover (7\"x10\") or the Hardcover (7\"x10\"), and Standard Color Heavyweight or Premium Color as they prefer. Please note that backers will still need to pay DriveThruRPG for printing and shipping costs at the time of ordering.  \nThe estimated print cost for each version is as follows (rounded-up): \nSoftcover Color: $5.99 (Standard) to $15.15 (Premium)\nHardcover Color: $11.16 (Standard) to $20.10 (Premium)  \nShipping costs vary by location. DrivethruRPG ships internationally and estimated shipping costs can be found here. \nWhy is Applied Vectors Ltd running this Kickstarter and not Utherwald Press?\nTime.

We were working on some game-changing options but they just aren't going to work out. Here's the update we were going to post on Monday.)\nHi all,\nIt seems clear we haven't managed to put together a package compelling enough for most Kickstarter backers. As we stated on the project's main page, we have financing to manufacture CROM regardless of the amount raised, but given the relatively low number of backers we've decided it's best to move on.\nWe love our game and are extremely proud of it. It's been a joy to run at game stores and conventions across the country, and we appreciate all the good times we've had with our fellow gamers.\nWe're also extremely proud of what we accomplished on the miniatures. Time and time again those who looked at the real-life production models at those same stores and conventions have told us how impressed they are with them, then posted their delight on social media.\nBut ultimately, this kind of product at the price we need to charge given our scale and premium paint work just doesn't seem a good match for Kickstarter. Nor is it possible to offer the kind of discount distribution and retail are used to.\nSo for that reason, we're going to shut down the project once and for all.\nWe greatly appreciate YOUR support and constructive comments, and are extremely thankful for all the help we've received from our friends at Conan Properties, Reaper Miniatures, and Ulisses Spiele.\nWe're fortunate that we can close out the project with every artist, freelancer, and manufacturer paid, and we hope you enjoyed the free game we put up on DTRPG (it will be taken down later this week so take a look while you can--we've updated the Fate Cards with the cool Blood Magic and Rampage boosters you didn't know about too!).\nWe don't know what will happen with the Reaper resin terrain... please check the Reaper Minis site in the coming weeks for an update.\nFinally, we're all extremely fortunate as Robert E. Howard fans that there are so many other great Conan games to play right now. We encourage you to do so to support the overall effort--we've certainly gone all in on them all. :)\nPulposaurus\n***\nConan: Rise of Monsters is an epic fantasy battle game with high-quality painted, 34mm, hardened PVC figures, fast-play rules, custom dice, and more. The backstory is a brand new tale inspired by Robert E. Howard's original Conan tales and the Marvel and Dark Horse Comics stories and adaptations.\n*** UPDATES! ***\nUPDATE! The rules and all Fate, Unit, and Terrain Cards will now be translated into French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian, and Polish! Right now these will be PDF only. We'll update you if there's any change. Thanks to Pinnacle's translation partners for joining us on our new Pulposaurus project!\nUPDATE! We're near a big Stretch Goal that adds a brand new painted MERCENARY unit to every Conqueror Pledge and higher, the Free Companions! See the Second Stretch Goals graphic below, and help us spread the word to get yourself these tough new rowdies!\nUPDATE! Our core team received the latest manufacturing quotes here at the Origins game convention and decided that Conan: Rise of Monsters won't be offered through traditional distribution. The nature of our project and the tight margins means it's really a direct-only product. We will work with individual stores sometime after the Kickstarter backers get their orders and offer the Conqueror and Warlord expansion at a \"net price\" with a suggested retail of $199 each. Individual figure sets will only be offered directly through our website.\nWe love and support our favorite local gaming stores with all our other games, but it's just not feasible with a project of this nature at the price point we want to maintain.\n***\n  You can download and try out the entire game right here, right now, thanks to our friends at DriveThruRPG!\n(Please get the latest update, marked v2 on the Sticky Note on the first page, after about 9pm EST on 6/15! We're at the Origins game convention and updating over wifi is going a little slow!)\nThoth-Amon has assembled the Legion of Set to bring the Serpent God into Hyboria. His sorcerers, swordsmen, and serpents scour the lands, gathering ancient artifacts and destroying the icons of those gods who might oppose their apocalyptic plans.\nKing Conan has forged an alliance to stop them\u2014the Circle of Iron. His knights, archers, pikemen, and oliphants are all that stand in the way of the dread sorcerer and his dark crusade.\nPulposaurus is part of Pinnacle Entertainment Group, makers of Savage Worlds and Deadlands, and publishers of Robert E.

Thanks!\nConqueror Two Player Core Set\nThe Conqueror pledge comes with everything two players need to play, including 30 painted miniatures, unit cards, custom dice, game tokens, Destiny gems, a Fate Deck of tricks and tactics for each side, two full-color cardboard terrain boards, and the rules!\nThe Warlord Expansion\nThe Warlord Expansion adds more unit cards, Destiny gems, Fate Cards, terrain boards, and more top-quality painted miniatures for both sides, including some truly MASSIVE MONSTERS!\nThe Warlord Expansion also comes with the Fall of Mitra Campaign, a 48 page book of scenarios AND campaign rules that tells the story of Thoth-Amon\u2019s quest to raise Father Set, the destruction of the Temples of Mitra, and King Conan\u2019s creation of the Circle of Iron!\nBest of all, it features BRAND NEW material from SAVAGE WORLD OF CONAN CREATOR ROY THOMAS!!! Check the ROY THOMAS section below for more on his involvement!\n  Early Bird Art Prints\nIf you're one of the Warlord Early Bird backers, we'll send you TWO art prints featuring Victor Moreno's incredible covers suitable for framing. Mount these two icons of swords and sorcery on your wall, O Prince, and dream of days of high adventure...\n  Conan: Rise of Monsters has simple core rules but complex strategies so no two battles are ever the same. Here's a quick overview of how it plays... look for more (including videos) at our website, and look for live play videos with brand new players direct from the Origins game convention the week of June 15-18!\nDid you miss the announcement above? The entire game is available right now, totally free, at DriveThruRPG! Download the rules, Unit Cards, Terrain Cards, and Fate Cards, grab some of your own minis, and give it a try! Then you can decide if you want to go in for the real thing!\nClick HERE when you're ready to head over to DriveThru and check it out!\nNow let's run through the basics...\n  Here's a closer look at one of the unit cards. This one is for the hard-charging Poitainian Knights!\n  Custom Sigil dice in blood red for the Circle or Iron and eldritch blue for the Legion of Set.\n  The Fate Deck. Take advantage of extra movement, hit harder, or foil your foe's moves. Of course, she has her own Fate Deck too!\n  A Fate Card for the savage Circle of Iron and the sinister Legion of Set.\n  We want you to be able to play the game minutes after opening the box. That's why we made a game that's simple to play but complex to master, and more importantly, gives you fully-assembled, professionally painted miniatures right out of the box!\nWe aren't selling unpainted miniatures...it's not the experience we want to provide and it's not our license. Veteran hobbyists can always add additional highlights and details as they see fit, but we think the vast majority of players will be very happy with the work\u2014our playtesters certainly have been!\nWe start with Victor Moreno's incredible art, then work with our manufacturing partners to match it as closely as possible.\n  The Priests of Set...from Concept to Production Model.\n  The Mighty Oliphant!\n Conqueror Production Minis\nHere are production versions of the miniatures that come in the Conqueror set so you can see exactly what you're getting. We're working on the Warlord Expansion miniatures now, and will show you the 3D sculpts and production models as they arrive.\nMost of the minis are what we call \"Games Workshop\" size, or around 34mm. The Oliphant and Scion of Set are both a massive 100mm!\nCircle of Iron Miniatures\n  King Conan!\n  Poitainian Knights\n  Bossonian Archers.

The true cost of the game is far higher, depending on how many sets we actually make. Pulposaurus and its partners believe strongly in Conan: Rise of Monsters, so we're financing the game along with your help as a backer.\nWe know most minis games on Kickstarter add additional miniatures to pledges as Stretch Goals, but that isn't feasible for this project given the upfront expense of our painted models. Instead, we've put all the figures available into two very affordable boxes, and are packing as much additional value as we can into accessories that enhance actual gameplay. This includes veteran versions of the units for more variety during play, additional themed Fate cards, story-driven campaigns with surprise events, high-quality cardboard terrain boards with weird effects worthy of a Howard yarn, and a few other surprises we'll unveil along the way!\nFirst Stretch Goals\nHere are the first Stretch Goals, please spread the word about our labor of love if you're so inclined and we'll open up even more!\nSecond Stretch Goals!\nWe're doing great, and there's SO MUCH MORE TO SHARE! Help us run through these next Stretch Goals and we'll show you what's next!\n  Add the amounts below to your pledge to add boxed sets, heroes, units, and monsters, or Reaper's official Conan: Rise of Monsters terrain to your order.\nWe will offer these Add Ons again during the Pledge Manager stage, but we recommend you Add On the money now so you unlock more Stretch Goals!\nAdd Ons may incur additional shipping, particularly heavier items like Reaper's resin terrain.\nCore Box and Dice Add Ons\nWant extra copies of the boxed sets or more dice to better savage your foes in one fell swoop? The sages have answered.\nCircle of Iron Add Ons\nNote that players can field multiple copies of named heroes. In these cases, imagine one is actually King Conan while another may be an an old ally rallying from the cold mountains of Cimmeria.\nLegion of Set Add Ons\nPlayers may field multiple copies of Set's champions. A second Akivasha might be another vampiress, for example. Or perhaps Thoth-Amon's chronomancy has triggered some strange and portentous anomaly!\nDeluxe Reaper Miniatures Resin Terrain\nOur friends at Reaper Miniatures made resin versions of the Cursed Terrain, special landscapes that dot the battlefields of Stygia and beyond that have special effects in the game. We hope to unlock flat terrain board versions via our Stretch Goals that we'll include with every order, but for those who want their battlefields to really stand out, Reaper's high-quality, deluxe castings are a must!\nUnlike the miniatures, terrain comes UNPAINTED. It's made in the US of top-quality resin and sculpted by fan-favorites Bobby Jackson, Jason Wiebe, Kevin Williams, and Chris Lewis of Reaper Miniatures. Each terrain piece is hand-poured in the highest quality gray resin to capture the details from the original sculptures and bring the Age of Conan to your battlefield!\nRules for \"Cursed Terrain\" can be found along with the game rules, Fate Cards, and Unit Cards on DriveThruRPG.com.\n              Inspiration for Conan: Rise of Monsters comes from Robert E. Howard's original tales as well as the fantastic interpretations by writer and editor Roy Thomas on Savage Sword of Conan, the comic series originally published by Marvel in the '70s and currently sold by Dark Horse Comics.\nAccompanied by the art of legendary artists such as Barry Windsor-Smith, Gil Kane, John Buscema, and so many more, Thomas' Conan tales hold up alongside the source material...a tall order as any true fan of Howard's knows!\nThe legendary Roy Thomas. Photo by Alan Waite.\nPulposaurus' co-founder Shane Hensley said this: \u201cMy own writing is heavily influenced by Stephen Crane, Robert E. Howard, and the Marvel crew of the \u201970s\u2026 Roy Thomas being first and foremost among a team of giants. I think what truly inspires me with Roy\u2019s work is how he and the artists were able to take Howard\u2019s unique style, so flavorful and atmospheric, and not just \u2018illustrate\u2019 it, but make something new and different yet somehow more true to the source material. Look at the image of Natohk The Veiled One (the wizard Thugra Khotan in disguise), below. This is one of those key moments where Roy Thomas, John Buscema, and Alfredo Alcala really nailed the power, mystery, and raw excitement of Howard\u2019s world.\u201d\nCheck out our interview with Roy Thomas here, and look for his work in the Fall of Mitra campaign book!\nNatohk the Veiled One, from Savage Sword of Conan #2 (Marvel Comics, 1974).\n  For those who supported our first Kickstarter for Conan: Rise of Monsters, thanks! We greatly appreciate it, as well as the constructive criticism most gave to make it better this time around.\nThe original Kickstarter raised over $100K before we canceled it, but we had a problem in the way we structured things we felt wouldn't satisfy ourselves or our backers. We've learned a lot since then and are now ready to plunge back into the fray. We hope you'll join us!\nWhat Happened to the Adrian Smith Miniatures? We've decided to stick with one art style, so we aren't reoffering the Adrian Smith miniatures. Adrian did amazing work, but Victor Moreno's art on this project is absolutely stunning and we want to keep things consistent. Thanks to Adrian for his previous support!\nWhat About Those Who Pledged at GenCon 2015? First, thanks again! You guys and gals saw our miniatures first-hand and posted about their quality on social media. We appreciate it!\nIf you recall, you were promised the alternative Adrian Smith Conan and Thoth miniatures for pledging there. While this is a new project and a fresh start, we still want to honor and thank you for your earlier support. We'll be contacting each of you separately and offering you credit toward our Add Ons. This is a great way to pick up an extra Oliphant, Devil of the Outer Dark, or whatever YOU choose to get with it. :)\nHow Come More Miniatures Aren't Stretch Goals? We're offering all the miniatures up front this time, divided into two boxes\u2014the Conqueror core set and the Warlord expansion. The problem with offering the miniatures in the Warlord Expansion as Stretch Goals is a little complicated if you haven't been run a Kickstarter yourself, but here's the situation for those who are interested.\nThe usual way to get people excited about board and miniature games on Kickstarter is to offer a basic package then add to it as the project is successful until the package becomes too good to pass up.\nMost of the games that do this are able to do so because plastic minis on sprues are very inexpensive if you have enough quantity to make the molds in the first place.\nConan: Rise of Monsters high-quality, painted miniatures means a higher cost per miniature (but we think it's still a fantastic bargain!). A typical plastic sprue might cost pennies, but our minis are assembled, painted, vacuum packaged, and come ready to play.\nWhen we followed this model the first time, it was hard to get to the Stretch Goals we accounted for because they were at fairly high levels to actually cover the costs. \nThat means there's a sweet spot between what we want to be in the box and the price... just like every other non-Kickstarter project out there. Makes perfect sense, right? But since this is Kickstarter and we all want cool Stretch Goals, we decided the best thing for this project is to offer what we think is a fair deal for the game and minis, and then add all the other things we think add tremendous fun to the game. That includes booster sets for each side's Fate Decks, \"Cursed Terrain\" boards, veteran versions of the unit cards so you can get even more use out of every model, and of course loads of scenarios to reinforce Howard's sense of narrative to your battles.\nThanks in advance for understanding the complexities of running this particular project on Kickstarter!\nOther games let you play out Conan's existing adventures, and we love those too. Rise of Monsters tells a new story that Robert E. Howard never told, but we think he would enjoy! Our tale focuses on Thoth-Amon, a compelling character who first appeared in The Phoenix on the Sword and was later the main character of Dark Hose Comics fascinating Book of Thoth.\nWhen we first meet the Stygian sorcerer in The Phoenix on the Sword, Thoth has lost his powerful \"Serpent Ring of Set\" and become enslaved to an outlaw named Ascalante. The wizard schemed to slay his enslaver and accidentally became entangled with Conan from afar.\nThoth next appeared in The God in the Bowl and The Hour of the Dragon. Once again the two titans fail to meet, but Conan continues to foil Thoth's machinations through his own adventures.\nOur Stygian antagonist next appears outside of Howard's official tales in L. Sprague de Camp's Conan the Buccaneer and Conan of Aquilonia. Much like our own backstory to Rise of Monsters, de Camp's tale involves Thoth-Amon attempting to raise the great snake god. Conan stops him, of course, and at the end of that non-canonical series, finishes the struggle with \"He was the greatest of all the foes I have overcome. I shall miss the old scoundrel, in a way.\"\nA number of authors wrote Conan stories after Robert E. Howard\u2019s death in 1936. They are not considered canon, but some, especially those by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, feature further tales of Conan and Thoth.\n  The Book of Thoth, by Dark Horse Comics. Some of the amazing art by Kelley Jones and Michelle Madsen can be found in the Legion of Set's Fate Deck!\n  The original idea for Conan: Rise of Monsters came from Shane Hensley, founder of Pinnacle Entertainment Group and creator of Deadlands and Savage Worlds. Shane is a super fan who published the Savage World of Solomon Kane and even attended the 100th anniversary of Howard's birth in Cross Plains, Texas, in 2006.\nShane's love of all things Howard and his friend Jack Emmert's desire to do a great  \"bronze age\" minis game with fantastic monsters seemed a natural fit. The name \"Conan: Rise of Monsters\" came naturally, and since the acronym was \"CROM\" the two friends knew they had to make it happen.\nThe proposal to our long-time friends at Conan Properties was accepted, and Jack Emmert, founder of Cryptic Studios, creative lead of City of Heroes, City of Villains. Champions Online, Star Trek Online, Neverwinter Online, and now Studio Head for Daybreak, began designing the core dice mechanics. Jack re-read every Conan tale, notated the characters, units, and monsters that appeared there, and committed them to his nearly eidetic memory.\nJack also re-read all of Marvel Comics' Savage Sword of Conan, a fantastic resource to see how Roy Thomas and others translated Howard's often intentionally-murky descriptions of strange creatures into the visual medium of comics. (We were very fortunate later on to actually enlist the legendary Roy Thomas' aid on the project! See above!)\nJack and Shane's great friend George Vasilakos, owner of Zombie Planet and Eden Studios, jumped on board to handle the graphic design. George brought on the phenomenal Victor Moreno to handle the art. Victor knocked it out of the park, creating phenomenal images we think redefine Howard's world for a modern audience.\nThe production of a game like Conan: Rise of Monsters is a massive undertaking. So the final partner, Timothy Brown, creator of Dark Sun and now Studio Head of Ulisses North America, was brought on to wrangle the complicated process of translating the team's wild ideas into an affordable reality.\nDarrell Hayhurst, line manager of Torg Eternity, came on board as a designer for the relaunch and graciously ran demos at stores and conventions all over the country. We met Jason Peck and his son Caeden at a livestream demo at one of our favorite local game stores, Games U, and after he became a fantastic playtester and editor.\nReaper Miniatures helped us TREMENDOUSLY, promoting our game and creating the incredible resin scenery found under the Add Ons section. Special thanks to Ron Hawkins and Ed Pugh for their PHENOMENAL support to our little team!\nThe original founders of Pulposaurus at the Game Manufacturer's Trade Show in 2015.\nOur Previous Work in Robert E.

It's Grimm's Tales meets Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's The Witcher series meets Kung Fu Hustle. It's Iron Monkey meets Brotherhood of the Wolf. You are errants, a class of wandering adventurers, who search a landscape of deadly beauty for a way to save the settled folk of the Elder Kingdom from ruin.\nA shining kingdom in the middle of a huge, forested wilderness. Warriors who flit through the trees like squirrels. Malevolent woodland spirits and fearsome magical beasts. An absent king, and the threat of corruption and collapse. These are the stories that await under the boughs of the Blackwood.\nThe Blackwood Errantry Codex is an officially-licensed campaign setting for the award-winning Savage Worlds RPG from Pinnacle Entertainment Group. We're producing a complete guide to gameplay in the Blackwood, including a full-length Plot Point Campaign, The Way of the Elder King.\nThe finished book will include:\n18 new Edges and 9 new Hindrances  \n5 new Races and 5 new Arcane Backgrounds  \n4 new Setting Rules full of folkloric whimsy and wuxia action\n40+ new creatures and foes\nA Plot Point Campaign, The Way of the Elder King, complete with Savage Tales\nPlease note: you will need a copy of the Savage Worlds core rules and the Fantasy Companion to play in The Blackwood.

Their magic bread crumbs may help that brother and sister find their way home, but in the clutches of this foul elf with the secret name they are powerless. Good thing the healer with such impressive fighting skills is sailing through the branches overhead to gain a flanking position.\nBut what's that noise? Sounds like the healer ran into some trouble. There! He's grappling with one of those ghastly hopping ghouls, but... he's holding his own. Now, to make quick work of the elf before those kids get eaten...\nIn the Blackwood, you won't run into Paul Bunyan, Hansel and Gretel, or Wong Fei-Hung, but you'll encounter characters very much like them. This is not your typical fantasy world of dwarves and halflings. Elves aren't crafting mighty rings of power, they're turning your friend inside out and cooking you into a stew. You'll journey through a forest full of slippery magic, where the terrain changes with the winds, and the right song might guide you better than the finest compass.\nIn keeping with the Savage Worlds design philosophy, we've created a few Setting Rules and character options to invoke the spirit of both folklore and wuxia. In the Blackwood, you'll be able to master a variety of fighting schools and use almost any object as a weapon. Spend all your time around pots and pans? In your hands, they're as deadly as any cudgel. We've also expanded the Dramatic Task rules to simulate navigating the changing paths and slippery magic of a forest right out of Grimm's Tales.

We've been researching successful Kickstarter methods for more than a year now, and we've supported many projects to understand the experience from the backer perspective. We've learned there are three core ingredients for success: achievable goals, open communication, and honest work. Here's where we stand on each.\n\nWe know it's easy for a Kickstarter campaign's ambition to outgrow the creator's capabilities. As much as we'd love to offer add-ons like GM screens, custom dice, and Bennies, we know each of those will increase our logistical dance by a significant amount. For our first project, we're focusing on improvements to the core book and a few easily-achievable goodies. In particular, we've decided to publish our guest writers in a separate volume to make sure there's no delay in the release of the core book.\n\nAs creators, we hereby pledge to you that we will keep you informed at every step of the way, for good or ill. As investors in our project, you deserve to know about all our triumphs, and any setbacks that may occur. It's the only way you can make an informed decision about your support.\n\nTo make sure things go smoothly, we've hired some excellent people to help out. We're paying fair wages so they can take pride in their work. We know our strengths (writing, cartography, and project management), and we've hired these folks to shore up our weaknesses (art, layout, and Kickstarter expertise). Together, we know we can bring you a book you'll love, and we can do it on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Storyteller", "descp": "You get: a PDF copy of The Blackwood Errantry Codex, and credit in the Roll of Errantry in the book.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["112 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Cartographer", "descp": "You get: a PDF copy of The Blackwood Errantry Codex and credit in the Roll of Errantry.

A few years ago, excitement built around the idea of a shared experience in Shaintar which would shape the very world itself. Sean Patrick Fannon's living campaign was born: Justice & Life. We'll talk more about this later.\n   About the same time, Savage Mojo helped Sean run a Kickstarter to create an amazing variety of source material for Shaintar. While Sean had to step back from much of the project, Savage Mojo took over the realm of Shaintar, allowing our friend to focus on other parts of his life while still being involved in the creative process.\n   In January 2017 we delivered the last of the 26 books in that Kickstarter. Guidebooks for kingdoms and cities, reports on organizations (both good and evil), short adventures and... but where was the killer campaign book, the epic story line for an epic fantasy world?\n   That's where the living campaign comes in. Those gaming groups have been running epic story arcs non-stop, and it's time to bring some of those into the spotlight. With your help we're going to publish their first, amazing story arc for everyone to enjoy, and have you tell the story for yourselves in your own way.\n   This is Shaintar's first plot point campaign, complete with Savage Tales and all the trimmings.\n   The living campaign is a form of collaborative storytelling. It's pretty amazing and here's how it works: every game that takes place in the community affects the story line for that year. The events of one group may affect others while progressing the overall story arc to a dramatic conclusion.\n   Best of all, events that happen in Justice & Life change the world, permanently. They become part of the lore of Shaintar, so participants from all over the world have a chance to write the future of the entire setting.\n   In 2013 the year in Shaintar was 3123... the year of Thundering Skies.\n   \"This has been, by far, the most rewarding experience I've had the pleasure of partaking in!\" ~ James Olexa, Jan 2017\n   Shaintar's first worldwide campaign event saw strange beings appear - wind wraiths, lightning elementals and storm magi, among many others. Here's the story in brief (click on the images to download a pdf of the overview). SPOILERS: We're trying to stay spoiler-free but you may find minor spoilers in the plot overview document.\n       Who's the secret master? What's the agenda? Justice & Life was mobilized. Heroes scrambled to defend Shaintar and repel the attacks, to investigate and strike back....\n   \"I find that I can craft much more in depth stories and plots when the opponents are not just nameless monsters holding potential loot for the heroes. When the enemy is another human, elf, etc. there\u2019s the potential to find out more about that foe. Interact with them, (and) role-play.\" ~ Stephen Dragonspawn (2017)\n   In what we believe is the true spirit of Kickstarter, we have a unique opportunity for collaborative storytelling and without Kickstarter we wouldn't have the fund to develop it into a finished book. It's as simple as that. This is what Kickstarter was made for, after all.\n   Right now we have the core of the story arc and some amazing characters, locations, and encounters from the Justice & Life groups. The next stage is to turn that into a campaign sourcebook for every fantasy roleplayer to enjoy, and we're giving backers the chance to contribute too (see the Collaboration reward tiers). \n   By backing this project, not only do you have the opportunity to play through the campaign, you also have the chance to shape the story of Shaintar. The events in the book will be official canon for the Shaintar setting, the definitive write-up of Year 3123 in Shaintar history.\n   This is a unique opportunity to join in on the ground level of a thriving community of GMs and players who are telling vibrant and epic high fantasy stories. We want to tell those stories right, and to give others the ability to share in them.\nFirst Servitor of Storms (Villain)\n   So, a little backstory here. About 8 weeks ago, I was asked to go on the Wild Die podcast and talk about Shaintar and we set it up and it happened. Fortunately for me, another fan of Shaintar, Stephane, joined the podcast with Gary and Eric and it turned out to be a great conversation. Now, Gary started teasing that he was going to get the villain pledge when we launched and he was true to his word. So we got together on social media and through a fantastic conversation here, Ssa'tehveen Draco, a Draykin (perhaps the only one in the world) came to be.  He is a terrible being who's sole desire is to bring dragons back to Shaintar so they may rule.  What role does the Tempest have for him? You'll have to wait and see...\n       Shaintar Year 3123: Thundering Skies adventure.\n   The player's gazetteer is 32 pages long. It contains some setting information and enough story background to help someone new to Shaintar get started. There's also a number of new Edges, gear and other special goodies offered.\n   The GM's section contains everything in 64 glorious pages. You get the full plot-point campaign, Savage Tales, specific setting information not provided to players, and stats for all the bad guys from great to small. This is your full toolkit for running an epic high fantasy campaign your group will remember for years.\n   NEW: Free Goodies!\n   Every backer at Adventurer tier or above (so almost everybody) will get a free copy of the Shaintar: Legends Arise Player's Guide pdf and a free copy of the Shaintar: Legends Unleashed Player's Guide pdf.\n   Exclusive Kickstarter Cover!\n   Only available through the Thundering Skies Kickstarter, we're offering an exclusive wraparound cover for the hardcover book. This cover will not be used on pdf or softcover formats and will never be sold publicly. It's only available here.\n   Below is a reminder of the amazing cover by Tomek Tvorek for Shaintar: Legends Unleashed and that's a sample of what's possible. We're still toying with ideas but we have two artists in mind for this and we know you'll love their work. The softcover & pdfs will have a blue cover with a smaller front image as shown above, and that's what will be available to buy after this Kickstarter finishes.\n   Every Thundering Skies hardcover you get through this Kickstarter, whether it's part of your pledge or through add-ons will get the exclusive cover. If you were ever thinking of getting additional copies for friends and family, this is the time to do it!\n      Bonus: Click the above image to download it as 1920x1080 wallpaper for your desktop.\n   Special opportunities available. We're giving you the opportunity to be creatively involved and to influence the story. Design allies that help the heroes, memorable enemies who add new challenges, or plot twists to increase the depth of the story. See the Collaboration reward tiers for those options. They're limited, and a one-time opportunity to have your name in the credits of this epic roleplay book.\n   \"This is the first tabletop I've ever even considered playing. I've played video games and MMOs from the early age of 5 (I had older brothers). I always thought tabletop was weird and a little strange but out of all the games I've played this is by far one of the best storylines I've been introduced to and the writer in me thrives for it. I'm entirely spoiled from playing any other game - ever; mostly in large part because Shaintar is an amazingly fantastical place and Howard Brandon is one hell of a GM. \" ~ Ashley Leuenberger\n   Note for print versions: see the \"Shipping\" section below.\n   We're committed to delivering stretch goals which give you, the backers, extra shinies for free - the more we succeed, the more we can give back to you! None of these stretch goals change any add-on pricing. Even as we make the book bigger or shinier, you get better and better value for your pledge money.\n   $11,000: A set of six pdf pre-generated characters for you to play with. There will be a character sheet on one side and a quarter page, sepia-toned illustration on the back with the character's background. This stretch goal is for players (and a part of the Adventurer pledge level), but also something GMs can use - any of these heroes who aren't played by players are suitably iconic NPCs.\n   $12,000: We're going to seriously bump the artwork. We'll take the six illustrations of our iconic heroes (see above) and turn them into beautiful full page images, full color and full wow! factor. Apart from supercharging the pre-generated character pack, these illustrations will also be part of the main book, so that's six pages of full color illustration for everyone to love there!\n   $12,500: We've gone $2,000 past our goal and we're celebrating in style. We'll add 8 pages to the Thundering Skies book. More adventure means more hours of epic gaming. We haven't decided how those extra pages will be split, but any pages added to the player's section of the book will add to the Adventurer pledge level, as well as everyone else's.\n   $13,500: At this point we're going to add another 8 pages to the Thundering Skies book AND upgrade all the illustrations in those pages to full-color rather than sepia toned and tinted.\n   $14,500: Just like the $13,500 stretch goal, at this point we'll add 8 more pages to the Thundering Skies book AND upgrade all the illustrations in those pages.\n   $15,000: If we get this far, we'll celebrate by creating a print-and-play pdf map pack for the Thundering Skies campaign. Everybody who pledges at the Adventurer tier or higher (that's most of you) will get a copy for free.\n   We are offering a heap of goodies as add-ons.\n   You can have any of the following books by simply adding to your pledge: $20.00 for a pdf, $35.00 for a softcover, or $45.00 for a hardcover. If you want multiple copies, just add multiple amounts. During the post-Kickstarter survey we'll sort out which books you want from the list below:\nThundering Skies\nShaintar: Legends Arise\nShaintar: Legends Unleashed\nSouthern Kingdoms (anthology)\nIndependent Nations (anthology)\nEnemies, Old and New (anthology)\nBlack Lantern Reports (anthology)\n   Thundering Skies is the campaign book you're backing right here in this Kickstarter, the first major story arc campaign for Shaintar.\n   Shaintar: Legends Arise and Shaintar: Legends Unleashed are the core Shaintar setting books. Sean Patrick Fannon's beautiful vision of Epic High Fantasy is laid out in those.\n   The four anthologies collect together the wealth of material from Shaintar's long and illustrious history in four handy volumes. However, if you want any of the original pdf guidebooks, Black Lantern reports or short adventures on their own, you can get those at 3 for $12.00. What's in the 3 for $12? Click here for a full list (it's a long one!).\n   What's in the anthologies? All this is in the anthologies...\n   Print+pdf offer: If you're getting the add-on of a print and its PDF, and both are from this list, then take $10 off the combo. Consider it an extra bonus of being a backer.\n   NEW! You can have a copy of Thundering Skies for the Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop for $20.00 (exclusively announced in Update #4).\n  For physical books, please see our \"Shipping\" section below. We will send these products as soon as we have them available. In the case of some (the core books, the first two anthologies, and the original short format books), they will be sent to you as soon as the dust settles from the Kickstarter. Thundering Skies and the second pair of anthologies will be released in the coming months.\n   Gayle Reick - Line Developer, Shaintar. She's worked in the gaming industry off and on since the early '90s and gained experience as a playtester for Champions 4th Edition. She followed it up with work as a localization producer at 3D0 and a stint in a hobby games retail store, developing a unique series of skills that has allowed her to fit right in the Savage Mojo family.\n   Howard Brandon - Project Manager, Shaintar Legends Awaken (formerly Justice & Life) and Shaintar Rules Guru. He's been a part of the Shaintar J&L since 2013 and over the past four years Howard has taken over management of the collaborative campaign, written books and rules for the Shaintar realm, and joined the Savage Mojo team on future development. When not running and playing Shaintar, Howard attends conventions, speaking about gaming, running events, and promoting tabletop RPGs as a hobby and storytelling medium.\n   Darren Pearce - Lead Writer. He's already written nearly a million words of guidebooks and black lantern reports. Now heading the writing team, he's got loads of material to work from and we can expect a spectacular product from him. He's also got credits for Doctor Who: Adventures in Time and Space, Mongoose's Lone Wolf and more besides. His list of credits contains fiction as well as RPG game design.\n   Carinn Seabolt - Editor. She's one of the partners over at Evil Beagle Games and has agreed to continue editing the Shaintar product line for us. In addition, she's the one making sure we keep Shaintar the epic high fantasy we love to play in. She's also done quite a lot of freelance editing and works as part of the customer service team over at DriveThruRPG.\n   Alida Saxon - Art Director. It's because of Alida that the Shaintar books have a fantastic style and consistent look and feel. She takes the manuscripts, commissions illustrations, and turns out book after book that Savage Mojo is (very!) proud to present to the public. She's also a part of the Pinnacle Entertainment Art Direction team, creating wonderful books with them as well.\n   For more detailed biographies, visit savagemojo.com and click on the \"About Us\" tab to learn a bit more about who we are and what we do.\n   Print versions of Thundering Skies and various add-ons are available as part of the Kickstarter. Backers are responsible for paying separate shipping on all print products but please don't add anything to your pledge at this stage. We'll calculate what you owe in shipping during the post-Kickstarter survey.\n   Printing and shipping will be through DriveThruRPG, so you'll pay them directly, and exactly what it costs them to ship. We feel that's the most accurate and honest way to deal with shipping.\n   We've made some changes in the last couple of days that might have you wondering where those beautiful featured characters are. Why'd we do this? Well, we were having people ask us where to find this one thing and we realized there was too much going on. We wanted people to find the information really easily. What we've done is create a Hall of Heroes folder where you can download a pdf of these characters. There'll also be a Hall of Villains and other folders added as we create content for you to view. The name of the folder is a link there so have fun & enjoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt Savage Mojo we're aware of the risks and challenges of Kickstarter campaigns perhaps better than most. We ran a successful Kickstarter for our Dungeonlands realm and we were involved in the Shaintar: Legends Unleashed Kickstarter. Then in 2016 we rescued the abandoned Nightfall Kickstarter. Additionally, from time to time we also work with other companies, helping them with their Kickstarters.\n\n As an example, let's look at the Shaintar: Legends Unleashed Kickstarter. Our initial involvement was administrating the crowdfunding campaign itself, and supplying the visual resources (illustration, cartography, graphic design, and layout). The Kickstarter went wonderfully (414% funded!).\n\n When Evil Beagle Games hit obstacles, Savage Mojo agreed to take over development of the Kickstarter products. It was one of the most complicated sets of rewards you'll ever see, but all the books are complete. We were determined to stick it out until the Kickstarter was finished and now we've done right by the fans. Between that and the process of saving the Nightfall (now Nocturne) Kickstarter, we've learned a great deal about resource allocation and production.\n\n As you can see, we're no newbs at this. This isn't our first rodeo, not even close. In this Kickstarter we're implementing everything we've learned from looking at all those other projects and being a part of them.\n\n Nothing in this world is 100%. That said, we've never met a challenge we didn't stick with until it was overcome. And to date we've always overcome in the end.\n\n This is our promise to you:\n Help us help the creative team behind Shaintar. Become a backer at whatever level you can afford. Pledge a few dollars more than the level you choose (the Kickstarter version of a tip jar). In return we'll give you every ounce of energy in our body, every creative thought in our mind.

More than just a coffee maker, it\u2019s going to be an integral part of your new lifestyle. Designed with equal elements of function and form, the Arctic is sleek, elegant, and makes amazing tasting cold brew. It\u2019s simple to use, so you can easily add it into your everyday coffee routine - no professional barista experience necessary. Great coffee awaits.\nThe best-kept secret in the coffee world has been brewing for centuries. Cold brew coffee was invented in Japan during the 1600s, recently popularized by upscale coffee shops, and perfected for making at home with the Arctic.\nIf you haven\u2019t tried cold brew yet, you\u2019re missing out. The flavor is delightfully smooth compared to the taste of your usual cup, and it packs more than enough of a caffeinated kick to get you going in the morning. \nSkip your morning trip to the coffee shop and save time and money during your morning routine.\nEverything we\u2019ve learned about cold brew coffee has been put into the Arctic. After discovering something so great, we couldn\u2019t help but share it.\nYou don\u2019t need to be a professional barista to make your own cold brew. The Arctic is specifically designed to make brewing easy at home.\nSo what is cold brew? It\u2019s a way of brewing coffee in cold water rather than the traditional method of using hot water. Cold brew has a longer extraction process which gives it a few advantages over your typical cup of coffee. For one, it tastes a lot smoother. The familiar bite of hot brewed coffee is caused by fatty acids, which are left behind during the cold brewing process. This means it\u2019s not only easier on your taste buds but on your stomach as well.\nAfter brewing coffee grounds in cold water for a set amount of time (more on the ideal schedule later) you\u2019re left with a tasty cold brew.\nYour brew can be used as a base for many different drinks: hot, cold, iced, or in a shake! The versatility of cold brew is a true game-changer in how you consume your daily dose of coffee.\nPlus, with the Arctic, you can brew up an entire batch of cold brew at once to store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. \nThere are a million reasons to love cold brew coffee made by the Arctic. But for starters, here are the main benefits we think you should know about:\n                                                                                The Arctic is incredibly easy to use. Here's our preferred cold brew method to get you started.\nRemember, you\u2019re in control of the brewing process from start to finish! If you prefer stronger coffee, simply add more coffee grounds, use less water, or increase your brew time. The beans you choose will also determine how your brew turns out, so experiment to find out what makes your favorite coffee. \n As part of your daily life, we knew the Arctic had to be designed with equal elements of function and form. What we came up with was something sleek, and simple to use, so you can easily add it into your everyday coffee routine.\nThe carafe is made of 100% borosilicate glass and has a capacity of 50.7 oz (1.5L) to hold enough cold brew for 1-2 weeks. The Micron Filter is laser cut with tiny holes, 200 microns in diameter, to keep coffee grounds from leeching into your brew. Each feature was chosen to enhance the entire coffee-making process, from the simplicity of brewing to enjoying the smooth taste in every cup. \nYour favorite cup of coffee should be as unique as you are. The choice is yours in how little or how much you want to customize! If you\u2019re someone who is very particular about your coffee, you\u2019re going to love making cold brew with the Arctic. From fine-tuning the brewing process itself to choosing which beverage to make with your finished cold brew, the Arctic makes it easy to experiment and find out what works best for you. The possibilities are nearly endless with the Arctic.\nOne of the great benefits of the Arctic is how customizable each brew can be. For all you coffee connoisseurs out there, you\u2019re able to control not just the bean type or roast level, but also the brew time and water-to-coffee ratio. This affects the taste, aroma, and caffeine level, so you\u2019re in complete control to adjust these levels to your liking and make your ideal brew each time. If you prefer to keep things simple, find out what works for you and stick to it.\n  If you prefer stronger coffee, simply add more coffee grounds, use less water, or increase your brew time. The beans you choose will also determine how your brew turns out, so experiment to find out what makes your favorite coffee.\nOnce you\u2019ve made a batch of cold brew with the Arctic, you can use it as a base in a variety of coffee beverages. Not only can you serve it as hot coffee, over ice, or with cream or milk, but there are also plenty of ways to think outside the mug. Try it in a smoothie or milkshake, over ice cream, mixed with your favorite spirit, or even use it to bake with! Any coffee lover will surely have no shortage of creative ways to incorporate cold brew into drinks and desserts. Here\u2019s a few of our favorite recipes:\nThe journey for developing the Arctic was a process that was driven by our love and passion for coffee. And, of course, it was fuelled by coffee, too. Our goal was simple: bring to life an awesome cold brew system we would be proud to use ourselves and share with our friends. We envisioned it would be functional and an attractive conversation piece. Take a closer look at our journey with the Arctic!\nThe Arctic isn\u2019t just a coffee maker\u2014it\u2019s going to be an integral part of your new lifestyle. If you\u2019re like us, you need coffee in the morning and it needs to be well-made. Cold brew made with the Arctic simply tastes better than regular coffee: it\u2019s smoother, more flavorful, and has less bite. The Arctic can save you money by avoiding those daily trips to the coffee shop, and save you time by brewing big batches at once that can last up to 2 weeks.  \nYou\u2019re going to love the versatility that the Arctic provides, which lets you adjust both the brewing process and your beverage of choice as well. Say hello to hot coffee, iced coffee, shakes, and anything else your imagination can dream up for cold brew. Best of all, the Arctic itself is a prime example of when beautiful design is masterfully executed. Because when all your guests compliment you on serving them the best coffee they\u2019ve ever had, you\u2019ll be proud to show them the Arctic.                                         \nYour pledge will not only help us bring the Arctic to life, it will help us build our brand and take our business to the next level. We thank you for believing in us.\nJoin the movement now and make a pledge to get your very own Arctic. Great coffee awaits.\nAs of December 5th 2016, we successfully reached our $75,000 stretch goal. A huge thanks to all of our backers for your support.

Backers are responsible for any and all import fees, VAT, duties, taxes, post office fees, and or any other fees their country or government imposes, which in the past have ranged from 0% to 20% in the US and EU countries, to as much as 200% for certain South American countries. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter.\nShipments that could not be delivered due to an inaccurately provided address (including failure to update an old address) will have additional costs to be reshipped. Due to the size of your rewards, we cannot ship to PO Boxes.\nEstimated Delivery: Once production is complete on all of the orders, we will provide updates for shipping dates. As you know with international shipping there can be unpredictable delays that are out of our control, however, we will do our absolute best to ship based on the predicted time frame.\nOur team is made up of friends and colleagues, all of which have one major thing in common: we\u2019re 90% powered by caffeine. Which is why we thought it was so fitting to collectively put our energy into making an amazing home coffee system.\nWe\u2019ve been through a lot from day one on our long journey of developing the Arctic. We\u2019re proud to share our creation with the world and appreciate all the interest that we\u2019ve been shown by our supporters.\nBecause no matter how we spend our days, we all start them the same.

Of course, even with a solid plan, there is a potential of schedule risk: it is still possible that an unexpected issue may arise that causes a delay in production or an unforeseen situation with shipping like our container being delayed in customs.

The con will happen even if the Kickstarter doesn't make - but if it does? We'll be able to bring more guests and do more fun things for you guys.  \nOur Angel investor has done what they promised and supported the con for the first 3 years.  Now it's time for us to fly on our own.  As is we can bring 12 guests (some are volunteering their time and travel expenses).  Usually we have closer to 30 professional guests.  In order to meet that goal we need your help.  \nPlus? You can save money by pledging now rather than waiting until regular ticket sales go live. Regular pre-registration (post-Kickstarter) is $50 online.  On-site registration is $60 for the weekend.\nOur goal of $5000 will bring the number of guests up to 17.  Once funded we will announce stretch goals to bring even more amazing special guests to Austin!  \n2017 Guest List (so far!):\nCam Banks\nClint Black\nJodi Black\nMark Carroll (added 10/3)\nJeff Dee (added 10/9)\nAnne-Marie Edens De Witt (added 11/1)\nSean Patrick Fannon\nShane Ivey\nTalzhemir Mrr (added 10/9)\nBrandon Christopher Peterson\nDonna Prior\nMichael Satran\nGareth-Michael Skarka\nDennis Sustare (added 10/3)\nGeorge Vasilakos\nRoss Watson\nEd Wetterman\nAvonelle Wing (added 11/1)\nWith your help funding the Kickstarter we'll be able to add more guests to our roster such as:\nJamie Chambers (added 10/5)\nJohn Wick (added 10/11)\nKenneth Hite (added 10/22)\nRobert Schwalb (added 10/15)\n(more announcements coming soon)\nSwag includes two t-shirt designs to choose from in gray, black or white, exclusive bennies and dice towers!\nPlease note that all items will be available for pickup at the convention (or if we make a stretch goal at a special pre-show event). If for any reason you are unable to attend we will make arrangements to ship your Kickstarter swag after the convention.\nHow are we addressing issues at last year's Con?\nThanks to input from last year's con-goers we will be making some changes that we hope you'll enjoy. \n1) FOOD - while there are plenty of options within walking distance of the hotel, many of us prefer to stay put so we can prepare for our games, shop with vendors and hang with friends.  The food options provided by the hotel last year were not great.  This year we will be contracting with another food service provider and curating what is provided. We will do our best to keep prices down; however, Con food is never going to be cheap since it costs extra to make it available on site. But at least it will be good food!\n2) REGISTRATION - we know there were issues with registration, both for the convention and for game signup.  We are working diligently to make that process much smoother for you.  In addition, if you purchase tickets on-site we will do our best to make that easy and fast. \n3) T-SHIRTS - There were a variety of complaints about shirts in year 3 including color, style, availability and how GM shirts were handled.  This time not only will we be giving you more options but T-Shirts will be on-demand printed and tied to a particular name so there is no confusion as to who gets what. Plus? You'll have more choice in what you order.\n4) MISC - Other things we're addressing: more signs, Con 101 information for booklet, map of outside food locations, big map at entrance, more information and visibility for silent auction, better information on game library and open gaming.\nWhat about scholarships?  We want to provide an opportunity for students who otherwise could not afford to attend to come to the convention.  Budding game developers will write an essay to be judged by our special guests to award however many scholarships we get funded.  \nEvery $25 raised by supporting pledges will equal one scholarship, if the total is not an exact match for a particular number of scholarships our Angel investor will make up the difference. For example, let's say we raised $110 in scholarships, $100 of it will guarantee 4 scholarships. Our Angel will provide the needed funds to make that last $10 into $25 to fund a total of 5 scholarships.\nIn addition, a portion of the proceeds from this year's conference will benefit Austin Creative Pathways, a local nonprofit dedicated to providing educational opportunities for underserved youth.\nWhat the heck are Chango Bucks?\nDuring the convention they are usable at tables for $1 re-rolls and during the Celebrity Game. They are not usable for any other purpose and are not legal tender. If you do not have dollar bills (like many of us who use credit cards for everything), you can \"buy\" Chango Bucks at the convention to use as your dollar re-roll /charity game currency during the con.\nWhat about add-ons?\nAdd-ons available: \n$25 per additional membership (if you want a second VIP or Super VIP membership pledge separately so we don't get confused) \n$5 convention scholarship fund support\n $20 Convention T-Shirt \n $25 Kickstarter Exclusive T-Shirt \n $10 Chango Dice Tower\n$10 Kickstarter Exclusive Chango Poker Chips (25)\nTo get add-ons: \n1. Make your pledge like normal\n2. Click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page.\n3. Increase your pledge by the amount needed to claim the add-on(s).\n4. Save your pledge.

Our shared interest in comics and gaming led to the argument which gave rise to our Villains and Vigilantes\u2122 superhero role-playing game: who would win in a fight, Spider-Man or the Human Torch? We decided to game it out... which meant coming up with game rules for superhero combat!\nSoon we were running our newly created superhero RPG, which we named \"Villains and Vigilantes\" (V&V\u2122 for short), for our own local gaming group. Our player's characters called themselves... the mighty Protectors!\nThe first edition of V&V was published in 1979, followed by a revised and improved edition in 1982.\nVillains and Vigilantes was the first complete superhero role-playing game. Its second edition featured random character generation, d20-based combat and 'hit points' reminiscent of other early tabletop RPGs, and the option for players to make characters based on themselves. Because superheroes and role-playing games are awesome! It's an unabashedly old-school approach. Read reviews of V&V here!\nIn 2010, we set up Monkey House Games\u2122 in order to release V&V 2.1: a re-publication of the '82 second edition with some corrections, new material, and all-new artwork. This was followed by a series of new V&V adventures, including \"Infinity Lounge\" which you can download for free.\nBut MHG's ultimate aim was always the publication of a fully updated 3rd edition of V&V. After an unfortunate delay due to legal problems (which have now been successfully resolved), this brings us to...\nV&V 3.0: Mighty Protectors!\nThe new 'third edition' has a name, and not just a number: it\u2019s called MIGHTY PROTECTORS\u2122 after the player group from the very first V&V campaign in our official setting \u2013 the Mighty Protectors Multiverse.\nMighty Protectors features a new streamlined and expanded revision of the V&V rules, an intro to the Mighty Protectors Multiverse (about which we've only provided scattered details before), and all-new artwork.\nWe\u2019ve posted about the new rules extensively on the Monkey House Games website. Expansions and changes include: refined character generation (supporting campaigns at Low, Standard, or High-powered ability levels, and allowing optional character construction in addition to random generation), improved game balance, new super-abilities (such as Arsenal, Grapnel and Communicators), greatly improved rules for old abilities (such as Special Weapons and Vehicles), and new rules for customizing abilities! Check out this sample conversion of the villain Bandit and his Race Car, from the V&V supplement Most Wanted!\nDespite these additions and changes, converting characters from Revised / V&V 2.1 is relatively simple. Monkey House Games is also committed to supporting the previous edition of V&V, and so we will include Revised/2.1 stats in all of our 3.0/Mighty Protectors adventures and supplements.\nV&V 3.0: Mighty Protectors also includes an extensive overview of the Mighty Protectors Multiverse. Play alongside its greatest heroes, such as the Crusaders, Shatterman and Condor, or the mighty Protectors themselves! Prowl the streets of Central City, explore the fabled Secret Land, travel among the planets of the Sphere, or visit the Interdimensional Library! You can read all about the Mighty Protectors Multiverse on our forums.\nProject Status\nOver 5 years in development, Mighty Protectors has been heavily play-tested. The new rules are finished, solid, and awesome. The remaining text work consists of a final editing and usability pass, examples of play, and final page layouts. We also need to create all of its artwork. We estimate that the book will be 140 pages in length. The money we raise will fund this effort, plus the work necessary to complete our stretch goals. We're extremely proud of the work we've already done, and thrilled to finally be able to bring the finished product to you!\nAdd-Ons!\nYou may add any combination of these choices to your pledge. Select any pledge level, while adding the following amounts to the actual amount of your pledge.

A decade filled with adventure and the spirit of invention.  \nBased on the ongoing Action Lab comic series, Herald the TTRPG gives you the chance to make history as you investigate clues, fight unspeakable creatures, design your own technologies, and uncover the mystery and adventure of the pulpy world of the 1920's\u2026 all while trying to maintain your sanity.\nThese are the days of new technology, of cults and magic, everyday items imbued with extraordinary powers, talismans, coded messages, mysterious trans-Atlantic plane disappearances, kidnappings and crooked businesses, mafia-controlled moonshine production, the jazz age, the stars of the silent film era, the scientists and explorers who opened our minds and expanded our brains, the age of astronomical discovery and the adolescence of quantum physics, the first automatons, the blinding era right after the Great War, the days your great grandparents barely survived. Oh, you didn't know that? That part wasn't passed down in your family history? Well prepare yourself...\nThere are terrifying things from beyond the stars. \nYes, BEYOND. Unimaginable, unspeakable, cosmic horrors from the great Cthulhu Mythos have arrived, unseen, and those that find out too much end up lost in debilitating madness. Lovecraft knew that. His stories were actually observation, and so many of the great minds and spirited adventurers of this age joined together to keep humanity from falling to the Mi-Go, Elder gods, sly Shoggoth or the dreaded avatars of Nyarlathotep. Human cults that worship these fiendish beasts have infiltrated all levels of society. The conspiracy is unraveling, the secrets have become too much to hide, the cultists too bold and dangerous.\nH.P. Lovecraft teams up with Nikola Tesla, Amelia Earhart, Albert Einstein, Harry Houdini, Sonia Greene, Marie Curie, Babe Ruth, Josephine Baker, Jack Dempsey, Charlie Chaplin,Clara Bow, Kandinsky, Trilussa, Keaton, the list goes on and on. So many joined the fight against the Cthulhu Mythos creatures who invaded our world in the 1920's. But this is no ordinary Call-back to Cthulhu style TTRPG, this is as much about the history and personalities of the notable figures alive in this exciting era. \nYou can play as any well-known person from the 1920's, mix up history, have fun! Or create an unique character from scratch to join the fight. \nOr, if you are feeling like you want to twist your RPG experience a bit... CREATE YOUR GREAT GRANDPARENTS.  \nWhy not take your inspiration for your next player-character from your family photo album? Perhaps your great grandfather was famous in your family for being one of the first airplane pilots or sketching wonderfully artistic drawings. Maybe your great grandmother was best-known in your family for her inventions or being the first one in town to get a degree in biology. Or maybe you always loved the stories about your black-sheep great uncle who spent his life travelling the world and searching for adventure. These are the archetypes that will fit perfectly in the world of Herald: Lovecraft and Tesla.  \nScience meets Fiction in the Savage Worlds of the Roaring Twenties.\nTHE STORY SO FAR:\nOn a cool autumn morning, Nikola Tesla\u2019s fiancee, Amelia Earhart, is pulled into another dimension while \u201cborrowing\u201d one of his prototype magnetic engines. \nAfter speaking with Einstein, Tesla is told to find HP Lovecraft for his arcane expertise, but the two are instead pulled into a world of secret societies, strange science, and the Cthulhu conspiracy; the same conspiracy that Mr. Mark Twain has recruited you to fight. yes, THE Mark Twain. Why is he still alive in the 1920s? What kind of dark magic is at play here? Well you can ask him, but don't expect a pleasant response. He's a bit cranky at 97 years old, but he sure looks great.\nHerald the TTRPG places you at the center of the Cthulhu Mythos, kicked by its cosmic unknowns and shoved into the soup of history.\n  Herald: Lovecraft & Tesla Corebook-  \nThis 175 page book contains The Savage Worlds of the 1920's comes to life in full color. History, creatures, equipment, vehicles, maps, campaigns and one-shots, a guide to the ElseWhere dimension of the Elder gods, an adventure generator, all the history and setting notes you'd ever want, as well as a \"Yearbook\" section of famous figures of the 1920s who joined HP and Nikola in the battle against the Mythos creatures from beyond the stars.

In our last update I mentioned that we were working on getting the battle maps and the hardcover editions printed and shipped to the warehouse. Well we've had a couple of issues that we've been grappling with which have slowed the process down a bit. Because we are only printing battle maps for backers, rather than an extra run for the public release, we've had difficulty finding a printer that is willing to do a short run of maps and not charge very high prices. Typically, when producing maps for an RPG, a large number would be purchased from a company overseas making the cost tolerable. The problem with that is that we would be looking at up to six months turnaround, which obviously isn't something we're willing to do.

Watch Season 0 below!\nThe Gamers: Episode 1 is The Gamers project fans have been asking us for since Dorkness Rising.\nIn The Shadow Menace we\u2019re going back to what people loved about The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising. Tabletop RPG comedy. Gamers sitting around the table, playing a roleplaying game, controlling fantasy characters. Then we cut to those fantasy characters and see what our actions are like as if they actually happened.\nAnd in this show, we\u2019re throwing in a twist. The fantasy world\u2026 is our own world! A modern fantasy. Gaming in the world you know, and what it looks like when you deal with real world situations through gaming mechanics.\nMark rolls up a new character\nWHAT ABOUT GAMERS 4 AND HOW DOES THIS SHOW FIT IN?\nWho remembers when Iron Man launched the Marvel cinematic universe? And then along came Thor. And Captain America. And slowly, we all began to realize that an AVENGERS movie might actually happen.\nGamers 4 is our Avengers. It's an epic team-up, assembled to conclude a story that began in 2002 with The Gamers, when we laid the seeds of a payoff that would bring everything full circle.\nWe laid more groundwork in Dorkness Rising.\nThen we expanded the mythology with Hands of Fate and Humans & Households. We put huge spoilers right in the middle of the screen and nobody caught them.\nNimble greats the Darkness characters\nNow we're continuing the story with The Gamers: The Series. We're putting the game pieces on the board and pushing them closer together. We're filling in the missing details, learning The Shadow's agenda, exposing the rules of the GAMERS universe. And of course, we're sitting a group of players down at a table, giving them a quest, and laughing hard at how their actions play out within the world of the game.\nIt's old-school meets new-school, with the gaming comedy that you crave, plus a heist-film twist, where we get to see how adventures set in our world would play out, especially with a savvy group of rules lawyers, munchkins, and story players.\nNimble puts the pieces together\nThis is the Gamers that fans have been asking for. And if we get to make this show, we get to pay off everything when Gamers 4 launches.\nWe've been doing this since we created the genre in 2002 with the original The Gamers. And we've been right there beside you, laughing with you the whole time. Now, geek is chic and there is a huge influx of fantasy and gaming films, shows, and even gaming themed episodes of existing shows. Some are great! But even now, with gaming in the mainstream, some make gamers the butt of the joke. We continue to love and respect gaming and gamers and want to make more stuff to laugh at *with* you for years to come.\nA mysterious ritual\nSO WHEN IS GAMERS 4?\nWe need three episodes (135 minutes total) to bring us from here to the events of Gamers 4. However, thanks to our Patreon supporters, we should be able to complete even more episodes of this show while Gamers 4 is in development. We can't rush the timeline for writing and planning Gamers 4, but we can tell as much of this story as possible while we're getting there.\n\u201cI backstab him with a ballista.\u201d \u2013 Nimble, the Thief\n\u201cSomeone finally understands us.\u201d \u2013 Gamers at every convention ever\nSince the original GAMERS film, we\u2019ve gone on to create classic roleplaying features like DORKNESS RISING and HANDS OF FATE, plus GAMERS shorts like HUMANS & HOUSEHOLDS and NATURAL ONE.\n  At the end of THE GAMERS, fantasy stereotypes Rogar, Nimble, Newmoon, and Ambrose\u2026 sorry, \u201cMagellan\u201d\u2026 accidentally stepped through a portal into our world, where they defeated their own players. They\u2019ve been stuck here ever since, without direction or purpose. Until now.\nA new gaming group has uncovered the group\u2019s old character sheets and the original GM\u2019s campaign notes. Now, the new players will set out to finish the story of the original Gamers as our heroes...\nencounter minions of The Shadow who have infiltrated our world\nsearch for a portal back to Fartherall\napply a dose of fantasy justice to evildoers across the multiverse\nCutting back and forth between the players at the table and the game, this first episode abuses line-of-sight rules, wrestles with grappling tables, and explores what happens when retro gaming meets sophisticated rules lawyers and when fantasy-world characters try to defeat modern villains.\nFeaturing the returning talents of Nathan Rice (Newmoon), Justin McGregor (Magellan), Phil M Price (Nimble), and Matt Shimkus (Rogar), we are also proud to introduce a new group of players:\nMegan \u2013 Anna Clausen, the gamemaster\nZach \u2013 Jay Irwin, Rogar's player\nCharlie \u2013 Maggie Ferguson-Wagstaffe, Newmoon's player\nJamie \u2013 Khanh Doan, Magellan's player\nBrad \u2013 Brandon Simmons, Nimble's player\nPlus a special appearance from Russell Hodgkinson (Z-NATION) as The Professor.\nAnd thanks to our monthly Patreon supporters, we have already completed a special Season 0 of the show to bridge the gap between the original film and now, which you can watch right here (Rogar Episode coming very soon. It's finishing up post production):\nBut this isn\u2019t just a show about the original film, THE GAMERS. While this series can stand entirely on its own for new gamers and fans to enjoy, it is also the next part of the meta-story, a saga that we\u2019ve been telling for fifteen years. This series runs concurrently with the events of THE GAMERS: HANDS OF FATE and leads directly into THE GAMERS 4, which will conclude the adventures of Joanna, Lodge, Cass, Gary, and Leo. But don\u2019t take our word for it: just watch this.\nIf you\u2019re a hardcore Gamers fan, this is where we lay the final pieces into place for the explosive GAMERS 4 finale. In this show we\u2019ll uncover The Shadow\u2019s mysterious agenda, explain the link between Fartherall and our world, and reveal secrets and connections that we set up in THE GAMERS and DORKNESS RISING. In other words, the pay-off begins! \nOur primary goal for this campaign is to raise enough money for the 45-minute pilot episode of THE GAMERS: SEASON ONE. Any extra funds raised will help increase our production value for this episode and help subsidize the cost of future Patreon-funded episodes, including a ridiculous DEMON HUNTERS and GAMERS crossover Christmas Special.\nIf you love THE GAMERS and want to help full episodes release on a regular basis, when this campaign ends we also encourage you to become a supporter of our monthly Patreon campaign. Our big goal is to receive enough ongoing Patreon support to stay in constant production on this series, rather than having to run multiple large Kickstarters throughout the year. Patreon supporters receive special benefits, including early access to new episodes, big discounts for add-ons in BackerKit, and producer credits.\nWHO ARE WE?\nWe are Dead Gentlemen Productions and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment.\nDead Gentlemen Productions began in 1999 with the production of DEMON HUNTERS. Based on that film\u2019s success, we went on to shoot a sequel, DEAD CAMPER LAKE, and followed up with THE GAMERS, REVAMPING DOYLE, HOUSE RULEZ, DORKNESS RISING, DEMON HUNTERS: ORIENTATION VIDEO, two editions of the DEMON HUNTERS RPG, and a DEMON HUNTERS online comic.\nZombie Orpheus Entertainment was founded in 2010, producing three seasons of JOURNEYQUEST, THE GAMERS: HANDS OF FATE, HUMANS & HOUSEHOLDS, NATURAL ONE, DARK DUNGEONS, ATTACKING THE DARKNESS, STROWLERS, and annual performances of THE GAMERS LIVE at Gen Con Indy.\nTHE GAMERS \"THE SHADOW MENACE\" is our latest collaboration between the two companies.\nThis season is produced by Don Early and Lindy Bousteld, written by Ben Dobyns, and directed by L.

Titles range from small one page products called \"#1 with a Bullet Point\" that list a few new themed items, feats, or spells, to Gingerbread Kaiju, an edible family board game.\nOwen K.C.

You're responsible for your own transportation to Seattle and lodging, so plan ahead on this one!\n(or) Background Prop - Send us something unique that you'd love to have appear in the show. This is subject to prior approval. We will contact you after the campaign is over to work out what you're sending us.

You pay for the shipping, including shipping and handling if you want it returned. We are not responsible for damage to your prop, or if its lost, stolen, etc\n(or) Virtual Rendezvous: Have a 60-minute VIRTUAL RENDEZVOUS ($80) with available creators or cast on Google Hangouts.

We will create an audio recording of The Shadow saying your minion's name in some kind of line for use on your smartphone or computer. We will publish and publicly recognize all the backer-created minions of The Shadow once the episode releases. This Reward is now included in the $750 level and above.\n$500 Reward - Character Sheet Credit:\n\nChoose two of the $250 rewards, plus all lower-level rewards, and send us a photo of yourself (we will work with you on what kind of photo works best), and we will create a credit for you in the style of the character credits in the beginning of the show. \nExample of a Character Sheet Credit\n$500 Reward - Red Card: NEW! Choose two of the $250 rewards, plus all lower-level rewards, AND you receive a much-coveted Red Card. This allows you to flag bad puns, off-color remarks, or other violations by our cast and crew, both from set and in-person at conventions. We'll send that person to time out, sub in somebody new, and film and upload the results for you.

Plus, by popular request, at $2000 and above we're also including a full size Mark the Red cardboard cutout standee!!! As always, you will be responsible for your own lodging and transportation, as well as to arrive on set on the day we schedule you. So check your September calendars now!\n\n This is really important, so read carefully:  \nWe will charge for all shipping after the campaign in BackerKit. In order for your rewards to ship, you will need to pay shipping fees at that time. Do NOT add shipping fees to your pledge now.  \nThe Short Version\u2014  \nInternational Backers: expect to pay less than $9.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $55 reward. \nDomestic Backers: expect to pay less than $5.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $55 reward. \nThe Long Version, for people who like details\u2014 \nInternational Backers: we are working with a third-party agency to fulfill your orders from warehouses in Europe, Canada, and Australia. This should help cut your typical U.S. shipping costs by a huge margin. However, please be aware that you may still be responsible for import duties, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. Duties will not be included in your shipping charge, with one exception...\nEU Backers: We will include VAT for EU members when we charge for shipping in BackerKit. That way your package should arrive with much less hassle and holdup. And a bit faster as well.\nDomestic Backers: we want to get the best-possible shipping and handling rate for you. Rather than over-estimating expenses now, we will charge actual rates when we are ready to ship. \nAll Backers: by handling shipping this way, we reduce unknown costs now, which means we know exactly how much we can put into the production budget, and then we can use economy of scale to make specific shipping orders with exact details. \nWhat will shipping cost, you ask?\nInternational orders will average $.99 handling per item, plus local shipping costs. This should still be much less than you have paid in the past. (For example, in 2013 our cost to ship a DVD internationally began at $8.59 and went up from there as the weight increased.) Unfortunately, we cannot calculate this more precisely until we know our volume and can negotiate for the best rate possible. \nDomestic orders will start at the current Media Mail rate for a five ounce parcel, plus a minimum of $.25 handling per item. You can estimate that shipping will begin around $3.99, plus more for larger or heavier packages that include more than a DVD. Again, we'll use our volume to negotiate for the best-possible quote.\nADD-ONS & BACKERKIT\nWhat is BackerKit?\nWhen the Kickstarter campaign is over, we will need to finalize the details of your rewards, your address, and that sort of thing. That happens in the form of a survey that we email out through BackerKit. When you fill that out, you will have an opportunity to purchase add-ons to your reward. You'll be charged shipping for the Kicsktarter reward, and for the additional items you pick up. So it's kind of like the checkout stand at the store. \nWhen will the survey be sent out?\nNot for at least 30 days after the Kickstarter ends. We're buggering off to Gen Con in Indianapolis after the campaign ends, and when we get back we will be gearing up for production... so super busy. Once the dust settles we should be able to get the survey out to you so you can pick up some tempting add-ons, which will help raise more money for the project. So make no mistake, we want to get this out the door asap.\nAdd-ons\nIn Backerkit you will find add-ons and exclusives, such as:\nExclusive T-shirt(s)\nDigital Downloads\nSoundtracks\nRewards available at higher levels that aren't limited or signed, such as the Bag of Holding\nThe previous films like: \nThe Gamers: Director's Cut DVD\n  The Gamers: Dorkness Rising Special Edition DVD\n  The Gamers: Dorkness Rising Definitive Edition BluRay\n  The Gamers: Hands of Fate DVD\n  Humans & Households and Natural 1 DVD\n  The Gamers Live 2012 DVD\n  The Mask of Death Pathfinder Adventure\n  The Shadow's Dungeon Pathfinder Adventure\n And more!!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any film project, there's a ton of things that could go wrong that we just can't plan for. And with any Kickstarter, there may be delays, challenges, changes, and whatnot that may occur in trying to fulfill the rewards. This is not our first rodeo, thankfully. We've been through giant storms, generators catching fire, last minute casting changes, and toddlers helping to pack packages. \n\nBetween Zombie Orpheus Entertainment and Dead Gentlemen Productions, we have EXTENSIVE experience with this process.

We currently have all but one of the prose stories written and illustrated, the playing deck designed, and all of the art prints created. We'll need additional funds to bring the grand comic finale to fruition and print. \nAny funds raised beyond our goal will go toward future Strange Arcana products; we've already got a Savage Worlds roleplaying game setting in the works and some other exciting products in mind too.\nYou see the world in four colors\u2014 bright, primary comets that streak across the sky. They fling themselves at one another, punching with the force of a wrecking ball and blasting each other with beams hot enough to turn sand into glass. These heroes, in their capes and their power armor, are beacons of light, no doubt. But everyone forgets that light casts shadows. I see into those shadows. I see the things that skulk in the darkness, waiting for a chance to pounce, while everyone is blinded by the light show. I know what the nightmares are, but what\u2019s more I know who\u2014no, what\u2014 the dreamers are that make the nightmares. What I have to tell you, you are not going to want to hear. You are not going to want to know what I know and you sure as hell are not going to want to see what I have seen. Here's your chance to change your mind, to turn back toward the light and leave the shadows at your back. You can stay in your four colored world. I wouldn\u2019t blame you. If I knew then what I know now, I might have done the same, but I can\u2019t go back and neither can you once you step into the darkness with us. So? What are you going to do\u2014keep punching badly dressed men with stupid nicknames, or face the real threat?\nArt print by James Denton\nStrange Arcana is, on its surface, about superheroes going toe to toe with tentacled horrors. It's the mutant offspring of an otherworldly love affair between Stan Lee and H.P. Lovecraft.\nThe world of Strange Arcana is our own, with the same history of people, places, and events. But beneath the surface, there is a secret history, a Strange history, in which forces both \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d contend over the power of Strange Arcana, the dreamstuff of vast, terrible alien intelligences called Sleepers. These beings gestate in the deep places of the Earth, coming ever closer to waking with each human death\u2014especially those deaths accompanied by pain and terror. Such deaths, in large concentrations, cause the Sleepers to stir, which in turn causes their dreams to leak into the waking world. Sometimes the dreams take form, becoming a walking nightmare like a demon or monster of myth. Often, they find purchase in a human mind and bestow awesome and terrible powers. In ancient times, these people were hailed as demigods and divine champions--or avatars of evil. In the modern times, they are known as superheroes and supervillains.\nArt print by Aaron Riley\n  Nora Nostalgia is back! Doctor Noir never faces a more confounding foe than the woman he once loved, and who still loves him even as she battles him time and again for supremacy over the Strange Arcana itself! With her nefarious Nethermen, Nora plans to enslave millions via magically-enhanced music. Will even the Guru of the Gnostic Graces dance to her tune? \n  Ever since Hex inherited reality warping powers from her father -- the mysterious and powerful man called Void -- and a ghostly wolf guardian from her mother, she has been on the run. Living on the streets and in shelters, the indigent and destitute become her family and she does what she can to protect them. When many of them start to disappear she goes looking for answers. What she finds is one of her villainous father's henchmen, a wild child called Lyssa, tasked with getting her out of the city before something happens that is so big even Void fears it. But Hex won't abandon her friends so she and Lyssa embark on a quest to save them while the city runs out of time. \n  When Overseer, a former computer programmer now merged with a mastermind\u2019s AI, detects a mysterious transmission coming from a previously unknown military base in the Canadian arctic, she leads a team of Vanguard Knights to investigate. Accompanying them on his first mission is Lucas Crow, a teleporter, but inexperience is no match against the Strange Arcana. There, they discover something never before seen by human eyes, and discover a force that threatens the existence of the entire world.\n  Octopoid monsters rise from the depths and rage across Boston. The exiled Prince of Atlantis, Sea Lad, could easily use his powers to send the things back to the abyss. But Sea Lad has one demand--an apology from the former villain-turned-hero called Titan. Can Mender, his reluctant sponsor in Vanguard, convince the man once known as \"The Bully\" to put aside his pride and convince the prince to save Boston? Spoiler alert--she can't.\n  Investigative reporter Anna Crane comes to Red Hook seeking the key to a string of mysterious murders. The search leads her to a depraved nightmare cult devoted to hideous sacraments of evil performed beneath the very streets of the unsuspecting Brooklyn neighborhood. When Anna falls into the foul grasp of the cultists and the inhuman monstrosities they serve, only the power of Naak-Ra can save her! But can the Warrior Out of Time reach Anna before it is too late?    \n  Leif Nygard knew that GEBO, the global Scandinavian housewares chain he worked for, had a cultlike following and a bunch of break room jokes about Norse mythology. But he never expected GEBO\u2019s gifts to extend to the supernatural. Once he and his girlfriend Bryn receive some, it\u2019s time to find out what\u2019s going on with the housewares chain that encircles the globe like the Midgard serpent\u2026.  \n  Freddy Rodriguez thought the jade pendant he\u2019d found had made him the avatar of the ancient Mayan gods. Then he faced off against a terrifying creature that laughed and told him, \u201cno, little man, your gifts come from us, not your silly gods.\u201d Now Freddy is worried that it might be true\u2014especially since both his \u201cgod form\u201d and his normal body have started changing in strange and unsettling ways.\n   We've lined up comic book artist Bien Flores to handle the penciling duties for Strange Arcana, with colors by the Sigil art team. Bien has 20 plus years experience in animation. He's worked for major animation studios as both animator and animation director and is transitioning to a full time freelance illustration career. As soon as we hit our funding goal, we'll begin production on the grand finale comic! \nHere are some sample pages from Bien's portfolio:  \nBien Flores portfolio pages.\n  Note: Add-Ons may incur additional shipping, determined during the survey.    \nArt print by Jonathan Taylor\n The BackerKit survey is sent when rewards are about ready to ship (Target: Feb 2017). You may either pledge for Add-On items *now* or during the *survey*. To Add-On items now, click on the pledge level you want. It should show you the total reward level plus shipping to your location. Add funds equal to the Add-On item price to your total pledge. There is no special button or function for this--Add-Ons are something of a Kickstarter tradition, not part of the Kickstarter website software.  \nPlease note you may be charged additional shipping for those Add-On items during the survey anyway (it's the same shipping price whether you Add-On now or later). For example, an additional book usually costs $1 more to ship with your order. To Add-On items during the survey, do nothing now. When you receive your survey (target: Feb 2017), you can choose what Add-Ons you want and your total will be calculated for you. You will pay via credit card.

We have decided to collect shipping fees through BackerKit for the following reasons: \n Collecting shipping fees during the campaign artificially increases the funding level of the campaign. \n Collecting shipping fees through BackerKit prevents our backers from having to pre-pay for shipping months in advance. \n By collecting shipping fees shortly before fulfillment, we will be able to most accurately determine shipping costs based on actual book weights instead of estimating. \n      Art print by Jonathan Taylor\nShould we pass our original funding goal, we\u2019ll add Stretch Goals free to every appropriate pledge level! Let\u2019s unlock as many as we can and make everyone\u2019s foray into the world of Strange Arcana as entertaining as possible!\n$18,000 - initial funding goal met.\n$20,000 - Contributor bonus! We're a first time publisher with a modest budget. Unlocking this goal allows us to pay our awesome contributors a little extra and they're worth every dollar.\n$22,500 - A new hero joins the fight! Bigger book! We'll add a brand new illustrated story by special guest author and a new art print from a special guest artist.\n$25,000 - Into the unknown!  We'll reveal additional goals if we're lucky enough to hit this mark, but we'll be happy just to reach our initial goal.            \nThe book will be available in stores and online only after backers have received their rewards. Rewards will be delivered at different times. Some rewards will be delivered in August, once Kickstarter processes the pledges. The full ANTHOLOGY PRINT BOOK, TEE SHIRT, and PLAYING DECK will ship together in early 2017.\nArt print by Jonathan Taylor\nThank you so much for considering our project!

What little money you do earn is invested right back into paint and canvases. Without that paint and those canvases, you won't be able to follow your dream of becoming a famous artist. Being a starving artist is a constant struggle.\nStarving Artists is an award-winning, blind-drafting and resource management game for one to four players.  Using some of the world's most beautiful works of art, players complete these masterpieces using transparent cubes in an attempt to become famous artists. It takes about 40-60 minutes (approximately 20 minutes per player).\nStarving Artists is played over a series of turns. Each turn represents a new day. On each day, you must choose between: buying new canvases, painting the canvases you already own, or working in order to get more paint. If at the end of the day, you've completed a masterpiece, you can sell it to earn more paint and food. If you don't spend your days efficiently, you won't be able to feed yourself, and you'll have to give up on your dreams. \nYou can read the current version of the rules or scroll to the end to see a short how to play at the bottom of this page.\nAs an aspiring paint-by-cube artist, your life centers around the paintings you must complete.\nIn order to complete those paintings, you take two actions each day. You can buy new canvases from the market, paint canvases in your studio using your paint cubes, or work to collect new paint cubes.\nAt the end of each day, you can sell your completed paintings. But, you'll be competing in the limited marketplace for paintings with anyone else who wants to sell. If there's not enough paint to go around, you'll have to make do with less.\nThe following how to play video is from the survival contest version of the game. There are some changes to the gameplay, but much of the gameplay is the same.\nEach copy of Starving Artists comes with everything that an aspiring artist needs: paints, studios, canvases and food. They also come with things that you probably wouldn't think about: telescoping box, rule book, paint bag, and a wooden carrot (to mark the first player).\n52 Jumbo Cards with great works of art and 145 acrylic cubes.\nFour player references, nutrition markers, first player token and paint bag.\nJumbo-sized canvases (3.5\"x5.5\") that feature the works of art.\nTelescoping box, acrylic cubes and paint bag\nCanvases being painted\nTransparent, Acrylic Paint Cubes\n Plus, the game now includes all these great stretch goal art packs:\nYou can read the current version of the rules.\nYou can also try the Print & Play version of the game.

It\u2019s a well-crafted, believable medieval world created by masterful German designers native to a land of dark woods, deep mines, and high castles.\nOver 30 years, those designers and a vast fan base of hundreds of thousands of players have created a rich fantasy lore without compare! \nThe Dark Eye (TDE) has the largest active community of any European roleplaying game. Years of gaming and stories provide a depth to the world not commonly found in other games. \nThis latest edition of The Dark Eye brings together decades of design refinements and player suggestions, all coordinated by a passionate and skilled team who have been playing for years. \nThe World of Aventuria\nThe Dark Eye is rich, complete, and incredibly real! \nAventuria is a vast and detailed continent and a world in need of heroes. The heart of Aventuria is the Middenrealm, an empire nominally ruled by the young Empress Rohaja but in reality controlled by powerful regional lords and ladies. It is a land where knights and daring heroes fight for the order of the gods and grim dwarves delve their mines and subterranean cities deep in the mountains. \nSome years ago, human servants of the dreaded archdemons conquered a province of the Middenrealm. Now called the Shadowlands, this haunted realm is home to demon summoners and necromancers. The Middenrealm remains ever vigilant for signs that the armies of the Shadowlands are once again on the move. \nThe progressive Horasian Empire, home to artists and poets, lies south of the Middenrealm. The cities of this fertile land are ruled by patricians, nobles, and councilors who strive constantly to outdo or weaken their rivals via intrigue. \nThe orcs of Aventuria make their home in the Orclands, steppes that stretch along the northwestern border of the Middenrealm. \nThorwal lies west of the Orclands. The Thorwalers are brave seafarers who enjoy a reputation as feared pirates. Emboldened by their whale-god, Swafnir, the longboats of the Thorwalers threaten much of the western coast of Aventuria. \nFurther south lies the Empire of Al\u2019Anfa. Its capital of the same name, called the Boil of the South by some, is a city of decadence and intrigue where a stranger\u2019s life is worth only what it can fetch in the slave markets. \nNovadi tribes rule the huge Kho\u0302m Desert that lies east of the Horasian Empire, beyond the mountains. Even further east, sultans and emirs rule over the Lands of the Tulamydes.\nThe northern forests and steppes surrounding the Salamander Stones are the traditional homelands of the elves. Beloved for their beauty and grace but feared for their sometimes cruel treatment of invaders, elves are magical beings who seem to be born from light.\nThe Dark Eye derives its name from the most intriguing magical artifacts in Aventuria\u2014the Dark Eyes. These rare and powerful magical items allow users to view far away places and glimpse scenes from the distant past. Creating such an artifact calls for very powerful magic and a sizable quantity of raw meteoritic iron. Few spellcasters have ever mastered the necessary enchantments. When completed successfully, the iron assumes the form of an orb or an eye.  \nThe Dark Eye uses a unique, time-tested game system refined over decades of continuous play. This newest edition\u2019s designers honed the feedback of thousands of players into the most balanced and playable version of The Dark Eye yet! Try it out for yourself! Click below to get the Quick Start Rules right away!\nThis edition of The Dark Eye incorporates module rules, as well, where general rules can be set aside for more in-depth rules when warranted by the situation. These focused rules offer more realistic options when such detail is wanted, but need not encumber the game when they are not.\nThe game system lets your group play any game style they prefer, be it a fun, quick dungeon crawl or a more elaborate storytelling session, or they can play TDE as an immersive simulation game.

For the love of the gods, click me!\nLost? Wondering what you get with the pledge levels? Get to update #11 right now!\nQuestions? Make sure to check the project FAQ!\nPlay Harry Dresden and his friends as they take on the cases from the bestselling Dresden Files novels in the ultimate what-if scenario\u2014what if Harry was on the scene with allies who weren\u2019t there in the original story?\nBox art by fiction series cover artist Chris McGrath. And no hat! (Except that Evil one in the lower right.)\nWhat\u2019s This Game? \nThe Dresden Files Cooperative Card Game (or DFCO) is a game where the players work together to solve cases from the bestselling Dresden Files novels in the ultimate what-if scenario! Play Harry, Murphy, Susan, Michael, and the Alphas in the first five novels, or take on Side Jobs in a random scenario generator based on the short story collection of the same name. \nPlay your hand, clear the board, and beat the odds in the final showdown at the end of the book. Use teamwork, strategy, and a wee bit of luck to win the day. \nAnd yes, expansions are a possibility\u2014but we need to get this thing funded before we can talk about those!\nWhat\u2019s Cool About It? \nDFCO is hotter than pyrofuego and cooler than Mab in a snit. Who doesn\u2019t want to be Harry\u2026 or Karrin\u2026Michael\u2026we could go on, but you get the picture. The game has plenty of in-jokes and references for Dresden fans (like the unreliable range of the Blue Beetle), but it\u2019s accessible to people who haven\u2019t read the books. \nThis is a tightly tuned, strategic, cooperative game that feels intense, vital, and a little bit risky (thanks to dice and other factors) throughout play. At 30 minutes per session, gameplay is fast-paced and down to the wire. You can learn how to play further down this page (cleverly hidden under the \"HOW TO PLAY\" header).\nAnd all of this awesomeness is set off by the original novel covers and gorgeous box art by Chris McGrath, plus dynamic card art by Tyler Walpole. It's a feast for any Dresden fan, and a visual treat for folks new to the series!\nWhat Even Is Kickstarter?\nKickstarter is a crowdfunding platform. A company (that's us here at Evil Hat) puts up a project (that's the game) and asks fans (that's you) to contribute money towards making the project happen. You reserve a copy of the game and will get it before anyone else does\u2014and along the way, you help us make sure it's the best possible Dresden Files game it can be!\nWhy Kickstarter? \nIf we\u2019re going to do a Dresden game, we\u2019re going to do it right. We\u2019ve already poured a lot of resources into this game, and Kickstarter will allow us to go bigger and better than we could by going straight to retail. Here, we\u2019ll cover manufacturing costs, help set print runs based on demand, boost our already hefty art budget, bring stretch goals to light, and more. \nSo much stuff! Right-click and \"open image in new tab\" to embiggen!\nWhat's inside, once again, in text form:\n1 game board\nFive 12-card player decks (Harry, Susan, Murphy, Michael, and Billy & Georgia; 60 total cards)\nFive 13-card book decks (Storm Front, Fool Moon, Grave Peril, Summer Knight, Death Masks; 65 total cards) \nOne 30-card Side Jobs random scenario deck \n13 Fate point counters (2mm chipboard, i.e., thick sturdy board game quality cardboard tokens)\n24 one-Clue counters  (2mm chipboard)\n24 one-Hit counters  (2mm chipboard)\n8 five-Clue counters  (2mm chipboard)\n8 five-Hit counters  (2mm chipboard)\n8 Fate Dice (all translucent acrylic, 4 of them Purple/Blue and 4 of them Orange, like Bob's eyelights)\n1 rule book (16 pages)\nDividers, foam blocks, and card tray insert to organize your components and decks.\nCard Size: The cards are 63mm x 88mm, aka \"standard European poker card sized\", similar to but not exactly the American poker card size of 2.5in x 3.5in.\nIn this game, players take on the role of Harry Dresden and his allies, investigating cases and taking on foes from the books. To accomplish this, you'll share a common pool of action points (called Fate points), and each player must choose between taking an action or generating Fate points each turn. Solve more cases than there are foes left standing to win!\nYou can download the rules right now:\nhttp://evilhat.com/dfcoks/DFCO-Rulebook-Draft-for-KS-Backers.pdf\nOr, take just 12 minutes to learn the game with this video:\n(Video not displaying for you? Head on over to YouTube!) \nIn short, each player plays a character from the novels (one of them is always Harry), taking on a shuffled scenario deck based on one of the books in the series. Using a combination of cards, dice, and teamwork, players attack foes, investigate cases, take advantages, and overcome obstacles to make sure they have the best possible odds for a win in the final showdown at the end of the book! Like any good cooperative game, it's hard to win (no fun if there's no challenge!), but always rewarding to play, and scales smoothly from one to five players.\nMore Videos\nThe Dice Tower interviews game designer Eric B. Vogel at the GAMA Trade Show (video link):\nThere's also an overview of the game with designer Eric Vogel and BoardGameGeek's W. Eric Martin (video link):\nSome friends of Evil Hat play a 4-player game using the prototype. Entire session of play, right here!\nAnd here's our project manager Sean Nittner playing a solitaire game using the 1-player variant rules.\nIn-Person Demos\nPublisher Fred Hicks lives in Maryland and occasionally does demos at local stores & elsewhere. Designer Eric Vogel lives in northern California and frequents Endgame Oakland's board game nights. Keep an eye out and you may get a chance to demo! One good place to keep an eye out is this thread on Board Game Geek (and the News section for the game in general, there): https://boardgamegeek.com/article/22374749 \nStretch goals? You betcha.\nTHE CIRCLE OF ESSENTIALS\n$48,000: FUND THE GAME (DONE!)\nOur initial funding goal! It's our magic number\u2014our summoning spell for the game. And like any spell, we had to put some real concentration and expertise into it. We looked at our projected costs for manufacture of 5000 copies of the game, plus royalty payments to Jim Butcher & Eric Vogel, and arrived at this total. (Since we're billing our shipping through Backerkit after the campaign closes, we're able to keep this magic number lower than it would be otherwise, reducing our initial funding goal by over 25%!)\n$64,000: BOOST OUR ART BUDGET (DONE!)\nWe've invested our own money (over $20k) in this project before coming to Kickstarter; we're not looking to have you cover those costs. But we still have a ways to go before we can really have the size of art budget this game needs to truly shine. While we've created all the art we need for the player hero decks, the book decks currently rely heavily on reuse. When we fund this stretch goal, we\u2019ll have the art budget we need to create unique Foe, Case, Advantage, and Obstacle illustrations for each book deck, rather than using the same four images for all of our book decks. That's 20 more pieces of art for the game! Plus, a funded goal means we can pay Tyler Walpole to make more art for the game!\n$72,000: ART BOOST II: FOE-LECTRIC BOOGALOO (DONE!)\nOnce we hit our first art booster stretch, it's just a short trip to the one we really want to hit: using a common background image to make sure we don't add months to the delivery date (and keep the costs managed), we'll create a unique piece of monster/villain art for every Foe card in the game (aside from the Side Jobs, which is more generic anyway due to its randomized nature) \u2014 expanding our prior stretch goal from 20 to 36 more pieces of art (including a total of 21 individual foe illustrations in the core game).\n$102,000: EXPANSION 1: FAN FAVORITES (DONE!)\nOur first expansion stretch goal is titled Fan Favorites. Add just $10 to your shipping pledge to get a copy of this expansion, which includes player decks for Thomas Raith and Waldo Butters, and book decks for Blood Rites and Dead Beat. Get the details over at Update #2!\n$132,000: EXPANSION 2: HELPING HANDS (DONE!)\nOur second expansion stretch goal is titled Helping Hands. You can add just $10 to your shipping pledge to get a copy of this expansion, which includes player decks for Sanya and Molly Carpenter, and book decks for Proven Guilty and White Night. Get the details over at Update #3!\n$162,000: EXPANSION 3: WARDENS ATTACK (DONE!)\nOur third and final expansion stretch goal, completing the circle of essentials, is titled Wardens Attack. Once funded, you can add just $10 to your pledge to get a copy of this expansion, which includes player decks for Carlos Ramirez and Anastasia Luccio, and book decks for Small Favor and Turn Coat. Get the details at yon Update #4!\nTHE CIRCLE OF GRATITUDE\nThis one's all about reducing shipping costs for everyone, and picking up a few digital and physical free exclusive benefits along the way!\nThere are ten stars to achieve in all, spaced roughly $20k or so apart from each other. Each star will reduce the shipping rate for everyone by $1, so when we hit the tenth star domestic shipping will be free, and international shipping will be reduced by a full $10.\nThere are also four stones. Each stone contains an extra special exclusive benefit, some digital, some physical. We'll detail all of the benefits below, though some may not yet be revealed.\nAll digital rewards unlocked will be included in the download folder available through Update #1.\n$180,000 \u2605 (DONE)\nSTONE: ACHIEVEMENTS CHECKLIST\nDesigner Eric Vogel has gone through the game's design and come up with a series of achievements for you to strive for in your gameplay as an added challenge. Now it's not just about winning; it's about hitting those goals, too. Use it to track how you're doing taking on some of the trickiest and most thematic elements of gameplay. We'll include this in the downloads folder when you unlock the first star in the circle.\n$201,000 \u2605\u2605(DONE)\nBox and game board art in full resolution will be added to the digital downloads folder.\n$222,000 \u2605\u2605\u2605 (DONE)\nCurrent book challenge art in full resolution will be added to the digital downloads folder.\n$243,000 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (DONE)\nSTONE: VARY HARRY, VERILY - EXCLUSIVE VARIANT CARDS\nHarry's deck must be played every game, but it doesn't have to be the same every time! When this goal funds, we'll include two variant cards for Harry's deck with every backer copy of the game. These cards will replace one of his Overcome and one of his Take Advantage cards. Listen to the Whispers of Lasciel to optimize your hand, at a cost. Mock the vampires with a Cheesy Costume to Take a crucial Advantage while they're reeling from the insult. PLUS, Harry's card art in full resolution will be added to the digital downloads folder. (Details)\n$264,000 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (DONE)\nSTONE: INFECT SUSAN'S DECK - EXCLUSIVE VARIANT CARDS\nInfect Susan's deck with three variant Attack cards, shipping with every backer copy of the core game! These cards will replace her current Attack cards whenever you're looking to have her \"vamp out.\" They'll make her attacks more potent, but more risky\u2014after all, when she really goes full black-eyed-and-toothy, someone's gotta be there to help her calm down. Design and playtesting is underway, and we'll get into the details once we've validated the gameplay mechanic, but rest assured, it'll have \"teeth\". In addition, Susan's card art in full resolution will be added to the digital downloads folder.\n$285,000 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2605 (DONE)\nKarrin's card art in full resolution will be added to the digital downloads folder.\n$315,000 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2605\u2605 (DONE)\nSTONE: World's Fieriest - A Multiversal Cross-Over!\nA new playable hero deck based on the Sentinels of the Multiverse hero Ra, God of the Sun (in a more urban fantasy oriented incarnation) will be sent with every backer copy of the game. The deck will be designed by Fred Hicks with Eric Vogel's supervision, featuring Sentinels-style art by Brian \"d20 Monkey\" Patterson.

We'll share this exclusive look at chapter 1 with you right after the campaign concludes in mid-May. (Details)\nSix audio tracks!\nCurious about the backer count based stretches?

Uh... Molly/Carlos! Harry/Murphy! Nicodem\u2014wha? \nOh, the OTHER kind of shipping. Got it. \nHere's what's true in all circumstances: \nWe're shipping a hefty little game box here, likely to weigh in a bit over 3 pounds (~1.5kg). We're pricing it at $39.99, but we've dropped off the $0.99 for this campaign. Plus, Kickstarter doesn't do pennies.\nWe're not billing the shipping during the KS campaign. This lets us focus on making sure the actual game and follow-on goals gets funded, rather than funding a whole bunch of shipping and only part of an actual game. (So please don't pre-increase your pledge for shipping. Defeats the point!)\nWe'll definitely offer add-ons in BackerKit from our existing catalog, and there may be cause for you to add more things into your shipping box before this campaign is done.\nThere are pieces-parts to all this, so let's get into the details.\nDomestic Shipping Costs\nFor our domestic shipping we were going to be charging a flat $10 fee, but since we hit that $375k goal, domestic shipping in the USA is free. Actual shipping costs will fluctuate for us, but once you add in packing material and handling fees from our shipping partner, we're giving everyone a small, if variable, discount on the shipping. Enjoy!\nInternational Shipping Costs\nShipping internationally is nasty. The building is on fire, and it's not our fault! But never fear: we work with Harry, and Harry knows fire. \nIf you're interested in the obstacles we're overcoming to make this all work, read on. \nIf you just want to learn what the current rate is for your location, skip the paragraphs below and jump to the \"International Shipping Rates - Current Status\" section below this one.\nOur obstacles: \nWe've got a game here that's somewhere between 3 and 4 pounds in weight. If you ask the US Post Office what it costs to ship a 3-4 pound game abroad, the answer is around $50. And that's in April 2016! By the time this game ships next year, it's entirely possible\u2014even likely\u2014that the rates will be higher.\n(We know. We know! It's nuts. But that's what the baseline looks like. Have a look at BackerKit's shipping cost calculator to get familiar with this\u2014skip street address, but put in Fort Wayne, IN, 46809 for the rest, that's where we usually ship from. Pick parcel as the type, and give 3 pound 1 ounce as the package weight. You'll find that's the same as 4 pounds, as far as international rates go, and... well, yeah. Ugly.)\nNaturally when faced with costs that steep, we have to look for other options. We'll continue to investigate and refine our shipping strategy over the course of the campaign, from now until we're ready to launch the BackerKit, to make sure we offer the best rate we can find that will still ensure a high success rate in terms of games arriving in good shape and good time. :)\nSee further below to get a read on what our current rates look like! These may improve, or they might hold steady; we won't let them get worse on you, so if you're up for paying the rate indicated, there's no \"gotcha\" coming later on. \nOr, you could wait: Assuming we hit our initial funding goal, we\u2019ll print the game in sufficient quantities for gamestore distribution, and that includes overseas distribution where possible. You may fare better simply backing at the PARANET PREVIEWER level and waiting until the game's release. We hope you'll back us in some capacity, of course!\nInternational Shipping Rates - Current Status\nLAST UPDATED: 14 April 2016.\nIn all cases: If you add more games into your shipment, it will increase the shipping fee stated below by $10 per additional game (less in some lighter-weight cases). \nFor countries in the EU, we'll be shipping from within the EU (via UK-based shipping partner GamesQuest) so that should dodge some of the usual concerns about VAT and customs fees. We're taking care of importing the games to GamesQuest specifically to make things as EU-friendly as we can.\nCanada: [Updated May 18th] We'll ship to Canada by partnering with Starlit Citadel. Our charge will be $5 (was $15 before the $375k goal's discount) to ship the game to Canada \u2014 might mean we'll eat a few dollars, but that's on us to reduce. :)\nUK: Right now our best general international option for shipping is with UK-based GamesQuest, so we should be able to give a very favorable rate within the UK. Right now we're pricing this at a $5 shipping fee (was $15 before the $375k goal's discount) based on current GBP to USD conversion rates, 2kg+ shipments in the UK, and with a modest buffer for other assorted fees getting the games to the UK in the first place. If we can knock that down a few dollars we will, but we also want to make sure we're not accidentally significantly undercharging. :)\nElsewhere: There's some fluctuation here. If things settle down and even out we may be able to reduce these rates, but again, we need to make sure we're not giving away the farm.\nGreece, Malta, and Cyprus appear to have the steepest cost within the EU. Right now we're pricing this at $20 (formerly $30 before stretch discount) to ship.\nOther countries in the EU have a lower average cost. We're pricing this at $10 (formerly $20 before stretch discount) to ship, based on that average, current currency conversion rates, and other factors.\nAll other international destinations including non-EU countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Central & South America, Japan, and elsewhere, will have a $20 (formerly $30 before stretch discount) shipping fee.\nAgain, please do not add your shipping fee to your pledge at this time. We will bill you for that a few months later, after the campaign is over. Since these numbers are not fixed in place yet, it doesn't make sense to do that for you... and because shipping fees added to the campaign during its funding phase would undermine the actual funding goals of the campaign, it doesn't make sense for us either. :)\nBackerKit\nWe will use BackerKit, a service separate from Kickstarter that helps Kickstarter campaigns gather data, take additional payments, and run a tight-as-possible shipping operation. It'll also let us offer you the option to add more items to your order after the campaign is over, in case you missed anything!\nWe'll first spin this up a few weeks AFTER this Kickstarter campaign concludes (giving time for Kickstarter's own payment processing to settle out). You'll be emailed a \"survey\" link that will also give you the opportunity to make some updates to your pledge, purchase add-on items, and\u2014importantly, for this campaign\u2014pay for shipping. We will give you a heads-up before we send the survey so that you can watch for it. More details on that when the time is right.\nFor our funding to work properly here, it's important that you DON'T pay for your shipping in advance. Our funding targets are based on our costs WITHOUT shipping included. We can't spend shipping money on producing the game, and vice versa. :) So please wait until the time is right!\nAdd-Ons That Will Be Available Through BackerKit\nWe'll be offering add-ons for sure. Extra copies of the game, other funded items if we end up stretching for them, and a selection of items from our existing catalog.\nDomestic backers will continue to pay nothing (formerly $10 before stretch discount) to ship their packages regardless of the items ordered.\nInternational backers should expect an additional weight charge of $10 per non-lightweight add-on item included in your shipment. See the international shipping section for details.\nAt present the list is as follows.\nDresden Files Cooperative Card Game (DFCO): $39 each.\nDFCO Expansion: Fan Favorites (Thomas & Butters): $10 each.\nDFCO Expansion: Helping Hands (Molly & Sanya): $10 each.\nDFCO Expansion: Wardens Attack (Carlos & Luccio): $10 each.\nDresden Files Roleplaying Game: Your Story: $50.\nDresden Files Roleplaying Game: Our World: $40.\nDresden Files Roleplaying Game: Paranet Papers: $50.\nFate Dice: Winter Knight set: $18\nAny other of our Fate Dice sets: $15\nRace to Adventure board game: $30.\nRace to Adventure: Dinocalypse expansion pack: $10.\nZeppelin Attack card game: $20.\nZeppelin Attack: Doomsday Weapons expansion: $10.\nDon't Turn Your Back board game: $40. \nIf there's an item from our catalog that's missing from the above list that you know you're going to want, let us know! We can add more items from our catalog, for sure.\nIf you know you want some of these add-ons, please feel free to add that amount to your pledge now, to help us hit our goals. (Because these games are already paid for in terms of their production, we can claim the majority of add-on revenue for the actual funding of this project.)

We've produced multiple printed roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats, as well as three board games and multiple sets of dice over the past 9+ years. We also have deep experience running Kickstarter campaigns; this one is our ninth. When we say we'll deliver a game and on time, we mean it.\n\nEvil Hat's experience puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that arise. As with any project, experience tells us a few problems and bugaboos WILL arise.\n\nHere's what we anticipate as potential problems.\n\nSTRETCH GOALS: Our first stretch goal affects the timeline for delivery, because funding it means we'll need more time to execute on all of the art. That said, we've already added that time into the estimated delivery date for the reward tiers. If that first stretch doesn't fund, we'll be able to deliver sooner\u2014but we're hoping it does. :)\n\nDISTANCE: The game will be manufactured in China. Physical manufacture can always introduce complications, particularly when it comes time to ship items in bulk. The slow boat from China is a real thing! That said, we've manufactured multiple things with our chosen manufacturer, Grand Prix International, before, and we believe we have a solid handle on the time impacts here.\n\nSCHEDULE: There's always a chance we'll be asking the printer to print the game right when their schedule gets busy\u2014or we could end up running into Chinese New Year. While this may bump our timeframe, it will likely only be by a few weeks. If we've done our math right, there should be padding to absorb that.\n\nMANUFACTURE: Problems can happen during the manufacturing process. Prototypes and proofs don't turn out like you'd expect. Materials and stock thought to be readily available might take longer to procure. File revisions might require a second round of prototyping. These issues, too, can create delays.\n\nSHIPPING: Packages get lost. We'll work with you to send replacements. Our shipper may take longer than expected. We won't put the products on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFINANCES: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and Fate Core, Evil Hat is\u2014for the game industry\u2014a perhaps atypically solvent game company. We've already spent tens of thousands to get this game to this point, and our bank account continues to look healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf YOU can think of a risk or challenge we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.\n\nWe intend to impress you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Expansions 4 & 5 Available Soon / Now!", "update_content": "OMG!\nOMG?\nOMG!!!\n...?"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Digitally Preview Expansion 4 At PAX East, Oh And Also There Are More Expansions Coming, Did I Forget To Mention?", "update_content": "Hi all!

However, I've had a hard time finding a book that will allow me to share my favorite hobby with my favorite person. \nSo after looking, I decided that if I couldn't FIND a book that I wanted to read to my little Rogue, I would go out and MAKE one instead.

With the support of our passionate fanbase, we bring you a feature-length third season!\nAs the story continues, the search for an oracle brings our heroes to a dwarven mining town in which they are pursued by an assassin, orcs, Glorion (their former fighter), and Wren, a recently-fired bardic historian.\nWHO ARE WE?\nWe are the team at Zombie Orpheus Entertainment. Since our inception in 2010, we've released award-winning shows and films like The Gamers: Hands of Fate, Humans & Households, Natural 1, Dark Dungeons, and most recently, The Gamers: The Series. And of course, two seasons of JourneyQuest!\nWith thousands of happy backers from prior Kickstarter campaigns, we have a track record of quality, project completion, and kick-ass storytelling.\nPlus, as with our other shows, JourneyQuest Season Three will be released under a Creative Commons license, allowing fans everywhere to remix, share, and play in the world of the show.\nOUR PRODUCTION TEAM\nExecutive Producer/Writer: Matt Vancil (The Gamers Series, JourneyQuest)\nProducers: Rennie Araucto (Hands of Fate) and Tony Becerra (JourneyQuest)\nDirector: Christian Doyle (Dorkness Rising, JourneyQuest)\nDirector of Photography: Jeremy Mackie (JourneyQuest, Hands of Fate)\nWHEN WILL IT SHOOT?\nThanks to the generous support of our core fans, writers Matt Vancil and Kate Marshall have already completed the script, which means that we can begin production in April 2016. The cast and crew are scheduled, locations are getting locked down, and we're ready to begin ramping up production as soon as this campaign succeeds.\nIn order to continue the story, this campaign needs to raise a minimum of $420,000 before February 19th. If we reach that threshold, our backers will be charged and we'll get to make the show. If we do not, no money will exchange hands and the show will not be made.\nFirst and foremost, we have to build an epic fantasy world: locations, sets, costumes, props, makeup, prosthetics, set dressing. This season includes a dwarven mining town and tavern, the first appearance by ogres in the series, a secret mountain hideaway, and so much more.\nWe also want to pay our cast and crew a living wage. Film production is their career and we want to make sure their labor is compensated fairly.\nThis production budget is the minimum that we need to do right by the story, the cast and crew, and the fans. With $0.77 out of every dollar going directly in the show and $0.12 going directly to creating and fulfilling the cool rewards that we've put together for you, this is going to be one of our most cost-effective productions yet.\nTELL ME MORE ABOUT THESE REWARDS\nEDIT: Read all about the new rewards right here.\nEvery reward is designed with our historical attention to quality and detail.\nFirst, every backer will receive access to our Backerkit store, where you'll be able to find add-ons and exclusives after the campaign, including DVDs of prior seasons, digital downloads, and (if unlocked) exciting new merch at a deep discount.\nOur digital downloads are always DRM-free, which means you can play, edit, and share them anywhere. And we'll deliver them in the highest-possible quality. In addition to the download of the show itself, we'll also include a PDF of the Nethadric's Pranks Adventure Path, a ten-part, 154 page JourneyQuest tabletop adventure module compatible with Pathfinder and Savage Worlds.\nWe've also heard fan feedback and are including our collectible embroidered patches with every physical order: no need to wait for the stretch goal on this campaign!\nAt $100 and up, every backer will get to work directly with series creator Matt Vancil to coin a new Orcish word. Your contribution will become an official part of the orcish language and we'll commemorate it with an exclusive etched metal card (3.5 X 2 inch) that includes your name, your backer number, your word, and its definition.\nAt $250, you'll attend our Season Three wrap party for a night with the cast and crew. We'll have a bag of unique memorabilia for you, photo opportunities, food, games, and a first look at raw footage from the set. And an exclusive Perf miniature. You're responsible for your own transportation to Seattle and lodging, so plan ahead on this one!\nAt $500, you receive a much-coveted Red Card, which allows you to flag bad puns, off-color remarks, or other violations by our cast and crew, both from set and in-person at conventions. We'll send that person to time out, sub in somebody new, and film and upload the results for you. And now you can bring your Red Card with you, with a dual-color etched metal card (2.75 x 4.5 inch) that includes your name and backer number. Plus, we'll give you an exclusive cast & crew t-shirt.\nAt $1000 and above, we've designed our rewards to be an incredible experience: you'll spend time with us on set or at the game table, have opportunities to appear in the series, receive exclusive art, and have your name featured in the credits and on IMDB. Plus, by popular request, at $2500 and above we're also including full size Perf Hats. As always, you will be responsible for your own lodging and transportation, as well as to arrive on set on the day we schedule you. So check your April calendars now!\nWHAT IF I ALREADY CONTRIBUTED?\nIf you contributed to JourneyQuest via the \"Support JourneyQuest\" button at FanSupported.net between 2013 and 2015, that amount will make you eligible for the equivalent reward level in BackerKit.\nEXAMPLE 1:\nYou contributed $50 already and don't want to pledge any more. We will add you to BackerKit and you will automatically receive the DVD/BLURAY reward.\nEXAMPLE 2:\nYou contributed $35 already and want to pledge more. We will add you to BackerKit and you will automatically receive the DIGITAL DOWNLOAD reward. If you pledge for the TIP JAR level and add $15 to your pledge we will upgrade you to the $50 DVD/Bluray reward in BackerKit. Or if you pledge for the TIP JAR level and add $65 to your pledge we will upgrade you to the $100 ORCISH reward in BackerKit.\nIf you were a Phase II backer or are a current Patreon backer, we'll have details for you soon about special reward levels in BackerKit. Thanks for your patience!\nHOW DO I KNOW HOW MUCH I CONTRIBUTED?\nIf you contributed at www.fansupported.net, send us a message with your name and the email address you used. We will check our master spreadsheet and provide you with a statement.\nWHAT ABOUT ADD-ONS?\nAdd-ons will be available in Backerkit after the campaign ends. Please do not add any money to your pledge unless you A) are a prior contributor (as discussed directly above) or B) you are making an additional contribution to support the show.\n*****WHAT ABOUT SHIPPING?*****\nThis is really important, so read carefully:\nWe will charge for all shipping after the campaign in BackerKit. In order for your rewards to ship, you will need to pay shipping fees at that time. Do NOT add shipping fees to your pledge now.\nThe Short Version\u2014\nInternational Backers: expect to pay less than $9.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\nDomestic Backers: expect to pay less than $5.00 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\nThe Long Version, for people who like details\u2014\nInternational Backers: we are working with a third-party agency to fulfill your orders from warehouses in Europe, Canada, and Australia. This should help cut your typical U.S. shipping costs by a huge margin. However, please be aware that you may still be responsible for import duties, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. Duties will not be included in your shipping charge.\nDomestic Backers: we want to get the best-possible shipping and handling rate for you. Rather than over-estimating expenses now, we will charge actual rates when we are ready to ship.\nAll Backers: by handling shipping this way, we reduce unknown costs now, which means we know exactly how much we can put into the production budget, and then we can use economy of scale to make specific shipping orders with exact details.\nWhat will shipping cost, you ask? \n\nInternational orders will average $.99 handling per item, plus local shipping costs. This should still be much less than you have paid in the past. (For example, in 2013 our cost to ship a DVD internationally began at $8.59 and went up from there as the weight increased.) Unfortunately, we cannot calculate this more precisely until we know our volume and can negotiate for the best rate possible.\nDomestic orders will start at the current Media Mail rate for a five ounce parcel, plus a minimum of $.25 handling per item. You can estimate that shipping will begin around $3.99, plus more for larger or heavier packages that include more than a DVD and patch. Again, we'll use our volume to negotiate for the best-possible quote.\nMORE WAYS TO HELP\nThank you for supporting JourneyQuest Season Three! We're excited to make these new episodes, with your help and encouragement!\nBeyond pledging (and even a single dollar helps!) you can help spread the word in the following ways:\nShare this campaign and the video on social media. Include a statement about why you love JourneyQuest.\nShare the first two seasons. Encourage people to appreciate what we've already made possible and help them turn into fans.\nCreate and share your own fan art. We love seeing the amazing things people have made based on JourneyQuest!\nWrite your personal JourneyQuest story. Write a longer piece, or shoot a video, or tweet a haiku, about what JourneyQuest means to you. Share it somewhere like Medium.com. Make it compelling, interesting, and fun.\nInteract with the community. Post and respond to comments here, or on Facebook, or on YouTube. Get to know other fans. Help show the world that we're not just a group of fan funders, but friends and collaborators in building a positive, inclusive, and welcoming community.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery campaign has risks and challenges. This is a big, complex machine with the potential for all kinds of things to go wrong. A cast member could have to drop out and be replaced. A location could decide not to host us. With large film projects, these kinds of issues are inevitable.\n\nFurthermore, we could face delays, large expenses, or terrible storms on shoot days. On top of that there's fulfillment and delivery, which could also get delayed.\n\nBut there's also good news: we've overcome all of these challenges in the past. We shot through the hailstorm at Chambers Bay. We rewrote scenes to finish before losing the sun. And we've fulfilled our reward obligations through blood, tears, and long hours rolling thousands of signed posters into tubes.\n\nBasically, we're professionals and we know how to deliver on our promises, how to communicate when we're behind, and how to email backers dozens of times to track down correct shipping addresses. Yes, we have our share of screw ups\u2014and if you're one of the half-dozen backers from prior campaigns who never gave us shipping addresses, please help us help you receive your rewards!\u2014but we'll make every effort to make it right when we do mess up.\n\nIf you're new to the ZOE family, we encourage you to check in with people who have backed us in the past.

He has done extensive work for ICONS - including writing the history section for Stark City\nDr. Comics (aka Professor Jason Tondro) has this to say about Against the Axis: \"From subterranean Vril to the Man with Green Gloves, from Panzer mecha to Nazi supermen fueled by Asgardian beer, this book has everything you never knew you always needed to run a Golden Age campaign.\" \nChuck Rice of Mayfar Games says: \"Steve Perrin delivers a wonderful trip into the Golden Age of Comics. Along the way, he provides some WWII history, some comics history, and a lot of great villains for your heroes to fight and heroes for them to interact with or play. If you want to take a trip to WWII for the ICONS system, you should buy Against the Axis!\" \nSteve Kenson, ICONS creator says : \u201cIndustry veteran Steve Perrin delivers both classic Golden Age comic book style and a wealth of useful information for Game Masters interested in World War II-era adventures or an entire series. A must-have expansion for the Stark City setting!\" \nSean Patrick Fannon (Shaintar, Savage Rifts, Modern Gods) says: \"One thing my friend, Steve Perrin, knows better than almost anyone else in gaming is World War II era of the Golden Age, especially as it applies to superhero gaming. He is deservedly a legend in gaming circles that quite literally go back to the beginning of gaming, both as a GM and as a writer/designer. This book is an incredible treat - not just for Stark City fans, but for anyone wishing to run rollicking, two-fisted heroic adventures across the world of the Golden Age. One-part total expertise with the subject, one-part masterful prose for the tone, and one-part genuine love of the era you won't find in another source = the perfect book for this genre.\"\nThe ICONS version of the manuscript is complete and will be ready for download to backers on the day of launch.

A role-playing game campaign book that includes techniques and lessons from over 22 years of play. A tribute to one of the greatest creators in the RPG industry, created using Champions 6th Edition.\nThis is STRIKE FORCE.\n\"One of the most important overall supplements in the history of roleplaying games.\" -- Steven S. Long, Champions Villains\nIn 1988, Aaron Allston released Strike Force, a supplement detailing the first eight years of his superhero campaign. Noted for its extensive and highly-influential advice to gamemasters on how to run a long-term campaign, Strike Force was a landmark RPG publication.\nWe are now working to release an updated version of this classic book for the 21st Century. Aaron himself was designing this new edition of Strike Force before his untimely death, and we want to bring his work to life as a monument to Aaron's lasting influence on the RPG hobby. This  updated Strike Force sourcebook includes never-before-seen material detailing Aaron's multiversal superhero setting, compelling characters and villains, and updated and expanded advice from Superhero RPG veterans like Steve Kenson and Sean Patrick Fannon for how to run a campaign using \"the Strike Force method.\"\nWHY YOU NEED THIS BOOK: Strike Force was the first superhero campaign guide. It provided game masters with information on how to run a memorable and long-lasting campaign using all the great themes and tropes of comic book's best and most classic storylines. This new edition builds on that success, including advice from superhero RPG guru Steve Kenson! Aaron Allston's Strike Force is the resource to create unforgettable stories in your own superhero RPG campaign.\nPrincipal writing has been completed and a WIP draft will be immediately available to backers! Preliminary artwork has been received, and we're in the process of laying out the book. However, we'd really like to be able to upgrade the artwork that is going into the project. We've got top-tier artists lined up to work with us, and we want to compensate them to the best of our ability--and that is why we need your help to reach our funding goal.\nAs things currently stand, High Rock Press and Evil Beagle Games cannot afford to purchase enough artwork to bring this up to the quality that we think is necessary for a historic RPG setting of this caliber. With a successful crowd funding campaign, we can use our artistic contacts to make a world-class product--worthy of Aaron Allston's talent.The initial funding goal includes the costs for artwork, graphic design, promotional materials, and assorted miscellaneous fees.\nWe plan to produce the core book as a PDF and as a limited print run. Aaron Allston's Strike Force is a 200-page, 8.5\" x 11\" book and will feature attractive page design and great illustrations. The PDF document will make use of PDF layer functionality so that graphic elements can be turned off to print more economically.\nAaron Allston's Strike Force presents the characters and villains of the setting in the Hero System, but we also have packages available to present these heroes and enemies in other rulesets such as Mutants and Masterminds, ICONS, and Savage Worlds.\n\"It\u2019s a bit hard to explain to a modern audience, with the wealth of gaming knowledge and advice available today, precisely how important and vital Strike Force was when it came out in the dark days of 1988. I\u2019ve occasionally resorted to a musical metaphor: Brian Eno once said of the seminal album, The Velvet Underground & Nico, 'only thirty thousand people bought a copy of that album in its first five years. But, every one of those thirty thousand started their own band.'\u201d --Darren Watts, Galactic Champions\nLuster, daughter of the Overlord!\nWe're focused on producing the best possible gaming experience that we can for our backers. Backers should please note that the May delivery date is for the Aaron Allston's Strike Force PDF. Stretch goal books are certain to require additional time for completion. The time frame on those is going to vary based upon the number of stretch goals achieved, the number of creators involved, and sundry other factors.

Since then I've used his methods in several campaigns, from Star Hero to Dungeons and Dragons to Vampire: the Masquerade. They work. My players and I had fun.

It is an absolutely fantastic setting with an award-winning mechanic that I hope all our fans will give a shot. \nWith Folio #7, we will be blending the same OSR specs that our fans have grown accustomed to with the previous issues while also blending in some aspects of the Deadlands: Hell on Earth design.  I truly hope you'll have a much fun playing this adventure as my players did, and as always thanks for taking the time to check out our latest projects here on Kickstarter.\nAnd as always, Instead of making gaming anvils, I\u2019ve drilled the artistry of the game down, found the gems of a fast-paced adventure, and delivered it in such a way that both new and old gamers alike can enjoy and play without taxing their life schedules. In the end, isn\u2019t gaming about being fun for everyone, not just the players? The Folio\u2019s goal is to ensure that, and always give folks the very best quality \u2018lean and mean\u2019 adventures we can.\nMy Project: The Folio #7 is a single shrink-wrapped adventure module based on Savage Worlds: Deluxe mechanics and set in the Deadlands: Hell on Earth setting.  Each will be produced as an 8x11\u201d, removable cover [11x17\" once removed], adventure with mostly b/w interior artwork. There are two interior booklets, The Field Guide for setting specifics, and the Adventure which details the challenges facing the players. All told, the final size will be roughly 40 pages of content.\nWho\u2019s it for? ALL gamers, both new gamers and old gamers, as it is easily expandable or playable as is.The concept is to allow gamers a starting point for adventure that can be modified to their liking while providing excellent reference content and framework. Again, the base mechanic will be for Savage Worlds: Deluxe, but I\u2019ve designed it to be readily modified to any post-apocalyptic game.\nIncredible Cover Art by Keith Parkinson\nWhat\u2019s in it? All original content. It has been written by myself, with incredible cover art from TSR legend Keith Parkinson, and interior artwork by skilled black and white illustrators, Chet Minton, Michael Wilson, Josh Godin and Jeff Laubenstein. This Folio will contain a 3-D map, a Field Guide, a new Edge unique to the setting, GM\u2019s notes and guides, and a full adventure.\nAbout Deadlands:Deadlands is a Weird Western by Pinnacle Entertainment Group (www.peginc.com) where the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, known as the Reckoners, are trying to bring about a Hell on Earth so they can walk upon it in the flesh. They do this by nurturing fear to drench the earth in dark, supernatural energy that can sustain their physical manifestation.\nThat\u2019s the \u201cmeta level\u201d and the back story that ties all the various Deadlands games together\u2014the original Weird Western, the post-apocalyptic \u201cWasted\u201d West\u201d of Hell on Earth, Deadlands Noir, and Deadlands Lost Colony\u2014which takes place on the far fringes of space.\nBy defeating these terrors, the players are slowly\u2014bit by bit\u2014battling the Reckoners as well. Besides lightning-fast gunslingers, brave Indian warriors, and other standards in the Weird West, Deadlands also has a number of \u201carcane backgrounds,\u201d characters who have developed supernatural powers to fight the good fight. Hucksters make dark bargains for power, hurling playing cards charged with energy or casting other \u201chexes\u201d and spells. Mad scientists use a super fuel called \u201cghost rock\u201d to power infernal gizmos and weapons. Shamans channel power from nature spirits, and the blessed draw spiritual magic directly from the distant but always present powers of good.\nMost importantly, in the world of Deadlands, those with particularly strong wills can come back from the dead\u2014hence the name \"Harrowed.\". The price is high though\u2014the Harrowed crawl out of their graves by way of \u201cmanitous,\u201d evil spirits that vie for control of their host. Those Harrowed who maintain \u201cdominion\u201d over their demonic rider can quickly develop additional supernatural powers as well.\nWhen? As always, the bulk of The Folio #7 is complete, we only need to be funding so we can begin the full printing process. Delivery will be in March 2016.  WE ARE FAST!\nInterior Adventure Booklet Cover\nWhy Savage Worlds? Because it is AWESOME!  I've been a gamemaster in countless settings, with countless mechanics over the past 35 years, but Savage Worlds is just so damn easy to play.  It is easy for players, and more importantly it is easy on those running the game.  There is a reason it won the Gamer's Choice Award at Origins! Also, I'm a child of the Cold War, so post-apocalyptic settings always have intrigued me, and Deadlands: Hell on Earth is simply one of the best to play.\nI can\u2019t do this without you! We here at Art of the Genre need your help! We've trimmed out all excess costs and have a break even amount of $5,000 per Folio.This covers the printing, shipping, design, mapping, and the incredible story telling artwork we\u2019ll be using in these adventures. We have already devoted countless hours to seeing this product come together, but to make it \u2018real\u2019 and available to all players, we need your help. We believe in this dream, and we hope you do too!\nWhat happens if we pass the goal? If we pass the goal, it will allow us to begin production on new stretch additions for this particular adventure, including side 'mini-adventures' as well as setting seeds and more Field Guides to help flesh out this little piece of the Wasted West. Bottom line, our goal is to make a truly fantastic and age-defying piece of gaming history, each penny we receive goes toward that. This \u2018put everything into the product\u2019 mentality is why this Kickstarter is so thin on \u2018rewards\u2019, as physical SWAG steals from the overall content of the project, the product, and the backers, as well as slowing the process of getting the module into your hands!\nSTRETCH GOALS:\nFirst stretch goal mini-adventure achieved at $7500!\nGOOGLE HANGOUT Q/A #1 (Sorry for the weird echo...)\nBACKER LEVELS\n*TRADEMARK DISCLAIMER\n\"Savage Worlds & Deadlands: Hell on Earth are trademarks of Pinnacle Entertainment Group.\"\nWe have run and delivered 13 Kickstarter books through AotG.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a fantasy fiction imprint working exclusively on Kickstarter, Art of the Genre has produced and fulfilled seven novels using this platform as well as delivering The Folio #1 - #6 early to all backers. \n\nThis is a personal passion project for all the authors and artists involved, so we are as anxious as our backers to see these volumes become a reality as quickly as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Final 3 Hours for the mini-adventure we missed!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Project Complete!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "FOLIO #7 PHYSICAL SHIPPING!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "ALL DIGITAL COMPLETE!!!!", "update_content": ""}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "251 backers pledged $6,002"}]}], "comment_no": 23, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/563681582/the-folio-7-deadlands-edition", "project_name": "The Folio #7 Deadlands Edition"}}, {"backer": "Jodi and Clint Black", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "UPDATE: The Preview Document is live both on Google Docs and DrivethuRPG!\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B49tHg4PzaOiVGo2QXdNWlJUdFE/view?usp=sharing\nhttp://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/172496/Olympus-Inc-Preview\nWelcome to Olympus, Inc!\nAt this point you're probably saying to yourself, \"well the artwork is cool and I like Savage Worlds, but what's the setting all about?\"\nI'm glad you asked! Unlike most settings that have tackled the concept of demigods in the modern world, we are a bit different. Olympus, Inc answers the question of what would happen if the Olympians were kicked out of the heavens by Gaia and the Titans ruled instead. \nAfter she ejected them from the heavens, Gaia was also kind enough to use the Lethe River to cause all humans to forget that the Olympians existed. This nearly killed the Olympians, who began to fade away. However, the Olympians realized that they could draw from our obsession with the almighty dollar and gain power. Therefore, the Olympians traded their stone temples for towers of glass and steel. They formed the world's largest corporations. Now the Titans and Olympians fight a battle for control of the Heavens and Earth with each wielding incredible power. In the midst of all of this are normal humans who are asleep to everything that is around them.\nGaia has put a few rules in place to ensure that the Titans and Olympians don't tear each other apart as well as the rest of the inhabitants on Earth. This is known as the Nemesis Effect. The Nemesis Effect prohibits the use of visible supernatural abilities in front of sleepers (normal mortals). It also prohibits mythical creatures from appearing in front of a sleeper in their true form. If anyone breaks the rules, the Goddess Nemesis punishes them. It can be anything from being wracked with intense pain to death. It really depends on the severity of the infraction.\nTherefore, the Titans and Olympians fight a secret proxy war in a world identical to our own. However, most humans don't know that the gods exist and they certainly don't know that monsters and demigods with superhuman abilities roam the earth.\nThe setting has a strong cyberpunk feel with a bit of superpowers and espionage thrown in for good measure.\nSo who's writing this thing?\nOlympus, Inc has been a labor of love for two experienced writers and avid gamers: Gilbert Gallo and Charles White.\nGilbert is an amazing Italian author whose work has been featured in tabletop gaming magazines. He has also authored \"Mythos\", a setting guide for Savage Worlds published by Mystic Throne Entertainment.  In addition, Gilbert wrote supplements in support of this line as well as other great stuff!\nCharles White is an American author whose work has been featured in a couple of different gaming magazines. He is the author of \"Ultimate Knights Templar Guide\". In addition, he has authored a few modules and is co-founder of the Ennie-Nominated publishing company that is behind this product, Fabled Environments.\nSo, what's in the book?\nIn this book, we present the history of how things came to pass and where we are now. We detail character creation for decedents of 6 gods from the Olympian Pantheon: Zeus, Hermes, Ares, Aphrodite, Apollo and Dionysus.  We also provide a list of powers for each line as well as details surrounding the corporation that each god created. In addition, we have also provided two demihuman options: Satyr and Minospawn. A Minospawn is basically a 6 foot tall Minotaur with the same bad attitude as the full size version. \nIf that isn't enough, we have created a ton of new edges, hindrances and weapons that are all designed to create the feel that is unique to Olympus, Inc. We have also included a plot point campaign as well as a random adventure generator that is sure to give you tons of ideas for your own game. \nOur hope is to flesh out the other gods, present more demihuman options, like cyclopes and centaurs, and offer additional powers for each divine line in future supplements. We really want Olympus, Inc to be a line and not just a single product!\nJust to be clear, this setting book requires both the Savage Worlds core rulebook as well as the Savage Worlds Super Powers Companion.\nOkay, that's nice, but what about stretch goals? \nI like where your head is at! We have those, too. We'll be sharing some specifics as we get closer to funding the book.\nI can tell you that the stretch goals are really cool! We reached out to some of the best authors in the Savage Worlds community and they agreed to help us out. Six amazing authors have agreed to create 2000-3000 word adventures in the world of Olympus, Inc. If we reach all six of these stretch goals, we'll put them all in a single .pdf and offer them to backers in print! \nStretch goal authors include: Sean Preston, John Dunn, Umberto Pignatelli, Sean Bircher and Curtis Lyon as well as the prolific Italian Author and Game Designer, Andrea Angiolino. We'll introduce you to all of these amazing authors as the Kickstarter progresses.\nLevels:\n$9000- 2000-3000 word adventure by Umberto Pignatelli AND 15 custom figure flats from Arion Games. These will be the archetypes presented in the book along with a few intelligent monsters.\n$9500--Fabled Environments Floorplan: Art Gallery/Museum \n$10000- 2000-3000 word adventure by John Dunn\n$10500- 2000-3000 word adventure by Sean Preston\n$11000- 2000-3000 word adventure by Sean Bircher\n$11500- 2000-3000 word adventure by Andrea Angiolino\n$12000- 2000-3000 word adventure by Curtis Lyon\n$12500-Compile all the adventures into a single document. Backers will have the option of purchasing the compilation in print as a add-on.\nWhy do you need the money? \n90% of the book is written, but high-quality artwork and product design isn't cheap. We want to use the money that we raise from this Kickstarter to commission more amazing artwork and create an incredible product. However, we can only do this with your support. The money that we raise will, among other things, allow this book to contain a ton of color art, like the two pieces created for the campaign.\nObtaining Hardcopies\nPLEASE NOTE: ALL print pledge tiers $45 and higher are only offered at Premium Print Quality. There is no additional charge beyond the tier cost to get the book at Premium Print Quality! \nDriveThruRPG will fulfill the print orders for this Kickstarter.  Whether softcover or hardcover, the book will be 8 1/2 \" x 11\" and come in around 150 pages. \nDriveThruRPG explains Premium Printing this way:\n\"The Premium color uses a thicker paper that can hold heavier ink saturation and thus the color pages look a little brighter and the contrast is much more powerful. Premium is more expensive to produce in part because of the heavier paper and there is more ink used in the process. Both B&W and standard color books are printed on 50-lb. standard white paper. Premium color books are printed on 70-lb. white paper.\"\nGot questions that we haven't answered? Feel free to contact us through facebook or kickstarter.

Only monsters remain to fight against the darkness. Witches rule the land, but their Grand Coven has been sundered. The remnants of their massive army include captured citizens of the conquered nations who fought as the Witches\u2019 shock troops.\nThese are the Accursed\u2014Witchmarks burned into their flesh and souls transformed these men and women into monstrous forms. Unable to return to their former lives, the Accursed wander the land, giving aid to those in need in an attempt to atone for past sins.\nLight has failed, darkness is ascendant. The Accursed are this world\u2019s only hope. They must embrace their curse or fight against it, using their powers to free their world from dark tyranny.\nIn 2013, Melior Via successfully ran a Kickstarter to fund the creation of the Accursed RPG setting for Savage Worlds. That project completed and fulfilled successfully and in a timely fashion. In the time since then, fans of the setting have asked us to produce more material. We've been working on that, but we'd like to accelerate our process. That's our motive for this crowdfunding campaign. Our goal is to produce additional materials for the Accursed Game World.\nOur primary focus is on creating a detailed World book. We already offer an ebook that details two of the world's nations (Sand and Stone, focusing on Hebron and Hyphrates). We'd like to produce more ebooks in that same style. Principal writing and editing for Fang and Frost is already complete. This is a game setting ebook that provides additional information about Valkenholm and Steppengrad, two of the major nations in the game world. A draft version of this material is immediately available to backers (see the first update).\nWe want to make sure that we can include top tier artwork in these materials. Beyond that, we'd also like to make similar eBooks, provided we receive enough community support. We're lucky to have top tier talent willing to work with us, and we want to be able to compensate them to the best of our ability. That's why we need funding.\nThe initial funding goal ($3,000.00) includes the costs for artwork, graphic design, writing, editing, and promotional work necessary to produce a single eBook.\nPlease note that these materials are in support of Accursed, which is an Official Savage Worlds Licensed Product. They require Accursed, the core Savage Worlds rules, and the Savage Worlds Horror Companion to play.\nReviews of Accursed:\n\"Amazing on every level and I cannot recommend it highly enough.\"\n\u2013Abstruse, Ain't it Cool News\n\"Melior Via made the game I've always wanted to play.\"\n-Tommy Brownell, Most Unread Blog on the Internet. Ever.\nWe're pretty sure that the community is willing to help us make at least one additional eBook for Accursed, but we hope that there might be more support than that. If the community is interested, we have plans for several additional products:\nUNLOCKED! Stretch Goal #1 - $6,000 \u2013 Science and Sea \u2013 We'll create another PDF focusing on Manreia and the Discordian Sea. Preliminary writing on this is nearing completion. If we achieve this goal, we will release a rough cut to backers when the draft is complete. This PDF will be given to all backers at the $10 level and up. It will be included in the book produced for backers at the Print Witchmarked ($25) level.\nUNLOCKED! Stretch Goal #2 - $8,000 \u2013 Bone and Barrow \u2013 We'll create another PDF focusing on Cairn Kainen and the Outlands. Preliminary writing on this is currently in progress. The final PDF will be distributed to all backers at the $10 level and up. It will be included in the book produced for backers at the Print Witchmarked ($25) level.\nThis stretch goal is a bigger deal than it seems. If we can achieve this, we will have funded the creation of PDFs featuring all six of Morden's major nations, plus the Outlands and the Discordian Sea. Using these, the new print book will be a complete atlas of Morden.\nUNLOCKED! Stretch Goal #3 - $9,000 - City Maps - Mikael Brodu will draft a set of maps for inclusion into the ebooks that offer a detailed look at the capitals of each of Morden's six nations, as well as a major location in the Discordian Sea and the Outlands. The featured locations are as follows:\nHebron \u2013 Parnath\nHyphrates \u2013 Ur-Xandria\nValkenholm \u2013 Kulidar\nSteppengrad \u2013 Aziev\nManreia \u2013 Palmyria\nCairn Kainen \u2013 Shieldhaven\nThe Discordian Sea \u2013 Port Sorrow\nThe Outlands \u2013 Clachan na Tannasg\nUNLOCKED! Stretch Goal #4 - $10,500 \u2013 Accursed Novella \u2013 Ross would like to see the fiction line for Accursed grow, and I think that's a more than worthy goal. If we can unlock this stretch goal, Ross will write a novella that takes place in Accursed. The ebook of  the novella will be provided (in .epub and .mobi formats) to all backers at the $10 level and up.\nStretch Goal #5 - $15,500 - Accursed Apocrypha - This falls into the category of things we said we wouldn't do, but requests keep coming up for it, so, we're putting it out there. Accursed Apocrypha is an ebook of alternative Witches and variant Witchbreeds. This ebook will be generously illustrated, with a picture of each variant Witchbreed as well as each additional Witch. We'll aim for it to be a 60 page book.\nWe'll include the ebook for free to all backers at the $10+ level, and we'll send everyone at the $25+ level a coupon code to purchase the print version at a discount. If we unlock this, the book will not be completed until late 2016.\nWitchmarked ($10)\nAt our base pledge level, backers receive immediate access to the working draft of Frost and Fang through Backers Only Update #1. When it is complete, backers receive a PDF copy of Frost and Fang. (Check Update #1!) Backers will also receive a PDF copy of Science and Sea, since that stretch goal has been unlocked.\nPrint Witchmarked ($25)\nAs Witchmarked, plus receive a softcover, print compilation of the World of Morden ebooks funded by this Kickstarter. The printed book also includes the content from the Sand and Stone eBook. Because we have met our first two stretch goals, this book will be roughly 120 pages.\nSee Add-ons below for options to upgrade the print version of the book to hardcover or premium paper.\nAccursed eBook Completist ($60)\nAs Witchmarked, plus you receive a PDF of every Accursed game ebook in Melior Via's library. That includes Accursed, the Player's Guide, Sand and Stone, Banshee of Loch Finnere, The Guns of Dagerov, Darkest Tides, Long Dead and Twice Slain, Absolution, Grove Point, Half-Light, Moon Valley, Fall of the Tower, Hatred's Snare, A Distant Dream, the GM Screen inserts, and the Double Poker Deck. (Retail value of more than $80!) Please note: This pledge level does not include any print products.\nPersonal Witchmarked ($250)\nAs Print Witchmarked, plus receive a piece of artwork dedicated to a character or bane you create in cooperation with the creative team. The artwork will be integrated into a custom 1-sheet. At this pledge level, the print copy of Worlds of Morden is automatically upgraded to Hardcover and Premium. Note that Melior Via retains copyright to the artwork, character, and 1-sheet.\nRent-a-Ross ($2000)\nAs Print Witchmarked, plus Ross Watson will travel to you to run a weekend of Accursed games for you and your friends in your home. Ross's airfare and hotel stay are included. You'll need to provide the place to play and the other members of the game group. At this pledge level, the print copy of Worlds of Morden is automatically upgraded to Hardcover and Premium.\nIf you would like additional items added to your pledge rewards, simply increase the value of your pledge by the amounts shown below. After the Kickstarter ends we will contact you to determine how you want to spend any extra amount pledged.\nFor example, if you had already selected the Witchmarked ($10) pledge level, but you also wanted a copy of Sand and Stone ($6), keep the $10 reward selected, but increase the value of your pledge to $16.

Books will be printed at the production facility that can most economically deliver them to the backer. (For example, Canadian backers will receive books printed in the UK, while US backers will receive books printed in the US.) DriveThruRPG will handle all printing and shipping, using addresses that Melior Via receives in a survey collected after the project funds.\nPledge levels that include physical rewards have the US shipping cost included for those rewards. Add on books also include US shipping. However, add-ons for non-US backers do require an additional shipping fee. If we don't have shipping rates set up for your country, please send a PM via Kickstarter messaging, and we'll get that addressed for you.\n\nMelior Via successfully ran and fulfilled a Kickstarter for Accursed in 2013 and one for The Thin Blue Line in 2015. We learned a great deal from those projects, and we are using the lessons learned in undertaking this one.\nRoss Watson is an award-winning game designer with more than 50 RPG books under his belt, many as Lead Developer for the Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay line. He was a core developer on the Dust Warfare and Shadowrun: Sprawl Gangers miniature game teams, and the lead writer for the Darksiders II console and PC game. He has written or contributed to books for 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire, and Malifaux: Through the Breach. Ross consults with companies on narrative, design, development, and IP management issues.\nJason Marker has been writing for the traditional games industry since 1999. In that time he\u2019s worked for Palladium Books, both as a freelancer and a full-time staff writer, Fantasy Flight Games, Wyrd Games, Melior Via, and Catalyst Game Labs. When not writing about spaceships or the vagaries of the games industry, Jason keeps house, raises his daughters, plays in a guerrilla brass band, shoots pictures, shoots guns, shoots bourbon, shoots his mouth off, rides motorcycles, and plays a hell of a lot of games.\nJohn Dunn's been active in the RPG community since the early '90s as an author for RPGA convention scenarios and later as the coordinator for the Shadowrun Missions ongoing campaign. In more recent years, his focus has shifted to work as a freelance game developer. He's worked with Fantasy Flight Games, Pinnacle Entertainment Group, Modiphius Games, Catalyst Game Labs, and Wyrd Games. He is also owner and lead developer for Melior Via, LLC, publisher of Accursed, The Thin Blue Line \u2013 A Detroit Police Story, and Hope Preparatory School.\nThe team members have designed role-playing games for many properties, including Star Wars, Shadowrun, Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay, Robotech, and Malifaux: Through the Breach. Collectively, we have decades of experience working in the hobby gaming industry and we\u2019re very excited about expanding the products for the Accursed game setting. All of us are bringing our combined creativity, experience, and passion to the project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge with getting any RPG completed is getting the actual work done. We have already completed the primary writing on the first two books. Using the resources of our core creatives, the writing should be completed in conjunction with playtesting shortly after the completion of this Kickstarter. The other requirement is the interior artwork for the remainder of the book. We have some of that in-hand, but we do need funding from this project to secure the remainder. Several artists have already given us verbal agreements, but we need funding before either side can commit to the contracts. Once those contracts are done, we expect the work to flow smoothly.\n\nIf either writers or artists encounter problems with deadlines, we have enough contacts (and resources from this Kickstarter) to reach out to other freelancers to finish the job. If something catastrophic were to happen to one of the core creatives, the other would be more than capable of wrapping the project.\n\nPrinting can be a challenge, for those seeking hard copies of our products. To overcome this challenge, we are working with a world class organization in DriveThruRPG. We have used them in the past to produce and distribute PDFs as well as print books and cards. We are confident that their expertise will be sufficient to produce great products once more. We know that we can obtain proofs from them in a timely fashion that will be up to the high expectations of our backers.

With some patience and creativity, it can be converted to other systems.\nKey Points of Interest\nPCs can be any of the six primary races (human, elf, dwarf, orc, gnome, half-folk) or hybrids of them.\nIf a PC dies, there is a chance she will be transformed into a playable ghost (spirit).\nBesides the general fighter, cleric, magic-user, and other, familiar character types, Retribution offers Edges and Hindrances to create specialized characters such as unjailers who work to free entities who have been bound to this plane unwillingly, necromancers who study mastery of the dead, exomancers who have the power to work with extraplaner beings, and others that add to the Retribution experience.\nNecromancy is more than just animating skeletons or raising the dead as zombies, covering also medium arts, binding spirits, and working with other aspects of death.\nExomancy is much like necromancy, but applies only to those who come from beyond the mortal realm. \nPlay Possibilities \nVenture across the sea from the original homelands to Agador to escape a troubled past; seek to restore your ancestral village, leading to any number of options; portray a group of ghost hunters who want to banish any who don\u2019t belong; assemble a group to search for relics of bygone days; work the trade routes, protecting merchants and finding adventure; be part of the burgeoning Agador Guard, who keep out pirates, or at least keep them under control; quest to release trapped spirits or try extra-planer entities who mean harm; or become part of the new political structure satisfying your own interest in power.\nRetribution Character Sheet\nRetribution Setting Summary\nThe Great Betrayal \u2013 the civil war of Agador \u2013 led to the sundering of the veil between the physical realm and many others. Play in a world where the planes of existence have leaked into Agador, introducing ghosts set upon retribution for their deaths, allowing entry of previously unknown entities, and upsetting the natural order of the land. \nMany are dead-set on wreaking havoc or have other mysterious agendas. However, not all are hostile. Some seek unjailers who can send them back to the planes from which the magical attacks and malicious intent pulled them. Others wish to explore what is here. There are those who are trapped by necromancy or exomancy. A few see themselves as new guardians of Agador. \nThis is a land of opportunity and peril. A place where the natural and supernatural collide. The Great Betrayal nearly destroyed all who inhabited it, but survivors and questors choose not to let it die. Join the ranks of descendants who are determined to restore order and bring renewed prominence to the island nation. Come to Agador to prove your strength and test your mettle. Break the cycle of Retribution.\nBackstory\nMore than a hundred years ago, elvish explorers discovered an undeveloped island. They set up camps and cataloged their discoveries. Word spread across the other lands. Intrigued, many sailed to new lives. For decades, the fledgling island nation grew in peace, with small settlements taking hold near the shores and in the wilds in between.\nSide by side, all manner of people worked the land: its fields, stones, and trees. Some sought more than they had. Whispered half-truths spread from small town to port city and all assemblies in between, sparking unrest. One by one, allies turned upon each other, seeing foes where friends had stood. \nFighting broke out. Families were divided. Civil war consumed the nation. Just as the violence reached its apex, some who\u2019d been searching for answers \u2013 suspecting Agador had been sucked into a manufactured crisis \u2013 found proof of their hypothesis. It was too late.\nEach side had ramped up all manner of fighting, engaging the deadliest of magical attacks and counterattacks that any had ever seen. Alas, in a fearsome display of power, the fighters of Agador did something none knew was possible and was not at all intended: they tore into the veil between the physical world and that of the dead. The recently departed flooded back into the mortal realm. The chaos did not stop there. The act reverberated across planes, allowing creatures beyond their imaginations to cross into their world. \nIn the span of just a few minutes, the civil war \u2013 The Great Betrayal \u2013 ended and a new, much more desperate one began. \nAnd Now\nIt\u2019s been 50 years since the war ended and Agador united to defend itself against those who don\u2019t belong. While many of the unearthly beings have been dispelled, banished, or otherwise stopped from occupying the physical world, the fabric holding the planes apart has never completely healed. \nSeveral leaders are attempting to rebuild Agador, returning it to the splendor and purpose it achieved before The Great Betrayal. They\u2019ve reached out to the faraway homelands inviting adventurers, merchants, and anyone else who will come in peace. They\u2019ve rallied descendants of the first settlers, as well, hoping to harness their ambition as heirs of lost settlements. It is up to those who accept the challenge to quell the ongoing quest for retribution while aiding in the reformation of the once-proud nation. \nDesigners\nRetribution is the product of Vickey A. and Robert (Bob) L. Beaver, longtime roleplayers and Obatron Productions co-owners.\nBob co-wrote Tunse'al Setting Guide and related products, has contributed to Savage Insider, and has playtested for various companies, including Savage Mojo and Greymalkin Designs. He GMs on a regular basis.\nVickey is the other writer on all Tunse'al products, the Editor-in-Chief for Savage Insider, co-writer on Caladon Falls (Savage Worlds, published by Savage Mojo), writer of \"Swords of Catthulhu\" (found in Worlds of Catthulhu), and writer of the Mimicling and Treant Sapling entries in Baby Bestiary, which sold out promptly after Wil Wheaton mentioned it at Gen Con 2015. \nShe has also edited, proofread, or playtested for Savage Mojo, Cumberland Games, and Greymalkin Designs. She GMs at conventions, stores, and special events, hosts RPG-related seminars, and is a G*M*S Magazine co-host for the RPG podcast.\nHow We'll Use Funding\nFunding pays writers, editors, layout designers, illustrators, and external vendors such as printers, Kickstarter, and USPS. Although shipping is listed separately, it counts toward the funding goal, so what you see raised includes that and any add-ons.\nMap of Agador, work in progress\nAdd-Ons\nTo allow for some customization of your perks and to prevent having even more reward tiers to read through, we've got some add-ons. More will be added if we hit certain stretch goals. If you see add-ons you want, simply increase your pledge by that amount. Additional shipping may be required, which we'll determine before the end of the Kickstarter so you know how much to adjust your pledge. Hopefully, we'll have an automated tool in place by then, but just in case, you should keep track of what you want so when the time comes, you'll know what you had in mind.

To minimize shipping headaches on our end, all shipping will be via flat rate post. Those outside the US are responsible for whatever customs charges are applicable upon receipt.\nStretch Goals\nWe have them! Do you want them? Alrighty! We'll at least give you some ideas. As the project gets underway, we'll add some snazzy graphics to relay them, but we'll start here. We have stretch goals for amounts of money raised, Legacy rewards being claimed, and social media buzz.\nMoney Raised - Unlocked goals result in add-ons available for purchase, more illustrations, additional pages, and more.\nLegacy Rewards- When enough Legacy rewards are claimed, characters created through the Legacy Playtest will be gathered into Retribution: Legacy, a compendium of characters for use as NPCs and PCs. The more that are claimed, the more that happens.\nSocial Media Buzz - Campaigns are fueled by word of mouth. The more people who see it, the better the chance it has of success. The more we see this campaign talked about in forums, shared via Facebook, tweeted about, and otherwise tagged, the more we will throw in goodies for all backers, regardless of pledge level. Privacy settings may prevent us from knowing all Facebook shares and posts, but links posted in Comments and tagging Obatron Productions can help! One-shots, adventure seeds, fiction, and even issues of Savage Insider can be unlocked here. Back the project and spread the word with the hashtag #RetributionRPG to help unlock our Social Media Buzz stretch goals.\nSpecial Thanks\nThanks to the many people who played Retribution games over the last two years! Your feedback helped us get to where we are.\nIt is with great appreciation we acknowledge Edward Douglas of Midnight Syndicate for allowing us the use of \"Dark Legacy\" from The Dead Matter: Cemetery Gates.

If something horrible should befall one or both co-owners, the project could fail to come to fruition. \n\nThe next biggest and much less tragic risk is delay. Sometimes, despite our most valiant efforts to the contrary, circumstances beyond our control disrupt our schedules.

These foul monsters boast superhuman strength and supernatural powers. The Rippers must use everything at their disposal to resist them. \nSome invest in the latest technology\u2014incredible devices of iron and steel powered either by steam or, more recently, by electricity. Others practice ancient magic or perform holy miracles. A rare few bravely (or foolishly) wield arcane biotechnology \u201cripped\u201d from the very creatures they hunt.\nWhatever the methods, all are united in their dedication to protect mankind from the monsters that stalk the night. The Rippers\u2019 struggle against evil rages on largely unknown to the wider world.\nRippers Then and Now\nPinnacle Entertainment Group first released Rippers in 2005, a setting book for the relatively new Savage Worlds game system. \nThe first Plot Point Campaign saw the Rippers take on their archnemesis of old, Jack the Ripper, along with his Cabal cohorts, Dracula, Frankenstein, Prometheus, and more. At the end of that campaign, the Cabal was crushed, its leaders dead, and the Rippers triumphant. It is not necessary for your players to have completed that campaign (though if they have, great!). \nWhen the Rippers start their adventures in Rippers Resurrected, the Cabal will be the hunted and chased; hounded and hiding in the dark places of the world. The Return of Evil Plot Point Campaign also sets the Rippers against a new enemy: a small cult bent on restoring to power an ancient evil.\nBooks  \nThe Rippers Resurrected Kickstarter project funds an unholy host of new products, starting with two core books: the Player's Guide and the Game Master's Handbook.

You can connect it to your computer via USB, to your iPad via Bluetooth, or to your Arduino via developer cables.\nOur mission from the start was to address the mismatch between the expressive capabilities of our hands and the restrictive interfaces of today\u2019s devices. We want to enable new ways of interaction with digital devices and allow Morph users to unleash new possibilities in the worlds of music, art, gaming (cue Buzz Lightyear), and beyond!\nBest of all, you can use the same device in each of these areas. People today have many hobbies and interests- isn't it time you have a device that literally \"Morphs\" with your activities?\nYou can use various Overlays, all which are automatically detected, for each supported use case. The Overlays are optional \"physical apps\" made of a thin, flexible layer that you can place over the device to provide a visual \"map\" and tactile feedback for each mode\u2019s unique functionality. Imagine having your art tablet, music production controller, QWERTY keyboard, piano, video game controller (and anything else your mind can fathom) all in one device. If you can imagine something so limitless without your brain imploding, you've imagined the Sensel Morph.\nUnlike your typical single-use input device, the Morph is an extremely versatile product. Here are some use cases that we\u2019ll be supporting out of the box:\nAs time passes we\u2019ll continue to add support for all of your favorite software. Don\u2019t forget to let us know if you\u2019d like the Morph to support a specific program.\nCheck out some video footage of people using the Morph! Watch Josh Ellingson digitally paint with real brushes, Adriano Clemente, the director of Dubspot Labs, create an original track, Ray Kampmeier control a robot arm, and Joshua Davis create responsive art!\nThe Sensel Morph comes to life through the use of various overlays - thin, magnetic, flexible, and fully customizable surfaces that turn the device into virtually any tool or instrument imaginable. As you may have already guessed, the name \u201cMorph\u201d came from the realization that each overlay allows the device to morph into a new physical, tactile interface. Using unique magnetic identification codes, the sensor automatically detects each overlay and makes switching modes completely seamless.\nWith each device that we ship, you\u2019ll be able to choose three overlays out of eight options including: (1) a QWERTY keyboard, (2) music production controller, (3) piano, (4) drum-pad, (5) art overlay, (6) gaming overlay, (7) the innovator\u2019s kit, and (8) one additional overlay which will be chosen by our Kickstarter backers via the Overlay Contest.\nWe\u2019re developing a simple web-based drag-and-drop interface that will go live when the first batch of devices ship. With this interface, you will be able to design your own overlay without having to do any coding. You will then be able to print them on paper (for use with the Innovators Overlay), or 3D print the overlays yourself. Pretty cool, huh?\nOne of the most exciting things about Sensel - maybe even more exciting than the Morph itself - is the community we plan to build. Users will not only be able to create new, custom interfaces for themselves using the simple drag-and-drop interface, but they will be able to easily share these interfaces with the entire community of Sensel Morph owners and talk to one another about what they\u2019re creating with the Morph.\nAfter developing early prototypes, we partnered with frog, a world-class design firm, to turn our early concepts into a device that\u2019s ready for consumers. We worked with frog to refine and test core use cases for the Morph. We ended up with a design that is both sleek and functional.\nThe size of the device is similar to an iPad, which was purposefully done to make the Morph and the overlays easily portable. We found that these dimensions are ideal for two-handed interactions with the device, as well as for many art and music applications. The size is also convenient if you want to use the Morph alongside a tablet.\nOne of our favorite things about the Morph is that you can combine multiple devices. Below is an example of how we extended our piano -- you can even put four Morphs together to create an instrument with 96 keys -- more than a grand piano!\nBeneath the smooth outer surface of the device are approximately 20,000 individual sensor elements at a spacing of 1.25mm (that\u2019s less than 1/16\u201d). We call them \u201csensels\u201d for short, hence the name of our company.\nUnlike other touch technologies, which can only sense conductive objects, each of the sensor elements in our device senses pressure with a high dynamic range. These sensors allow us to capture a high-resolution image of the pressure applied to the device. Highly tuned algorithms on the device take these pressure images and turn them into a list of touch locations, each with their own force and shape information. This touch location data is then used to enable all the applications we\u2019ve described above and is also accessible to developers through our API. Here is what the sensor sees when you interact with a finger, hand or paintbrush:\n\nYou may be asking yourself: How can Sensel possibly fit 20,000 individual sensors into a device this compact and why has this never been done before? The reason is that it required three major innovations and a whole lot of elbow grease to make this technology possible - innovations in materials, manufacturing, and electronics. Our team worked closely with a material scientist to custom-formulate a highly-tuned polymer layer which gives each individual sensor element the ability to sense force. This material enables the product to have high sensitivity and a high dynamic range. In other words, it can detect anything from a feather-light tap to a hard push and everything in between (with over 4,000 detectable voltage levels).\nNext, we created a new structure that allowed us to take advantage of advanced lithographic manufacturing processes (similar to how circuit-boards and semiconductors are built). In contrast, most force-sensing arrays available on the market today are screen printed (typically on a Mylar\u2122 film), and thus cannot achieve high resolution or consistency, in comparison to Sensel\u2019s process. This process allows us to create a very high resolution array of sensor elements on the same circuit board as the rest of our electronics, hence the 20,000 individual sensor elements.\n\nEvery sensor needs electronics to power it, read out signals and interpret those signals. The third major innovation is a new, patented electrical drive scheme and electrical circuitry that allows us to read this high-resolution sensor with commonly available electronic components, quickly and efficiently. This allows us to drive an exceptionally high-resolution sensor at high speed (>125 Hz), low latency (< 8 ms), and low power consumption at an affordable price point. We\u2019ve also thrown in some extras like an accelerometer, LEDs, and Bluetooth LE support (along with a rechargeable battery) for those of you who can\u2019t stand wires.\nWe also worked with expert mechanical engineers at Hive Design to design an aluminum housing for the Morph which is thin and lightweight, yet provides rigidity (necessary for when you\u2019re really jamming on your device). It also holds the magnets which are used for overlay attachment and looks beautiful alongside your other devices.\nWe've received questions from our backers about things like compatibility with various art software (such as Photoshop), what it's like to perform music on the morph (in terms of sensitivity and ability to pitch-bend), and about what kind of objects the Morph can pick up. Here are a couple of video responses we've put together to answer some of these questions:\nKickstarter is a place where we know we\u2019ll find people who are always on the lookout for the next big thing, and we think we just might have it. We're excited to see what you do with the Morph with the use-cases we've developed so far, but we're even more excited to see what you come up with on your own.

We use all standard manufacturing processes to make sure that production goes as smoothly as possible, and we\u2019ve already completed several builds of the device to fine-tune the design and manufacturing process.\n\nHowever, when building any hardware device, unexpected issues may pop up (manufacturing, sourcing, shipping, etc).

A scientist examining a strange artifact found on a distant planet that, unbeknownst to him, opens a mysterious gate to a nightmarish dimension when a button is pushed.\nThese are just a sampling of the myriad images which come to mind when we think of Hell. Codex Infernus: The Savage Guide to Hell, brings those images to life and shows you how to plug them into your games, regardless of what genre you love to play!\nThe goal of Codex Infernus is to produce a combination setting book and Toolkit. The fantasy campaign setting (Covenant) is written to highlight all of the new rules, magic items, and character concepts you'll find in this tome! While we think this is a killer setting in it's own right, Covenant is a model which gives you examples of how you can use everything in this book in your game!\n\nThe meat of the book, however, are the rules. They are modular so you can \"drag and drop\" what you wish into your own campaign, and leave the rest out!  Codex Infernus gives you everything you need to design a Hell that caters to your specific group, because the concepts and rules we introduce in this book transcend genre, encouraging you to explore new possibilities for your Savage Worlds game.\nBut let's get into specifics.\nIn this book you'll find:\nReady-to-play character archetypes for a variety of genres.\nNew Fantasy races\nNew Demonic races\nNew Edges and Arcane Backgrounds\nNew magic items and relics of power\nAn immersive Fantasy campaign setting\nGuidelines for using the book in a variety of genres\nRules for demonic pacts, demonic possession, and an optional corruption system\nRules for playing immortal characters!\nOh, didn't we mention demons?

Kickstarter has not yet found a way to separate the funds that actually go towards the money we need to raise, and the shipping costs needed to send out the finished product.\nThe result from this oversight, is an artificially inflated \u201ctotal\u201d amount of money raised. So with all that in mind, for this campaign we'll be billing for the shipping costs after the campaign is over, via the BackerKit pledge management service. This charge is in addition to whatever you pledge here. See below for our estimates of costs.\nEXPECTED SHIPPING COSTS (Based on estimated 3lb package) These estimates reflect the maximum we'll charge for shipping. We will not hit you with a surprise increase beyond these amounts; setting expectations here is key!\nIn the USA: +$6. No additional charge for additional items in the same shipment.\nCanada & Mexico: +$25. +$10 per additional copy beyond the first. (This is a few dollars lower than actual cost for an International Priority shipment, or right at the mark for First Class International if the package falls within the weight limits that allow that rate.)\nUK: +$15. +$10 per additional copy beyond the first.\nEurope: +$25. +$10 per additional copy beyond the first.\nAnywhere else in the world: +$30. +$10 per additional copy beyond the first. (This is a few dollars lower than the actual cost of International Priority Mail as quoted to us. Much depends on the actual shipping weight calculations, once we can make them.)\nFor international shipments, our shippers will do what they can to mark the customs forms in the most favorable, legal way, although, this is subject to human error and other constraints.\nWhile we will do our best to figure out ways to reduce shipping costs, there's no guarantee we'll manage it \u2014 so please include these shipping estimates in your budget!

Andrew Plotkin made a Werewolf adaptation in the 1990's which has since turned into the #1 party game.\nWerewolf is a game of deduction, lies and bluffing, which there are two teams: Villagers and Werewolves. The Villagers don\u2019t know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to remain hidden while they slowly eliminate the Villagers one at a time.\nThe game is incredibly simple, I've taught 5 year olds and 90 year olds (both of which you should not underestimate!).  Each player gets a token which shows their role, while one of the players acts as a moderator to keep the game running smoothly. Each day and night, the number of players gets smaller and smaller until either all the werewolves are voted out, giving the victory to the village team, or the werewolves equal (or exceed) the number of villagers, allowing the werewolf team to win.\nIt is very customizable and allows you to add different roles into the game to change it up, and because you are playing with people, no two games are ever the same!\nWhy Werewolf Tokens?\nI've been playing werewolf for 6 years and played many versions.  I'm a true aficionado, but one thing that I didn't like about other versions was quality and versatility.  Playing cards get damaged, wonky art and not easy to play with outside.  One day I used a wood-burning tool and made a set of chips.  We put them in a bag and took them camping.  They were a hit.  People asked me where to get a copy, and that's where it all started.\n We went through 10 iterations until we got what we like.  What's great is that this is a very simple game to learn, you can never truly master it and it's customizable with many different roles!\nNow you can play Werewolf Tokens (I play them at all these places)\nFamily get-togethers\nHolidays\nBirthday parties\nBBQs\nCamping\nComic conventions\nteam-building at work\nschool\nweekly game meetings\nanytime there's more than 5 people!\nAll American Made.  Local businesses used for production. No overseas manufacturers.  I'm making each set myself with love!\nStandard tokens\n I wanted to use solid pieces of wood, not plywood and at 1/4 inch.  We found that 1.5 inches was the perfect size, not to small, has good weight and you can put it in your pocket.  Each token is treated with Danish Oil that acts as a sealer and gives some water resistance.\n Premium tokens\n I wanted to make something special for those who wanted a higher quality token with a more refined look.  These tokens are stained and filled with wood filler that gives a higher contrast and semi-smooth feel.  Each token are treated with Danish Oil and Polyurethane sealer to give a satin finish. \nThis is where you can get crazy and customize your game set.  In addition to the standard 20 tokens that the game comes with you can ask to receive additional tokens of the kind we make, blank tokens or even have a new token custom-made, (For instance if your werewolf group loves to play with the Sorcerer)\n You can come up with whatever Custom-ed piece you want to make.  Anything your heart desires, from Little Girl, Vampire, Ghost, Mason, etc.\n                                                      ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have run many iterations and prototypes of the Werewolf Tokens.

Written by Dr. Jason Tondro and produced by Fainting Goat Games, this book is a treasure trove of knowledge for anyone looking to delve deep into the world of super evil.\nArtists for the Project include:\nJoe Singleton [http://joe-singleton.deviantart.com/] Artist, writer, plotter (evil and general), Defender of Liberty, Holder of Secrets, and Keeper of the Eraser of Doom!\nDionysia Jones [http://dionysiajones.deviantart.com/] I have done interior art and cover illustrations for published RPG books such as Earthdawn, various Mutants & Masterminds supplements, and was the lead artist for Tianxia.\nJacob Blackmon [http://prodigyduck.deviantart.com/]  I draw and I play role-playing games.\nJoe Arnold - Has worked for Jeff Dee on Cave Master\nIt's true, super villains are a secretive lot. Other than the occasional slip of megalomania during world domination broadcasts, most super villains keep the essence of who they are and what they do under tight wraps. Dr. Comics (That would be Dr Tondro... Shh. It's a secret) has tapped every informant, minion, and ex-villainous love interest he could get his hooks into to divulge the secrets of what makes a super villain tick. For matters of security, we cannot reveal his sources. The only verifiable source is his comics dealer (who has since gone missing).\nThe Super Villain Handbook covers forty archetypes for various super villains that one might encounter throughout comics. While the book was created with ICONS in mind, there are many reasons that this is an essential resource for GMs of any superhero game. \nThe book classifies super villains not by what they can do (for example, \"control magnetism\") but by their role in the story (\"I must make the world safe for my people!\"). In such roles, we see everything from the lowly Crime Boss to the Cosmic Menace. This allows villains of all types and power sets to fill different roles at the table without coming across as poorly re-skinned clones.\nEach of the 40 roles also includes game stats for a sample villain in the ICONS rpg. For powerful villains with roles that are more plot device than punching bag, Jason... Er, I mean, Dr. Comics... has added cosmic power levels to the ICONS experience. These levels let the aspiring GM have a benchmark so his heroes can try and punch the hurricane (or other \u201cunstoppable force\u201d ) into submission.\nEach role is a study in evil that gives a GM the tools to construct the villains their heroes were meant to fight. Archetypes start with a quote from a famous character in comics that has filled that role. As you dig deeper into the villain, you discover what makes them tick. This includes classic examples of the role, which roles are related, and even story and plot ideas that the villain usually operates in. From the Assassin to the Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, the archetypes in this book constitute an essential reference to new and old GM's alike.  \nKickstarter is an excellent way to connect with potential fans as well as to distribute coded subliminal messages which activate Sleeper Minions. The basic book is complete. It contains the 40 illustrated archetypes as well as useful tools to expand your evil. Unfortunately, our original minions rage quit after being beaten up one too many times and took our cover.  \nWith your help, we can push the book into lofty new heights of evil. The basic Goal is to fund the book for both an ICONS Assembled and SUPERS! Revised edition. At 3,200, Jason will turn his mind control probe on Ross Payton (Base Raiders RPG), to publish a FATE Core version of the game. 3,800 dollars will see a deluxe version of the book for ICONS where we will see 40 unique villains added to the book, doubling its size. At 4,500, Jason will once again turn on the probe and, if he doesn't fry Walt's brain, we will see a deluxe version for the SUPERS! Rpg as well.  5,000 sees the Deluxe Book get the FATE Core Treatment.\nPledge tiers have been carefully constructed by our team of (kidnapped) scientists to maximize your kickstarter and project experience. Pledges of even a single dollar, immediately get the un-illustrated version of the book. At ten dollars, you get immediate access to the illustrated document as well as any stretch goals that are greenlit. Higher tiers can grab custom characters, games run by Dr. Comics, Jason Tondro, as well as even having a character of your design appear in the book. Please check the side for all tier info. \nOne of the greatest things about this project (aside from the fact that super villains everywhere haven't trained their destruct-o-rays on us yet) is that Jason is crafting a YOUniverse instead of a Universe. A comic book universe usually consists of characters and a world owned by a single company. Dr. Comics is looking to move away from that. The YOUniverse is crafted so that all of the characters funded through the Kickstarter will be released to the public domain, side by side with characters that are already there. In short, the YOUniverse belongs to you!\n From Steve Kenson (of Green Ronin and Ad Infinitum Adventures): Villains are a mainstay of superhero games: Who is going to challenge the heroes from week-to-week if not a reliable rogues gallery of villains? The Supervillain Handbook gives you enough ideas and archetypes for endless game-play and its discussion of classic villain archetypes is useful for all superhero games, beyond just Icons Superpowered Roleplaying. If superhero roleplaying games are your thing, then you want this book!\nFrom Chuck Rice of Mayfair Games (and previously of Vigilance Press and RPGObjects) Jason Tondro continues his amazing work of mixing a scholar's look at comics with great, ready-made NPCs for your ICONs games. This is his best work to date, focusing on the villains that oppose your plucky heroes. Every page is full of plot hooks and character ideas. This book will serve as a tremendous Game Master's reference through countless campaigns.\nThe BAMF Podcast hosts Jason and a round table of Villainous experts as we talk up things like the Super Villain Handbook", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile kickstarter can be a tricky way to produce a book of this type, Fainting Goat Games has teamed with HAZARD Studios to produce this project. Both production houses have run numerous kickstarters and have delivered. Fainting Goat games has produced such works as Stark City, the Great Game, and Improbable Tales, just to name a few. HAZARD has crafted SUPERS! Revised Edition as well as two issues of HEROIC, with their publishing partner Zenith Comics. Even with this in mind, there are always challenges and unforeseen occurrences which can hamper a project.\n\nSome of these challenges include: rival super villains fighting over their positions in the book, a minion drought, or a cosmic threat which slows down internet connectivity. Even with these things in mind, the main book is already written and ready to launch. With your help, we can take this book to the next level as your ideas, characters, and villainy join with ours in a massive plot to rule the WORLD (of tabletop rpgs... What? We're not greedy).\n\n As a side note, HAZARD Studio launched a kickstarter last year to fund Issue 2 of Heroic.

Do you love the grit of the wild west and the pioneering spirit of those folks that left everything behind and went west to seek their fortune?\nMaybe your campaign is a straightforward historic adventure with outlaws, Native Americans and simple townsfolk all struggling for survival. Maybe you've opted for a world where the creatures of nightmares exist and magic isn't just a thing of legend. Perhaps you've moved away from both of these settings into the present and the lure of a haunted old west ghost town.\nJust like a good play or movie, a story needs a great set to make it come alive. That is where we come in. This Kickstarter will give you what you need to help make your vision come alive on the tabletop. The Kickstarter is for floor plans of several iconic old west structures: Settler's Cabin, Hotel/Saloon, General Store, Church W/Cemetery, Sheriff's Office and a Livery Stable.\nIn addition, several great game companies/authors are providing product to anyone that pledges $25 or more:\nWarning Label is providing .PDFs of two decks of their Casts of Cards (Wild West Archetypes and Boomtown-not yet released). This will provide you with over two dozen pregenerated characters for Savage Worlds complete with stats and backgrounds.\nSometimes finding high quality western minis can be a challenge for GMs, so Arion Games is providing .PDFs containing over 100 old west figure flats!\nAmbient Environments is providing 4 amazing soundtracks (Wild West Showdown, Old Western Town, Old Western Saloon and Reckoning). These add another amazing dimension to the game when played at the table.\nDarren Miller (Author-Canned Food) will create an adventure using the wild west floor plans from the campaign.\nFor more info on any of these products or companies, please click on the image.\nStretch Goals\nInstead of providing additional products from outside sources, we have decided to focus the stretch goals on expanding the number of building floor plans that we create for the campaign. In essence, the more support that we get, the bigger the town grows.\nFor every $250 above our funding goal, we will add one new building:\n$3250-School House\n$3500-Undertaker's Office\n$3750-Bank\n$4000-Doctor's Office /Home\n$4250-Train Station/Telegraph Office\n$4500-Streetscape\n$4750-Barber\n$5000-Court House\n$5250-Mayor's House\n$5500-Old West Train\nI have some ideas for things beyond these as well. If you see a pledge tier that needs to be added or have suggestions for structures that need to be created as a part of the campaign, we are always open to suggestions.\nAbout Our Maps\nThese maps will have all of the features that you have come to know and love from all Fabled Environments products:\n-Want to draw it out yourself? Use the 8.5\" x 11\" map as a guide.\n-Want to simply drop the map on the table and play? Use the 24\" x 36\"/ 36\" x 48\"  full scale maps (if you have access to a plotter printer) or print the tiled version on regular paper using the functionality of Adobe X or higher and assemble it yourself in a matter of minutes.\n-In addition, multiple layers, such as labels and furniture,  can be turned on or off using the layers feature. Separate layers containing  a 5' square and 5\" hex grid will also be provided with every floor plan produced by the campaign.\nAll of our floorplans are rendered in black and white and are created by a professional architectural drafter/interior designer using AutoCAD. This gives all of our maps the realistic feel that your players crave.\nFor some examples of our previous maps, feel free to watch the YouTube video above, go to our store on DriveThruRPG.com, check out our previous successful Kickstarter campaign or take a look at our web page.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFabled Environments has been offering high quality digital floor plans of modern structures to members of the Tabletop RPG community for over 10 years.

While we have a generous start up budget, it is being stretched to its limits building out the massive 3,520 square foot slice of geeky paradise we are leasing.\nWe want to build amazing, durable, easy to play on wargaming tables. Sure, we could just slap a piece of plywood on top of a rickety fold out table, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. A wargaming table built to satisfy the needs of the avid wargamer requires a lot of thought and a lot of lumber. Each table will cost at least $100 in wood alone, but it\u2019s worth it. Extra storage space built in to the table will keep people from tripping over their army storage cases. A 2\u2019 deployment section for Games Workshop games will make deploying (and burying) little dudes much more convenient. An 8\u2019 long table also makes it perfect for running two Warmachine / Hordes battles on the same table. Don\u2019t worry; there will still be plenty of storage space on three different shelves for Warma-Hordes players.\nWe want our players to be comfortable during their board game, role playing, and collectible card game (CCG) sessions. We could buy a fleet of solid metal folding chairs and pack everyone in like sardines, but again, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. Our restaurant style booths will allow our tabletop and wargaming customers a luxurious space to play for hours. We\u2019re going to buy steel chairs for our CCG players, but they\u2019re going to have thick padding on the seat and back of the chairs. No one wants to sit on cold steel for hours.\nAt Geek Out Games we view these luxuries as essential to the store, not something we will trickle in over the next five years. When we first open our doors in April, we want the jaw to drop on the very first geek that walks into our store. They will understand that this store understands them, appreciates them, and adores them; because we do.\nThank you for your support and contribution. Together we can make an amazing space for geeks to get their game on!\nAnnouncing 3 new reward tiers!\n$30 - Solid metal d20!\nThe BEAST next to its baby bro.\n$40 - 5 pack of solid metal d6's!\n5 solid metal d6\n$55 - Solid metal RPG set!\nFull set of solid metal RPG dice\nHalo Helmet:\nHalo Helmet\n Space Marine Helmet:\nSpace Marine Helmet\nStretch Goal: $1,500 - Achieved!\nFirst, a huge thank you to all of our supporters! We reached our initial modest goal in near record time. It\u2019s amazing. You\u2019re amazing. Thank you. We at Geek Out Games were concerned that $1,000 was unobtainable and that our campaign would fail after 30 brutal days of begging and groveling. You proved us wrong. We\u2019re incredibly grateful. Thank you.\nThe optimist in us (that was beaten down by dread when we started and is now dancing for joy) had planned on unlocking a spinning dice pen if we reached $1,500 in total money pledged. This pen is crazy good and we\u2019ve only found it through one supplier. That means that it\u2019s also pretty rare, as far as promotional items go. If we\u2019re going to order pens, there is nothing more geeky than having a six-sided dice spinning on the top of the pen. Of course we\u2019ll have our logo on it as humongous as possible, and we want to share that geeky glory with all of our supporters.\nIf we hit our stretch goal of $1,500 we will order a heap of these pens and include them in every tier that has stuff mailed out to the backer. That\u2019s pretty much every tier since even our adopt-a-booth and adopt-a-table tiers come with a SWAG Pack.\nThank you again for all of your support and we cannot wait to open up our store so that we can show it off to our amazing supporters! Stay tuned for more information as we get the build-out rolling full steam in the next couple of weeks! The transformation from vacant cave into a boutique style gaming store will be incredible.\nStretch Goal 2: $2,500 - Achieved!\nFirst, let me just say that you guys are amazing. You've blown away my expectations and humbled me beyond words; and that's hard to do. I usually have a ton to say but all I can find myself doing recently is blubbering about the best supporters in the world.\nIt took me a while to find another SWAG item worthy of you guys, but I finally found it. Wargammers need a good tape measure that is small enough to carry around but long enough to measure across the table. Heck, we could all use another tape measure around the house too.\nIf we hit our SECOND stretch goal (amazing!) we'll throw in a carabiner tape measure with our beloved logo to everyone that gets a piece of SWAG already. This is in addition to the spinning dice pen y'all have already unlocked!\nCarabiner Tape Measure\nStretch Goal 3: $4,000\nWe\u2019ve already achieved 250% of our initial goal and we\u2019re only half-way done with the Kickstarter! So what can I possibly want another fifteen hundred smackers for? \nHere is what what the stretch goal cash will go towards: Inventory.\nStocking a new store from scratch is blasphemously expensive. While the additional funds raised will go to increasing inventory in general, here is an idea of how those costs can skyrocket. We'll look at just stocking 16 different t-shirts as en example\nI want to build a rotating t-shirt display that will hold 16 different t-shirts, 4 per side. You\u2019ve probably seen them. There is a t-shirt on display and then next to it is a little cubby that holds the product you can pick up and take to the register. The display cabinet is not very expensive (my contractor is awesome and will build it for me). But the product inside of it adds up very quickly. \nIn order to have enough sizes to fit the variously shaped geeks that may want a shirt, and to meet minimum order requirements from suppliers, I will need to carry about 30 of each shirt. At $10 a pop, that\u2019s $300 per shirt. To fill my awesome, custom built t-shirt display rack, I need to buy $4,800 worth of t-shirts. \nThat\u2019s four thousand eight hundred dollars in t-shirts alone. Now, that\u2019s nearly $10,000 worth of product at retail value and will greatly help our store break even and maybe even turn a profit way before I expect to. You can\u2019t make money without having inventory. But that is an awful lot of money up front for a start up on a budget. That also doesn\u2019t take into account the \u201ccore\u201d products I need to buy; you know, the games that our game store needs to live up to its moniker. \nHence the new stretch goal at $4,000 in hopes of off-setting the cost of the initial inventory purchase. I have no idea if we can reach that goal or not, but I\u2019m going to shamelessly squeeze you guys in the attempt. \nWe\u2019ll be offering a blue baseball hat with GEEK OUT GAMES proudly emblazoned on it and the word Supporter across the back (right above the little pony-tail hole) at $50 donation. This will be the only way to get the hat (hence the squeezing part). I could put it in the SWAG pack contribution level, but then I wouldn\u2019t be squeezing you guys very hard, would I?\nWhat is a stretch goal without offering a big juicy carrot for those that shell out their hard earned cash to make it happen? A lame one, that's what. Geek Out Games isn't lame so here's what we'll offer everyone that contributed at any level once the stretch goal is met:\nPICK ANY SWAG ITEM in addition to what you're already getting and we'll throw it in your care package. Want an extra mug? Done! have a thing for hats and want two? Done! Want an extra logo dice bag with matching dice to give to a fellow geek as a present? Done! Seriously, you can pick anything that we're offering and we'll gladly add it to your SWAG shipment. \nFor those of you that have generously offered a donation without selecting a reward, please let us send you something. Just pick it and we'll ship it. We'll send you an email when the KS ends asking what you want and we'll be honored to send it to you.\nIt's the least we can do for turning our modest $1,000 goal into an amazing $4,000 triumph!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf the Kickstarter is successfully funded, we will have the funds to purchase and ship all of the deliverable items.

They're joined by Morgan Lash\u2014a former Wichita Witch who's shed her dark past to protect the girl the Cackler searches for\u2014her sister!\nThe Cackler and his lieutenants doing the devil's business...\nThink you can figure out the Cackler's secret identity before you get to the end of the tale? We've been putting the clues out there for 20 years, amigo! (The most concise clues are in The Black Circle book for the original Deadlands Classic, by the way, but everything is retold right here in the graphic novel as well.)\nWhat You're Funding & Delivery Dates\nWe're making both the print and digital versions of The Cackler. Each digital issue of the 4-issue series will be released as it's finished and should be out by May, and the hardback, full-color, collected print version should be in your hands by September.\nThe print version also includes the bonus game information and the illustrated story Dead Men Talking as well. We'll eventually release those as digital downloads, but they'll appear in the print version of the hardback first.\nDigital Fulfilllment\nYou'll get your digital files through the Pinnacle site, Comics+ / iVerse, and DriveThruComics.com :)\nThe Twisted Team\nShane Hensley wrote the Cackler's long-awaited tale, and it was edited and kicked in the rear by C. Edward Sellner of Visionary Comics and Deadlands Brand Manager Matthew Cutter.\nArt for this tale of Weird Western woe is by the legendary Bart Sears, one of the true masters of the medium. He's worked for EVERY major comic publisher, from Marvel to DC, Valiant to Crossgen. Colors are by the amazing Michael Atiyeh, who includes DC, Dark Horse, and Star Wars credits to his name!\nCheck out Bart's site HERE, and Michael's DeviantArt Page HERE.\nIf you haven't read the original one-shots, you can check out a preview of the issue these two hombres collaborated on before, Death Was Silent, one of our most popular initial stories. You can also check out previews of other Deadlands comics on Visionary's Deadlands Page!

The Cackler's secrets are locked up inside the graphic novel. Nice try though! ;)\nWant to Be Part of the Story?\nThe Cackler graphic novel also includes the illustrated short story of the day the Cackler met Stone, the town that suffered their wrath, and the deaths of those stubborn few who tried to save it!\nThis terrible tale of High Plains horror is called Dead Men Talking, and YOUR CHARACTER can be a part of it!

We'll include the Raven graphic novel and anything else from the Visionary store they have left in stock (inventory is getting a bit low on quite a few of their Deadlands offerings!). That keeps things nice and simple here since Kickstarter doesn't offer an easy way to track Add Ons, and still allows you to add items to your order to save on postage once we're about to ship.\nFor other Deadlands comics, if you go RIGHT NOW you might still be able to pre-order our first Deadlands comics collection, Dead Man's Hand, coming from IDW. Just download our pre-order form here, then print and take it to your local comic shop. If you want the Raven graphic novel, just select the $75 Visionary reward level, which includes a full digital and print version of the Servitor of War's five issue series by Matthew Cutter, C. Edward Sellner, and Greg LaRocque collected in one volume.\nDead Man's Hand Cover from IDW and Raven Cover\nAnd if you want the digital versions right now, just head over to the Visionary website!\nThe Visionary Playing Card Decks\nVisionary's Dead Man's Hand and Raven Custom Playing Cards!\nVisionary also created high-quality, custom playing cards for both Dead Man's Hand and Raven, featuring art on the decks from the respective comics, which have proven to be immensely popular. The Dead Man's Hand deck features cover art on face cards, and Raven features the various characters of the series. You'll get one set of each when you pledge at the $75 reward level or above.\nOriginal Art and a True One-of-a-Kind\nWe've also added two reward levels for the art collectors in the crowd. Pledge at the Art Collector $400 level and get all the graphic novel goodies, including a page of original Bart Sears art, chosen from the interior of the book (earliest backers choose first). \nOne quick-on-the-draw soul can also back the Aces level, which gets you in the Dead Men Talking story, a full-color print of the cover, AND the original cover art itself, all signed by the creators!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nPinnacle is known for some great games and we're very proud of that. Our partnership with Visionary Comics to produce the comics has resulted in some great titles to date. But we want to take things to the next level with this effort and produce a title that has sweeping and major changes for the world of Deadlands.\nOur efforts here are not only vital to producing more fantastic comics, but help pave the way for other opportunities, such as the excellent upcoming novel series from Tor Books, spearheaded by Visionary. It also helps our continued efforts to make Deadlands a great computer or video game, live action show, and/or feature film.\nProducing a graphic novel\u2014especially with the kind of top talent and high production values we hold ourselves to\u2014is expensive and very risky in a field dominated by such power players as Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, IDW, and others we're huge fans of. We've got the story, Visionary has the skills to make it happen, and now we need YOUR HELP to bring it together!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoth Pinnacle Entertainment Group and Visionary Comics are old hands at fulfilling Kickstarter projects\u2014check our previous Kickstarters to see for yourself. Pinnacle's award-winning Deadlands line includes more than 100 products over its almost-20-year history, and Visionary has produced multiple titles, including previous Deadlands comics Raven, One Shot originals, and Dead Man's Hand. The artists attached, Bart Sears and Michael Atiyeh, are top professionals in the graphic novel industry who frequently work for the likes of Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Dark Horse, and others.

Between devilish traps and wild creatures roaming the old department store (that\u2019s what it is), your life might very well end prematurely, and violently, if it wasn\u2019t for your pack.\nNine hordes \u2013 extensive rat families \u2013 populate the Ratlair, each with their own specialties, values and quirks. And of course, each horde knows songs about heroes and martyrs, who earned their unforgettable (and usually somewhat excessive) names through their deeds alone. The hordes might disagree and fight about almost everything, but they know that in the end, they are social creatures, and they can only survive together.\nSeven of nine hordes ... would like to learn more? Just click the pic!\nYou can learn more about the hordes on our blog.\nPacks! is a small, fast-paced role-playing game of rodent adventure, horror and obscurity, offering a completely new perspective on a world well-known.

So you can decide to play the game with the original rules, Savage Worlds or Fudge.\nYou can learn more about the Fudge RPG here.\nIt's a little unclear in the video so please note: In any case the core book will include the original rules and the SW conversion!\nThe original Packs! was pretty rules-light and easy to learn; it focussed on atmosphere and character. Savage Worlds presents a fast-paced gameplay as well, but just a little bit crunchier than the original rules.\nYou can learn more about the original rules and Savage Worlds on our blog.\nWith the funding goal the core book contains the SW conversion.\nDigital copy of Packs! (PDF): After backing the project at Fledgling level ($10) or higher, we will send you a message with a work in progress version of the core book; this can take up to 24 hours. The PDF file already contains 60% of the planned contents including some illustrations and a preliminary layout, missing only the Savage Worlds rules (which we are working on right now), some adventures and additional contents. If we reach our first goal, you will get the final PDF as soon as it\u2019s done!\nDigital expansions (PDF): If you back at First Blood level ($20) or higher, you will get access to a digital expansion package that starts out with ready-to-print inlays for the customizable GM screen of Savage Worlds, containing rule overviews and art, as soon as we reach the first stretch goal ($4000).

It includes a hardcover copy of the book, with a new cover illustration by Melanie Philippi, and five high-quality paper art prints depicting gorgeous (and scary) scenes encountered in the game. Please note: The actual contents of the book are identical to the retail version.\nKickstarter exclusive Leather-bound Edition: This edition, bound in real leather, will be available in this Kickstarter campaign only, not in stores or at conventions. It will be dedicated to you personally and numbered, with a heat brand of the Packs! logo and the shadows of a rat swarm. The books aren\u2019t finished yet, of course, but we can show you a sample picture of the German Savage Worlds Leather-bound Edition.

There can always be obstacles or delays when developing a game and getting it into print: Authors or illustrators can get sick, prices for printing or delivery can change. Sometimes the printer doesn\u2019t deliver a book as agreed upon, or it needs to be printed one more time as the quality is disappointing. And to be totally honest with you, everything and anything on that list has happened to us in one way or another over the course of the last seven years.\nWe already did three successful crowdfunding campaings in Germany and had our fair share of experiences with delays and mistakes.

In the depths of space these explorers found millions of star systems, strange planets, and exotic alien races. Centuries later, they form the Known Worlds, a vital region of trade and technology where empires grow and business thrives.\nIt is an unparalleled age. Cutting edge science has opened limitless frontiers of space and consciousness, and has even begun to hint at the mysteries of the universe itself. But to find them, one must travel beyond the familiar, to the last parsecs of reality. \nThe Last Parsec is a science fiction roleplaying game of exploration and adventure. It requires the Savage Worlds core rules and the Savage Worlds Science Fiction Companion to play.\nCharacters cross the cosmos under the auspices of JumpCorp, an intergalactic megacorp that contracts exploration, security, bounty hunting, transportation, and everything in between. Adventures take explorers from system to system and planet to planet, finding strange new civilizations, discovering terrifying creatures, and battling pirates, hostile aliens, rival corporations, and stranger things!\nYour hero might be a cynical human, a gregarious yeti, a hot-tempered rakashan, or one of 11 total core races--or you can create your own using the Science Fiction Companion.\nRewards\nA graphic of all the reward levels listed at right can be found at the bottom of this page, but here's what people usually ask us about first--the level that includes \"one of everything.\" That would be the Jump Chief, and it's everything at a discount over adding everything on to a base level separately.\nNOTE: The Jump Captain and Jump Chief backer levels include a set of die-cut Savage Worlds Status Counters on thick cardboard (also available as an Add On). We accidentally left these out of the Pledge levels and can't edit the Reward text to reflect this change, so we're doing it here and on the graphic below. Sorry for the inconvenience!\nWendigo Tales\nIf you'd like to jump into the setting at hyperspeed, check out our short fiction line, Wendigo Tales: Season Three features The Last Parsec, and the first two tales are already out (with four more coming soon).\nThe Searchers, by Shane Hensley, and Scrapped, by Cameron Dayton. Available now!\nBooks\nWe're taking a \"starbox\" approach to the overall setting this time. Races, technology, ships, creatures, and more are all covered in the required Science Fiction Companion, so instead of creating a core book first, we're going to do something a little different.\nThe Last Parsec blasts off with three setting books and several adventures featuring exciting planets, systems, and fantastic events at the edge of the Known Worlds. We'll produce a second wave of books and other material along with an expanded setting book tying more of the background and events together sometime in 2015.\nGet the FREE Last Parsec Primer here!\nIn the meantime, you can get the essential setting information in The Last Parsec Primer, completely free and available now!\nHere are the first three settings for The Last Parsec, written and illustrated by Pinnacle's best. We're only going to sell the books in sets during the Kickstarter--which also gets you the unlocked digital rewards. After the Kickstarter, each book will be available separately as usual.\nEach book contains detailed background on a system, planet, or other location, any new Edges, Hindrances, Gear, Ships, or Setting Rules important to the area, a Plot Point Campaign, Savage Tales, and a Bestiary covering the strange xenos and shady characters one might meet in the distant reaches.\nEach book is full-color, 96 pages, in our standard graphic novel format so everything lines up nice and neat on your shelf. All three settings are available in softback and Limited Edition hardback.\nEris Beta-V: A JumpCorp-employed team of explorers investigates a magnificent ringed gas giant with its numerous moons. Ancient artifacts of enormous power can be found among the rings and asteroids. Every moon is a unique world to be explored. When the system\u2019s valuable commerce is threatened by unscrupulous agencies, the team must root them out and put themselves at great risk on the icy fringes of interstellar space. Written by Matt Cutter (Deadlands Brand Manager).\nScientorium: Hidden away by sheer distance and forever shrouded from the minds of the curious lies a mammoth artifact from the previous galactic age, the library of Scientorium. Its strange experience chambers offer passage to a million histories on a million worlds, secrets and technologies undreamed of. Now abandoned by all but its automated security systems and enigmatic caretakers, its workings are oddly twisted and jealous, meting out reward and punishment in equal measure. This is a classic science fiction saga, an epic journey across space and time in the vein of Niven or Heinlein! Written by Timothy Brian Brown (Dragon Kings, Dark Sun, Traveller).\nLeviathan: Hunt the most dangerous game in the Known Worlds! The jungle planet Leviathan teems with mammoth lacerauns, savage beasts of enormous size and cunning, potential trophies unmatched in any other star system. Intentionally undeveloped beyond a few tourist-oriented settlements, Leviathan nonetheless draws more than just adventure-seeking hunters though, including researchers and those who would see the world left completely untouched. Both are more than willing to turn the tables on any would-be hunters. Written by John Goff (Night Train, Deadlands Noir).\nPoster Maps\nJust like the poster maps we did for Deadlands Noir, Weird Wars Rome, and East Texas University, we're creating two double-sided, dry-erase maps on heavy paper stock. This time out the maps feature four different ships (dropship, freighter, pirate vessel, and research ship) you can use for your JumpCorp team or the treacherous foes who cross their path.\nHere's a peek at the map work in progress--we'll update this with more detailed pics as they near completion.\nGame Master's Screen\nThe Last Parsec GM's screen is a tri-fold, landscape screen featuring gorgeous full-color artwork on one side and all the important charts and tables for the game on the other.\nThe GM's screen also includes The Last Parsec Primer in printed form and an original adventure (that sets up one of our future settings) by Ross Watson called The Enigma Equation.\nMiniatures\nOur friends at Bronze Age Miniatures have created nine exclusive miniatures representing some of the most popular archetypes from the Savage Worlds Science Fiction Companion and The Last Parsec.\nThe set contains the aurax, construct, deader, male and female human, insectoid, kalian, Serran, and yeti.\nBest of all, if you pledge for the minis during the Kickstarter and the bonus figures listed under Stretch Goals are unlocked (the Floran, Saurian, and Rakashan), we'll include them in your set free!\nFigures sculpted by Bronze Age Miniatures.\nAdd-Ons\nEveryone who pledges for physical shipments can add additional items to their shipment at no additional shipping cost. (After the KS you can always order these from our store at standard shipping rates.)\nSimply increase your pledge by the amount shown. When we send out the Final Survey, your credit will apply.\nStretch Goals\nHere are the additional digital or physical unlocks we plan on releasing if we exceed our original funding goal:\nRogue Traders (Merchant Level)\nKickstarter's Reward boxes don't allow formatting, so we decided to put the list of items and terms here where it's easier to understand:\nThis Reward level is for \"Brick and Mortar\" stores only and can be purchased as many times as you like. It includes:\n3 x Leviathan in Limited Edition Hardback ($75 retail value)\n3 x Scientorium in Limited Edition Hardback ($75 retail value)\n3 x Eris Beta-V in Limited Edition Hardback ($75 retail value)\n3 x GM's Screen + Adventure ($60 retail value)\n2 x Dropship and Freighter dry-erase, poster-size ship maps ($30 retail value)\n2 x Pirate and Research Vessel dry-erase poster-size ship maps ($30 retail value)\n2 x Double Action Deck ($60 retail value)\nAll this will be shipped freight free to the continental US *BEFORE* general release.\nPlease note that if we cannot verify your brick and mortar store, you will receive the Jump Captain package and a prorated refund instead.\nThe Kickstarter\nThe books and adventures are already in layout, the first wave of miniatures are done, and we're ready to go.

Her art appears in the DMG, B1, early issues of The Dragon, in Calendars, and in the first RPGA module and within various other early projects and game books.\n\"I embrace new adventures and new possibilities,\" Darlene says of her association with Mythos Arcanum, \"and can get behind the idea of engendering a better world of possibility via RPGs. In 2012 and 2013, Joe Aragon inspired Darlene for her to create a score of fantasy RPG illustrations.\" \nWhat if we introduce young users to some different concepts through their game play? At the moment, violence and greed gets rewarded. Can a different world be imagined in which the power of greed does not ultimately rule or perhaps a world where the concept of chivalry is not dead? What would it mean to be in this world? How would it feel? If, in their gameplay, outmoded models of power becomes antiquated and obsolete, can a new relationship to power make an impact upon a young player's choices in life?\nDarlene's challenge as an artist visionary is to consciously use her art to help foster a world modeling integrity. Art and intention can come together to introduce new resonant pathways in the brain. Art engenders a new synthesis. Patterns and shapes produce unique effects. Patterns of black and white, Dark and light, Vibrational frequencies, Cadence, Visual poetry--All come together to create a transcendent effect on the brain.\nWho is Mythos Arcanum Games Imagined?\nWe are a community working tirelessly, composed of veteran artists from the original days with TSR to relative newcomers in the field. Together we are participating in a collective creative experience known as Mythos Arcanum. We hope that you as fellow gamers and explorers of the imagination will join us in a living, breathing experience not borne from a mass market corporate scheme but rather from the imagination and minds of gamers like yourself!\n\nThis is just the beginning folks! We already have follow up products, at we plan to publish if this project is a success. We have adventures, settings, unique locations, . We even have a post-apocalypse game set in the far, far past written by James Ward, the author of the famous Gamma World! We may even be able to convince him to contribute an adventure offered here as one of the tier goals. \nThis is intended to be a community based project.\nDesigned by gaming community, supported by the community, and ultimately, the fate of the game will be driven and determined by the community.\nIt will require the community to support this game in order to make it a real manifestation.\nThis is no company driven thing where we bombard you with sales pitches, got to get them all while they last, nor will we change on you after a couple years just to drum up sales.\nThis will not be a game that gets changed in a couple years when a company decides it has sold to most of the consuming public and wants to drum up sales again. This game will last and only be built upon.\n\nMythos Arcanum Games Imagined is not like any game company you have ever dealt with before. The game will befully compatible with the first three versions of the most popular role playing game in history. All your old game material should be able to plug and play with little to no modifications. The book itself will be chock full of classic art from classic artists. It will be laid out by Darlene herself, with an eye to the subtle spiritual that only she can deliver. It will be a piece of symbolic symbolism with pieces of the collaborator\u2019s soul within its very pages.\nIt will be a work of art in itself!\nThis will be YOUR game!\nPlease commit your pledge and join the Mythos Arcanum community!\n\nIn addition: The cat is out of the bag! YES, the mystery artist you see here is none other than the great Jim Holloway himself! He is not only the cover artist but the main artist featured throughout the book!\n\nAnyone that pledges $5,000 or more will receive an original Jim Holloway artwork!\nAnyone that pledges 10,000 will receive multiple Jim Holloway originals, at least 2 full color paintings, as well as signed print from Darlene and numerous signed Weird Art of Vaggelis Ntousakis!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and Challenges\n\nMythos Arcanum comes with an original setting with its own gods, mythos, history, monsters and magic, but the rules are flexible enough that they can be adapted to any fantasy role-playing setting. \n\nThe rule book, a number of adventures and much of the artwork is complete. We are looking for funding to print and publish the Core Rule book, adventures and potential art upgrades.\n\nThe main challenges seem to be general cynicism, unethical Kickstarter campaigns launched in the past that have increased the cynicism, larger established game companies with existing production budgets taking advantage of Kickstarter services and existing loyal droves of fans in order to drive up profit margins that are dominating public attention. \nThis increases the challenge to legitimate small indie efforts and the upstart small guys trying to bring something truly special to the public.\nSupport guerrilla gaming!\n\nPlease support the little guy and pledge to Mythos Arcanum!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Completion Date Update", "update_content": "Printing of the Mythos Arcanum core rulebook is scheduled and should be completed on 10/02/15.\nI will send another update just as soon as I hear about a delivery date and an estimated date for sending to you the customer.\n\nThanks again for all your support and patience.\n "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Heading to Print!", "update_content": "After much gnashing of teeth, debate over how to best print the unique elements we wanted, last minute revisions, and threats of physical bodily harm, a wonderful and beautiful product is now headed to the printer!

The myths, the folklore, the campfire stories, and urban legends. Every terrifying tale of things that go bump in the night\u2026they\u2019re all true. These soul-sucking, flesh-devouring, shadow-haunting fiends want nothing more than to eat you and everyone you love. That\u2019s where we come in. The Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch. Most just call us Demon Hunters. If you haven\u2019t heard of us, we\u2019re doing a good job. In the name of all that is Good, we fight the forces of Evil. And we\u2019re hiring!\nDead Gentlemen Productions, creators of the worldwide cult hit films The Gamers, The Gamers: Dorkness Rising,and The Gamers: Hands of Fate,are once again teaming up with RPG professionals to bring you the new Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors corebook. \nOur world is a dangerous and ridiculous place. If you love the TV shows Supernatural, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and The A-Team, along with movies like Army of Darkness, Evil Dead 2, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, Ghostbusters, and James Bond, we do too and it's all here. The truth is, as mentioned above, it's ALL real. Like the show, Supernatural, the Demon Hunters setting relies on existing lore, urban legends, etc., because we have found that the truth really is stranger than fiction. \nThe Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch is the worldwide organization that operates behind the screen of the mainstream. We are what stands in the way of you and what wants to eat your heart while you watch, you know, because it's Tuesday.\nBecause the forces of evil in our world are SO evil and powerful and prevalent, we use comedy to help fight it back. This game is a training tool to help you face what's out there. So grab your friends, generate scenarios, tell your collaborative story, and laugh. Laugh hard. It steels your soul for the horror that awaits you.\nBefore The Gamers, The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, JourneyQuest, or The Gamers: Hands of Fate, there was Demon Hunters. The group that would become The Dead Gentlemen created 2 feature length digital films between 1999 and 2001. The movies were enjoyed by college audiences, and the world we created has inspired us ever since. In 2008 we partnered with Margaret Weis Productions and released the Demon Hunters Roleplaying Game. In April 2014 we relaunched our Demon Hunters story in the form of a webcomic, rebooting the canon, and now we'd like to create a new Demon Hunters RPG using rules inspired by the Fate Core system. Additionally we have developed an adventure generation system based on our experience and tools as screenwriters and storytellers. That's where this Kickstarter Campaign comes in.\nDemon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors Corebook\nThis is a mockup. Actual book may look different.\nWithin the 248 pages of this deluxe-yet-surprisingly-portable Bible-sized (6\" x 9\") roleplaying game book are all the rules and guidelines you need to create your Demon Hunter, seek out and thwart the minions of evil, and survive long enough to keep the mundanes from hearing about it. From character generation to gameplay, it is designed to get you fully into the story quickly. Our system is building on Fate Accelerated & Steve Kenson's Icons Assembled, so if you love those games you're going to love the Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors. \nFor the Gamemaster, an adventure generation system utilizing our storytelling structures that provides tables, charts, clever advice, and a host of useful story elements keeps you from going crazy while spinning grand and epic tales of infernal nastiness. \nIt's a gorgeous black and white tome with a foil-stamped leather-like softcover, and makes a great bludgeoning weapon in case of emergency. \nPLAYTESTING UPDATE: Every backer who pledges for the STARTER KIT or higher reward levels will receive playtesting materials in PDF as they become available. We anticipate the first round shortly after the campaign is over. The playtesting materials will be for both gameplay and adventure creation.\nDemon Hunters Player's Guide PDF\nThis brief primer gets your players acquainted with the world and how to build a basic character. It also includes a number of pregenerated playable characters.\nBurnout! A Dynamic Demon Hunters Example Mission\nThis adventure is designed in the style of mad libs so that you can use the elements in the corebook mission generation system, or the Gamemaster's Apprentice cards (Chill! We\u2019ll tell you about those in just a minute - sheesh). Your team of Demon Hunters have to investigate a strange repeat occurrence, unraveling a dastardly evil plot. Can your hunters save the day? \nAntiTank Sally\nDemon Hunters Temporary Tattoos\nOne of the most notable aspects of this setting is that every Demon Hunter has a Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch tattoo (the one with the 3 swords), and every Order of the Infernal Scepter agent is branded with their insignia. At the TREESLAYER reward level and above, you receive these as temporary tattoos.\nCustom Demon Hunters Dice\nWe are still finalizing what these are going to look like. Below is a photo of our initial prototype, subject to change. Final dice images will be available before the end of the Kickstarter Campaign. You will have the chance to pick up Demon Hunters dice of either or both factions (Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch or Order of the Infernal Scepter) at their respective reward levels, or when the campaign is over through BackerKit (See description below), even if your reward level doesn't include them. \nCONTEST: The Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch and the Order of the Infernal Scepter have been at war with each other for ages. You get to pick a side by backing the CELESTIAL TORCH DICE or INFERNAL SCEPTER DICE reward levels. Whichever faction receives the most support, its backers will win a PDF of the Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors. This includes BackerKit orders!\nPrototype Dice. Design still being finalized.\nDemon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice Cards PDF\nDesigned by team member and professional game designer Nathan Rockwood, this print and play deck of 60 double-sided cards, themed for the world and style of The Demon Hunters, can generate plot seeds, characters, or encounters on the fly, or help a GM plan adventures. These cards also come with a special link for DriveThruCards to buy a printed deck at a discounted price.\nDemon Hunters Adventure Guide PDF\nA series of suggestions, examples, and pre-constructed setups--the Demon Hunters Adventure Guide PDF used in conjunction with the tables in the corebook, or the Demon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice cards (or both!) gets your chapter of Demon Hunters out in the field and honing their skills, even when you feel like you've run out of story!\nThe Cipherspace Codex\nThe digital collection of everything we're offering, including but not limited to:\nDemon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors Corebook PDF\nFillable PDF Character Sheet\nFillable PDF Mission Record Sheet\nPDF Demon Hunters Players Guide, including sample pregenerated characters\nA Demon Hunters Adventure Guide PDF\nPDF Sample Adventure, Demon Hunters: Burnout!\nPDF of the Demon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice Print and Play card deck\nPDF of the script from our college movie that started it all, Demon Hunters\nPDF of a script from the followup movie of our college movie that started it all, Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake\nPDF 2008 version of the Demon Hunters Roleplaying Game, published by Margaret Weis Productions\nDigital Demon Hunters Wallpapers for desktop and mobile devices\nBacker Milestone Goal Reached!

This is the official Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch pin. The pin is 2\" long with 2 clutches!\nMockup. Not actual pin.\n         Add-ons will only be available through BackerKit. We want to run a simple campaign and have found that add-ons create a layer of complication. So not to worry, add-ons will be available when you go to check out when the campaign is over. We will add previews of those here when they're available.\nWhen the campaign ends we will be using BackerKit to help fulfill your rewards and send out the surveys. BackerKit is like a last minute shopping cart, like the rack with all the candy bars, magazines, and batteries to tempt you at the checkout stand. So if you missed out on something that was revealed during the campaign, or you wanted to add something your reward level doesn't include, you will get a second chance to purchase it with BackerKit. \nGabriel\nShipping costs are out of control. And in particular, out of OUR control. All of the rewards include shipping anywhere in the USA. It is stunning what it costs to ship outside the USA and the paperwork to do it. If you live outside the USA, please note the extra shipping fee on each reward. Kickstarter automatically adds this when you check out. \nWe know from experience that delivering rewards is often underestimated. That's why we're extending the estimated delivery dates. We are aiming to ship much sooner, but better to be safe than sorry.\nWe are offering the print on demand copies of the Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors as a link from DriveThruRPG that allows you to purchase the PoD version of the book as close to our cost as we can provide. The print on demand printer adjusts their prices as they need to, so we are unable to provide an exact cost, but it will be less than if you were not a backer. Many backers would like a physical book before their deluxe edition is being traditionally printed, so we are providing this as an option. The PoD version of the book will be a hardcover book, and will not be the deluxe leather-like edition.\nJust to state it again, the Demon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice cards are available this way as well through DriveThruCards. \nSilent Jim\nWe are working with some of the best roleplaying game professionals in the industry to make this game incredible, and we need to pay them for their hard work. You're also paying for the print production and shipping costs to us for all the physical rewards. If you live in the State of Washington in the USA, your WA sales tax is included in your reward pledge.\nCam Banks, Writer, Lead Game Designer: Cam is an award-winning game designer & developer who left New Zealand in 1996 to marry his sweetheart and forge a new life in the USA.

After working in clothing design and the short lived Ethos trading card game, Ben turned his sights to comics. After a cross promotion involving Ethos and Dead Gentlemen\u2019s Luster character (from The Gamers: Dorkness Rising), Ben was invited to join the Demon Hunters webcomic project, where he masterfully brought to life all the crazy concepts bouncing around Jimmy McMichael\u2019s head. He\u2019s also incredibly humble. Masterfully so.\nJimmy McMichael, Writer: Jimmy writes the Demon Hunters webcomic. It is the culmination of a 15-year scheme that has involved playing Herr Doktor in Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake, creating and running the Dead Gentlemen website for far longer than he had any interest in doing so, co-writing the original Demon Hunters RPG and accompanying Orientation Video for Margaret Weis Productions, and working on RPGs based on the shows Supernatural and Leverage. This Kickstarter is the final phase of his master plan. All of the pieces have fallen into place. Let the Ragnarok Protocol commence!\nJen Page, Artist, Graphic Designer: If there was such thing as real life \u2018Experience Points\u2019, Jen would be racking up the geek stats.

She's contributed plenty of work to Dead Gentlemen including the JourneyQuest logo, the Luster artwork on the Dorkness Rising cover as well as designed Dead Gentlemen's own company logo. \nNathan Rockwood, Writer, Game Designer: Believing firmly that 'story trumps rules' has led Nathan down many strange paths over the years--medieval reenacting, teaching both English and Game Design, teaching video games IN English class--and one of those paths crossed with the Dead Gentlemen's when he worked as an author and designer on the first Demon Hunters RPG in 2008. Nathan has written for many other games before and since, including the award-winning Serenity RPG, and has recently begun publishing independently, but he's looking forward to reactivating his Brotherhood Chapter... and may even get a real tattoo this time.\nEmilie Rommel Shimkus, Copyeditor: Emilie is an actor, singer, and writer from the Pacific Northwest.

We have learned a lot on previous Kickstarter campaigns with our sister-company Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, and we are using that experience to make this far more efficient and faster turnout than ever before.

Check out the GeekDad review here.\n\nWhy Are We Kickstarting Designers & Dragons?\nPre-press production on Designers & Dragons: The \u201970s is already complete, and it\u2019s so gorgeous that it got us all riled up. We\u2019re really excited about this project, and we want this first volume to have company. In short, we want to be able to print and release all four volumes at the same time. But...\n... production and printing on each volume costs $10k or more, and the idea of producing all four volumes at once gives our financial people a case of nervous twitches. We want to make this happen responsibly so we can continue to produce the high quality products you\u2019ve come to expect from Evil Hat Productions. \nThis Kickstarter will enable our goal of printing more than just the 1970s volume at the same time. It will help cover the print runs and some of the costs for Volumes 2-4 so that we can do this right\u2014and with full knowledge of how many of you out there are interested! Plus, if we hit our initial funding goal and our first two stretches, we'll be able to release the full set all at once. \nThis Kickstarter gives us an opportunity to spread our excitement in more productive ways than running through the neighborhood whilst festooned with streamers and blaring horns. (And with less of a chance of getting arrested, which is a double win.) If you\u2019re as thrilled as we are about the chance to dig into the history of our hobby, we hope you\u2019ll help spread the word to people who feel the same. Seriously, these books are addictively awesome. They nearly drove us to festooning and horn-tootery, which we think says a lot.\nProject Rewards & Goals\nEach volume in the Designers & Dragons series will be a 6\"x9\" softcover, several hundred pages long, with black and white interior. Each decade's volume of Designers & Dragons covers dozens of companies founded in that decade and follows them through to their end, or the present day for those still with us.\n\nPlease note: Companies are generally listed by their best-known, or at least most-recent, name. So you might see something like Margaret Weis Productions listed above where it was originally known as Sovereign Press, and so on.\n\nDesigners & Dragons: The \u201970s: Immediately available in multiple digital formats to our backers. Are you a backer? Go HERE to download your copy! \nEverything you\u2019ve wanted to know about the origins of roleplaying games\u2026\nDesigners & Dragons: The \u201970s is a comprehensive picture of the beginnings of the RPG industry.

Learn about the colorful history of TSR and the wave of D&D inspired games (and gaming companies) to follow, and dip your toes into wargaming trivia. Whether you\u2019re a long-time gamer who greets each mention of a \u201970s title with \u201cI remember that!\u201d or a new-to-the-hobby sort who wants to know how we got here in the first place, Shannon Appelcline\u2019s meticulously researched history won\u2019t disappoint.\nMeet the characters behind the characters and the gamers behind the games in Designers & Dragons: The \u201970s!\nForeword by: Greg Stafford!\nCompanies covered include: TSR, Flying Buffalo, Games Workshop, GDW, Judges Guild, Metagaming Concepts, Fantasy Games Unlimited, Chaosium, Gamescience, Heritage Models, Grimoire Games, DayStar West Media, and Midkemia Press.

We've reached $15,000, so we'll be able to print the \u201990s volume at the same time as the \u201970s and \u201980s!\nJust like the earlier volumes, plus a free Baywatch-themed gaming session with David Hasselhoff. No, not really. We\u2019re kidding about that part, but hopefully we didn\u2019t have to tell you that. But this volume does profile an RPG titan\u2014Wizards of the Coast\u2014not to mention cover the rise of storytelling RPG settings like White Wolf\u2019s World of Darkness.\nForeword by: Peter Adkison!\nCompanies covered include: White Wolf, Atlas Games, Pagan Publishing, AEG, Phage Press, Dream Pod 9, Wizards of the Coast, Metropolis, Hogshead Publishing, Last Unicorn Games, Kenzer & Company, Grey Ghost Games, Imperium Games, Holistic Design, Pinnacle Entertainment Group, Fantasy Flight Games, Guardians of Order, Eden Studios, Margaret Weis Productions, Green Knight Publishing, and Hekaforge.

Details in this update with some further information in this update.\nA gallery of nostalgia-tweaking advertisements and company logos to backers at $15+. Details!\nShannon's yearly looks at the industry added to the Platinum Appendix. What's the Platinum Appendix? Details in this update!\nShannon will write a short history on the gaming group that released the first third-party supplement for Dungeons & Dragons, forever changing the game with the introduction of a thief player class. We'll add this to the Platinum Appendix. Details in this update!\nHow will I select my rewards?\nFirst, pledge your reward level!\nSoon after the campaign concludes, we'll send out surveys to folks getting the physical books. When the time comes, we will ask you to fully configure your rewards package over on backerkit.com\u2014a well known third party pledge configuration service. (If using a third-party pledge configuration service is a problem for you, it's probably best to wait and buy our books when they reach distribution.) \nBackerkit will also make it possible for folks to add on additional books in case you forgot to pledge for them while the campaign was active. Bonus!\nWhat Are My International Options?\nShipping kills, friends. Shipping kills. So be ready for that!\nWe've added a number of \"BILL MY SHIPPING LATER\" reward tiers for our international backers. Please make sure to read the relevant section in Update #3 so you can understand exactly how this will work and how high that later shipping charge will be!\nThe books will be made available for sale to the international market once they're in print, so if you'd rather wait, that's totally fine. There are also some other options to consider besides the BILL MY SHIPPING LATER reward tiers.\nIf you want to stay apprised of developments on this project, consider backing us at one of the digital levels\u2014even for $1, a low-cost way to \"subscribe\" to this project's updates. \nAnother good option is to contact a retailer closer to you and arrange for them to order the books you want! Evil Hat's books are distributed and sold to and by game retailers in multiple international markets, including Canada (served by Lion Rampant distribution), Australia (dependent on individual retailers placing orders with us), the United Kingdom (distributed by Esdevium to many stores in the UK and Europe, including Leisure Games), and Germany (often carried by Sph\u00e4renmeisters Spiele), for starters. \nOr you can find a way to effectively \"pretend\" to be a domestic backer by finding a person or organization in the US that can receive a package for you, then get it to you in a way you're willing to afford. (We've heard mention of Ship It To as one option, tho we have no experience with them ourselves.)\nInternational retailers without a reliable distribution source for our books may pledge for the MASTER OF RETAIL reward tier\u2014so long as you have a US-based address for us to ship to.

We've produced multiple printed role-playing games in a variety of physical formats over the past six-plus years. This is a non-fiction book series, which is markedly *less* challenging to produce than a RPG book.\n\nEvil Hat's experience puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that arise\u2014as with any project, experience tells us a few problems and bugaboos *will* arise.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nTHE TEXT: While the editing and layout of several volumes is largely done, it's possible that we will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we've got an editor, a proofreader, and a historian going over every sentence in close detail, so we feel we have this under control. \n\nPRINTING: Our company has grown up alongside the big boom in digital short-run printing technology. Thanks to the advances made there, we'll be able to print the book in any quantity we need. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, or simply goofing up the manufacture or shipping of the books in some way. With a number of potential domestic printers to use, we'll always have a back-up we can go to in the event that our first choice printer has to be set aside. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nSHIPPING: Packages get lost. We'll work with you to send replacements. Our shipper may take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFINANCES: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and Fate Core, Evil Hat is\u2014for the game industry\u2014a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already spent thousands on getting Designers & Dragons to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

Thank you so much for funding us! If you're finding this page after the fact, you can check out the show on our YouTube channel, visit us at www.deadgentlemen.com, and be sure to follow us on Kickstarter for awesome future campaigns and projects.\n12 years ago, we decided to enter the emerging reality TV market, but with our own devious twist: using hidden cameras to observe the methods the PRODUCERS use to make great unscripted television. The production team, however, was overly zealous, and some...things...occurred.\nHappily, the statute of limitations has finally expired and we're ready to release the hilarious/appalling/potentially-criminal results to you! During the film's enforced convalescence, we have managed to put together most of the footage and all we need is a few finishing touches to make the ending really...explode off the screen...you might say.\n--------------------------------------\nStretch Goals!\nACHIEVED!!! $16,000 - Expanded Professional Sound Library. If we hit this goal we will be able to acquire an expanded sound library that has been used on actual professional reality television. The quality of our show will be enormously improved with this addition.\nACHIEVED!!! $17,000 - House Rulez Backer Patch! Everyone at the $50 level and higher will receive an exclusive House Rulez Backer Patch. If you have ever gotten a patch from a previous ZOE Kickstarter you know how cool these are. \n$18,000 - A Thank You Bonus to Sarah Sanders-Ode, our assistant editor (and she's in the show) for editing over 61 hours of footage into 4 hours, over the past several YEARS!\nYou can add the patch as an Add-On for $5 if you're pledging at a lower level. Just increase your pledge accordingly and make a note in the survey we send out.\nHouse Rulez is Dead Gentlemen's first foray into the world of reality television. DG hilariously exposes not only the quirks and foibles of the cast, but also uses hidden cameras to covertly spy on the show's production team--and their increasingly frantic attempts to create a watchable show!\nA four-hour reality television miniseries, House Rulez will be released on the Dead Gentlemen and Zombie Orpheus YouTube channels.\nWe are Dead Gentlemen Productions and our friends over at Zombie Orpheus Entertainment. We created House Rulez twelve years ago with an all volunteer cast and crew and almost have it finished! We are just asking for your help to complete the final sizzling touches! \nAbsolutely! Old favorites like:\nNathan Rice (Lodge from The Gamers movies, Roderick from JourneyQuest, Gabriel from the Demon Hunters series) \nMatt Vancil (finally on camera without facial prosthetics!)\nSteve Wolbrecht (Nodwick from Dorkness Rising, Chris from the Demon Hunters series)\nEd Gibbs (the Hierophant from Dorkness Rising)\nDon Early (Mort Agrippa from Dorkness Rising, Silent Jim from the Demon Hunters series)\nPhil Price (Nimble from The Gamers and a cameo peasant in Dorkness Rising!)\nBen Dobyns (while not acting in the show, House Rulez' director has produced and directed multiple installments in The Gamers, Demon Hunters, and JourneyQuest series)\nMANY more familiar faces!\nGamers: Dorkness Rising, Gamers: Hands of Fate, and JourneyQuest can be seen on YouTube. You can also watch JourneyQuest on Hulu. Our movies are also available for sale at www.watchthegamers.com, www.paizo.com, www.drivethrurpg.com, and www.amazon.com\nThe project was the brainchild of Dead Gentlemen Productions' own DG Improv: all of the original members of DG Improv are involved in this wholly unscripted adventure.\nAlso involved, top improvisers from Puget Sound area troupes such as Fool's Play and Seattle GOGA.\nStory editor Sarah Sanders-Ode not only appears in House Rulez, but cataloged every dramatic moment and spent several years finding and editing the ideal shape and form to tell this epic story. This project would not exist without her passion and dedication.\nFor post-production, Alex Perrault brings the benefit of 20 years of expertise as an Emmy-nominated editor who worked in film, broadcast, DRTV, and web. His long experience in documentary and reality film making, and past with networks like PBS, Discovery, A&E, TLC, and National Geographic, allow him to bring a very modern sensibility to all his projects.\nGraphics, sound, and sweetening will be by Jaya Productions. They started in 2001, working on DRTV campaigns, and eventually grew into the Reality TV space, working on many hit shows that aired on networks like A&E and History. In recent years they've grown into web and corporate video with work for Amazon, Real Networks, US Dept of Energy, King County, Microsoft, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They specialize in creative storytelling through effective editing and motion graphics.\nAnd finally, Zombie Orpheus Entertainment is on board to help shepherd House Rulez across the finish line. They will bring their Kickstarter and distribution expertise to the task of manufacturing and delivering rewards and putting the show in front of your eyeballs.\nThis will be a FAST turnaround: you'll get to see the fruits of your generosity within a few months of the Kickstarter's completion. This isn't a campaign where your help will enable us to MAKE the project, this is all about FINISHING it. We already have a team of talented and experienced reality television editors hard at work--they are fine-tuning the rough cut and preparing it for release. We will release House Rulez for FREE online under Creative Commons Non-commercial license so that the whole world can see the conflagration of emotion and hilarity\u2014as well as being able to play with the released version all you like.\nCan't afford to pledge? That\u2019s okay! You can help us just by letting anyone who might like our show know that we\u2019re out here. Tweet us, share us, like us on Facebook\u2014any extra exposure we get helps people who can contribute find our project.\nYes. And no. An opportunity to bring the project to the masses presented itself briefly in 2009, but...things...scuttled the attempt. This time, though, we have no fear of a repeat: our legal ducks are all in a row plus a full cut of House Rulez is already complete\u2014only the finishing touches are needed before it can be released in all its catastrophic glory. And that's where you come in.\nYou can find us and ask us questions at the sites listed below. Additionally, you can ask us a question with the \u201cAsk A Question\u201d button at the bottom of the FAQ; we\u2019ll be sure to get you an answer!\nSome things we could accomplish with further support would be a 12-years later \"Where Are They Now\" mini-documentary, better color correction, sharper audio mix with additional sound effects and foley, the ability to release outtakes and extra footage (there's A LOT!), and a full-length commentary. We'll share more details after we meet our primary goal.\nHoly Crap! Thank you all who just responded here to that ZOE email that just went out! Amazing.

This is the 21st century and no one wants to admit they\u2019ve helplessly watched a classmate get sucked into the pages of a library book, come face-to-face with an angry ghost, or glimpsed a creature prowling the campus by the light of the full moon.\nCollege is where you make your own choices and find out who you really are. You can keep your head down, hoping to avoid the twisted horrors you sometimes catch out of the corner of your eye, or you can face your fears, fight the darkness, and protect your campus. Everyone starts out as a wide-eyed freshman, but if you survive four years at ETU you\u2019ll be a hero.\nThe Books\nThe ETU line debuts with two, 96-page, full-color books in our graphic novel format. We expect to deliver the PDFs in July. Assuming the Kickstarter is successful, the physical products should ship no later than November.\nThe core book, East Texas University, offers a well-rounded syllabus of character creation, new Edges & Hindrances, gear, Setting Rules, and tours of campus and nearby Pinebox, Texas. For advanced credit, read the section on rituals and talismans. Finally, the Adventure Generator and encyclopedia of miscreants is sure to light a creative spark in even the most humorless campus parking enforcement officer.\nWelcome to ETU. Classes start this Fall. Register now.\nThe second book, Degrees of Horror, includes a full-length Plot Point Campaign designed to take your class from Freshmen to graduation\u2014if they survive! We can't say much about the plot, but suffice to say it's a Big Deal for Pinebox...and maybe beyond. Degrees of Horror also features a full course-load of Savage Tales that work equally well with the Plot Point Campaign or your own epic saga.\nA Plot Point Campaign and additional Savage Tales for ETU!\nThe Game Master's Screen\nThis tri-fold screen features a scene of chaos on campus on the player's side, and all the important charts and tables for the game on the GM's side. It also includes a full-length 32-page adventure by Ed Wetterman\u2014we'll give you details and show you the cover in one of our first updates.\nWhen students at East Texas University talk about surviving college, they mean it\u2026literally!\nAll pledge levels include unlocked digital rewards and free domestic shipping!\nAdd Ons!\nWe have four Add Ons for everyone who pledges at the Junior level Reward or higher (if you order an Add On and only pledged for PDFs we'll refund your Add On pledge since this doesn't cover the shipping).\nThese items will be available as Add Ons after the Kickstarter closes, but at a higher retail price. To get the lower prices reflected below, include them in your pledge (you can tell us exactly what the extra funds are for when we mail out the Final Survey).\nNote that you must pledge at the Junior level or higher to order any of these items as Add Ons. International customers must add an additional $20 if you add one or more sets of Bennies, miniatures, or Go Ravens! dice. There is no extra cost for shipping the maps.\nAll the Add Ons for East Texas University, all visual like. :)\nAdd On Details\nBennies (Pack of 20 high-quality ceramic poker chips): Please add +$15 to your pledge\nAll TEN ETU 28mm Miniatures: Please add +$50 to your pledge\nGO RAVENS!

Long lasting and durable coin or victory point counter replacement for any game. Great for role-playing games too!\nUPDATE: BONUS PACK OF COINS!\nAll REWARD LEVELS of $100 or more will get an extra free bag of coins of their choice. This is not reflected in the actual rewards as we can't change their text after people have pledged to them. This is for 200 coins or more, not just spending $100 or more.\nWe sell these coins in bags of 10. So when you choose your reward to the right you are choosing the TOTAL number of coins you would like to receive. After this campaign ends, you will get to pick how many 10-pack bags of each denomination you would like.\nThese wonderful metal coins/tokens measure from 18-25mm in diameter and are 2mm thick!  They are made out of zinc and weigh about same as modern coins. \nThe coins are two sided with an iconic dragon on the heads side and a large easy to read denomination number on the tails side. The images shown here are mostly complete designs but some aspects may change slightly. They will be colorized and have a shading rub applied to them.\nComparable coins from another publisher would cost you more than twice as much as we are charging.\n .\nThe above items in this ala-Carte menu are items you can purchase with your coins to help us reach a higher total dollars pledged on this campaign which in turn will allow us to reach more stretch goals! To purchase anything from this menu, simply click on the MODIFY PLEDGE and add the $ amount extra to your pledge amount for the items you want.

Each denomination still comes in a bag of 10 coins.\n$35,000 - New 100 Coin - REACHED!\nAn additional coin style will be added, making 7 total denominations of coins you could order.

Each denomination still comes in a bag of 10 coins.\n$50,000 - Larger Coins - REACHED!\nEach coin will be made 1mm larger (diameter)\nAll prices include USA shipping costs. All outside the USA shipments have an additional charge that is required.

The point of this Kickstarter is to get it off the ground. The bulk of the book was written at the same time as the \u00c6ther Core Book, but it has evolved and changed with the system. Now we are ready to give it the finishing touches that it deserves along with the polish and shine that we have so badly wanted for it.\n\u00c6thermancy is a complete magic book that builds on the skill system that is at the heart of \u00c6ther. It allows for an incredible degree of creativity and flexibility with your spell caster, whether you are using the system for typical wizards, clerics, or psychic users; all of them are treated the same in the \u00c6thermancy book, at least mechanically. The book contains ways to incorporate magic into your existing campaign, it contains 30 adventure hooks, a fully fleshed out adventure, and over 200 spells. (FINAL COUNT 257 unless someone else pledges in the next 2 minutes, then it's more!)  It blends seamlessly with the \u00c6ther system; making it feel like a continuous inclusion rather than something clunky and bolted on.\nWhat is \u00c6ther?\nFrom Kevin Rohan, the system creator\n\u00c6ther is a critically acclaimed universal role playing system that allows you to do anything. The Core Book is geared for modern games, but it is easily and readily adaptable for any time or technology level, from the Stone Age to the very far future. It is a skill-driven system that has amazing character creation flexibility and the possibilities for advancement are virtually limitless. But, you don't have to take our word for it, see what some of our customers have said!\nFrom Amazon:\nFind those at Amazon.com.  For a few more, click the link to see our reviews at DriveThru RPG! Want to know more about the system itself, visit the Silver Gryphon Games website!\nWhy are we Kickstarting this?\nWe need additional funding for art. We want the presentation of this book to be our best ever, and that means more polish than we've ever done before on the various print editions. Virtually all of the Kickstarter funds are going for art, with a very small portion of them going to establish other features of the book such as the ISBN codes and identifiers.\nIn the spirit of Kickstarter, we have several stretch goals, all of them revolve around more content for \u00c6thermancy and more choices for you at your gaming table. More spells, more caster types, more archetypes, and more creatures are made available at the individual stretch goals. As we approach those new goals, we will tell you more about them, but we can say that we have a lot planned for this project! Without being Kickstarted, these other goals may never see the light of day, so this is a rare opportunity to actually drive content and tell a publisher exactly what you want!\nWe do have some art already, provided by Dennis Darmody, and for a taste of what's due to be inside, we present you with the Explode spell and an illustration for it!\nFast breakdown of what you can get!\nWant to see this larger?\nFunding and Stretch Goals\nWe will be updating this section as this project grows, and we have a number of stretch goals that are designed specifically for \u00c6thermancy and supporting information for using more magic in your game world. Ranging from more \u00c6thermancer archetypes, spells and adventure hooks, all the way up to fantasy bestiaries and beyond, this will be a keystone project for Silver Gryphon Games and will help guide our production for many months to come!\nDaily Expansion Goals:  We really want this to succeed and we're willing to put our mouth where your support and money are!  Starting on September 17th, we decided to add 5 new spells to the main book every time we have more than 5 backers in a day.  Additionally, every $1,000 dollars in pledges we receive will generate another 5 spells for the main book!  Considering there is (at the time I'm writing this) already 210 spells in the book, that could end up being a huge spell selection!\n$4750: \u00c6thermancy is Funded! We will contact the prospective artists immediately and we will get art going. If all goes right, we may be able to update you with concept sketches or even full art, depending on when the goal has been hit!\nAdding spells until the last minutes!\n$6500: The first stretch goal of the Tome of the Unknown \u00c6thermancers is unlocked! Each of the smaller stretch goals for this companion volume will add another main \u00c6thermancer archetype with three variants, spells, adventure hooks, and pre-generated \u00c6thermancers, ready to use in your campaigns! Our expected date of delivery on these is April of 2014 due to the art concerns, but we may be able to get these out sooner!\nThe spell casting mechanic of \u00c6thermancy works by the player choosing which of the eight attributes their character uses as a Casting Attribute, and each of these eight \u00c6thermancers pivots off a different attribute, adding a wide range of possibilities to your gaming table! The first of the Unknown \u00c6thermancers is the Sorcerer, and others unlock as stated below! If all eight \u00c6thermancers are funded, the book will be completed with its own fully fleshed out adventure!\n$11,750: The second major stretch goal is the Grimoire of Forgotten Lore! Each small goal unlocks another type of magic, adding para-elements to the five core elements of fire, earth, water, air, and energy included in the core book, and it also adds life magic, death magic, and summoning to the mix! Every small goal unlocked gives you another 30 spells, three \u00c6thermancer variants that deal specifically with the type of magic unveiled, and it also gives three adventure hooks per caster type! Our expected date of delivery on these is June of 2014, again, due mostly to art concerns.\nIf all eight sections of the Forgotten Lore are unlocked, there will be an adventure added to the Grimoire of Forgotten Lore to complete the book!\nWe have many further goals in mind for this project and as we get closer and closer to unlocking them, we will reveal more information about them, but here's a taste:\n$19,500: Catalog of Mythical Beasts - Contains up to 295 creatures of an \u00c6thermantic nature, each of them is fully illustrated! One of the mini-stretch goals of this volume also contains a new type of \u00c6thermancer, the artificer!\n$49,250: Reliquary of Forsaken Relics - Contains up to 210 relics from many places, origins, and times, all for use in your \u00c6thermancy adventures!\nThat is just a taste of our goals, we do have further goals in mind, and we will release more on them as we approach the appropriate funding levels!\nPixie Dust Miniatures\nCaroline at Pixie Dust Miniatures has agreed to do miniature \u00c6thermancy books for us, and they make perfect charms for necklaces, bracelets, zippers, Christmas ornaments, or just to have for a keepsake! There is only one pledge level that you get a small \u00c6thermancy book for backing us, and that is the $25 pledge level. We did this for those who wish to support the project, but may not be interested in purchasing the physical copies of the book. We thank you for that, and we want to know that we appreciate your support!\nAll others who wish to have one of these items, simply add $20 to your pledge when you determine a level of support. The books are made of real leather (sorry, no material substitutions for those who prefer a non-animal based material) and other non-toxic materials and measure approximately 1 inch by 0.75 inches by 0.2 inches.\nCaroline is also providing a special award for those of you who pledge to our top two levels; a miniature wizard's desk complete with scrolls, books, and bottles! As with the spell books, everything is hand-crafted from leather and glass and a few other secret materials! The table measures 5.25 inches wide by 1.5 inches deep by approximately 4 inches tall.\nQuestions and Answers!\nWe here at Silver Gryphon Games have never had a \"fire-and-forget\" mentality when it comes to a product, and a Kickstarter project is no exception. Last summer with our dice, we were answering questions and met quite a few of our fans. With this Kickstarter, we plan on having on-line game nights revolving around \u00c6thermancy, Q&A sessions with Silver Gryphon online, and we will of course be available via emails and the Kickstarter message system to provide any answers you may need!\nThese events will be scheduled via our Facebook page and announced at the Silver Gryphon Games home page. We invite you to check with us regularly, but we will try to keep everyone updated via the Kickstarter as well.\nDelivery of Product\nWe will be waiting for art before we can do the final layout. After that we will deliver the backer awards and then we will wait a short time to put the standard editions of the PDFs and books into circulation. Additional supplements unlocked via the stretch goals may have differing delivery dates, and those will be updated as we are able to firm those dates up.\nAs of now, we are confident we can begin delivering \u00c6thermancy in February of 2014, and every two months, we expect to be able to deliver the next expansion book (Tome of Unknown \u00c6thermancers, Grimoire of Forgotten Lore, Catalog of Mythical Beasts, etc) every two months thereafter. All backers will have their products sent to them in the mail before we release \u00c6thermancy to the public, and we're expecting about two weeks later, we will release the book through our normal sales channels.\nFor the expanded material, we will be releasing those in a similar manner. All backers will have their PDFs and physical copies sent out to them at least two weeks in advance of Silver Gryphon Games making them publicly available.\n\nSpecial Thanks\nWe'd like to be sure to thank Caroline at Pixie Dust Miniatures for providing the spell books and the wizard table!

So we started talking to people and brainstorming. Some of the features people wanted to secure their phone, included:\nWorking with multiple phones or devices\nMore flexibility for clothing\nSeamless connection with walls and car dashboards too\nTwo years ago we started working on the initial proof of concepts, all involving magnets. There were 3 fundamental design criteria:\nStrong enough to run with\nEasy to remove\nShielded to protect your phone, credit cards, and other devices\n\nCountless prototypes later...\n3D printing made the early stages possible! Like proud new parents, we didn't care how ugly our baby was.\nWe started with 3D printing, but plastic didn't cut it. So we set up our own CNC machine and started producing robust aluminum prototypes, all in Jeff's basement.\nPro tip: Before you buy a CNC machine, ensure basement is soundproof. Turns out, they can be a little bit noisy.\nAt first, it was a side project, but then it grew legs. People were getting excited and volunteering to be beta testers. After they used it for a couple of months, this is what some people said:\n\u201cI really dislike having a bulky phone in my pocket, and I think the traditional belt clip holsters are ugly. What I like about Clipless is that I can have my phone on me, but can hide it in new ways.\u201d \n\u201cI used to always miss calls because my phone was lost in my purse! Now, I know exactly where my phone is all the time.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t like the normal holsters, they always jab me when I sit down, or get in the way of my seat belt. I love how I can attach Clipless pretty much anywhere.\u201d\nWe received lots of great feedback, including suggestions for improvements. To help with industrial design we worked with three designers from Cortex Design in Toronto. They helped us get it to where it is today, a high quality product that feels great in your hands.\nMore than just a magnet\nPhoto of the latest prototype, made with high-quality metal alloys. Any other photos seen in this campaign, are of older prototypes.\nSecure Phones and Devices\nClipless works with any kind of phone, GPS or tablet, that has a flat area to adhere the connector. The unique adhesive we use, allows you to stick the connector to your phone or tablet directly, or to a case! The adhesive works on almost every kind of material, and can be removed without residue. Basically, if it\u2019s not squishy (very flexible) silicone rubber or genuine leather, then it should work just fine. Fake Leather? Plastic? Aluminum? They all work great. \nA flat phone or device, HALF the size of a credit card, is all you need.\nSecure to Clothing\nClipless works with any normal clothing or fabric. That means denim, skirts, shirts, purse-liners, golf-bags, jogging pants, sportswear \u2013 the list goes on. Basically, any average single layer material, works perfect! Two layers of something thin, works too. Use caution on delicate clothing, such as lace or silk.\nSecure to Surfaces \nYou can stick the NFC-enabled mount to any surface, meaning plastic, your car dashboard, any metal, wood, tile, glass or mirror. As long as it\u2019s flat, the mount will work. The mount works with a really strong semi-permanent adhesive. It is designed to be single-use, but it can be removed, without residue. Use caution on delicate surfaces, such as painted walls. \nMounts are NFC-enabled\nThe Clipless mounts are enabled with near field communication (NFC). This allows a phone to intelligently run common tasks, based on the physical object it's mounted to.\nWe\u2019ve partnered with the creators of \u201cNFC Task Launcher\u201d to enable our Clipless mounts to launch specific apps automatically when the phone is mounted. Click the embedded video to learn more about NFC.\nBe one of the first to get Clipless...\nWe've spent two years refining Clipless to make sure that it works well and that it can be sold for a price that people want. We're almost there! With your support, you will help us fund:\nProduction tooling\nMinimum quantity orders\nEconomies of scale to achieve a reasonable price\n\nRewards\nThere are three different pledge levels, however the only difference between two of them, is the amount.  We're giving away the first 1000 at $17 + shipping, to the early birds. After those are gone, it's $35 + shipping.\n$35 for either rewards package, and add increments of $6 to either for extra discs, connectors, or mounts. (Maximum of 5 Add-Ons)\nSorry about the confusion! We do need people to add $5 for shipping to North America or $15 for International, to either pledge level.

As a Savage Worlds licensee, we currently produce the quarterly magazine Savage Insider, the only Savage Worlds magazine, and a number of price-friendly settings.\nWith the high number of settings already available, we decided it was time to try something new that didn\u2019t require a new setting. Something that provides the Game Master and players with a ready-made adventure series that brings the player characters from their first days as a Novice through their heroic days at Legendary. All of this would be achieved without forcing the GM and players to learn a new setting or familiarize themselves with the mechanical changes made to accommodate that setting.\nThus we have Twilight Continuum.\nTwilight Continuum, as the header states, is a 6-part space opera adventure series for Savage Worlds. To be more exact, Twilight Continuum is the first set to follow the Perilous Journey publication model, providing the user with a complete adventure series from that follows the beginnings of the player characters' careers until they are essentially nearing retirement, all framed by a single storyline. The setting for Twilight Continuum is near-future, with a science fiction action and adventure storyline mixed with social and dramatic elements (also known as space opera).\nDIVIDED WE FALL...\nIt is the dawn of the twenty-second century, and mankind's quest for land and resources has led to the colonization of the inner solar system. But the people of Earth remain polarized into two major factions and their satellites - the Western Nations Alliance and the Eastern Chinese Co-prosperity Sphere - and in spite of a state of detente at home, battles and skirmishes continue in the vacuum of space and between colonies.\nFOR THE ENEMY IS AT THE GATES...\nBut when the invading fleets of the Zentari arrive and aim their invasion toward earth, humanity must learn to cast aside its differences and fight together against a common foe. What drives the aliens to conquer earth? Is there any hope against their superior technology? Become one of the handful of heroes destined to save the earth and change the universe. Enter the Twilight Continuum.\nIn Twilight Continuum, the player characters assume the role of a squadron of fighter pilots, fresh out of the Alliance Military Academy, who have the good fortune to be assigned to the Alliance's prototype fast-response corvette, Vanguard. Although their skills are intended to be pitted against the pilots of the Co-prosperity Sphere, the characters each possess a genetic potential which makes them the best hope for all of humanity when the fleets of the Zentari suddenly arrive.\nPerilous Journey is a publication model influenced by Paizo Publishing\u2019s Adventure Path and Triple Ace Games\u2019 Daring Tales. This model reflects an entire, standalone adventure series divided across six 72-page books. These books cover all Savage Worlds ranks from Novice through Legendary. This model is designed to be used without the need for a setting guide, only requiring the use of the Savage Worlds core rulebook and the Perilous Journey adventure series. This series includes a Player\u2019s Guide to get players aligned to the series\u2019 storyline and the six adventure books. Each book contains a single character rank with books 5 and 6 covering the first and second halves of Legendary rank, respectively.\nEach book within the Perilous Journey adventure series contains more than just the adventure content. Each one also features:\nOne part of a novella set in the adventure\u2019s storyline.\nSource material to further the adventures outside of the storyline or provide mechanics for use within that book.\nA mini-bestiary to provide additional encounters to either expand the adventure or for use outside of the storyline.\nTwilight Continuum is the storyline created by Curtis Lyon over the past decade. This adventure series features the player characters as they work against the threats facing Earth and all of humanity. The series is divided across the following six books in order:\nVanguard: The characters mostly fight against the CCS, but Princess Zandra begins reaching out to one of them. They are assigned to the Vanguard, and are therefor the first to encounter the Zentari invaders.\nEnemy at the Gates: The characters are forced to cooperate with their former enemies of the Co-prosperity Sphere as the fight with their new enemy looms ever closer aboard the battle cruiser,Vanguard. The outcome will lead to a new understanding of this war's costs and demands.\nPrometheus Unbound: With the new tech, the characters are able to mitigate some of the shortcomings on the Human side, although they are still losing. But when Prometheus finally comes online, they are given full-on Atlantean star fighters to use, and take down the Zentari flagship. The Zentari retreat.\nInto the Void: Princess Zandra begs the Heroes to save her. Fortunately, the Earth Coalition Government agrees that the war should be taken to the Zentari while Humans have the edge. The characters, aboard Prometheus, begin a journey across the galaxy, hopefully generating goodwill as they go and learning a bit about the common roots of Humans and Zentari.\nFinal Destination: The journey across the galaxy continues until the Heroes reach Zuma and confront Emperor Vokos. The battle culminates in the Imperial Palace, where the characters can rescue Zandra, but Vokos escapes \u2013 and it becomes apparent that the fabric of the universe is cracking!\nEndgame: It turns out Prometheus is also essentially a 'key', and the prison holding back the Akuma is being unlocked. Not only must the Heroes free Zuma from Emperor Vokos, but they must also find a way to keep the Akuma from returning to the universe and destroying the galaxy once and for all.\nInstead of creating a new space opera setting to run Twilight Continuum, GMs and players will only need the 6-book adventure set and a Savage Worlds core rulebook. However, the adventure storyline and accompanying mechanics within the books will allow GMs and players to move the adventure into their favorite, existing sci-fi setting such as Mercenary Breed (published by Mystical Throne Entertainment), High Space (published by StoryWeaver), or Nemezis (published by GRAmel).\nTwilight Continuum is a very large project, spanning six books of 72 pages each. This requires a lot of funding for writers, artists, cartographers, editors and publishers. Mystical Throne Entertainment, and the writers that are part of the project, wish to present to our investors a completed project from beginning to end. We want to produce all six books along with a Kickstarter exclusive hardcover compilation. Without all six books, the project would be incomplete and GMs and players would be left without the remaining adventures they so desired.\nPlayer\u2019s Guide: Written by the entire Twilight Continuum team with an estimated delivery of July 2013, this book presents the storyline from a player character standpoint, providing the necessary background to play the adventure series and a look at the available options.\nVanguard (Book 1 of 6): Written by Curtis Lyon with an estimated delivery of July 2013, this book covers the player characters at Novice rank.\nEnemy at the Gates (Book 2 of 6): Written by The Warden with an estimated delivery of August 2013, this book covers the player characters at Seasoned rank.\nPrometheus Unbound (Book 3 of 6): Written by Darren W. Pearce with an estimated delivery of September 2013, this book covers the player characters at Veteran rank.\nInto the Void (Book 4 of 6): Written by Curtis Lyon with an estimated delivery of October 2013, this book covers the player characters at Heroic rank.\nFinal Destination (Book 5 of 6): Written by The Warden with an estimated delivery of November 2013, this book covers the player characters throughout the first half of Legendary rank.\nEndgame (Book 6 of 6): Written by Darren W. Pearce with an estimated delivery of December 2013, this book covers the player characters throughout the second half of Legendary rank.\nTwilight Continuum (Limited Edition hardcover compilation): With an estimated delivery of January 2014, this book provides a compilation of all six books into a single, hardcover print with a Limited Edition cover, available only to backers of the Kickstarter campaign. This Limited Edition hardcover will never be available to the general public.\nTwilight Continuum (softcover compilation): With an estimated delivery of January 2014, this book provides a compilation of all six books into a single, softcover print.

We are dedicated to providing this entire project in a timely fashion with a goal of having all six books done before the end of the year.

The Gaming Guide to Lycanthropes provides rules for playing were-creatures, whether afflicted, natural born, or wereblooded (lycanmarked).

This system ensures game balance for concerned GMs and fairness to other non-lycanthrope characters, but allows lycan-loving players to have the were-creature character of their heart's desire.\nThe book will include many new were breeds and new crunchy content, and it will collect available Open Gaming Content (OGC) from other sources to make this guide your go-to book for all things lycanthrope!\nThanks to Christina's experience with several Open Design projects from Kobold Press, she'll be running this kickstarter book in a similar vein, providing possible writing opportunities for those at pitching pledge levels.\nThe book's tentative Table of Contents:\n\nForeword--Wolfgang Baur\nC1: Lycanthropes and Lycanthropy (Christina Stiles)\nC2: Playing Lycanthropes (Dawson Kriska)\nC3: New Lycanthropes (a dozen or more; authors, OGC, and wereshark patrons)\nC4: Wereblooded and Related Races (Ben McFarland, authors, OGC, and pitch-level patrons)\nC5: Lycanthrope Traits & Feats (authors, OGC, and pitch-level patrons)\nC6: Lycanthrope Archetypes and Prestige Classes (authors, pitch-level patrons, OGC)\nC7: Lycanthrope Magic and Magic Items (Wereapprentice)\nC8: Lycanthropes in Your Campaign (Wereapprentice)\nC9: Lycanthropes in Published Campaigns\n     ...in SpirosBlaak (Steven Trustrum)\n     ...in Midgard (Wolfgang Baur)\n     ...in Vathak (Jason Stoffa)\nC10: Dave Gross Short Story\nWereraven\n\n\nSTRETCH GOALS! \nHere are the project\u2019s additional goals.

A lot of people (writers, developers, editors, artists, layout persons, and printers) are involved in the completion of a project like this, and for most involved, game production is a part-time endeavor. Therefore, the day job and life matters come first, so potential bumps could include team members getting hit up with everyday problems that, unfortunately, delay the project. Still, our less-than-ambitious delivery date should provide us the necessary time to overcome any unexpected hiccups.

Cthulhu/Interface Zero crossover sourcebook and adventure!\nDon't let these great deals pass you by!\nSome of you might be new to this part of the sprawl, and you're probably wondering, \"What is Interface Zero anyhow?\"\nGood question my friend.\nLike it says in the short description at the top, IZ (that's short for Interface Zero) is a sci-fi/cyberpunk game set on Earth in the year 2090. Interface Zero is powered by Pinnacle Entertainment's Savage Worlds Deluxe System.\nIn this dark and grimy world of corrupt, power-mad government, greedy megacorporations and fringe science-gone-wild, you play ronin: rogue street operatives who make their living doing the things nobody else can, or will, do. You have no master, no loyalties beyond your bank balance, tomo. Your only friends are those of convenience. Your tools of the trade are computer code, high-powered weapons, combat drones, cybernetic augmentations, mental powers and maybe even a little bit of luck.\nIn 2090, the line between human and non-human has blurred to the point where the word \"human\" is little more than an abstract concept. \nFully-sapient androids walk the streets alongside vat-grown simulated bio-forms. These bio-forms are known as simulacra, or \"sims\" for short. The science of hybridization allows anyone with enough cash or credit to splice her DNA with anything from a beetle to a rhino. The human genome has been hacked, kouyuu, rewritten to suit the latest fashion trends.\nSo, which face are you going to put on before you go out tonight?\nThe internet of 2090, more commonly known  as \"The Deep,\" is a vast ethereal matrix of interconnected cloud networks that we access via a cybernetic implant known as the Tendril Access Processor, or TAP for short. The TAP is a wireless modem for your brain, providing constant access to the hyper-real world around you. Of course, that constant access has a downside, tomo.\nPeople can use your TAP against you and hack your brain. They'll steal your personal information and empty your bank account before you even knew you were hacked. Heck, some brainers can even swipe your memories and sell them on the black market, so watch your back. Be sure and get the latest mods and firewalls installed, or you might wake up one day and find you no longer remember the world around you.\nOur technology has increased to the point where we can augment our bodies with cybernetic implants, or even completely replace body parts.  Most of these, such as the Tendril Access Processor, help us in our daily lives. Of course, there are other reasons to get \"cybered,\" omae. If you want to stay at the top of the food chain, if you want to get the best jobs the mean streets have to offer, you need an edge. Cyberware gives you that edge.\nAs I see it, the only real reason to do a second edition of a game or setting is if you can make said game or setting better. And that's precisely what we are doing with Interface Zero 2.0. We think we can improve on the first edition, while at the same time bringing you much more setting material so you can go even deeper into the world as it exists in 2090.\nInterface Zero 2.0 is going to be at least 200 pages long, but stretch goals may take the book as high as 300. It really depends on how much more you want to see. IZ 2.0 will be a full color, hard back book, and will be printed through the Drivethrurpg's digital print program. Below is a small list of the new material you'll find in the book.\nCharacter Archetypes: You'll see an array of archetypes modeled after the Archetype packages found in the Streets of Bedlam RPG (Thanks Jason!).\nAdvanced Hacking Rules: Hacking 2.0 went a long way towards streamlining the rules found in the first edition, but they didn't address elements of Interface Zero involving virtual reality, hacking weapons, or vehicles, etc. So we're adding some advanced rules which will give your team's hacker more utility in the game.\nYou're going to see new gear, more vehicles including mecha and power armor, new weapons, purchasable androids (robot minions, anyone?)\nStreamlined cyberware rules.\nStreamlined hybrid creation rules.\nWe're adding rules for mecha creation to the book.\nWe're bringing in rules for dubbing, so you can make a virtual \"backup\" of your mind, just in case you catch a bullet between your eyes. Hey. You never know.\nMore NPCs and threats for you to use in your Interface Zero 2.0 game!\nMore information about the world, including cities such as London, Christchurch, New York, Denver and Philadelphia!\nThere will be a full-length plot point campaign, and numerous Savage Tales to keep you and your friends busy for a long time to come!\nOne of my favorite things about a Kickstarter is the idea that you can get some pretty cool stuff when you back a project, and I wanted to make sure that you all come away from this experience feeling like we treated you well. We can't do this without you, and I want to make sure you know how much I appreciate your trust.\nThe first thing you should know, is that everyone who backs this project will get electronic copies (when applicable) of all the stretch goals as they get unlocked!\nAdditionally, ALL BACKERS will get access to the play test PDFs as soon as we make them available!\nUPDATE!\nWe're adding an explorers edition to the options you can choose from!\nGutter Punk:All Backers at the Gutter Punk Level can get a copy of the explorers edition of the book (the standard edition, not the limited edition) by adding 25 dollars to your pledge!\nDrone Jockey: All backers at the Drone Jockey level can get a copy of the explorers edition of the book (the standard edition, not the limited edition) by adding 20 dollars to your pledge!\nStreet Samurai or Higher: All backers at or above the Street Samurai Backer level can get a copy of the explorers edition of the book (The standard edition, not the limited edition) for only 15 bucks! \nNote: The above options are obviously only if you actually want both the hard cover in regular size AND the explorers edition. Some people won't want that option, instead preferring just to have the explorers edition. You'll be given the option to choose which size you want when you fill out the backer form at the end of this kickstarter.\nShipping: I'm embarrassed to say it, but I forgot to add shipping costs when I posted this section on the explorers edition. I'm handling this in the same manner as Shipping for add-ons.  \nInternational backers (only) please add 7 dollars to your pledge to cover shipping and handling for the explorers edition.\nThis update it NOT retroactive, so if you have paid for the explorers edition of Interface Zero 2.0 before  January 23, 2013 you DO NOT need to add anything to your pledge.\nAs a backer, you get the option to add the following rewards to your pledge. The items below can be added to ANY pledge - just increase the monetary amount of the pledge, but keep the same reward tier.\nFor example, if you backed at the Street Samurai pledge level (a minimum of 50 dollars), but you also want the cards and Bennies, you simply add $10.00 for the bennies, and $10.00 for the cards to your pledge level. This would make your modified pledge level $70.00.\nMiniatures!\nWe're doing the add-ons this way so you can choose exactly what you want without having to worry about getting the stuff you don't want.\nFor a single random miniature, just add 6 dollars to your pledge.

Here's how:\nIf you order multiple items, take the  associated cost of the highest add-on and add half the shipping cost of your other items to that number. Odd numbers should be rounded off to the lowest number.\nSo, if you ordered 2 novels, a set of bennies, and one hard cover book, you would need to pay a total of 9 dollars for shipping and handling.\nThis is not retroactive. If you added any of the above add-ons to your pledge before January 22, 2013, YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO ADJUST YOUR PLEDGE for those orders.\nWe've got a ton of great stretch goals planned for you.

Check out the FateRPG Yahoo Group and the Google Plus Fate Core Community.\nFate started as a \"house rules\" project for the Fudge system during a car ride Rob Donoghue and Fred Hicks had back in 2001. After seeing some success with it in their home games, they created a free, downloadable version for anyone who cared to grab it. They figured a few dozen people would have a look. Instead, hundreds did, and it fast became one of the most popular variants of Fudge out there, spawning its own thousands-strong discussion list and eventually helping to launch Evil Hat as a commercial game company.\nFrom there, Fate grew into new revisions and iterations, showing up in Evil Hat's own Spirit of the Century in 2006 and the Dresden Files RPG in 2010 (each one leading to a temporary shortage in the supply of Fudge dice as demand spiked), as well as dozens of third-party Fate games and a few other popular games that borrowed ideas from Fate, if not the whole system.\nToday, Evil Hat is proud to bring you Fate Core: the latest evolution of the Fate role-playing game system. Inside you'll find refined, clearer language about every part of the game -- ranging from streamlined language about aspects and skills, to a unified approach for game actions and outcomes, to our trademark, rock solid GM and player advice.\nSimply put, Fate Core is the best version of Fate we can possibly make, built upon over a decade of play and design experience by Evil Hat, and with the Fate player community at large, taking the best lessons from all of gaming and distilling them into a cohesive, compelling whole. \nWith Fate Core, you'll be able to drive right to the heart of your characters, using simple-yet-deep rules to make the most of those stories. Throughout, you'll use Fate Core's mechanics to model how fiction, not physics, operates, producing an experience that's better than \"realistic\" -- it's authentic. \nAfter the kickstarter campaign concludes and the game's text, art, and layout are finalized, the PDF of Fate Core will be made available to everyone on a \"pay what you like\" scheme. We'll also be selling a printed version of the game, and will use the system to power upcoming games like the Atomic Robo RPG. \nUpon publication  we'll place near to 100% of the Fate Core text into the Open Gaming License as open content, once again continuing our commitment to supporting third party efforts to build the Fate games everyone wants to see.\nIn the meantime, as a backer of this Kickstarter campaign, you will get immediate, early access to the laid out text of Fate Core as it currently stands (see the link right below the video). You will have the opportunity to tell us what you think, and help us determine the final shape of the game. \nIt's an exciting time for Fate, and for Evil Hat, and we hope you'll join us as a backer, a fan, and a member of the Fate community. Let's rock this thing!\ncover art by Kurt Komoda\nWe've set the project timeline on this to the maximum because we want a solid two months for our backers to have a look at the Fate Core preview, give it a whirl, and let us know what they think. We'll be iterating through the feedback you give us in that time to make any necessary tweaks to the text and the layout.\nAs project funding progresses, we'll continue our efforts to get the art buy and execution put together for Fate Core. At launch time we don't expect to have all of our art done, of course -- but we believe in getting a head start when we can afford to do so. Depending on complexity and speed of execution, art creation and placement into layout may run past the end of the Kickstarter campaign; we're giving it about a month.\nOnce the art is in and the text and layout are final, we'll charge hard on getting the print run complete. We'll be going with one of our established, fast-on-execution-and-quality domestic book printers for this. Setup and proofing will eat a week; manufacture shouldn't run much longer than a month, if that.\nAfter that point, it's all about shipping, which is probably the most potentially elastic part of our timeline. But we'll be shipping out the copies we owe to all of our backers before we put the book on sale anywhere else. \nSigned copies, consultations, and fudge dice will take a bit longer to get out there, due to the added steps involved.\nThe PDF: As a backer of this project at any level, you'll get immediate access to the early preview PDF (see the link at the top of this page, under the video) before the kickstarter campaign even concludes.The final PDF that will be released after the conclusion of the kickstarter will be available on a \"pay-what-you-like\" basis -- which includes free for those so inclined. (But folks who don't back this project will have to wait a few months before they'll get to see that.) We're doing this because we want you to see what's already been done -- and for you to get a chance to provide us critical feedback that will improve the game in its final form.\nThe HARDCOVER Book: Those backing at $30 and higher will receive a 6\"x9\" formatted hardcover, black and white interior version of the Fate Core rule-set, with a page count somewhere in the lower 300 range. Shipping in early spring 2013.\nThe Digital Expansions: Backers at $10 or higher will get access to a digital expansion pack that starts with a fantasy adventure playable with Fate Core. Our stretch goals on this kickstarter will add more expansions into that pack at no additional cost to the backers! The higher we soar, the more awesome the expansion set gets. After the kickstarter concludes, each individual PDF in this expansion pack will sell for about $5 each, so this has a chance of being a real steal.\nUNLOCKED: The Fate System Toolkit Book: A $20 HARDCOVER book containing the Magic System Toolkit and other unlocked \"system-tinkerer's\" content. See Update #5 for how to add this to your pledge. Shipping sometime in summer 2013.\nUNLOCKED: The Fate Worlds Compilation Books: A two-volume set of softcovers for $30 total containing the non-Toolkit expansion content from the Fantasy Adventure on up through Camelot Trigger. See Update #5 for how to add this to your pledge. Shipping around mid-spring/early summer 2013.\nUNLOCKED: The Fate Accelerated Edition Book: A $5, 32-ish page softcover book containing the very basics of Fate for fastest learning and use. Shipping by early spring 2013.\nUNLOCKED: Sally Slick and the Steel Syndicate: A $15 softcover, 200-ish pages, of the Young Centurions-set young adult novel by Carrie Harris, shipping late in 2013. \nUNLOCKED: Strange Tales of the Century: A $40 softcover by rockstar nerd-researcher Jess Nevins, hundreds of pages, filled with pulp character archetypes and timeline material to bridge the gap between Spirit and Shadow.\nFred's Fudge Dice Stash: Folks who pick a reward that includes Fred's Stash will get four fudge dice of one random color (i.e., all four dice will be the same color, and that color will be picked randomly) included with a signed-by-Fred copy of the Fate Core book. The six colors include the three bronze, copper, and gold tones of Grey Ghost Games' Olympic Fudge Dice set, and the translucent red, translucent blue, and glow-in-the-dark yellow-green of the no-longer-available Wizard Fudge Dice set that Evil Hat produced.\nFred's stash includes the largest quantities of the front row pictured here (the Wizard dice), and a smaller number of the back row (the Olympics). We will try to take requests if it seems feasible, but can't offer any guarantees about the color you'll get. Supplies will dictate!\nThe Consultation: Got a particular thing you want to do with Fate Core for your home game? We'll pair your ideas with an Evil Hat approved expert who will help you sort out your Fate Core implementation for your home game, and will also write up to 2,000 words so you'll have an official reference document to work from. Part of your contribution will be used to pay the experts for their time and wordsmithery. You'll share rights to the document with Evil Hat, or we can simply agree to enter it into the available open content surrounding Fate Core (assuming it's viable for us to do so) -- your call. This will be carried out either by a Skype call or an exchange of emails (or a mix of both), as fits the schedule of those involved. If it turns out your ideas exceed what's feasible in 2,000 words, consider this a starting point rather than a total solution -- but we'll do our best to cover the essentials!\nFeel like you need a spreadsheet to figure your pledge level out? We've got a Backer Pledge Calculation Sheet right here!\nBig Blue Box\nWe have a number of stretch goals in mind. Below, we reveal some of the ones that lie ahead. Stay tuned for updates as the project continues to learn of more!\nKABOOM!\nWhat am I getting?\nThe Fantasy Adventure (Tower of the Serpents): When our project hits its first funding goal, we start the roster for our set of digital expansions with a fantasy adventure playable with just a few friends, some dice, and the Fate Core rulebook. This will be written by Brennan Taylor, author of the Bulldogs! Fate game published by Galileo Games. [Learn More][Preview & Playtest]\nKriegszeppelin Valkyrie: Our first stretch goal travels to a mini-campaign set in a World War One that isn't quite like you read about in the history books. You play the multinational barnstormers and daring fighter pilots of the era, crewing the biggest airship that ever flew, as you take on the forces of a mad scientist and his army of galvanic automatons. It's one part pulp, one part Battlestar Galactica, and100% high-flying zeppelin-and-biplanes action, from Evil Hat's own Clark Valentine. Once unlocked, the Valkyrie will join forces with our EXPANSIONS package for our backers. [Preview & Playtest]\nMagic system toolkit: In one of our earlier incarnations of the Fate system, Evil Hat co-founder Rob Donoghue lost his damn mind and included a chapter of over half a dozen different magic systems for use with the game. With this stretch goal, Rob will create a new supplement doing exactly that for Fate Core to be added to our EXPANSIONS package for our backers. This will be included in our Extras Toolkit (see below)! [Learn More] [Preview & Playtest]\nMultiple electronic formats: You've made us commit! We will release the final electronic version of Fate Core in multiple formats -- PDF, ePub, and mobi (for Kindle) at the least.\nWild Blue: From Bulldogs! co-author Brian Engard comes this setting of six-guns and superpowers, monsters and outlaws and keeping the peace on the frontier. It's a dangerous world out there, but opportunities abound in the Blue Lands for those willing to help themselves. You're one of the Queen's Wardens, a newly inducted recruit into the land's most elite law-enforcement team, a team made up entirely of Powers, people born with unique capabilities beyond those of the common folk. You're a superhero, a law-bringer, a Warden. But all power comes with a cost, and being a hero is never without danger. [Learn More] [Preview & Playtest]\nCourt/Ship: The court of Louis the XV of France was a weird place. He had a place called a \"Deer Park\" where he kept a stable of young mistresses, he kept his court in the cramped and weird living situation of his palace, and from all reports lived a crazy and decadent lifestyle. Women would come to court to become his mistress to gain a title and lands. This was also the time of the \"gentlemen scientist\" when there was growing interest in science and technology, as well as new systems of government. Into this environment... an alien invasion begins. This Fate Core expansion by J.R. Blackwell will explore themes of identity, hierarchy, and what it means to be human. [Learn More]\nHardcover upgrade: It's our first mega-stretch goal. We've gotten a lot of inquiries about a hardcover option for Fate Core. When we looked into it, it wasn't terribly workable as a partial thing, where some books would be softcover, others hardcover. So with this stretch goal, we're gunning hard for hardcovers -- hit this mark, and we'll be able to add enough extra cash to the print budget to make the whole Fate Core print run a hardcover affair, while keeping the same cover price of $25 that we would have charged for the softcovers!\nBurn Shift: From the Mindjammer mind of Sarah J. Newton, a post-apocalyptic vision of the future! The Age of Space is gone, blasted to atoms in a devastation which buckled continents and boiled seas. Now the sky flickers with many-colored lightning and roiling clouds, and the air is heavy with poison. Twisted by strange energies from forms already geneered beyond natural adaptation, the remnants of posthumanity struggle to survive in the ruins of a once-glorious civilization. But for every one who succumbs to the curse of the Wounded Earth, another thrives with the Burn Shift -- the new power which gives survivors an edge in this harsh and nightmarish world. Where most post-apocalyptic RPGs stop, Burn Shift starts: it\u2019s not about wallowing in the devastation, but about pushing through it, reforming and rebuilding communities, going beyond... Whatever the future will be, it won\u2019t be like the past. [Preview & Playtest]\nFight Fire: Fight Fire expands Fate Core's handling of objective hazards, answering the common question \"the warehouse has the On Fire aspect... now what?\" Not only is this answered -- literally -- but it is enhanced and expanded in the form of a mini supplement that tackles both the day-to-day operations of urban firefighters (using tactics cribbed directly from the FDNY) and their lives off the clock. Raised in a firefighting family, Fiasco author Jason Morningstar takes Fate Core in a direction that tempers hard-researched realism with drama and danger. [Learn More]\nNo Exit: From writer Shoshana Kessock, take a journey into psychological horror, \"Lost\" style. Characters find themselves living in an apartment building they can't leave, and must come to terms with who has put them there and what they did to deserve it. Dark truths will come to light, in No Exit. [Learn More] [Preview & Playtest]\nThe Ellis Affair: In May of 1923, an American businessman dies while abroad. Investigators are dispatched to try to make sense of it, and uncover a hidden world of conspiracy, diplomacy, and covert operations gone awry. Who was Earl H. Ellis? Businessman, or spy? Was his death accident, or murder? And why was the last man to have contact with his ashes found catatonic and weeping while clutching them to his chest? It's up to you to solve this real-events-based mystery from author Lisa Steele. [Preview & Playtest]\nCrimeWorld: Leverage television show head writer (and series co-creator) John Rogers uses his extensively-researched knowledge of cons and capers to craft this sourcebook for running grifts and heists in your Fate Core games. Use CrimeWorld to run a game in the world of the ultra-criminal, or apply it as a toolkit to give added depth and adventure to confidence games and thievery in any game based on the Fate Core RPG system. [Learn More]\nFate Core Dingbat Font: In the final digital release, we'll include a font (used to create the little pictures you see next to the headers on this project) that sports the icons for the four actions, icons for fudge dice, and strings-of-boxes you can use to create a stress track quickly. Maybe more!\nWhite Picket Witches: Small towns are cauldrons full of family secrets. In Salem, those cauldrons bubble over. Inspired by paranormal cozies like Practical Magic and the Witches of Eastwick, White Picket Witches give the players magic and charms to deal with small town pressures... and sometimes, the forces of evil. It's about accepting the past, fitting in, or breaking out. It emphasizes friendships, brother/sisterhood, community, and a touch of romance. Designed by Filamena Young of Machine Age Productions, who has worked with Margaret Weis Productions, White Wolf, and many others. [Learn More]\nTimeworks: \"Want to have developed the iPhone? We can make it so that your firm had the idea before Apple. Want to get rid of a tricky rival? We'll make sure his parents never met. After all, it's only murder if someone gets killed. Not getting born doesn't count. Our time technicians are experts at moving the timestream in revenue generating directions. We're discreet, careful, and always on time. After all, we know you expect the best. Timeworks. Making time work for you.\" From game designer Mark Diaz Truman. [Learn More]\nExtras Toolbox: We'll take the Magic System Toolkit and absorb it as one chapter -- then go beyond the field of magic, doubling (or maybe even tripling) the word-count, to create the Extras Toolbox, a series of collections-of-extras that will illustrate in greater depth how to construct full add-on options for your game. Each collection will be viable as a plug-and-play addition to your game, if it turns out to be a fit. We'll look into exploring ways to implement powers, vehicles, gear, and more, with a few system-tweaks and variants for extra spice. If funded to this level, we'll also be taking your suggestions -- and maybe even contributions! -- to make sure this covers, at least lightly, all the \"gear-head\" topics you're hungry for. [Learn More]\nAnd better yet...\nExtras Toolbox IN PRINT: ...Backers at $30 (\"The Book\" level) and up will also get the option to add more to their pledges to get a printed copy of this book.

The One and Future King returns to a solar system filled with battles between knights in 80-ton armor on the field of honor.  Duel a Venusian princess for her hand. Hunt outlaws in the asteroid belt. Travel to Earth to joust for a seat of honor next to the High Orbit King. Star Wars Saga Edition writer Rob Wieland remixes Arthurian legend and big stompy robots in a setting featuring courtly intrigue, duels of honor, and XTE-78 Lancepack missile launchers. [Learn More] [Preview & Playtest]\nCreative Commons for Fate Core: One of the things we've done with Fate Core is write the rules up from scratch. This got us the clearest text possible. It also meant that absolutely none of our rules text uses text written by someone outside of Evil Hat. With that kind of ground-up ownership of the text, it frees us up to do more than just the Open Gaming License (OGL) if we want -- and the most popular other-license request we've gotten over the years has been for some kind of Creative Commons licensing alternative. With this goal funded, we'll put the time in to make that a reality -- we will choose a commercial-friendly, non-viral license that fits our vision for others using Fate Core (likely CC-BY), and provide documentation for how to properly follow the license if you decide to go that path with your own derived material, as well as protocols for commingling your CC-derived work with others' OGL materials if you happen to design like Frankenstein.\nMore Words for the Toolbox: We'll add 10,000 words (about 30-40 pages in the 6x9 Fate Core format) to the wordcount budget for the Extras Toolbox if we hit this goal.\nCompilation Book for all non-Toolbox Expansions: If we hit this goal, all the expansions up to this point (from the beginning, up to Camelot Trigger) that aren't in the Extras Toolbox will get bundled together in a softcover compilation book that will ship at least a few months later than Fate Core. Our rough estimate suggests this will be a 6x9 softcover book with at least 300-400 pages of content -- bigger than Fate Core itself! [Learn More]\nAll Expansions in Multiple Digital Formats: All the expansions will be released in ePub and mobi (Kindle-friendly) formats as well as the originally-promised PDF.\nEven More Words for the Toolbox: We'll add another 10,000 words (about 30-40 pages in the 6x9 Fate Core format) to the wordcount budget for the Extras Toolbox, putting us at a minimum of 40,000 words all told (~130-160 pages), about half the word count of Fate Core itself.\nShadow of the Century: The Spirit of the Century setting moves forward to 1984 -- where the world is poised on the brink of explosive technological advance... and the end of all things! If we hit this stretch goal, we'll put Shadow of the Century on the 2013 development docket, all backers at $10 and up will get the PDF of this project when it completes in late 2013 or 2014. [Learn More]\nDeck of Fate: We'll put the Deck of Fate into production in 2013. You can learn much more about the Deck of Fate in Update #9!\nHardcover Toolkit: If we hit this stretch goal, all copies of the Fate System Toolkit will be in hardcover instead of softcover -- at the same price!\nFate Accelerated Edition: At this stretch goal, we will produce Fate Accelerated Edition: a compact (32-ish pages) lighter-weight version of Fate with all the dials cranked towards ease of use and learning. Fully compatible with Fate Core! When we hit this goal, backers will have the option to add to their pledges ($5 per copy, plus shipping charges as needed) to add a copy of the printed version. The electronic version will be made available on a pay-what-you-like basis, just like Fate Core.

If you have any for us, please ask in the comments, and we'll do our best to give you an answer quickly. You can also follow us on twitter at @EvilHatOfficial and on Facebook.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvil Hat is an experienced RPG publisher. We've produced multiple printed role-playing games in a variety of physical formats over the past six-plus years. This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise -- and as with any project, experience tells us a few problems and bugaboos likely will.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Art: The art could take longer to execute than we're hoping it will, or could simply manifest in a fashion we find unsatisfactory (requiring a 'do-over'). Artists are people with real lives and those lives come with schedule-complicating problems. If any delay looks like it will be short, we'll likely roll with it, and we'll let you know what's up. If it looks like something long, we have an assortment of other artists we've worked with over the years who we know can execute quickly and on-time for a deadline.\n\nThe Text: While the editing and layout of Fate Core is largely done, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several Fate-savvy writers available if we need a fix, and our editor is also our layout guy, so making changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: Our company has grown up alongside the big boom in digital short-run printing technology. Thanks to the advances made there, we'll be able to print the softcover, affordably, in any quantity we need. We're also adept at working with domestic hardcover suppliers to get product quickly. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, or simply goofing up the manufacture or shipping of the books in some way. With a number of potential domestic printers to use, we'll always have a back-up we can go to in the event that our first choice printer has to be set aside. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and our other projects, Evil Hat is a -- for the game industry -- perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already spent $10,000 on getting Fate Core to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

It's a great way to get our RPG setting products in front of 600 retailers who don't know we exist and at least as many gamers who probably don't either! Obatron Productions is in the final stages of composing Tunse'al Setting Guide (TSG) in both Savage Worlds and systemless formats. \nWe're creating a product specifically for FRD, Tunse'al Quick Starts and Side Tracks (TQSST), as we wrap up our debut product. With this project, you'll have the chance to get them both, plus many other accessories to enhance your play. The Tunse'al Setting Guide contains world information, character creation details, and a bestiary. Tunse'al Quick Starts and Side Tracks contains encounters to launch campaigns from or to insert into the middle of something you already have started. Both are available for Savage Worlds or systemless. \nSavage Worlds versions include familiar formats for stat blocks and indicators for Wild Cards. The systemless format uses tables designed to help you gauge how difficult a situation or creature is, as well as how experienced a player character or non-player character is in order to make it easier to apply your system's mechanics to our setting.\nTunse'al Setting Guide in the Savage Worlds format will be supported in Wild Card Creator, which was a successful Kickstarter project earlier this year. Journeyman Games is behind it.      \nSnapshot of What Makes Tunse'al Different from Other Fantasy Settings\nWe know of other settings that have some elements that we have, but none that have put together the mix that Tunse'al presents.\nHonor is everything largely because money does not exist; the global society is tribal, they might do trade, but there is no currency, so the only thing that gets you accepted, respected, or elevated is your honor; those at the top of the tribe are generally revered; the idea of what is honorable varies, though - to some, it's doing what you say, to some, it's fighting fairly, to some, it's doing something you don't want to do for the sake of another, to some, it's having the most kills - it all depends upon the tribe. \nThere are five great tribes, each having its own, many lesser tribes; the land is so vast, relatively few of the lesser tribes have seen others belonging to different greater tribes; there is relative peace, but lesser tribes sometimes war against each other and even the greater tribes have had past conflicts.\nThere are no humans. None. Nada. There are two races, the Gelid and Gales, who have strong similarities to humans, but they have striking differences. The tribes are largely composed of one race due to physiological restrictions and vast distances, not merely because they look different from each other. Still, some manage to overcome the environmental difficulties to be part of a very different tribe.\nMagic is not innate; all have the potential to either learn it or have prayers answered by the gods, but either happens only through the practice of the language of magic, which very few people know. \nMining ore is taboo, so metals are rare, limiting technology to those things that can be made from other material; that's one reason there are no coins. \nMoney does not exist, but commerce does via trade; that means Tunse'als have to be motivated by something other than money; it also means groups who like to incorporate interpersonal skills as part of the story line have an easy way to do that most any time since there is some degree of \"what's in it for me\" or \"why would I want to do THAT\" in accepting challenges.\nThe world really is out to get you; surviving a land where humanoid-like beings, ahem, co-exist with dinosaur-like beings, a slew of wild animals, nasty insects, and dangerous plants is not easy; there are no roads and few serious, stable paths; and the races' physiology works against them when they leave their normal environments (just watch someone from a tropical environment in the middle of a snow storm or someone from a frigid area simply walking down the road on a 95 degree day with 30% humidity to get an idea of what we mean by that!). \nOther things that aren't typical in fantasy: The Kresh are genderless and known to experience reincarnation; the Korrin have very few inhibitions regarding societal expectations and are the only people who can make a ship take flight; the Gales are largely nomadic and sometimes enslave their own people; the Gelid are largely driven by a desire to learn and lead the way in developing the language of magic; and the non-playable Skin Eaters have to eat skin to survive even while covertly trying to convince others to join their preparations for their goddess' return.\nSkin Eater\nMore Text for Those Who Like DETAILS\nTunse'al is a tribal, fantasy setting in a world very different from our own. There are five dominant races, four of which are playable. The Gelid are blue-skinned diplomats and scholars who find paths across the rugged Baarek Mountains; the Kresh are the amphibious conservationists of the swamps who, from their homes in The Wetlands, have vowed to protect Tunse'al; the Korrin are the large, red-skinned, two-horned people of great passion who dwell in the jungles of The Footlands; and the Gales are the desert folk sporting weathered skin, nictitating membranes, and an uncanny knack for navigating the sands as they roam The Drylands.\n\nThe fifth race, the Skin Eaters, is a twisted version of the Kresh, created by the same goddess who created the Kresh, but not before she had gone quite insane. The Skin Eaters being an enemy is one thing all the other races can agree on.\n\nThe races presented are not all that's different from what we see on Earth. Tunse'al is a super continent, thousands of miles wide and tall. Tunse'als have two suns, three moons, and all the havoc such a celestial set-up plays on a planet. Magic exists, coming either from the deities or from the land's resources themselves. Then there are the ferocious reptile-like beasts, saurs, that make Tunse'al their home, too. From trees that look as if they touch the sky to mountains that actually do, to plants that can kill by touch and fey that are sometimes friendly and sometimes horrifying, Tunse'al is a place where honor is everything, money does not exist, and the world really is out to get you!\nOne Possible Version of a Play Mat\nWe want backers to have something before FRD in June, so we're offering many rewards including Tunse'al Setting Guide that will be ready much sooner than that. In fact, you can get your hands on TSG in PDF format before we even start to sell it online! If you support us at that level, you'll get a link to download Tunse'al Setting Guide within a couple of days of the close of the fundraiser. Everyone else has to wait until November 30 to buy theirs. \nAs part of the Free RPG Day program, we MUST wait until July 1, 2013 before making Tunse'al Quick Starts and Side Tracks available anywhere else.You'll notice several estimated delivery dates prior to July 2013. Those are the estimated dates of the item in each reward level that would take the longest to fulfill other than TQSST. We'll send links for all other PDFs as they become available. All items requiring physical shipping will be mailed together once all items from a given tier are ready, excepting TQSST, which will ship in July.  International shipping varies greatly. To avoid inaccurate cost projections, we'll handle those on a case-by-case basis. Just send us a message, please.\nAs is tradition in RPG Kickstarters, we have stretch goals! We also have some add-ons that we'll reveal once we get halfway to our goal. One nice thing about Kickstarter is that you can alter your pledge prior to the funding drive closing.\nAt-A-Glance Rewards Summary\nAt-A-Glance Reward Summary! Don't forget, you can up your pledge to cover add-ons not included in your reward level.\nAdd-Ons\nTo add an item onto your pledge, simply add the amount needed for all of your add-ons to your pledge. PLEASE keep track of what you want so when you get the survey at the close of the project, you'll know what to choose. If you'd rather send us a message with your choices, we'll try to keep up with that, but the best thing to do is track it yourself so there is no confusion or missed messages.\nIf you are pledging at a level LOWER than Kresh or Korrin, also add the specified amount for US shipping to your pledge, if applicable. Add only the highest shipping stated (so, if one item says $3 and another is $5, add $5 NOT $8). \nAdd second version of Tunse'al Setting Guide PDF so you get both Savage Worlds and Systemless, $10\nAdd second version of Tunse'al Quick Starts and Side Tracks PDF so you get both Savage Worlds and Systemless, $4\nAdd a set of 20 wooden tokens, great for Savage Worlds Bennies or to keep track of a variety of stats in other settings, $6 (add $3 for US shipping if nothing else being mailed, add $1 more for every two sets ordered)\nAdd Tunse'al T-shirt, $15 (add $5 for US shipping if nothing else being mailed)\nAdd Tunse'al mouse pad, $10 (add $5 for US shipping if nothing else is being mailed)\nAdd Tunse'al Setting Guide print (Color cover, black and white interior, specify Savage Worlds or systemless), $25 (add $5 for US shipping if nothing else is being mailed)\nAdd a Printed GM Screen (Heavyweight, color, double-sided), $5 (add $5 for US shipping if nothing else is being mailed)\nAdd d6 with Targ head (16mm wooden die), $2, (add $1 for US shipping if nothing else is being mailed)\nAdd Tunse'al Map (8 1/2\" x 11\", color, laminated), $5 (add $5 for US shipping if nothing else is being mailed)\nAdd Tunse'al Player's Guide PDF (specify Savage Worlds or systemless), $3\nAdd second version of Tunse'al Player's Guide PDF, $2\nAdd Tunse'al Player's Guide print (Color cover, black and white interior,specify Savage Worlds or systemless) WITH PDF, $10\nFor RETAILERS Only: Add Tunse'al Player's Guide print (Color cover, black and white interior,specify Savage Worlds or systemless) WITH PDF code, $5\nFront of Token\nBack of Token\nStretch Goals\n\"Gimme\" Stretch Goal: Once we hit $1,251, yes, just ONE dollar over our goal, everyone gets a PDF of Tunse'al bookmarks. ACHIEVED! :)\nWe're down to the last few days. If we break through our funding goal, then we'll show \"Achieved\" across any stretch goals we make.\nS-T-R-E-T-C-H Goals", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest risk to our project is that it doesn't get funded! We'll still sell Tunse'al Setting Guide online, and we'll still make Tunse'al Quick Starts and Side Tracks, although TQSST probably won't come out so quickly. It'll mean we miss a huge marketing opportunity that has the potential to open a lot of doors for us. That would be horrible since it takes a lot to get retailers to order \"unproven\" products from new publishers, and we'd really like to be in stores and on shelves sooner rather than later.\n\nSome possible challenges to the project are all about fulfillment. If our dice supplier, play mat maker, or printer are late with anything, then we'll likely have delays getting stuff to you. If anybody changes costs drastically after the fact, then we risk having less money to work with than we expected, but you will still get your orders, even if that means we have to alter the exact product in some way. \n\nWhen it comes to stretch goals, it's certainly possible that after the close of the fundraiser some folks' payments don't go through. That could affect our ability to buy what we'd need to make good on those goals. We would do everything humanly possible to avoid alterations after the fact, but the reality is that we have no way to predict how many folks might have payment issues when we're done. Hopefully none that won't get resolved in a few days! If the worst happens, though, we'll figure out alternatives to the goals' prizes and keep you informed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "A New Kickstarter from Obatron Productions", "update_content": "A New Limited Time Kickstarter - Foreshadows of Another Life  \nAs part of our successful Kickstarter for Retribution Setting Guide, we are creating our first stand-alone fiction piece, Diaries of Agador, to be released as part of our Obatron Fiction line, which in turn is being accelerated with our in-progress Kickstarter for Foreshadows of Another Life.

To even look upon his form may cost you your sanity. He has lain beneath the waters for eons, and will continue to do so until the stars align, whereupon he will awaken and reclaim dominion over the Earth. \nUntil such a time as he awakens, Albino Dragon will be channeling the pantheon of monsters and mysticism from H.P. Lovecraft (The Call of Cthulhu & other stories) so these horrific, tentacled, anthropomorphic monstrosities can invade your next card game in a complete, official Cthulhu-themed Bicycle playing card deck. \nMost of the characters in Lovecraft's stories only witnessed statues of Cthulhu, but that was enough to drive them insane. Imagine what mayhem and entropy may be unleashed when other players attempt their best poker face while squaring off against a handful of masterfully-painted cards featuring the will-crushing visage of Cthulhu.\nThe Call of Cthulhu - Channeling The Great Old Ones\nShane Tyree (the artist) and I (Erik Dahlman, CEO of Albino Dragon) have worked on a lot of projects together, but as long as I have known Shane he has revered the work of Lovecraft.  As a result, a great deal of the art Shane produces tends to take on a darker tone, and I have to ask him to lighten it up a bit.\nBut not this time!  I fear I've quite literally unleashed a monster, as Shane has been given carte blanche.  Creative freedom has shown us here at Albino Dragon just how deep the rabbit hole goes into the darker corners of Shane's twisted imagination.\nThe result is one of the most beautiful, amazing, and horrifying adaptations of the Cthulhu mythos that we've ever seen.\nThe Cthulhu playing card deck is printed by the famous United States Playing Card Company, featuring 56 poker-sized cards with custom faces that bring the Cthulhu mythos to life.  Depending on your pledge level, your deck(s) may include some or all of the following features\nIntricately designed Cthulhu playing card backs\nOne of a kind court cards\nUnique tuck box\nEvery playing card is Cthulhu themed \nCustom Jokers\nMagic finish that allows \"bikes\" cards to handle smoothly & last longer than cheaper playing card decks\nUnique gaff card with multiple uses for card tricks\nA double-backed gaff card\nYour own likeness on one of the playing cards\nNot to mention the Cthulhu playing cards will feature nightmarish renditions of some of the most popular beings from Lovecraft's dream-inspired tales.\nAzathoth - King of Spades\nCthulhu - King of Hearts\nDagon - King of Diamonds\nNyarlathotep - King of Clubs\nJust to name a few!\nArt Prints Available (Add $8 for each)\n1st Edition Design\n1st Edition King of Hearts Design\nNyarlathotep\nH.P. Lovecraft - still to be colored\nBook Cover\nCthulhu Playing Poker\nThe Haunted Queen\nThe Ghoul\nView the full t-shirt image here\n\nThe attention to detail and the design of a complete deck of poker-sized Cthulhu playing cards is no small feat.  Without Kickstarter it would be difficult for us to honor Lovecraft properly and bring such a beloved mythos to its fan base in this form.  We turn to you for support in the hopes that we're not the only ones who would love to see the looks on the faces of players when this deck comes out of the box for play.\nAs we raise additional funds we will be introducing stretch goals with upgrades that include custom seals and finishes to enhance the quality of the printed decks.  Your pledges will ensure that we can deliver a higher quality deck of Cthulhu playing cards than we ever could have done without the support of the Kickstarter community.\nGet Cthulhu-ized!\nWhat's even better than owning the Cthulhu deck? How about being a part of it? A few supporters will get to submit personal photos to us, and Shane Tyree will use photos of you to create one of 4 horrific Cthulhu face cards utilizing your likeness.\nThe perfect gift if you know someone who adores Lovecraft, Cthulhu, who collects unique playing cards\u2026 or if you'd just like to see your mother-in-law depicted the way nature intended.\nThe Stars Have Aligned & You've Heard The Call!

Inside each tube is a green limited edition Call of Cthulhu deck and a signed Cthulhu art print. \nIf you live in the United States, you can take one off my hands for only $35, but here's the catch: you accept the tube as is. These were the first ones that we packaged so you can see from the photo that they are taped to the inside of the tube. We found that sometimes they would break away from the tape and slide around the tube, causing damage to the print (and sometimes the corners of the tuck box).
