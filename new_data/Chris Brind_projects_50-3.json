[{"backer": "Chris Brind", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "They say the pen is mightier than the sword, and WOWSTICK miniature pen-shaped hand drill is probably a designer\u2019s great friend, helping them to drill and put their imagination into shining works. It is the world's first one-piece miniature electric hand drill for creative DIY, and it features super lightweight, ultra-quietness and great portability.\nFinish your DIY projects with the right tool kit is important. WOWSTICK hand drill helps drill small holes of various things: resin, plastic, wood cardboard, paper cardboard, crafts, model making, aluminum / copper sheet and foil, etc. Aiming at its practicality and simplicity, WOWSTICK is the cordless lithium-ion battery powered drill which is crated just like a pen, an ideal tool for DIY-ers as well as general people.\nNo more clunky gadgets, wires, and plug-points. WOWSTICK one-piece miniature hand drill with its dispatchable head lets you accomplish your creation by gripping up, aiming at the point, and pressing one single button.  \nThe WOWSTICK drill is small and light, just 1.6oz (46g) which fits right in your hand and literally easy to carry anywhere, so you can take it to distant workplaces. Sized at 6.8\u201d*0.6\u201d (172*13.8mm), you can grip it like a pen for ultimate control and precision as well as for comfort.\nIt is not only a great tool for DIY projects, but also a hassle-free decoration to put in your pocket or on any desktop.\nEvery bit of WOWSTICK from outside to inside (Except the button and the charging port) is all metal CNC machined to ensure the seamless curves and consistent product quality. Greatly standing out from the conventional drills in the market, this manner is more precisely made to achieve more stable product performance. Our drilling spindle run-out is far exceeding the industry standard to be less than 0.1mm, resulting in high-precision drilling at the right position every time.\nThe WOWSTICK kit has 8 drill bits made of harden steel: 0.8mm, 1.0mm, 1.2mm, 1.4mm, 1.6mm, 1.8mm, 2.0mm, 2.2mm and it allows drilling at 420r/min \u00b1 10%, so you can use it in many projects and get accurate results.\nThe handheld device is practically designed to cater for different needs, letting you plug in and off bits based on your projects, and the fact that the bits are fully compatible with 2.35 mm diameter bits accessible in the market, you may drill, decorate and attach your crafts freely.\nThe bits can be used on a variety of materials: resin, plastic, wood, clay, bead, crafts, model making, aluminum / copper sheet and foil and more, very practical items in daily life.\nThe WOWSTICK hand drill is ideal DIY workers like in the drilling industry and general people. It will be a good addition to your artisan inventory. It particularly suits those who perform intricate decorations. You can use the mini drill for making holes, for crafts and more applications.\nUse Tips:\nIt is suggested to take in and out alternatively when drilling, so that the residue can be brought out without getting stuck.\nYou may test it on the spare material before use. When there is no issue, you may start drilling holes in your crafts.\nOn harder metal materials,  it is suggested to start with a smaller bit and then shift to a bigger one when it is aiming at a large hole.\nThe smaller the drill bit is, the more attention should be paid. Due to its small size, it is easy to break off when used improperly. \nNote: Be careful of the operation when you are using a finer drill bit since it is easier to break off. You may perform intricate drilling of valuable materials with its unique low speed optimization.\nWOWSTICK mini drill is more than easy to operate. With just one button built at the position of your thumb when you are holding it, you may just start working with a press on the button. When a pause is needed, you may release the button. \nTo replace the bit is also a breeze based on our particularly designed screwless locking mechanism. It is fairly intuitive and no extra tool is needed. Just gently rotate the chuck out, take out the drill bit, put in a new bit, and then secure it. The process can be accomplished within 10 seconds.\nAfter finishing the works, you may put on the drill cap to avoid accidents caused by unintentional pressing of the button. So it is a hassle-free device.\nThe drill has a built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery so that you don\u2019t have to worry about the distance between the wall plug and workbench or troubles caused when you forget to unplug the power cord. It provides a safe, effective, clean energy, less stressful operation option. It is cordless, tailored pen-shaped designed and operates at 3.7 volts, 1.036Wh. That said, it can be used for at least one month in regular use at its full charge.\nWOWSTICK mini drill is rechargeable via USB type C charging cable. Full charging time is about 40 minutes and can be used about 2 hours.\nWOWSTICK is the sturdy, high quality handheld tool for DIY projects. The whole body is aluminum alloy one-piece molding, giving the most simplified look, comfortable grip and sturdy and durable in use.\nThe motor of the mini drill has also been heat-treated for endurance, so it can continue to work without getting heated for a long time. You will never complain about its quality build.\nWOWSTICK designers have been digging out the maximum abilities of the pen shape. From installations to actual working, creators always like to use the device instantly from idea to prototype and thus may get inspirations at the fingertips.\nIt comes with an improved ergonomic design to ensure comfortable grip in any situation. Using the aluminum alloy shell, it is ultra-compact and light, slim and very easy to handle for detailed projects. Holding it like a pen, its slim grip makes great sense in detailed works. As a result, no matter walnut or resin, you may just focus on the fun of making things.\nGo experiment with the WOWSTICK\u2019s easy drilling. Go ahead and grab your creativity now!\nThe Imezing team consists of a group of designers, engineers and seekers of quality life. Back to simplicity and convenience are our core concept.

They see that you are a Materialist, Xenophobe, and Militaristic Avian Species from a dry world run by an Imperial government.\nEra: Each game is called an Era and lasts about 2 hours. After an Era, you can play the same civilization immediately in a new Era or store and save your civilization in the game box to continue playing later. Each Era you play with a civilization will let you develop them further and explore deeper story lines. A player can also skip playing a Session with the rest of the group and come back in a later Era to continue playing their civilization.\nWinning Eras: You win an Era by being the first to complete a number of communal Objectives. The first player to complete their Objectives wins and the Era ends. The winner will gain an Era Reward that progresses them towards ascension.\nAscending: Your ultimate goal is to Ascend your Civilization. On average, this should take you 6 Eras to achieve. Your Civilization will ascend the game in victory, then does not disappear, but adds new content to the Galaxy for all players to discover! You can then begin a new Civilization with benefits from your ascended one.\nCrisis: As your Civilization approaches Ascension, you will gain the attention of powerful Crisis entities and forces that will threaten the entire Galaxy. If you take too long to Ascend, your aging Empire will encounter an enemy that even your mighty Empire might will fall to.\nGalaxy in a Box: Stellaris Infinite Legacy will let you and your friends build and tell the story of your own galaxy that will grow and change with every Era. You will play civilizations that will expand, ascend, and fall, each adding to and changing the game based on the choices you made.\nYour Story Begins: With your first game, you and your friends will venture into a brand new galaxy that is vast and full of wonder.\nGAME PLAY\nA game is played in Rounds, each of which is composed of 4 Phases. The Rounds are repeated until a player wins the Era.\nDuring a Phase, you will chose to Explore, Expand, Exploit, or Exopolitics. Each player has four Phase Boards, one for each of the listed phase types.\nIn the First phase of a Round, all players secretly choose ANY one of their Phase Boards. Nobody knows which Phase Board their opponents are planning! The players then simultaneously PLAN which Actions on their chosen Phase Board they want to take, spending each Action's required Resources and Leadership from their Reserves. Once everyone is done planning, they will one at a time RESOLVE their Actions. When done resolving, each player flips their Phase Board over to mark that they can not use it again this Round.\nIn the second Phase of the Round, all players will again secretly choose one of their remaining Phase Boards. They all simultaneously Plan their Actions and then one at a time Resolve them.\nAt the end of the Round, once all 4 Phases have been resolved, the players refresh their Resources and Leaders, flip their Phase Boards to their unused sides, and a new Round begins. \nPHASE BOARDS\nClick on the Explore Phase Board below to open a pdf describing each Phase Board. (Note, Kickstarter has a character limit for this campaign page.)\nClick on this image for more Phase Board details.\nStory Paths\nStellaris Infinite Legacy is driven by Story Paths that you develop through your decisions and actions.

Full of LEDs, smarts and no larger than regular dice, they can be customized to light up when and how you desire. Incredibly strong, smooth and sharp, they work for several hours at a time, after which you can simply recharge them with the accompanying case. Pixels know which way they roll and can communicate with your phone or tablet via Bluetooth. This means they will work with Roll20, Foundry or any one of your favorite online platforms.\nPLAY\n\nDepending on the design you select, the LED lights will either shine through the entire face (Midnight Galaxy and Aurora Sky) or only through the numbers (Onyx Black and Hematite Grey).\nPLAY\n\nBecause of all the electronics and the battery, Pixels tend to be slightly heavier than regular dice of the same size. As a result they feel really nice in your hands, sound like proper dice, without being nearly as heavy as metal dice.\nAurora Sky Pixel next to a few other types of dice\nWe\u2019ve put a lot of effort in Pixels to make sure they are just as easy and convenient to use as regular dice. We\u2019re really excited to have been able to fit all the electronics inside such small packages.\nOnyx Black Set next to other types of dice.\nPLAY\n\nDice are made to be rolled, tossed, thrown and dropped. Fortunately, Pixels are really strong and don\u2019t expect you to be careful handling them; all the electronics are encased in very tough resin. Your Pixels will last for many years!\nBecause Pixels are cast in resin, there are no screws, no flaps, no parting lines anywhere; the dice are perfectly smooth! Programming and recharging the dice are both taken care of wirelessly, a significant technical challenge in such a small form factor, but one that we strongly believe was worth it!\n In fact, Pixels are fully waterproof! :)\nPixels are, above all, great dice for your table games. This means that balance and fair rolls are just as important to us as all the fancy electronics inside. We have dedicated a lot of time, design and testing to make sure they are as fair as possible. With a combination of small counterweights and precise attention to the finish of our edges, we\u2019ve already made Pixels surprisingly well balanced. And of course we will continue to improve the balance before release.\nPLAY\n\nFairness comparison with well-known brands (Comparison Data Credit of Mark Fickett)\nPixels speak Bluetooth. This is how the companion app communicates with the dice to reprogram them. It is also how the dice communicate back with the app to report what you rolled. In this early version of the app, we use the functionality to have your phone play sound effects based on your rolls.\nPLAY\n\nHowever the Bluetooth protocol used by the dice isn\u2019t proprietary, and many other apps will be able to talk directly to the dice as well. We are already in talks with D&D Beyond, Roll20, Foundry, and a few others to integrate Pixels directly.\nPLAY\n\nAnd while the dice can connect to your phone or computer for extra fancy features, that is not at all a requirement. Once you\u2019ve customized your Pixels, you can put your phone away and just use them for as long as you want. Or until you get tired of the color scheme and decide to try something new ;)\n\nIt was very important to us that Pixels be \u2018dice\u2019 first and foremost, and that design philosophy extends to the software side of things as well. They are just as easy to use as any other dice. Just pick them up, roll them, and they\u2019ll light up! That\u2019s it.\nThe dice use a small rechargeable battery. The battery, while absolutely tiny compared to a typical cell phone, is large enough to power the dice for several hours. In fact, in our tests, we\u2019ve averaged 5 hours of use on a single charge. And if you only use Bluetooth but don't have the dice light up, then you can easily record more than 20,000 rolls on a single charge (Check out the video in the Balance section).\nPLAY\n\nOnce your session is over, Pixels will recharge conveniently in the accompanying case. Every single Pixel will come with its own charging case, and every set will come with a larger one.\nPlace the die in its case. Make sure the highest face is up (20 in the case of the D20) and it will recharge in an hour or so.\nThe lid of the case contains a small magnet that will prevent the dice from turning on and lighting up during transport. Don\u2019t get us wrong, glowing pockets are cool and all, but not being able to flex your flashy dice isn\u2019t; we wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\nBattery Voltage over ~1000 rolls.\nThe To-Go case next to the standard individual case.\nAny 7-dice set you get will come with a To-Go carrying case. This larger case has its own battery, and room for 8 dice. It will be able to recharge all your dice 2 or 3 times before needing to be recharged itself. Great for when you are not necessarily close to an outlet or if you just want to keep your dice topped-up while you play.\nPLAY\n\nThe case will let you carry any set of dice. Want a full set? No problem. Need to have 8D6 for some reason? You got it! The case and individual chargers both use the same insert system, so you can customize the dice layout as much as you want.\nPLAY\n\nPixels are completely customizable. Thanks to the accompanying app, you are in control of how the dice light up. Want to create a quick colored theme? No problem! Prefer a colorful set of patterns instead. Go right ahead! Using the accompanying app, you can control exactly how the dice light up and when.\nPLAY\n\nUsing a Condition -> Action system (similar to IFTTT) you can describe exactly under what condition you want the dice to light up or even your phone to play sounds (if connected).\nPLAY\n\nAt any time you can easily preview your creation directly on a die and make sure the result is exactly what you want.\nRoll20, Foundry and D&D Beyond are all working with us to ensure Pixels are supported on their platforms.\nWe are also discussing potential integration with Fantasy Grounds.\nIn addition to the planned Official Integrations, we are committed to keeping the Pixels' API completely Open Source and available on Github.\nAll of Pixels Software and Firmware code is available on GitHub.\nThis means that even if we are not supporting your favorite platform directly, you will be able to use 3rd party integrations, or even better, write your own.\n\nPixels will allow developers to write their own apps, and do that even for commercial purposes. If you are interested in writing games / apps / integrations that use Pixels, consider one of our limited Devkit D20 Addons.\nIf you are a developer, grab one of the D20 Devkit Addons and receive a sample shortly after the campaign ends.\nAlthough every Pixel can be used as a Dev Kit, if you grab one of those addons, you will receive an Early D20 so you can get a head start on development.\nPixels are not only Open Source, but also Open Hardware! Pixels wouldn\u2019t exist without the open-source and open-hardware communities, and so we think it the right thing to do to share our work as well.\nPixels Design Files are also Open Source\nMost of the design files are already available on Pixels Hackaday.io project page, along with multiple prior prototypes and documentation of our adventures getting to the final versions of the dice.\nThe \"core\" of a D20 Pixel\nIf you are interested in using Pixels, have a question or suggestion for future updates, or just want to show your support, stop by our Discord!\nThis is also the place were we tend to share the most up-to-date developments. \n\nPixels have also appeared in the following publications:\nPixels use RGB LEDs that are individually controlled to give you the most flexibility possible. Choose dice that will either glow entirely (brighter overall), or only through the numbers (more readable when lit) and let your creativity decide how they light up. \nClick on the image below to check out high-res pictures of all the available designs.\nHead over to the Pixels website to see High-Resolution pictures.\n\nCan't quite find the exact combination of dice you need? Add one or two more singles to your pledge. \n Eager to start integrating Pixels with your app? Grab one of the limited Early Devkits!\nAll the rewards consist of a combination of Single dice and 7-dice sets. For instance, if you pledge at the 1 Die level, you get 1 single die. If you pledge at the Set level, you get 1 set. If you go for a 2 Set + 2 Dice, you get 2 sets and 2 singles. What those singles and sets are is up to you! You get to pick the size and design of each.\nIf you are not able to get exactly the combination you want from the rewards, we will also offer Addons. Want a Standard Set with 2 extra dice? No problem: Back at the Byte level and tack on an extra Single die! All Addons will ship at the same time as your rewards.\n\nNot sure which level to back at? Here are some suggestions:\nPlease note that the rates below are estimates, exact shipping costs will depend on your country and shipping speed. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first physical product that we will be bringing to market, so there is no question that many challenges are still ahead of us. This is why we have been working with a manufacturing partner to help us through the process and pair us with reputable and reliable manufacturers. At this point, we have two manufacturers lined up and able to begin production.\n\nBased on the feedback we got from factories, we expect to ship rewards in 12 months. However, please understand that this is an estimate. While we hope start delivering rewards sooner, we fully expect to have many issues along the way, no matter how hard we try to avoid them, and so it possible that it will take us longer to finish production. After all, getting this far was anything but easy and there is no reason to think that things should change during production! :)\n\nWe are, however, committed to making Pixels a reality and to keep the entire process transparent. This was a passion project before it was a product, and seeing the excitement spread throughout the community has almost given us a sense of duty to making flashy-connected-dice happen in the open. We think they are amazing, and we want to put them in your hands!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Thanks", "descp": "We will put your name in the code base and in the official Pixels app as a thank you for your support!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}], "stat": ["98 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1 Die", "descp": "Get one individual die of your choice.\nYou will be able to select the exact die size and design through the backer survey after the campaign has concluded.\nWe will also put your name in the code base and in the official Pixels app as a thank you for your support.\n* Please note that shipping will also be charged after the campaign has concluded and will be based on your location.

Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact.\nThe story is yours to tell in...\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Dungeons, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe, Potions & Perils, components shown below.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nThe Potions & Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!\nMixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

The Let\u2019s Dig for Treasure, Let\u2019s Summon Demons, and Don\u2019t Talk to Strangers games will immerse you into these hilariously dark retro worlds. Featuring clever and beautiful fan-favorite artwork, each game is a wild romp through the parallel Rhodes universe. The games are quick to learn and are created for 2-6 players, ages 14 and up.\nDynomite Games is an old-school sub-brand of Cryptozoic Entertainment. With a diverse portfolio of licensed and original IPs, Cryptozoic\u2019s catalog covers a broad spectrum of tabletop games and collectibles including Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards and the DC Deckbuilding games.\n\nWe've made simple, streamlined game engines (with very little set-up time) so that anyone can dive right in--but we've seasoned the games with enough hidden depth and unique design space to satisfy all of you hardcore gamers too!\nCheck out a brief overview of each of these games:\nIt's the funky-freshest Push-Your-Luck experience out there, for the whole family! Just shuffle up the deck and divide it into 3 \"Dig Stacks\" and you're ready to start digging for treasure!\n1. On your turn, choose and \"dig up\" a card from any of the Dig Stacks...look for cards worth a lot of points, or cards that trigger a powerful effect, such as stealing a card from another player!  \n2. You can stop digging at any time, or keep digging up cards for as long as you want...the more cards you dig up before you \"stop,\" the more you stand to gain--but be careful--if you dig up a 2nd Worms Card, or even a SINGLE skeleton card, your turn will end immediately and you'll lose *EVERYTHING* you dug up so far (this turn)! \n3. Once an entire Dig Stack is empty, the game is over and players add up the total point values on their cards!  Be sure to look and see if you scored any \"bonus point\" effects (you did make sure to dig up some Milk to go with your Cookies, right?). \n4. You've got all kinds of zany stuff to find while digging: Loyal Dogs (protect you from a Skeleton!), Sewer Lines (worth negative points--give it to your least favorite opponent!), heck, you might even transcend death with The Crown of the Lich Lord, or turn those pesky worms into big points with Skwirmz the Worm God! \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are little Johnny, Suzy, and Fido supposed to do when the suburban droll has them down? I know, Let's Summon Demons!  Whether you're building sadistic synergies with the \"rotten\" kids or sharing the love with the \"sweet\" kids, only the savviest (and luckiest!) player--the best Demon Summoner--will walk away a winner!\n1. Shuffle up the Demon Deck and the Block Deck, and deal everyone a Starting Candle and a hand of 3 Demons. Your goal is to summon all 3 of those little devils before your opponents beat you to it... \n2. At all times, a rotating assortment of five cards will be available for purchase (the low, low price of 3 soul tokens) to all players--this is called THE BLOCK and it has Boys, Girls, and Animals of every style and strategy! Look for cards that combo together! \n3. On each players' turn, they'll roll the dice--if any player's cards they've acquired \"match\" the total rolled then that card activates--often resulting in the acquisition of more soul tokens! More soul tokens means more cards from THE BLOCK, means even more soul tokens--but to what end?\n4. Well, you can sacr--er--discard 3 of your cards to SUMMON A DEMON! The most powerful cards of all! Once any player has summoned all 3 of their Demons --and has a balance of 10 souls on top of that--they are declared the ultimate Demon Summoner and the game is over! With all of the variety offered between the 20 unique demons and the diverse BLOCK DECK, there is plenty of content to explore and master!\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool's out but otherworldly STRANGERS are here!  Mom & Dad haven't caught on yet so you're on your own, kiddo. Play your cards as efficiently as you can, helping to navigate your Kids one at a time from SCHOOL to a SCORING space--in order to score as many points as you can before the neighborhood is completely overrun with STRANGERS!\n1. At the start of the game, each player will draw a hand of 3 cards and place one of their kids in the SCHOOL space. Your goal is to get that kid into a valuable scoring space, at which point you'll place a new kid in the SCHOOL space and repeat the process. Some spaces are worth more points at the end of the game, and some confer a unique bonus (for example, your hand size increases by 1 for each Kid you have in the Library). \n2. Remember, you want to score a good space, but you'll have to Walk, Run, Skateboard, School Bus, and even City Bus to get there! Each turn you'll play one card and draw a new card to replace it!  \n3. But watch out!  When any player draws a STRANGER card, they can abduct any kid on a \"STRANGER SPACE!\" Furthermore, now that a STRANGER is lurking in that space, it is impassable for all future movement...so you may just have to re-route your plans on the fly! SAUCER cards can abduct *any* kid--even one that has already scored--but your opponent will have to get lucky when they flip the SAUCER COIN or you'll escape abduction!\n\n\nLike what you see? Giggling with glee? Store each game together when you back all three! We personally guarantee that this sleek and convenient slipcase looks a lot better on your bookshelf than a haphazard stack of boxes!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect the game to start shipping in June 2021. It is English-only and we're shipping worldwide in partnership with Quartermaster Logistics. This game is \"friendly\" in terms of shipping (i.e., we cover customs/import taxes) to the US, Canada, EU, Australia, and New Zealand. Shipping rates are based on actual costs to ship your rewards (depending on your country) and will be charged as part of your pledge.\nPlease note: Due to COVID-19, most shippers have added surcharges to their rates. The amount we charge for shipping reflects the latest rates. In some regions, the cost of shipping may exceed the cost of the tier you\u2019re pledging for; unfortunately, this cannot be avoided. In most cases, pledging for two or three games (\u201cDouble Trouble\u201d and \"Slipcase Exclusive\" Tiers) costs almost the same in terms of shipping as pledging for one game.\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not our first rodeo!

They come with Booster Rewards built-in rather than Stretch Goals. We're definitely going to print them on our own no matter what and want you to know that up front, but are asking for your backing so we can order the right amount and most importantly, create the extras that add to the entire experience for all of us\u2014like maps, pawns, and additional Archetype Cards. We play too, and we want all these goodies as much as we hope you do!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nPinnacle is very fortunate and grateful to have a loyal and established group of friends and fans who enjoy playing our games, but it's sometimes very hard to get our products to you. We love game stores and sell to them through our fulfillment partners at Studio2 and through traditional distribution, but we also know many of you don't have a store in your neighborhood, or your local store just doesn't carry our games.\nFor those that do, great! Retailers who want in on our Kickstarters get discounted versions of the rewards including Stretch Goals for them and their customers. If you're a retailer, just sign up to our newsletter for all the details. (And gamers, please feel free to let your local store know!) Retailers also get their rewards when backer orders go out, usually several weeks before they show up in the traditional distribution chain.\nIn sum...\nIf you want Blood Drive and the extras we're offering with it, back this Kickstarter Booster.\nIf you want Blood Drive but prefer to support your local store, GREAT! You can pledge for the Digital reward level here if you like, get the Booster Rewards, then order the print version of the book from your store later next year. (But be sure to tell them or they might not order it on their own!)\nDeadlands is the premier Weird Western setting. You can download the free Test Drive, here to see what it's all about.\nIf you missed the Deadlands: the Weird West Kickstarter, you can still get in on the action through the pledge manager, which is still open. Anything you add through that pledge manager will be delivered as soon as it arrives in our warehouse in early 2021.\nYou'll be able to add these items to your Blood Drive order in the Pledge Manager.\nYou can also add on our other Deadlands products once we launch the Blood Drive pledge manager (available sometime after this Kickstarter Booster closes and funds). There you'll be able to add on extras like the Deadlands core boxed set, pawns, the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign, town maps, Action Cards, Bennies, and more!\nSpread the word!\nIt's hard for a small company like ours to get the word out about our game and our worlds. If you care to help boost the signal, you can do so using the following channels. Much obliged, amigo!\nBlood Drive is written and in layout. Your support allows us to create the extras and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the book and cards a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website  first, then through DriveThruRPG.com.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. \nWe'll charge for shipping after the Kickstarter through the pledge manager, but below is a table estimating how much the shipping will be. It's possible these prices may go down as we continue to seek out different options, but we won't charge you any more than what's listed below.\n*Prices exclusive of VAT/GST, shown in USD. We will collect and pay customs in the pledge manager. USA backers pay no additional shipping on Add Ons!\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your friends pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail Info@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box, but the Book Only tier will likely ship in a padded envelope).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead our \"Welcome, Retailer!\" Newsletter here for the basics we recommend for your store!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter products before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle products with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time).

Headed up by General P.K. Loyer, this site would bring together and train freedom fighters from worlds oppressed by the Goa'uld System Lords. \nOnce trained, these highly functional SG teams would be sent on missions to defend the galaxy and overthrow the Goa'uld System Lords. You are a member of one of these teams.\nFrom the perspective of the Stargate SG-1 TV series, our story with the Phoenix Site picks-up after the episode titled \"Allegiance\" in season 6, episode 9. The rebel Jaffa and Tok'ra come together with the Tau'ri at the Alpha Site to discover the base has been compromised. This leads to the initial authorization for the use of the Phoenix Site to bring together the best of the best from around the galaxy.\nThe world of Stargate SG-1 is perfect for a tabletop roleplaying game.

The options are endless.\nThe following are some of the unique features of the Stargate SG-1 RPG in comparison to other 5th edition games:\n\u25cf A Stargate Program Brief which details all we know in the Stargate canon leading up to season 7.

However, we have been inspired by many other RPG systems beyond 5th edition, and we believe we have brought together the best of what is out there. You will also find some very innovative mechanics of our own.\nWe\u2019d like to thank our playtesters and reviewers that have helped make the Stargate SG-1 Roleplaying Game a great game! \n\nSocial goals help spread the word about the project.

You have allowed us to make The Wagadu Chronicles even better that we thought it ever could be.\nThank you SO MUCH!\nYou can continue following the development of the game and books through our website and our social media: twitter, instagram & youtube.\nAnd you are most welcome to join our lovely discord!\nSee you in-game <3 !\n We believe that role-playing isn't always just about about grinding and growing stats. It's the embodying of a role; the presence of a backstory and all of the quirks and details that define your unique character.\nMany of us have experienced old-school role-play around a table with pencils and a bunch of dice. We know how immersive it is to speak like our characters and to be surrounded by other players who are making decisions based on their characters profiles. Role-play truly submerses you in another world, more powerfully than any NPC  quest could.\nImagine a videogame where everyone around you is role-playing. The noble Emere with whom you are travelling does not want to desecrate any tombs and ignores the loot; the Swala hunter you just met chants a ritual prayer before every hunt and the Asiman merchant never attacks or kills anyone because she believes her goddess wants peace to rule in Wagadu.\n\n\n For the first time in gaming history we are building an online game 100% tailored to role-players, from lore to mechanics.\nThese are some of the community features that we are implementing to create this unique environment:\nContinuous releases of free lore material.\n In-character role-play as a default for all players when in Wagadu's servers.\nOff-world lobbies where players can get technical support or any role-playing tips on how to act out their character before returning to the actual game world.\nRewards for groups of players that engage in interesting and well thought role-playing.\nWe intend to keep the space safe from harassment and trolls who want to disrupt other people's story and the role-play environment - we are spending a lot of energy on this and will have a number of moderation tools that we and the community can use.\n We have already started building our community on Discord! We chat about the setting, role-playing games and even have a Wagadu role-play coffee-house channel <3 Join our Discord!\npre-alpha footage\n\n The tabletop RPG books of Wagadu are crucial to this project because they flesh out the lore in a way that a videogame can't. If you want to truly experience and understand role-play in Wagadu, you'll have to take a look at the lore that is in the books. If you decide to focus only on tabletop role-play, your input and user generated content will affect the development of the MMO.\nWagadu is an ecosystem of tabletop and videogame, which can be experienced in different ways depending on personal taste.\nExcerpts from our free teaser 5E lore book\nWagadu is a strange place where different types of people fall from another world and have to fight to adapt and survive. Behind the scenes a lot has been done to create this world. We believe that role-playing thrives when the setting is well fleshed out and interesting.\nThe approach taken to create this fantasy world was: \"What if Tolkien were black?\". Just as Tolkien did, a lot of time was spent researching the mythologies and traditions of people, but in this case across the African continent. The result is seven \"lineages\", which are similar to fantasy \"races\" but more nuanced, with overlapping cultures and more fluid identities.\n\nMany of the lore elements, including some crucial elements of the setting such as the conflict of lineages with slavery or the \"Dwen\" spirit-children, are inspired by diasporic experiences of black people both in the Americas and in Europe.\nTo make this fantasy world more authentic we have been in contact with experts such an Africa biologists for the various biomes and  African elders for village lore.\nWe are sharing a free 300 page guide to the world of Wagadu, that be can directly downloaded here: \n\nWagadu's role-play and immersion are so important for us that we built the MMORPG mechanics in tandem with the lore. In the Wagadu Chronicles, world-building and gameplay strengthen each other.\n We are building something that has never been seen before in any MMO, a special cinematic mode called \"Dialogue Mode\". This is a mode that can be triggered when two or more people chat with each other. It allows for close ups and the use of many animations (from emotions to little show-off spells) you can basically create your own little live show with friends or strangers as you explore and role-play your character's story.\npre-alpha footage\n The 5E setting adapts the usual class system to Wagadu, the MMO takes a freer approach.  You have skill \"presets\" that look like traditional \"classes\" but you can freely break away from that and build your own warrior-oracle or farmer-chef, nothing stops you.\nYour character is made up of skills that go from 1 (beginner) to 5 (master), every level unlocks more advanced uses of that skill.\nThere are dozens of skills to choose from, we have many of them nailed down already but we will be looking for feedback (especially from our backers) on what additional skills to add during alpha and beta. Some examples from the current skill set are cartography, divination, archery and animal husbandry.\nEvery day, every player receives a free bundle of experience points (called \"Memories\") to invest in skills. No grind required, so you're not penalised if you decide to become a travelling merchant, a coffee-brewer or a tailor: you'll level up just like your mercenary friend.\nA special feature of The Wagadu Chronicles are \"ancestral blessings\". Throughout Wagadu, Ancestors leave skills for players to pick them up, these skills last from a few minutes to an hour and unlock some random power anywhere in the skill tree (and sometimes even completely unique powers that belong to NPC Ancestors). So your Daa'ima bodyguard character may well be able to breathe underwater for an hour or to heal everyone for 15 minutes!\npre-alpha footage\n Just as in other sandbox MMOs, we will leave the economy in the hands of the players. If there are only a few Fire Asimans in the game who can craft fire potions, these will become rare and expensive and people will have to travel more to find where to buy them.\nMost items in the game can only be crafted by other players, loot and NPCs will provide only a few basics.\nMany items, from pots to clothes, to weapons, can be customized by in-game editors if you have the right skills. No two robes are the same in The Wagadu Chronicles! You can sign your creations and even become a famous in-game designer (and ask higher prices). \nAdditionally, every item can be lost or stolen when you get slain - be careful!\n\n\n\n Surviving Wagadu requires interaction with Spirits and Ancestors of all types. Obtaining wood in Wagadu for instance, usually requires interaction with a Tree Spirit. You can convince it to give you some wood by making the right offering but also by behaving in ways the Spirit likes: if in the last few days you have planted and watered seeds in the farm, the Tree Spirit might be more generous to you. If instead you are holding an axe, the outcome might even be a battle. Navigating Spirit requests is made even trickier by the fact that different resource Spirits have conflicting requests and things that they love/hate.\nIn Wagadu, NPCs remember what you do and act accordingly. Your actions matter.\nAnother little peculiarity of The Wagadu Chronicles is that your character has a couple of \"hidden background\" traits: these are features that you inherited from an ancestor (such as descending from an Elephant-Spirit) and that are hiddenly assigned randomly at character creation. Spirits might react upon them, and discovering your hidden backgrounds can be an exciting role-play story and create unexpected bounds with other players.\npre-alpha footage\n\nTotems are central to every player's game, since they:\nact as spawn point.\nprovide healing & safety.\nbestow perks (e.g. farming bonus).\nallow to place player housing.\n  Groups of players can turn an unclaimed  wilderness Totem into a Village Totem by giving it recurrent offerings. This allows players to place housing around it. The type of offerings the Totem asks for varies based on its personality: one might request  30 calves to be born, another Totem might just ask for money.\nThe Totem requests vary slightly every week and a Totem's personality affects the village's players' gameplay and goals.\nPlayers can make offerings to additional wilderness Totems to add them to their \"Totem Pantheon\" and get their perks. When two different villages compete for the same Totem, a \"Spiritual Challenge\" ensues in which the highest bidder wins.\nSheer strength does not always mean victory. A Totem might request that the whole village never goes hunting, so that Lionblood village might give it a pass and let it be claimed by the peaceful clan of farming players that live in the next island.\n\n The Music of Wagadu is heavily inspired by a combination of African traditional instruments and with western RPG tunes. We aren't just building a refreshingly new soundtrack, we are also creating new associations based on African traditions, such as playing Ghana's bamboo-flute funeral dirge for death-related gameplay and Mali's Dogon bull-roarer for spiritual and ancestral summoning.\n We are collaborating with established traditional Ghanaian musicians such as Dela Botri and professors of the Department of Music of the University of Accra in order to make Wagadu sound truly authentic.\nFor the voiced parts of the game, we will be collaborating with black voice-actors, such as the iconic, Abubakar Salim (\"Bayek\" in Assassin's creed Origins) whose amazing voice features in our Kickstarter trailer.\nRecording sessions at Kay Boni's Cafe Abajo in Accra, Ghana\n\nTwin Drums is made up of a team of established game developers. We have worked for some of the biggest franchises and gaming companies out there. We have experience of working on different platforms and we are bringing all of these different perspectives into our game development. And yes, we are half black and a third queer: that\u2019s our secret super-power.\nTo make sure that The Wagadu Chronicles gets all the support it needs, we have partnered with League of Legends developer Riot Games - they have been amazing with us and we are very excited about this collaboration.\n\n We have some funding and support from a big developer. The Wagadu Chronicles is happening. The reason why we are here is because your support can help us improve the game by increasing our development budget and by joining us in this development journey with your feedback and participation.\nBeing able to see how many of you care about role-playing and afrofantasy and getting your support will help us make The Wagadu Chronicles the best game that it can possibly be!\n Please note that the price in USD is an approximation based on the original price in Euros since Twin Drums is based in Europe. Prices in USD may vary depending on the USD to EUR exchange rate.\nBear in mind that shipping costs have not been included in the pledges and will have to be paid subsequently. \nWe are currently collecting data and negotiating with our suppliers in order to get the best deal for most countries and we will be able to provide exact shipping charges closer to shipment!\nSome pledges provide multiple versions of  in-game items as a rewards. This is very special because all items in Wagadu can normally be lost or stolen at death (\"full loot\") but these backer reward items are \"bound to your soul\", they cannot be looted. Since we will not be producing them anymore by game release, their value will constantly increase and they will become very rare, expensive and recognisable in the game. It's your choice if to keep them, sell them or gift them to your closest friend.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk is that we are a small team making a relatively big game.

Corey?\nDo you like dice?\nThen you have docked at the right station!\nLast year Green Ronin published The Expanse RPG and this Kickstarter is to fund dice sets for the game. Sure, you can play The Expanse with any old six-sided dice, but now you can declare your allegiance to Earth, Mars, or the Belt with these Expanse dice! If the campaign does well, we\u2019ll offer exclusive Protomolecule dice as well!\nWe have once again partnered with Q Workshop, who previously produced our Dragon Age and Blue Rose Dice Sets. They make beautiful dice and we know their work will be stellar. \nAs you can see, the dice have already been designed. Earth, Mars, and the Belt each have their own set. We just need to fund the production and determine how many of each set to make. This is where you come in! We don\u2019t know if we should produce an equal number of each set or not. If OPA ranks are strong, we\u2019ll need more Belter dice. If a lot of you believe in the dream of the red planet, we\u2019ll need more Martian dice.\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out The Expanse RPG, you can download a free Quickstart here. You can also purchase PDFs of the game and its supplements as add-ons to this campaign. If you want print books, you can get those from the Green Ronin Online Store or your friendly neighborhood retailers.\nDice in the RPG\nThe Expanse RPG uses the Adventure Game Engine (AGE), which also powers our Blue Rose, Fantasy AGE, and Modern AGE RPGs. In AGE games, you roll three d6s when taking tests. Two of these dice are one color, and the third a different color. In The Expanse RPG that third one is known as the Drama Die and its results let you pull off cool stunts in play.\nYou\u2019ll note that each dice set has two different styles of dice. This allows you to make two complete sets of dice from each set, each with two dice of one color and a Drama Die in a different color. \nStretch Goal: Protomolecule Dice! Unlocked!\nUpdate: Our stretch goal has been unlocked! You can now get the Protogen dice as a $12 add-on!\nThere is only one stretch goal for this campaign but it's a good one! If we hit $30,000, we will also produce a set of Kickstarter exclusive Protomolecule dice that you can get as an add-on. These will come in a plastic bag (so no box) and cost $12. \nThese dice have the Protogen logo on them. Just some scientists on a hidden space station doing nothing sinister at all! \nImportant Note: Shipping!\nWe will be charging shipping on this project after the campaign ends through a pledge manager. We charge the actual amount the shipping costs and remember, game companies don't set shipping rates! \nAdd-ons\nYou can complete your pledge with PDFs from The Expanse RPG if you aren't already a player of the game. To purchase an add-on, click the Manage My Pledge button and increase your pledge manually with the total cost for all the add-ons you want. After the campaign is finished, there will be a pledge manager in which you can make a final decision on what add-ons you want (and you can add even more dice then if you want!). Note that all these PDFs are currently available on the Green Ronin Online Store and DriveThruRPG, so if you want to get them today, you can do so directly. If you choose to buy them through this campaign, you won't get them until after it ends, but as recompense they are at a discount here. \nThe Expanse RPG PDF: $25\nThis is the core rulebook for The Expanse RPG. Its 224 pages include everything you need to play except dice, but hey, you should have that covered! The Expanse RPG applies the fast-playing, stunt-powered AGE system to spaceships, solar colonies, adventure, and intrigue in the far-future. Blast off to adventure!\nAbzu's Bounty PDF: $17\nAbzu\u2019s Bounty presents six full-length scenarios designed for a new crew of characters in The Expanse Roleplaying Game. They embark on a series of adventures, from a fateful discovery in the rings of Saturn to acquiring their own ship to a deadly confrontation that could change the course of history for the entire solar system.\nGM's Kit PDF: $9\nThe Expanse RPG GM's Kit provides full-color, printable GM screen inserts with essential tables and references for game-play, as well as evocative artwork. It also includes printable color quick reference sheets that put the stunts and actions at your fingertips, a combat tracker, a set of pre-generated Player Characters, and a complete adventure to launch your crew right into the exciting universe of The Expanse!\nLegal\nThe Expanse Roleplaying Game is \u00a92019 Green Ronin Publishing, LLC.

Her crew mourned the loss of Captain Winona. The Einherjar Empire breathed a sigh of relief and returned to its abuse and tyranny. And a few impulsive men declared her a deity, worshipping the ground her buccaneer boots walked on. \nThis space opera tells the tale of a god's second coming, and of the people (and pet wolf) she left behind. God has returned.\n Jennie Gyllblad is a queer Swedish-born, UK-dwelling Comicatrix.\nCreator of British Fantasy Award-nominated Skal, Jennie is no stranger to painting the fantastical and outlandish. In By Man & Angels, though, she had the opportunity to turn her paintbrush to something both more foreign and more familiar. Based on Norse mythology, By Man & Angels draws inspiration from the full gamut of Viking folklore, and allows her to celebrate her Scandinavian heritage.\nOne of Jennie's lasting science-fiction loves is The Fifth Element. With its bold costumes and striking designs, its focus on the power and importance of love, and an occasional musical interlude, it isn't hard to see its influence in her work on By Man & Angels.\nPedro La Barba is a half-Caribbean, half-British writer, and lifelong fan of science-fiction.\n\n As a mixed-race man, Pedro never saw many characters who represented him in the science-fiction he grew up with. So, it was important to him to create a space opera where diversity existed not just through a range of colourful and exotic aliens, but through the spectrum of race, gender, and sexuality as well.\n\n Pedro's science-fiction touchstones are Farscape and Mass Effect. With its mismatched crew of outcasts, warm sense of humour, and designs that could pass for practical effects, he hopes to have paid tribute to a little of those works when creating By Man & Angels.\nThank you for taking the time to look at our kickstarter! Special love will always also go to my patrons and other supporters - You're keeping this little viking longboat afloat\ud83e\udd70", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe comic itself is already completed, so the main risks/challenges would be with the printing and postage.\n\nDue to Covid19 affecting the \"fancier\" printing methods that I use for a couple of my other comics (such as Hardcovers, Spotgloss etc) - I have made the decision to not offer any of those as potential rewards on this Kickstarter. \n\nThat's why this project may appear quite basic and \"No Frills\".

Near the Maul stands the impossible tower that houses Yara, his jewel, and his soldiers. A tower that no one dares enter, with walls polished to infinity, so no one can climb them.

There are risks in timing when it comes to any product manufactured in another country and then shipped around the world, including:\n\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThere is also the very real risk of complications due to COVID-19 that we cannot foresee.

It builds on the tense, cinematic experience Nemesis is known for, adding even more opportunities for emergent, dramatic gameplay. Become an unlikely survivor, locked in an underground base with something terrifying. Turn up your paranoia, as you try to guess what other players are up to, or what the contingency plan is. Work to learn the weaknesses of your nemesis \u2013 or run like hell. Switch off the lights in someone\u2019s lab section. Take a dangerous trek to the outside bunker. And whatever you do, be ready for unexpected!\nThe game comes with all the components needed for a cinematic Sci-Fi horror experience and doesn't require the Nemesis Core Box.\nNemesis: Lockdown offers 1-5 player semi or full co-op experience that takes around  90-120 minutes and will be different every run! This stand-alone expansion also works with majority of the previous Nemesis content: other Alien races and most of the characters. \nDuring this campaign you can also get classic Nemesis Core Box (only in English) and all the previous expansion (in 6 different Languages)! \n\nClick for more info!\n\n\nNemesis Lockdown previews \nNemesis Core Box\nNemesis: Lockdown setting\nI should have known when they asked us to prepare the landing platform. There are only two reasons to make a night sample transfer. It\u2019s either too urgent to wait, or it\u2019s a black op. Both spell trouble.\nMy survival instinct, honed by twenty years of work in the Sample-Return Receiving Facilities, was screaming, considering the rumours that reached even our remote site.\nMaybe if I bailed right there, I wouldn\u2019t be crouching in a dark lab, sweaty palms clutching a scalpel, and this damned soft voice repeating over my head: \u201cContainment Breach, Containment Breach\u2026\u201d\nThings only got bleaker when they told us there would be human BSL-5-ET subjects coming. Extra-terrestrial samples and living people don\u2019t usually mix. They SHOULD NEVER mix. Something went really bad out there, and we got caught in it.\nWhen Martinsen and Sovich processed the first sample, I only caught a peek from behind the armored glass. There was one word on the container.\n\u201cNemesis.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t there when the actual breach happened. There were screams over the intercom. The main power went out. Soon, I saw Martinsen and one of the human subjects running to me from the isolation ward elevator, as if the devil himself chased them. I\u2019ve seen it for a split second, before they were caught. I\u2019d rather take my chances with the devil, than with the thing that took them.\nNow, it\u2019s been fifteen minutes since I last heard any shots. The pain in my mangled leg subsides. I get up and slowly make my way to one of the security stations. Am I the only one left? No, thank god! Sovich is still kicking. I have her on a live feed from the main terminal. She\u2019s\u2026\nChanging the logs! Switching her name for mine. Frigging rat! When the board learns we had a containment breach, there will be hell to pay, and she wants to make sure the bill is on my name.\nNow, she turns towards the main console. In the middle of it, under the protective glass, is the A3-5 button, a big chunk of red plastic. They told us it enables the \u201cCode Red Emergency Protocol\u201d but we had no clearance to know what the protocol actually is.\nDon\u2019t do it, Sovich. You might just nuke us. Don\u2019t\u2026\nOf course she does. She wants to play the good girl, an upstanding citizen.\nWell, there\u2019s still time to fix everything. No one will call until morning. We\u2019re on a dark side of the planet now, blocking all signals. I need to get topside, to the secondary console in the other building. Re-write the logs, access the classified procedures, and see what new trouble she got us into.\nThe only things between me and my salvation is a broken airlock, a long stretch of hellish surface, and enough gamma radiation to hard-boil an egg. I\u2019m betting these things can\u2019t walk outside.\nThat would be too frigging unfair...\nGameplay details\nThis time, you are trapped inside the laboratory hidden somewhere on Mars. This construction has several floors you will be able to travel through via elevators or stairs.\nEach section of the board will have a separate power supply that can be cut off at any second. When that happens, elevators stop working, and the corridors sink into pitch-black darkness. This offers an interesting way to slow down the alien pursuit \u2026 or to trap other players.\nMovement and space management has a very different, tenser feel in Lockdown!\nLockdown will come with an entirely new mechanic called the \u201cContingency Order.\u201d It represents one of many possible emergency plans (such as \u201cnuke the station\u201d ). The only way to discover which one is active is through investigation and elimination.\nObviously, it\u2019s up to you whether you\u2019re going to share your hard-earned knowledge with other players.\nHaving a detailed energy system for different sectors of the board allowed us to put more emphasis on the light \u2013 or the lack of it. This makes room for more interactions between players and makes controlling the flow of energy through different sections one of the important elements of the game.\nThere are also items that are a source of light, but they won't last long and will require energy. You may always decide to go through the darkness, but this will make card Events more dangerous and incurs other penalties, such as using different (less accurate) die for shooting.\nLockdown comes with a set of new, freshly designed rooms that thematically reflect a secret base on the surface of Mars. It also contains a whole new set of neutral items, character-specific items, and craftable items.\nIn our previous campaign, we loved the experience of working with the community to create a new alien race, or to determine the look and professions of the crew members. This led us down a very creative path, and brought amazing, diverse ideas into the game!\nWith Lockdown, we want to follow up on this experience. In this Kickstarter campaign, you will not only be buying a game, but you'll take part in its creation too!\nNemesis Lockdown comes with high quality, non-essential companion app. It will provide many exciting gameplay modes, a dedicated soundtrack, as well as support for an advanced solo mode.\nThanks to the app, we bring new depth to solo play that will now include the \"traitor\" tension from semi-cooperative games, as you will never know if you can trust what the app tells you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded nine Kickstarter projects.

The Royal Navy has their eye on you and the more notorious you become, the more eager they are to stopping your exploits. \nAn encounter with the Navy will surely slow your progress, so you best be avoiding them. To do so, you're going to need a good ship and a great crew!\nThere's a lot of scallywags out there looking for adventure! So assembling your crew won't be very hard, but pulling together a winning crew... that's a different story.\nYour crew will play a major role in Tiny Epic Pirates. Each crew member brings different advantages to battle and to the actions you'll take. \nThe dice listed at the top of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent what number you'll need to roll to score a hit on another ship! Having multiples of a single number can result in lots of damage, but spreading your numbers out can result in more consistent results. The choice is yours!\nThe icons listed at the bottom of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent bonus actions that can chain together for epic turns! If the first icon matches your chosen action, you'll get to take the action of the second icon for free.\nIn addition to your crew, you'll have your reputation and your exploits. As you prove yourself in battle, your legend will grow and so will your ability to command your ship.\nWinning battles against other pirates, and against notable merchants, will increase your Legend Level. Each new level offers immediate benefits, as well as increases to your ship's movement and the number of dice you roll in battle.\nBut enough talk, you're no landlubber. You can learn more about Tiny Epic Pirates by engaging with us in the comments, watching the videos below, or by downloading the rulebook below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals\nIncludes 7 Plastic Ship Minis!\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Pirates, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe components shown below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Crimson Silver Mini Expansion\nThe Crimson Silver Mini Expansion introduces new Floating Fortresses and Silver as a new resource!\nPlayers are able to visit the Floating Fortresses as they move around the board and perform upgraded versions of Trade, Plunder, and Crew Up. Players may also lay siege to these Fortresses for additional rewards. But beware, the Floating Fortresses have a contract with the Royal Navy and if any Pirates show their dirty face around there, the Navy will be on their tail!\nEven with the threat of the Navy though, the precious Silver these markets are known for is simply too alluring to avoid. A lot of blood as been spilled over this Silver. So much that it's known around these seas as Crimson Silver.\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

Rumors of dead pirates returning to the sea... aboard an ominous ghost ship helmed by the legendary pirate Amdiak...\nSeveral new game elements are added to play including cursed gold, a ghost ship that haunts the players as they try to steal the cursed gold, ancient relics, haunted map cards and even skeleton crew!\nPlayers gain cursed gold by stealing it from the ghost ship and attacking other pirates who possess it. Cursed gold can be traded for an ancient relic said to hold ashes of Amdiak. Bury this relic and break the Curse of Amdiak!\nIf the ghost ship finds catches you though, your captain becomes cursed and you lose your cursed gold. Once cursed you will be able to recruit powerful skeleton crew to mindlessly obey your wicked command!\nDo you dare to set sail on ghostly waters?\nThe Curse of Amdiak expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Pirates.

Happy one year anniversary! A year ago, we were settling into a pandemic and watching the millions starting to rack up on this project. Now vaccines are being distributed, and, after spending a solid year in my house working on this beast, we're actually getting close to being done!\nThere is not a whole lot talk about this week. We're continuing to make progress on all the various fronts of this massive endeavor. The campaign elements have already been refined significantly since we started testing two weeks ago (though there is still a ways to go), artwork is coming in left and right, and we're going through all the various writing for scenarios and sections that needs to get done. Also lots of progress on the graphic design front with various cards and books.

Things are moving along over here. We just recently started play testing the campaign aspects of the game (players play through the entire campaign by sort of hand-waving the actual scenario parts of it with some simple metrics), and that is proving very helpful in refining some of the overall systems of the game, which is great.\nIt has taken a lot of effort to get to a point where all aspects of the campaign are in place (outside of some flavor text) to do this, and it feels good to finally get to these last stages of development! We've also brought some additional writers, graphic designers, and artists on to the team to get through all the work we have left in a timely manner, so that's exciting too!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #75", "update_userinfo": "Spending some time with the section book", "update_content": "Hello!

THEY are the ones in control of the signal, and it\u2019s your mission to take them down!\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a game if it were that easy...\nThere are enemies hiding in your midst attempting to sabotage your progress, and even some of your own team may not be who they say they are. As a member of the resistance, it\u2019s your job to weed out the traitors and take them down before it\u2019s too late.\nLucky for you\u2026 you have these! Now put them on, or start eating that trash can. \nThey Live: Assault on Cable 54 is directly inspired by the themes of the movie; it's rich and poor divide and the battle to control the system. The game involves collecting resources and banking them for use in the final assault, just like the end of the film.\nYour role will vary depending on if you\u2019re playing as a Human or an Invader. One will have you attempting to save humanity, the other will have you fighting to maintain your position as their overlords.\nBelow is a basic breakdown of the roles you fill to complete your mission.  \nHuman or Invader - either way, you\u2019re going to need your cunning, reasoning, and a trusty pair of Hoffman Lenses to win! \n\u201cI take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.\u201d\nThis is the exciting bit\u2026\nThe Hoffman Lenses have no need for apps, phones or a computer. Just like the movie, simply put them over your eyes to see the truth!! We\u2019ve worked closely with our production team to ensure that our art and design aesthetic works in a simple, real-world way.\nPlayers can use the lenses to inspect and uncover Invader interference in three ways:\n Uncovering hidden enemy players - Players will be able to risk their glasses and enter a PVP encounter. If successful, the winner will be able to look at the losing player\u2019s character card and see their true identity. The question is, will the others believe you?\n Uncovering enemy sabotage - Before assets enter the final assault stash, they will need to be deposited at resistance locations. As a human, it\u2019s your responsibility to check items with the glasses before they go to the stash. This will allow you to identify and discard any sabotaged cards! As an Invader, you\u2019ll need to identify the sabotaged items and sneak them into the stash- ready to thwart the final assault.\n Checking the billboards - Resistance hideouts have billboards (cards) to identify them. Each contains hidden messages from Invaders that they use to coordinate their raids. It\u2019s important to know where your items are and understand the risk of potential raids, otherwise, they may get confiscated.\nThe Hoffman Lenses are one of the most unique and exciting parts of the game. They are also one of your most valuable assets in preparing for your assault on Cable 54! Limited tokens dictate the number of times you can use the glasses, so you will need to be tactical with how and when you choose to put them on. Get it wrong, and you could be left unprepared for an emergency situation!\n Can a simple drifter rise to lead the resistance against the Invaders?\nCan a corrupt politician find redemption?\nCan a tired detective track down an elusive Invader-targeting serial killer?\nThey Live: Assault on Cable 54 allows you to play as new and exciting original characters, as well as iconic ones from the movie, in a dynamic narrative-driven board game that is full of twists and turns. Each character is fully fleshed out with their own personal adventure that fits into the world of They Live.\nThese stories are told through a unique story deck for each character. The order of their deck is randomized, and how many cards it takes to complete your story depends on your success with each. This system means a different personal-story experience each time you play.\nThese carefully constructed stories have different endings depending on if you\u2019re playing as a human or an invader. Completing them is optional, but doing so will reward you with unique character items and special skills to aid in overthrowing the invaders, or sabotaging the resistance!\nHow your personal story works:\nEach player will start with an Awakening Card at the beginning of the game. This will set the scene, explain who you are, and tell the story of how you came to know about the Invaders (although... this may be a cover story). After the Awakening Card, it\u2019s completely up to you how, when and if you uncover the next part of your adventure.\nYou must successfully complete four randomized cards from your personal story deck to experience the ending and unlock your unique character item. However, just like in real life, if you mess things up you can't go back and change it.\n Each turn is split into 4 phases. The following diagram explains how each phase works: \nThe main game will involve the players looking at their cards and knowing if they are a Human or an Invader to assume the correct role. For obvious reasons, this doesn\u2019t really work for 1 player and could even mean outnumbered play for lower player counts.\n\u2018Blind Play\u2019 will involve the player or players controlling multiple characters. All taking part in the adventure without knowing their character\u2019s allegiance. You can enter PVP and engage your own characters, using the glasses to uncover the possible enemy within. If you do find a traitor in your midst, the game will take over control of the uncovered Invader and activate a separate Invader behavior deck.\nIf Invaders in your party make it all the way to the \u2018Final Assault\u2019 they will become active and produce significant debuffs to your character and engage with you in combat.\nThis mode is currently in the testing phase with additional behavior card art in development. \nTonight is the last stand for the resistance - the enemy strikes at dawn!\nThe game contains a ticking timer that progresses towards a fixed deadline. In order to win the game, you need to get to Cable 54 and start the 'Final Assault' before the clock hits midnight.\nThe 'Final Assault' contains three story-based trials that will need to be overcome to win. Doing so will require high-level players that have been developed throughout the game. You will also need a good stash of weapons, items, and allies to be victorious.\nEach of the three trials will test your skills and require you to spend assets on improving your chances of successful dice rolls. It\u2019s during this assault that enemy players are most likely to reveal themselves and spend their sabotaged goods on halting your progress.\nWith the correct planning, the right equipment, and a little luck, you have the chance to stop the signal once and for all, and live on in legend as part of resistance history.\nIf you fail, well, things will be a lot worse\u2026\n All of the other core rules are in our attached rulebook below. This includes details on combat (PVE and PVP), actions, stats, skills and more.\nThis is a continually evolving process in terms of explaining the game in a way that is suitable for public consumption. You will see this updated throughout the campaign, and after, concluding with the finished document before release and print. \nBase game components for the standard edition of the game.\n*Please note this does not include stretch goals unless stated, all numbers could increase through through further development*\n\nAdditional cards may be added for the 1-3 player \u2018Blind Play\u2019 mode. \nAndrew Aitcheson - Co-Creator\nMovie geek and game enthusiast, who has previously worked in the education field and has designed a number of teaching aids and games for adult learning.

We are aware of the huge amount of work it takes to produce and distribute within strict timescales even in normal circumstances. With the current climate caused by Coronavirus (COVID-19) disruptions and delays have become the norm rather than the exception. \n\nAction Taken \u2013 We have already factored in an anticipated amount of delay and slowdown into our production and the projected shipping dates are currently 3 months later than they would otherwise have been. If the delays that we have allowed for do not materialize then shipping will occur much earlier than the specified dates.\n\nRisk \u2013 The technology we are using for the glasses has not been used in board games ever before, does it work?\n\nAction Taken \u2013 The polarisation technology that we are employing is one that is currently in use in sunglasses already, it just has never been deployed for the purpose of identifying Invaders among us. We work directly with our factory (and not via a trading partner) which results in much stricter control for production. We have worked closely with the production team to develop the game technology and ensure that everything works as it needs to before getting to the point of Kickstarter.\n\nWe promise to keep you informed and updated as the project develops, highlighting any potential issues, but also keeping you up to date with the first looks and latest progress.\n\nRefund Policy:\n\nWe offer a full refund, including fees, up to 14 days after the project ends. After 14 days and until we pay the production agreement with the factory, we offer a no questions asked refund minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover). Once we pay the production agreement with the factory, we do not offer a refund. If we fail to fulfill your game you are entitled to a full refund, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after 14 days may be processed via PayPal or the payment reversed through your credit card at our discretion.

An event called \"The Reckoning\" awakened an ancient evil, and you'd best hope the howls you hear on the High Plains are just a pack of ravenous wolves...\n \"The Year is 1876, but the history is not our own...\"\nThese words introduced Deadlands to the world back in 1996, spawning decades of amazing tales and memorable monsters. Now the granddaddy of Horror Western games is back with a brand new edition. \nThe cover that started it all, the original Deadlands, by Brom!\nIt's now 1884 in the official timeline. The Civil War ended in 1871 at the Battle of Washington, an epic conflagration of steam and steel. The Great Rail Wars are over as well, finishing not with a whimper but the bang of  Dr. Darius Hellstromme's ghostfire bombs at the gates of Lost Angels.\nEven the Servitors, the Reckoners' chosen champions on Earth, have been defeated\u2014at least for a while. Reverend Grimme vanished in a massive flood that destroyed his city, Raven's Last Sons were defeated by the Great Summoning, Stone was foiled in the barren expanse of Death Valley, and Dr. Hellstromme's latest scheme to open the gates of Hell proved fruitless.\nWe told the tale of the Servitors in four Plot Point Campaigns, still available and ready to play with just a little tinkering for this edition on our website!\nIn response, the Reckoners have turned their blasphemous gaze back to the grassroots of evil. They've given life to dark desires and horrible abominations that live in the shadows of the isolated frontier, far away from the attention garnered by the overt plans of their Servitors.\nThe heroes of the Weird West join with the secretive Twilight Legion in the distant outposts, chaotic boomtowns, and lonely settlements of the West to fight evil and quell the fear that gives the Reckoners their power.\nSo gather your posse of heroes and hit the trail, from the frozen north to the arid deserts of the Southwest, from the industrial East to the fractured canyons of California's \"Great Maze.\" \nThe Weird West awaits with adventure, mystery, and more monsters than you can shake a Peacemaker at.\nThink these Mojave rattlers look nasty? You should see the rest of it!\nDeadlands is the long-awaited return to Pinnacle's oldest and most popular setting. First published in 1996, the original \"Deadlands Classic\" system won countless awards and its bold, bright orange books are still a striking and valuable addition to gaming shelves the world over. \nFor those who want the whole experience, Deadlands has a rich and varied history to explore!\nDeadlands has told some epic tales since it first burst onto the scene in 1996, but you don't need to be steeped in its storied past to join in the hootin' and hollerin'. If you're an old hand, we think you'll find it both familiar and refreshing.  If you're new to the world or setting, this is the perfect time to join the wagon train (and if you've lapsed, we forgive you for that, partner). We've recapped and summarized the monumental events of the last 24 years so you can catch up.\nThis new edition is the biggest revamp of the game's background and rules since the Reloaded edition from 2005. It's been revised, rewritten, and refocused by both Deadlands Line Editor Matthew Cutter and original creator Shane Hensley.\nBack in the Saddle, by Aaron Riley!\nAll the rules have been updated and adapted to the latest version of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition. You'll need that book to play. You can add it to your pledge as an Add On if you don't already have it, or you can check out the PDF now.\nArcane Backgrounds are tightened up. Those nasty Harrowed had the same overhaul we gave them in Lost Colony (including letting the Devil out!). There are new and streamlined rules for dueling. And of course a passel of new Edges, gear, infernal devices, and powers to blast the tarnation out of the creepy crawlies coming to do your party in.\nFor you Marshals (that's what we call our Game Masters), there's a comprehensive overview of the Weird West after the events of the Servitor Plot Point Campaigns, including new plots, perils, and intrigue for cowtowns, boomtowns, and old favorites like Lost Angels, Tombstone, Deadwood, Dodge, the City o\u2019 Gloom, and a few new locales we might surprise you with! And of course this handsome tome also includes enough rascals, varmints, and critters to keep a posse busy 'til doomsday.\nThis is more than just a rules update--it's a world update! And check out that gorgeous new graphic design by Karl Keesler, with art by some of the best in the business!\nNow that the tales of the Servitors have been told in their individual Plot Point Campaigns, Deadlands is returning to its roots with more local yarns of dread, terror, and violent action. The new edition and supplements to follow turn their baleful eyes from the world-shaking events of the Reckoning to isolated frontier towns or sinister machinations in the few larger settlements. The Twilight Legion must root out the evil that lurks in all-too-human souls, the lonesome hills nearby, or the dark woods at the edge of town.\nTo showcase the return to more personal tales of horror and adventure, we've created the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign set!\nThe campaign features a single county in Wyoming and the terrors that lurk in a booming mining town and environs. Your heroes roam about the map, interacting with the locals, solving mysteries, fighting abominations, and\u2014with luck and a steady shootin' iron\u2014eventually lower the \"Fear Level.\" That's how you defeat the Reckoners' terrorforming, amigos, and Horror at Headstone Hill showcases it front and center.\nThe Horror at Headstone Hill Campaign Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands: Horror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains an introductory booklet on the region for the players with notes from Tombstone Epitaph reporter Lacy O'Malley and the Twilight Legion, a Marshal's guide detailing all the locations on the map and a full sandbox-oriented Plot Point Campaign, a poster-sized map of the county, and a selection of player handouts to drive this incredible tale of six-guns and sorcery to its bloodstained conclusion!\n Something happened at Devil's Tower recently. Something terrible. A being called the Cackler raised a powerful sorceress of legend, Morgan Le Fay, sending ripples through the many worlds of Deadlands. From the Dark Ages to the far future planet of Banshee in Lost Colony, the \"Morgana Effect\" has caused subtle changes from the world we knew before.\nThe Cackler and his unholy posse ride the range in this world-changing graphic novel by Shane Lacy Hensley!\n The Morgana Effect is a big story that ripples (quietly for now) through all the settings of Deadlands\u2014including the upcoming Deadlands: Dark Ages, the Weird West, Noir, Hell on Earth, and already released Lost Colony. It's also a story-based reason to change the rules and some parts of the setting we've been hankerin' to adjust for a while. You can read more about the latter here, but we think even those of you who have been with us since '96 will welcome the changes once you take 'er for a test ride.\nOver the years we've seen some amazing gaming setups, but collecting and painting a comprehensive collection of cowpokes and critters can be both time consuming and expensive. That's where the Deadlands Pawns come in. \nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains over 100 Deadlands characters and critters printed on thick punchboard!\nWe've created a selection of heroes, villains, and monsters in thick punchboard (the sturdy stuff board game tokens are made from) to represent some of the most common and iconic encounters in the Weird West. These figures are even die-cut to the contour of the character image to make each pose as dynamic and striking as possible.\nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard, containing over 100 pawns to bring the Weird West alive on your tabletop. If the set does well, we will expand the line to include additional Deadlands sets and pawn sets for our other lines. \nThat's enough jawin'. Now let's talk about what's really important...what you get for helping us bring the Weird West to life!\nWe've set up the reward tiers to be as simple as possible while still covering the most popular combinations you sidewinders always ask for. We've done 21 of these Kickstarters now, so we have a pretty good handle on things. But if you don't see the particular combination you want, just pledge for the book and add on anything else in the pledge manager we'll launch sometime after the campaign closes.\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nThe core book for Deadlands: The Weird West is a 192-page hardcover book, in our usual \"graphic novel\" size, and glorious, bloody, full-color throughout. That amazing cover is by Aaron Riley, a fan favorite of the entire Savage Worlds line!\nDeadlands Boxed Set contains the hardcover core rulebook, brand new poster map of the Weird West, GM Screen + Adventure, Set of 25 Bennies, Set of 7 dice, and a set of 12 Archetype Cards, along with Power Cards, Adventure Cards, and Infernal Device Cards\u2014all housed in a sturdy and attractive box to match your Deadlands: Lost Colony Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands the Weird West Core Boxed Set includes a copy of the hardcover rules as well as a brand new poster map of the Weird West by the phenomenal Cheyenne Wright, a set of 25 Bennies, a set of custom-colored dice and Wild Die, and a Game Master's screen and introductory adventure, Double Down at Sundown, by Rob Wieland!\nWant to see the new screen? Here it is, partner! The tri-fold screen is our usual landscape format with gorgeous art on one side and all the charts and tables the Marshal needs on the other!\nThe new GM Screen for Deadlands: the Weird West! Click here to view Federico Musetti's gorgeous art as a larger image.\nHorror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains a Player's Guide booklet, a Marshal's book with a full Plot Point Campaign, a poster map or Uinta County, and several pages of player aids and handouts. Art not final.\nDeadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard containing stunning full color miniatures die-cut to give you over 100 miniatures for use in your Deadlands games. Art not final.\nAfter the Kickstarter is over you'll be invited to a pledge manager so you can add any additional Pinnacle products you want to your order. Want the Rippers Resurrected Expedition Amazon supplement or Deadlands: Lost Colony or Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds Boxed Set? These will all be available to ship with your order.\nIf you want those existing items right now, partner, just head over to www.peginc.com and order, but please realize you'll have to pay shipping on that separately.\nIf you want to order everything at once in the pledge manager (to combine shipping with your Deadlands rewards) everything will be delivered toward the end of 2020. \nAdd-Ons require pledging for a physical reward level. \nAnd if you want to budget or add Deadlands-specific Add-Ons to your Kickstarter pledge now, here are the prices. Thanks as always for your support of our little company!\nWe always like to sweeten the pot. Help us reach our funding goals and we'll add a passel of digital and physical rewards. The first is a set of the cool new Harrowed \"Dominion Cards\" by Cheyenne Wright! If we reach that Stretch Goal, a set of cards will be added to every Deadlands Core Boxed Set. (You can order them as an Add-On as well.)\nWant to hear more from Sounds Like Crowes? Check out their website here.\nLearn more about the Wildcards and Saving Throw by clicking here!\nCheck back frequently to see where we're at, and tell your friends to check out our project\u2014every pledge means more for everyone!\nHelp us unlock more stretch goals by sharing the project! Here's where you can find us on social media:\nDeadlands and Horror at Headstone Hill are both written and in layout. Your help allows us to create all the extras we want to make and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the core rules a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website and DriveThruRPG.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. You will pay for shipping after the Kickstarter using the pledge manager. \nClick here to view larger image\nAll prices in USD and based on estimates calculated April 2020.\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know that international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your amigos pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail site.admin@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter product before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle product with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time).

We're Tucktec and over a year ago we introduced our Folding kayak to space-locked folks of all types. We are water enthusiasts and love to see our waterways clean and litter-free. Unfortunately, plastic bags and bottles are the biggest culprits.  We believe that to enjoy the water today and keep it clean for future generations we all have to do our part.  At this early stage of our company, we have an opportunity to make some decisions about our growth. So we decided to make a REAL change and see if we can start manufacturing our kayaks out of recycled plastic. That's why we're turning to the Kickstarter community.  If we can get enough interest and support to meet the minimum volume to set up specially made recycled sheets it can happen! You can help us kick-off our production from this time forward... making our kayaks out of 100% recycled bottles and bags! Help us launch Tucktec eco!\nOne Tucktec eco Kayak is equal to keeping 215 milk jugs out of the waste cycle and our waters.\nOne Tucktec eco Kayak is equal to keeping over 2,500 shopping bags out of the waste cycle and our waters.\n\nReady To Pack Less & Explore More? \nBenefits:\n No need for extra storage space \nNo need for a roof rack\nNo more renting kayaks\nFits in the trunk of a car\nPerfect for apartments & RVs\nGet on the water anytime\nHike into the sweet fishing spots\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nWhere Will You Explore First?\nIt's never been so easy to bring a kayak on your adventures!  Tucktec's small packed-size and weight turn any body of water into a day of fun!\nWhether it be in the city...\nOff the grid...\nOn a date...\nWith your furry friends...\nOr simply to just get away...\nAnyone. Anywhere. Anytime.\nSpecifications\nTucktec eco is a Hard-Shell Kayak that Folds up to store ANYWHERE.  Made from 1/8\" thick solid HDPE, the reinforced fold lines will not tear, puncture or split.  Ever!  Tucktec eco Kayaks are built tough to take abuse!\n Assembled Size:\n 10' feet long (304 cm)\n 31\" inches wide (78.74 cm)\nweight: 28 lbs. (12.7 kg)\nmax capacity: 350 lbs. (158.7 kg)\nFolded Size:\n 48\" inches long (121.9 cm)\n 15\" inches wide (38.1 cm)\n 8\" inches deep (20.32 cm)\n\nFeaturing:\nWIDE FLAT BOTTOM FOR STABILITY\nRETRACTABLE TRACKING FIN\nADJUSTABLE BACK-SUPPORT SEAT\nADJUSTABLE FOOTREST\nONE TWO-PART KAYAK PADDLE\nDRY-BAG\nOPEN COCKPIT.

It only took her THREE practice runs to get to where she easily set up her Tucktec eco in about 90 SECONDS!\nPLAY\n\n\nLightweight.\nStows anywhere.\nStraight Tracking.\nControl & Maneuverability.\n Safe & Durable.\nThe Tucktec eco is made from solid and rigid plastic formulated to fold easily, but remain tough and durable like a standard hardshell Kayak.  It's UV treated and even withstands extremely low temperatures. The hull sheet is 1/8\" inch thick (3.17 mm) and can handle abused from hard use, rocks, stumps, and even Oyster beds. All fold lines are reinforced up to 1/4\" thick (6.35 mm) and the main lever latch folds are carbon-fiber reinforced. The Tucktec eco is not a \"skin-on\" type of Kayak or a flimsy foldable Kayak. When set up, it looks, feels, performs, and holds up like a regular  Kayak.\nPLAY\n\nDon't forget to ALWAYS use a Coast Guard approved PFD (Personal Floatation Device) Life-vest, Life-jacket.\n  NOT recommended for Beach Waves or rough Ocean waters.\n  Not for use in whitewater above class 2 rapids.\n \nDoes it leak?\nTucktec Kayaks are made from one solid sheet.  All folds go in, and over themselves. There are no open folds that need to be sealed, and no way to leak.\nIt's Super Stable.\nPLAY\n\nAvailable In MANY Colors (see below for color selection)\nAt the end of the campaign we will send a survey for you to confirm your address and at that time you can select your color.  \nYou can get your Tucktec in GREEN, DARK YELLOW, TAN, BLUE, BLACK, ORANGE, RED, BRIGHT GREEN, PINK, PURPLE, & LIGHT BLUE.  We'll send you an email before we ship to confirm your color of choice.\n\nWhat About Shipping?\nAnother really cool benefit of a Folding Kayak is the shipping! You could expect to pay up to hundreds shipping a full-size kayak across the country or overseas, but not a Tucktec!\nPLEASE NOTE:  For INTERNATIONAL orders we are actively working with shippers to bring the cost down as much as possible. The cost shown below represents the HIGHEST amount you would ever pay for shipping.  Depending on how many international orders we get and other factors, the cost could go down for some international orders.\n**The shipping prices below are for up to 3 kayaks in one shipment** Example: if you buy 1-3 kayaks and live in US you'd only pay $30 (not $90).\nUnited States (Lower 48) - $30\nCanada, Alaska, Hawaii - $50 \nUK / EU - $60\nAustralia - $60\nAnyone from a country NOT listed will need to contact us with a shipping address to get an accurate quote.\n **International backers - import duties, taxes & charges are not included in the shipping cost.  These charges are the backer's responsibility and will be collected by the carrier upon delivery.  Please see FAQ for details.\n\nAs Seen On\nOur Story...\nThe inspiration behind Tucktec Eco came from my personal desire for a canoe or kayak our family could easily use on day trips and camping trips.  I did not have storage or a roof rack and at the time, being a working artist, I could not afford much.  I knew I did not want an inflatable... durability being an issue and they were very sluggish on the water.  I had seen a few other portable options, but all of those were too expensive for anything good.\nI got to thinking... there's got to be a way to take a solid full sheet of plastic and fold it in a way that would not only form the shape of a boat but do it in such a way that the folds would \"in and over\" leaving no open seam that would need to be sealed or possibly leak. \nI spent weeks at first folding little paper boats and floating them in the sink.  I\u2019d even add pebbles to see how much they would hold. My wife thought I was crazy.\nAfter several revisions, the Tucktec was born!  I now had the portable watercraft I was looking for.  A solid and rigid kayak that set up quickly, was sturdy and durable, and that even I could afford.\n-Dan, Tucktec Founder & CEO\n\n What Others Are Saying\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox\n\nMore than $15,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a lot of experience packed into a short time making the Tucktec Kayak. We also have the support of our local community. We use several local (usually family-owned) companies to make some parts and supplies. We are fully prepared to switch manufacturing from the standard sheets over to the Recycled sheets with no need for any new tooling or set-up on our end. We can scale quickly if needed.\nWe do not anticipate any problems. We are just switching to specially made recycled sheets but we understand things may come up that we can not predict. We can promise we will work as hard and as fast as we can and product quality will be our first priority. We will always be up-front, transparent, and timely with our updates to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe all know plastic lives forever. We expect, with proper care, that the Tucktec eco Kayak will not only last for years of enjoyment, but has the potential to last for decades. Even after it's final paddle, the specially formulated HDPE plastic can be recycled up to 10 more times!\nReusability and recyclability\nWe do not package our kayaks in plastic bags or film. The only disposable portion of a delivered Kayak is the cardboard shipping box it comes in. The Kayak itself can be recycled and is made from one of the most accepted plastic for recycling.\nSustainable materials\nWe use the highest grade HDPE recycled plastic. Other than special additives for UV resistance, our Kayak sheets are 99% recycled, and 100% RECYCLABLE.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe manufacture in-house and source special parts and supplies from small local (usually family-owned) companies that exhibit community involvement and environmental awareness. We have worked with each company to make sure that even the plastic or aluminum scrap created from our production is recycled.\nSustainable Distribution\nOur own in-house warehousing means that we do not have to move product multiple times before it reaches the final customer.

A tv series adaptation of Tales From the Loop was launched just a few days  ago on Amazon Prime Video.\nNow, you can take another step into the amazing world of the Loop. In Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Boardgame, 1-5 players take the roles of teenagers who investigate the mysteries originating from the Loop, a huge underground science facility with strange effects on the suburban landscapes around it \u2013 just make sure you\u2019re home in time for dinner!\nTales From the Loop \u2013 The Boardgame is designed by Martin Takaichi and includes high-quality miniatures by Paolo Parente's Dust Studio.\nPrototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nArt by Simon St\u00e5lenhag\nIn 1954, the government ordered the construction of the world\u2019s largest particle accelerator. The facility was completed in 1969, located deep below the pastoral suburban countryside, outside of the big city. The local population called this marvel of technology the Loop. Over the years since it was built, strange phenomena have started to appear in the area - mysterious creatures stalking the land, machines malfunctioning in inexplicable ways.\nIn the Tales From the Loop - The Board Game, you take the roles of local kids and play cooperatively to investigate whatever phenomena that threaten the islands (or perhaps just the local video store), and hopefully stop them. Each day starts at school, but as soon as the bell rings you can use whatever time you have before dinner and homework to go exploring! Player actions are integrated, meaning there\u2019s no downtime as you wait for others taking their turn. It also makes cooperating with your fellow players dynamic as you can react to things that happen in a turn and don\u2019t have to plan it all out from the start.\nAt least four scenarios will be included in the base game (more can be unlocked as stretch goals), and each scenario takes approximately 90-150 minutes to complete.\nFull Setup of Prototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nAll the components of the core game are listed below. More components can be added if stretch goals are unlocked:\nMiniature produced by Dust Studios based on Simon St\u00e5lenhag's design\nThe Loop isn\u2019t the only technological achievement in the \u201880s that never was. Advanced AI, robotics and magnetrine development are highly advanced as well. Riksenergi, the governmental agency tasked with running The Loop, employs different machines to automate a large number of functions on the islands. While some have drivers or handlers, most are running on their internal AI code.\nIn Tales From the Loop - The Board Game, these machines are represented by beautiful miniatures sculpted by Yannick Hennebo based on St\u00e5lenhag's original designs and manufactured by Dust Studios. They are molded in high-quality PVC plastic and are between 25 and 40mm tall. You can buy extra minis as addons, check the Addons section below.\nIn the STANDARD EDITION, the miniatures are delivered unpainted. In the DELUXE EDITION, the miniatures are delivered PRE-PAINTED by Dust Studio.\nMiniature prototypes by Dust Studio - not final product\nADDON MINIATURE SCENARIO PACKS\nIn addition to the machine minis included in the core set, you can add models of a Gorgosaurus dinosaur and the \"Visitor\" robot, along with scenarios to use them with, Addons to your order - check the Addons section below. Each pack includes a model and 20-30 Scenario Cards. The Gorgosaurus and the Visitor are available unpainted or pre-painted by Dust Studio.\nBelow is a video demonstration showing what a turn can look like in the game, by lead designer Martin Takaichi. It doesn\u2019t go into detail about every rule (there\u2019s the downloadable rulebook for that, see below) but gives you a good sense about how the game flows and general gameplay.\nTo let you to try out Tales from the Loop \u2013 The Board Game for yourself, we\u2019ve decided to provide a Print & Play kit for download. It doesn\u2019t contain everything that will be in the final game, but four characters and one scenario is enough to play the game with three other friends! If you just want to read the beta rules the rulebook is available for download.\nDo keep in mind that this is in only a prototype in Alpha state \u2013 things can and will change from the P&P version to the final version. In fact, that\u2019s another reason we wanted to do this, to get feedback from you so we can make the game the best it can be. Use this survey to provide feedback and report on errors.\nLINK TO THE PRINT AND PLAY FILES\nPrototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nIn addition, backer Timothy Clark has made two excellent videos that go through how to set up the Alpha and pretty much all the rules for the game in a clear and engaging way. If the Alpha rules PDF put you off, or you simply prefer to learn by example, do check out these two videos:\nAs we have passed our base funding goal, we will be able to expand the games with stretch goals.

You will be assigning your workers to eleven different locations, such as Tea House, Quarry, Messenger Post, or Barracks, using special Command cards that have additional effects. Production in locations activates ONLY when all their slots are filled with clerks, but filling them all by yourself can result in a penalty. On top of that, players can buy overseers who will give additional output every time a location becomes activated. This creates a lot of involving long- and short-term strategies.\n Each player starts with one unique General, characterized by their asymmetric power, as well as the production level. From there, you will further customize your economic engine and fine-tune your strategy by recruiting advisors who provide additional bonuses.\nEventually, a Wall Defence phase beings, where players place previously build armies on Horde Cards \u2013 earning Honor (Victory points) and looting resources from the defeated troops. This requires smart management of three types of units: Archers, Spearmen and Cavalry. Players place these soldiers one by one, playing the Tactics cards that create another layer of interaction.\nGain meditation by shooting with the Monk Archer, then spend meditation on a Cavalry Squad Leader to move your Cavalry around the battlefield faster, and \u2013 finally \u2013 finish off by getting extra Honor for each of the Cavalry\u2019s engagements thanks to the Banner Holder. There are endless possibilities for great combos and memorable plays.\nOn top of that, your Advisors and General might give your troops extra abilities, such as shooting twice or looting twice the resources!\nAll of the above makes the Great Wall one of our most strategically involving designs that will be appreciated by many different groups of players:\n                            - those who love euro-styled games with their intricate economies and engine-building,\n                            - those who love over-the-table play,\n                            - and finally, those who simply like to wage war on a beautiful map.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded nine Kickstarter projects.

Other base functionalities, like brushes and shape tools, are already available through the DUNGEONFOG Battlemap Editor and are not listed here:\nThe Citybuilder coherently assembles sections according to archetypes - e.g. poor human district or elvish administrative quarters - and logically auto-generates housing structures, squares and parks.\nEach house is equipped with its own automatically generated map-notes, including residents per house, construction costs, etc. and will be used to create note-based outlines for your cities. As is customary for the DUNGEONFOG system, notes can always be edited and expanded.\nEvery section can be set to a specific archetype, which will affect the random asset-pool for buildings:\nWealth level: Poor, Average, Rich, etc.\nType of building: Merchants, homes, administration, etc.\nRace/Species: Dwarven, Elvish, Human etc.\nPlan Settlements With Just A Few Clicks\nYou can also place landmarks and buildings manually. Temples, markets, towers, etc. can be planted precisely where you want them to be at any time. The remaining space can then be filled with buildings based on the selected archetype of the section.\nPin locations and link them to battlemaps\nPlay directly on the maps with our Fog-of-War viewer\nEach building, square and street can be mapped out in as much detail as you desire and require, including battle and dungeon maps. Let your imagination guide you without boundaries!\nClever Coding For Boundless Creation\nVector-based drawing enables you to manipulate landmasses to an unprecedented extent: Select, move or resize landmasses without losing quality on the graphics. Add, subtract or even combine landmasses to create unique regions. \nVector-based drawing allows you to revisit and manipulate all objects\nNever before was composing original regions and landmasses easier and more intuitive. By cleverly balancing tool functionality and harmonic art composition, the DUNGEONFOG core mechanics offer the perfect fusion of practical application and elegant map design.\nBIOMES\nBiomes are quickly and easily allocated with an intuitive brush tool. This renders different forms of vegetations, geographical formations and landscapes effortlessly and stylishly.\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Grassland\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Forest\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Mountain range\nWith PROJECT DEIOS, you will have access to a base setting for fantasy assets that will include more than 200 assets, for biomes like:\nBiome Samples\nSince the monthly DUNGEONFOG prop packs enjoy high popularity, we will continue to develop new textures, settings and props on a regular basis.\nPROJECT DEIOS combines all your ideas, detailed maps and concepts for continents into one giant map model. Through clever segmentation and the gradual increase of detail complexity, your world creation is a stable, coherent concept without boundaries.\nAdvanced Export Functions\nEach region can be selected, viewed and exported separately, including all contained landmarks and linked maps. The scales are automatically adjusted to fit your viewport and level of zoom.\nPolitical borders can easily be drawn - the DUNGEONFOG core functions circumvent unwanted overlaps and neatly translate all attributes to practical and editable Game Master notes.\nClimate zones, water currents and other characteristics are effortlessly added with easy-to-use brushes. Each feature stays continuously editable, allowing you to change or add whatever you want as your story progresses.\nEach landmark you place on your creation is automatically attributed its individual location. PROJECT DEIOS stores all locations, landmarks and properties in a geospatial data model. This allows your creativity to venture out endlessly, because map sizes are almost unlimited.\nBuilding an entire world from scratch might seem a bit intimidating. With the community maps feature, you can form creative alliances and collaborate on your storytelling endeavors. You can also share your worlds or use and adapt maps from fellow Game Masters or authors. There is no need to hide your creativity away - be proud and enrich multiple adventures with your ideas!\nJoin A Community Full Of Stories And Creation\nThe three pillars of DUNGEONFOG have always been \u201cPlan - Create - SHARE\u201d. We will stay true to our core functionalities, even while expanding our scope to make effortless world creation a reality.\nA great advantage of the innovative DUNGEONFOG map-making toolset is the simple but crucial feature that every object, entity and map stays perpetually editable and can be reused and even shared. This enables Game Masters, Authors, Storytellers and RPG enthusiasts to collaborate, exchange feedback and help improve each others\u2019 worlds. \nYou can draw from the users' collective creativity by using community maps, adapt them to your story\u2019s needs and make your own original ideas accessible to others.\nCollaboration Opportunities\nWe\u2019ll even go a step further, and explore how we can make collaboration between multiple authors on shared maps a possibility. Collaboration is not just working together on one map - but also using other users\u2019 maps to add to your own stories. Discovering a beautiful world map will spark new ideas and with PROJECT DEIOS, you\u2019ll have the platform to add your own creative stories to existing maps and let marvellous adventures unfold.\nWe think that everybody should be able to create maps with the new DEIOS Suite! After launch, we\u2019ll offer Free Access with limited features to everyone.\nIf you'd like to have access to all of our features, consider backing us at the Bronze level or higher for access to the full DEIOS Suite. \nKickstarter only\n\n\nYou and your support through Kickstarter will bring the DEIOS Suite to life. So we\u2019re offering you special bargains as a thank you, which are only available exclusively during this Kickstarter campaign:\nKickstarter-Exclusive Art Packs\nWhen supporting our campaign at Silver (pick one), Gold (pick two) or Platinum (all) level, you will receive our additional, Kickstarter-exclusive art packs, each containing 25 assets for cities, regions and world maps.\nKickstarter-Exclusive Video Series By The GreatGM\nCreating entire worlds with manifold distinct areas and settlements offers possibilities for near endless adventures. It might be easy to get lost in boundless creativity and to lose sight of one's goals, were it not for the guidance of wise masters and the help of fellow adventurers. \nIn his exclusive 6-part video series, The GreatGM lends Kickstarter supporters (Gold level and above) a helping hand and shares his vast knowledge of worldbuilding and storytelling. Since his new series is exclusively tailored to the DUNGEONFOG system and the  DEIOS suite, all viewers can expect valuable hands-on tips and masterful tricks from The GreatGM himself.\nDUNGEONFOG, World Anvil, GreatGM and Caeora Have Teamed Up For This Project\nAt its core, DUNGEONFOG was founded to support Game Masters and storytellers on their creative journey, and to make map-making easy, intuitive and practically useful. But we\u2019ve realized that we\u2019re not alone on this quest. World Anvil, The GreatGM and Caeora also aim to transform map-making, storytelling and worldbuilding into an extraordinary experience for you. So we\u2019ve teamed up!\nPROJECT DEIOS is our shared vision - ONE system that can support ALL your map-making and storytelling needs. DUNGEONFOG was a massive Kickstarter success back in 2017, and our toolset makes the mapping process effortless, quick and perpetually interconnected. With these incredible partners, we\u2019ve formed a team of experts in the world of storytelling, worldbuilding and map-making to make PROJECT DEIOS a reality.\n www.dungeonfog.com \n www.worldanvil.com \nwww.greatgamemaster.com\nwww.caeora.com \nWorld Anvil Integration\nOur partner World Anvil brings a lot of experience with collaboration features to the table. Drawing on their expertise, we will develop a permission-based co-authoring, commenting and sharing system. Simultaneously, we have a keen eye on the smooth technical connection between DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil. \nWe\u2019ll start with basic integration features, like accessibility of DUNGEONFOG maps while editing a world in World Anvil, or accessing your written world descriptions as a resource while creating maps in the DUNGEONFOG editor. \nWe\u2019ll also pay attention to the functionality of pins: Creating locations will auto-generate pins, and therefore, redundant manual pinning will not be necessary. In addition, we\u2019re exploring many ways to integrate World Anvil\u2019s extensive Campaign Manager and their character manager, Heroes, with PROJECT DEIOS. For example, our player viewer could be integrated with Heroes, so that all party members know their location at all times, or the location of the main villain.\nEasy Collaboration\nThe joint communities from DUNGEONFOG, World Anvil and The GreatGM is a thriving community of map makers, storytellers, writers and Game Masters at your disposal. This makes sharing resources easy as never before. A thriving community also enables you to cheer for great maps by others and draw motivation from users that used your work.\nArtwork and Assets Will Be Created By Caeora \nThe assets will not only be created in his beautiful unique style, but will also pay attention to scaling & line art so that every map you create will always look stunning - whether you play digitally or export them in high resolution.\nOur dream is to help Game Masters, Authors and storytellers create entire worlds in all their detailed glory. Creating something this boundless is a huge endeavour! \nOur primary goal is to get enough funding to cover an additional developer and have enough funds to pay our partners for their work.  \nTo cover all core functionalities, we estimate the costs to be around 100,000 EUR (about $112,140). Since we launched DUNGENFOG, we managed to build up some resources that cover about 40% of the estimated development costs. Our partners agreed to help us with an additional 10%, which means we can already cover 50% of the development costs of our DEIOS Suite.\nSo we don\u2019t ask you to fully finance our dreams - rather, your support could pick us up halfway and carry us to the finish line. Therefore, we set the funding goal to 50,000 EUR (about $56,070). With additional  resources, we can hire additional developers and speed up the development process immensely, getting DEIOS into your hands sooner!\nProject DEIOS Pricing After Launch\nWe want to make sure that prices are compatible with using the DUNGEONFOG system as a hobby. At this point, we estimate the full package (meaning the \u201cDEIOS suite\u201d including the DUNGEONFOG Battlemap Editor) to cost around \u20ac 7.90 (about $8.80) per month. \nBattlemaps are included in DEIOS - so you only need the DEIOS subscription\nOur DUNGEONFOG battlemap subscription will remain untouched and will be available as a separate subscription as well.\nWe will offer monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly subscription models with respective discounts. As is usual for DUNGEONFOG, you\u2019ll always be able to pause your subscription without losing your creative work. \nWhile planning this project, it was highly important to us that we grant our supporters early access to the DEIOS Suite development stages. Therefore, our timeline includes several stages of development releases to keep waiting time short, while at the same time enabling room for early feedback and improvement. \nNow that we have reached our funding goal - let's talk about stretch goals! \nAs enthusiastic map makers and RPG adventurers, we have a full array of additional ideas we thrive to implement - so here they are:\nPortals and Planes - FUNDED!\nPROJECT DEIOS is conceptualized to evolve and grow infinitely. Our first stretch goal includes the possibility to not only build an entire world, but to conceptualize multiple planes of existence. To support even the most fantastic ideas, we will offer biomes and props to create adventures taking place in five additional settings - and it is up to you to decide which ones will be included in the DEIOS Suite. \nWhen we reached this stretch goal after the end of the PROJECT DEIOS Kickstarter, we will give backers the opportunity to vote for their 5 favorite settings, which could include:\nWe will notify all eligible (silver+) backers after the campaign where to place your vote\nOnce the stretch goal is reached and the funding is over, we will contact all eligible (Silver+) backers and ask you to help us decide on the new settings.\nIf you would like to add to that list, join us on Discord or post here in our campaign comments with the addition: \u201cSETTING -\u201d  (Example: \u201cSETTING - Candyland\u201d).\nOnce the campaign is over, we will send you a link to our voting tool and you can help us to determine what of those 5 settings will be created first.\nEach setting will include artwork for biomes, city buildings and landmarks and will contain more than 100 different assets for your worlds.\nThe setting will then be available with ALPHA 2 so you can test and review it as soon as possible.\n SOLAR SYSTEMS, STARMAPS and 3D World Mapping - FUNDED!\nEven multiple planes of existence are not enough for you? \nWhen we reach this stretch goal, you don\u2019t need to feel tied to one world alone - let your imagination venture out into unexplored galaxies and the unlimited possibilities of space. \n When reaching this stretch goal, we will add tools to create \nGalaxies\nSolar Systems\nand mapping tools to create a 3D mapping of your world as globe, disc, cylinder or dyson spheres.\nAll maps will remain linkable and you will be able to expand your creation into whole universes.\n RANDOM LANDMASS SEEDING AND CITY GENERATOR - FUNDED!\nWhile creating entire worlds and galaxies, not every village, town or region has to be created individually. Sometimes, a specific vision of a city demands special attention to detail only in certain places, while other districts could be more generally conceptualized. \nOr a story calls for a highly characteristic and specific shoreline, while the vast central plains don\u2019t need to contain that much detail. \nFear not, we have you covered: When we reach this stretch goal, we will develop a tool set to generate entire cities and landmasses randomly. All you have to do is adjust the parameters to you needs and create a randomly generated map.\n Random city generator: Adjust size, demographics and layout (medieval , western, etc.) and we will randomly populate your city map with districts and buildings.\n Random landmasses: Adjust landmass-types amount of water on you map, sizes,  island scatter and more to randomly generate world maps.\n Save the seed for your randomization and share it with your friends\nTo celebrate this unlocked stretch goal, we have added an additional +25 Asset Pack to the pool!\n\u20ac 175.000 - New Setting - FUNDED\nWith 175k funded, Caeora will now add another new setting that you can vote on at the end of the campaign.\n\u20ac 250.000 DESKTOP APPLICATION - FUNDED\nWe can now hire an additional application developer full time and finish the desktop application together with the launch of DEIOS.\nOne-Time-Buy License Keys\nAll Platinum backers (and beyond) will receive in addition to all the other rewards 1 license-key to the standalone desktop application, which will run without subscription.\nThis means, that during our extended development time and beyond you will have:\nAccess to our ALPHA and BETA (online), \nAll Kickstarter settings and artpacks (also as part of your standalone license).\nPremium Access to Online DEIOS Suite until Desktop App has been released.\n1 License Key to standalone desktop application, that you can either use to activate your standalone desktop application, or gift a friend.\nAbout the Desktop Application\nOnce released, the software will available for download to any premium user at no additional cost.\nIn addition, we will offer a standalone license, that comes without subscription.\n+\u20ac 25.000 - The Indefinite Stretch Goal x6\n\n For every additional \u20ac 25.000 beyond our 250k stretch goal (275k, 300k, etc.) we'll increase the assets for all 7 settings by: \n + 50 battlemap assets  \n  + 15 additional landmarks  \n  + 15 additional special buildings for cities\nAnd + 50 new assets for solar systems & galaxies\n(in total 600+ assets)\n\n\nStep 1 - UNLOCKED: Digital badges for DUNGEONFOG and WORLDANVIL | +1 asset\nSuccess! All backers will be able to claim these exclusive badges for their DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil profiles. And every backer will receive one additional exclusive LANDMARK ASSET added to his DUNGEONFOG account (You will be able to vote on the assets in our Kickstarter survey). \nStep 2 - UNLOCKED:  +3 month | + 3 asset\nSuccess! With all three Social Stretch Goals unlocked, we are now adding + 3 MONTH run-time to all PROJECT DEIOS subscriptions and every backer will receive three additional exclusive LANDMARK ASSET added to his DUNGEONFOG account (You will be able to vote on the assets in our Kickstarter survey). \nStep 3 - UNLOCKED: 3x +25 Asset Packs\n Wow - You have unlocked ALL our social Stretch goals! We are now adding these EXCLUSIVE ASSET PACK (25 items) to your DUNGEONFOG account:  \nFacebook Challenge - COMPLETE!\nFollow this link to our Facebook post and share it with your friends:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dungeonfog/videos/470601057087850/\n  Twitter Challenge  - COMPLETE! \nFollow this link to our Twitter post and retweet it:\nhttps://twitter.com/WorldAnvil/status/1153093783283744772?s=20 \n\nInstagram Challenge  - COMPLETE! \nFollow this link to our Instagram post and like it:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B0V0V6SBU2D/?igshid=oahxha3re8of \n\n\nJoin us by backing our campaign today, so we can bring the DUNGEONFOG DEIOS Suite to you and all of our worldbuilding and RPG enthusiast-friends!\nThank you, Kickstarter!\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 800+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $350MM raised between them. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project has the potential to completely change the lives of all of us here at the studio, so we're putting our all into it.\n\nWe've been very open with the development of DUNGEONFOG so far and we take comments and concerns from our community very seriously. In fact, a lot of the changes in the editor came from community suggestions. We will continue to take and implement suggestions for Project DEIOSlong after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to make everything compatible with as many operating systems & browsers as possible. Due to the use of newer tech, some older computers and browsers will not be able to support all features. Please try the free version of DUNGEONFOG to see if your computer has problems running the current battlemap editor.\n\nWe\u2019re aiming for fairly regular build updates with monthly intervals, and the progress can be seen by all. When we say we will try to include something, we really will find a way to try it. We will try our hardest to make DEIOS a tool everyone will enjoy and will remember.\n\nWeb development isn't always smooth sailing and there are a lot of uncertainties (especially the programming part), so that's why we\u2019ve added a bit of a cushion to our timeline and chose Spring 2020 for the release date. This will give us a bit of breathing room so that we can get it to you on schedule... or maybe even earlier!\n\nIf it comes out early, it'll be a pleasant surprise. But in case we have a little delay ( unlikely, but possible), a bit more of your patience will be highly appreciated.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Helping Fairy", "descp": "Let the fairies praise you and enjoy the warm, fuzzy feeling of our gratitude.\nAll Kickstarter supporters will be able to claim a special DEIOS badge for their DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil profiles.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital DGNFOG badge\nDigital World Anvil badge", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["186 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "BRONZE", "descp": "With the BRONZE pledge, you gain access to the open BETA release and a 3-months membership to the full DEIOS Suite editor (after release).\nINCLUDES:\nDigital DGNFOG badge\nDigital World Anvil badge\nOpen BETA (Winter 2020)\n3 Months DEIOS subscription (starts with launch)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["647 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac35 or more", "title": "SILVER", "descp": "With the SILVER pledge, you gain access to the closed BETA, a 6-months membership to the full DEIOS Suite editor (after release) and 1 unique art pack, exclusive to Kickstarter backers.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital DGNFOG badge\nDigital World Anvil badge\nEarly access -

Everything you do will change the strange rhythm of the Etherfields dream world, where even the wildest fantasy is possible. \nGameplay created by the Board Game veteran Micha\u0142 Oracz (author of This War of Mine: TBG, Neuroshima Hex or The Edge: Dawnfall and many others), will test not only your logical skills but also your intuition, deduction, and emotional intelligence. Develop your character from scratch using advanced deck-building, travel through the dream-world map and delve deeper into chosen locations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really blown away by my experience with this game so far (\u2026) It\u2019s an amazing well of creativity!\u201d \n  - Rahdo\n\u201cThis one is real puzzler, it\u2019s so vastly different that anything I have played (\u2026) Really excited about this one!\u201d\n  - Ant Lab Games\n\"Etherfields is as a surreal and meaningful journey into a dream world that begs to be discovered.\"\n - Man vs Meeple\n \u201cEtherfields is an immersive experience.

Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

Set in a world on the brink of war, it has much in common with Earth in the 1930's, but instead of mundane technology powered by steam, coal, and oil, this world is powered by magic, enthralled daeva, and lightning! Imperial superpowers teeter on the edge of cross-continental conflict, while beautiful and deadly airships patrol the skies. Adventurers wield both machine guns and magic, spirits haunt the desert night and the dead have been known to walk again. Seek out adventure, mystery and great fortune as an elite soldier, a powerful mage, or a cosmically-attuned spiritist!\nThe game will feel very familiar to fans of tabletop roleplaying games like D&D and Pathfinder. The players each control characters in a made-up world while the GM helps tell the story and describe how the world reacts to the players. Zafir play sessions are separated into missions, and each mission is 2-5 combat encounters. Encounters take roughly 20-35 minutes depending on number of enemies and complexity, and in playtests players feel like they're able to make smart strategic decisions without holding up play. In general, combat in Zafir feels like playing a cooperative boardgame or skirmish wargame.\nZafir: Tactical Roleplaying Game Rulebook (left), Kickstarter-Exclusive Special Edition (right)\nWhen we set out to develop the combat of Zafir, we were reacting to traditional RPGs like D&D and Pathfinder. In these games, combat often feels simplistic, leaving the players with very few tactical decisions. For many characters, the optimal play is simply to move toward an enemy, then strike them with your weapon until they drop. The decisions a player makes on the battlefield don't feel nearly as impactful as they should.\nZafir is much more nuanced. As well as being played on a three-dimensional, one-inch grid where verticality and elevation are critical, it boasts a cover system that rewards careful movement and and gives bonuses for attacking targets caught out in the open.\nEvery turn, each player will weigh up a host of tactical considerations. Should you move out of a defensive position in order to get an attack advantage? Should you hunker down into full-cover and lob grenades? Or maybe it's time to grab the high ground and gain that elevation bonus. Zafir creates an experience where every move and every attack is so much more meaningful, and one critical decision or tactical error could change the outcome of an entire fight.\nContained in its hardcover rulebook is everything you need to play!\nFor Players:\nStreamlined Character Creation: Build your character quickly and efficiently, using starter classes to help you learn the game as you launch into your first mission. There's no need to understand every rule in the game before you hit the table to play! Zafir's characters develop as you play, the complexity evolving gradually.\nSix Playable Species: Zafir is home to six sapient species, each with their own cultures and national identity: insaan (humans), hinn (elves), ath'enki (subterranean orcish folk), rhuthari (lionfolk), dyn (foxfolk), and jaan (lizardfolk).\nSix Character Classes: Choose one of six main classes, each with a different battlefield expertise featuring over 140 class abilities: Recon, Sharpshooter, Arcanist, Grenadier, Adept, Acolyte\nTwenty-Four Class Specializations: As your character levels up, they gain further class specializations that enhance your abilities and provide further special bonuses.\nClear, Concise Rules: A brand-new, unique combat system focusing on gun combat, cover mechanics, and tactical battlefield decisions, that plays as fast and exciting as an action movie!\nGuns, Equipment, Airships, & Artifacts: Access to a wide array of weapons, armor, vehicles, equipment mods and abilities to kit out your character exactly the way you want!\nLore, Locations, History, & Cosmology: A fully fleshed-out campaign setting, including extensive information on the people, the gods, the nations, and the history of Zafir.\nFor Game Masters:\nVillains, Minions, & Monsters: A compendium of bad guys, with over 50 enemy unit descriptions and abilities (including many monsters based on Zoroastrian and Persian mythology!), plus all the tools to design your own.\nStarting Mission: A detailed starting mission to help you teach the players the game and introduce them to the combat of Zafir.\nRecommended Battlefields: A series of pre-designed battlefields, for when you don't want to prep your own.\nTips for Running Games: Zafir might play a little different that other RPGs, but we've got a section chock full of great tips to help GMs run amazing games of Zafir.\nEncounter Generators & Loot Tables: A plethora of helpful tools to design great encounters for your players and give awesome, balanced rewards\nAzi-Zahhak, the Black Queen of Serpents, the Immortal Dragon (stats included in GM's Section)\nLike many of our favorite RPGs, we've designed six iconic characters as inspiration to players and as examples of the different playable species and classes.\nVishtek, Dalinus, Kira, Tiz, Tyrain, & Lotoku\nCheck out the project updates for details on the revealed Iconics!\nVishtek Okam'ran (she/her) - Ath'enki Adept (More Info)\nDalinus (they/them) - Jaan Sharpshooter (More Info)\nKira (she/her) - Hinn Trencher (More Info)\nTIz (she/her) - Dyn-errad Arcanist (More Info)\nTyrain (he/him) - Insaan Acolyte (More Info)\nLotoku (he/him) - Rhuthari Sapper (More Info)\nZafir Games is a one-person team currently being funded from personal savings. So far, we've contracted some absolutely fantastic art and writing from contract team members (see below) and we're absolutely certain this game is super fun and will make people happy to play it. However, finishing the game, paying artists for more beautiful art, editing the book, and printing and shipping it world wide will require significant funding.\nCurrently, 100% of the rules, 100% of the character and class abilities, and about 70% of the GM's guide and campaign setting are already written.

Use your fame and influence to bid for the most famous gladiators in history. These star players could earn your school much wealth and glory if you use them skillfully! Use your hired gladiator in epic arena combats - put on a spectacle guaranteed to excite the roman crowds and gain your school the fame it surely deserves!\nWinning the Game.  Use the starplayer gladiators most skillfully, impress the crowds the most, outmanoeuvre the other players and show off your best combat skills in the arena events to win! Do badly and the fame of your ludus will dwindle in the eyes of Caesar and the keys to the colosseum will go to your rival!\nHere are all the Stretchgoals we have unlocked already. The next one is an awesome addition to every pledge level of the game!\nGladiatores: Blood for Roses plays over 3-4 rounds. Each round is a separate arena event where each player bids their future fame (victory points) on randomly drawn starplayer gladiators. Players can bet on who might win the next fight, plan secret tactics and gain a wealthy sponsor who will help the player in the next event. Each player then uses their chosen gladiator in the next arena battle event against the other players gladiators using unique sets of combat cards specific to each fighter.\nEach gladiator character comes with a unique set of combat skill move cards.\nThere are eight unique gladiator characters to choose from in the base game, each with their own special combat card deck and variable powers. With over 20 combat moves that link together in unique ways, each combat will feel totally different with nearly 100,000 card combinations to explore!\nThe quick video below shows 2 examples of the rapid card play in action.\nPLAY\n\n Example 1: the attacker Achillia starts with a nasty cleave attack that the defender quickly parries away. Then a flurry of blows and counter blows happen before the attacker manages a successful deflect which allows her to stagger her opponent. Example 2: Kalendio the Retiarius thrusts with his spear but is blocked. He shoves his opponent but is bashed with a shield which he swiftly manages to dodge...\nWith so many card combinations to choose from, every battle in Gladiatores creates this unique and evolving narrative gameplay.\nTactical card play, risk-taking, bluffing, trapping enemies, clever use of gladiator special abilities or just sheer audacity in the arena battles will impress the crowd and gain you the most glory. Plan your moments to strike, use your secret tactics wisely, learn from enemy mistakes, spot and then exploit their weaknesses to get ahead and grab those victory wreaths!\nDuring the game, each player will accumulate victory wreaths that combine at games end for a final victory point score.\nGladiatores Blood for roses combines many well known game mechanisms in a novel way. These include: \nThe Praetorian (all in) and Senator pledges (all in x2 game) come with a sponsor pack. It includes a fascinating historical folio exclusive to this kickstarter, the extra unlocked miniatures and some special promo cards as a FREE trial of what will potentially be available in future expansions!\n Setup - Short setup time. Takes only 2 minutes!\n 8 playable characters - 8 unique gladiators with more to follow!\n Flexible game length - choose a quick battle (1 round) or settle in for the more strategic season mode (3-4 rounds)\n Variable gameplay - each gladiator character plays completely differently, with different combat skills, strengths and weaknesses in each game.\n Dynamic combat experience - our nRPS system takes a complex web of possible combat moves and countermoves - like a real sword fight! - and condenses it into an easy to understand and swift to play card game.\n Longterm replayability -  Different skill sets drawn each time you play + variable challenges means huge replayability.\n Easy to learn - Check out the rulebook section below to see for yourself or watch the videos on our youtube channel.\n Fantastic art - from acclaimed illustrators Anja Kryczkowska (Gloom of Kilforth, Evolution) and Brolken (Legend of the Cryptids).\n Expansions - We already have a range of new famous gladiators ready to expand your choice, new combat moves and some secret plans we have for future campaign play...!\n8 playable characters. In Gladiatores: Blood for Roses you can play eight unique historical gladiators with their own special abilities. Each character uses a thematic set of combat skills that emulate the styles of gladiators that existed during the roman era (e.g. the Secutor, Murmillo, Retiarius, Dimachaerus, Hoplomachus and Thracian). Randomly drawn extra cards complete the gladiator's skill set for the next event making each game an unique challenge.\n WITH MANY MORE FAMOUS GLADIATORS PLANNED TO FOLLOW...\nFor fun we are taking our gladiator school Ludus Leonidas across Roman Europe, all the way to the colosseum in Rome! Each stretchgoal is a famous city amphitheatre and with your help, we can knock down those stretchgoals and take our gladiators through the regions, closer and closer to the Gold prize in Rome! Follow our progress on this map below...\nGladiatores is the only gladiator themed game (as far as we know) that actually makes you feel as though you are fighting for your life in a blow-by-blow combat. We've designed a combat system that emulates / simulates the cut and thrust of actual combat. Our Card Dueling system takes a complex web of possible moves, counter moves and follow up actions and presents them in a very easy visual and playable way. The cards played in each combat between players creates a narrative flow of 'take that' actions and counter-actions that will keep players on their toes in every game!\n Also, Gladiatores: Blood for Roses is not just a combat game. In fact, the main purpose of combat is to use your star player gladiator wisely to either win the wreath of victory or by impressing the crowd - preferably both! All the glory gained from betting, winning or showing off to the fans during each event gains you victory points for your school, and ultimately a chance of winning the game!\nBidding: A first step before each event is bidding. Gladiatores are randomly drawn for the star player market and each player then gets to bid on one. Other players can outbid an earlier player who then has to choose an alternative. The cost to buy a gladiator is a player's future victory points! Players must therefore think wisely how much they can afford for that star gladiator they really want! See the graphic below for how this works.\nPLAY\n\nCombat: Each player's school then enters their gladiator into the next randomly drawn event. Each player draws their mini-deck of combat cards specific to their gladiator, and makes ready to fight for prestige, glory and the all important victory wreaths. Combat cards represent single moves a gladiator can make in the fight (e.g. Thrust, Cleave, Deflect, Dodge and Disarm). Many cards also have some 'countering' options written on the card's orange side banners. When another gladiator attacks you, play one of the cards listed on the banner and you break the previous card played against you, making its effects no longer valid. This card and counter-card play continues until a player chooses to (or cannot play another card). The results of the final card then trigger!\nJust take a look at the detailed combat exchange below for a good example of this in action:\n Very quickly you will be planning your combat moves like a pro!\nBy countering the attacker's cards with 'break' cards of your own leads to a detailed exchange of combat moves (much like a real sword fight!) which we call Chaining. Often you can chain your own combat moves, using follow up cards that give you extra advantages (for example like playing a DISARM card after a successful DEFLECT). The following graphic shows this in action...\nCard chaining example\nOften players will fight it out in a flurry of cards and countercards, trying to get past their opponent's defenses and strike a telling blow. But, you need to take care! This is not a deck builder. Rather, its a deck destroyer! Your combat deck is your stamina and endurance to survive the event. Spend your cards too quickly and your rivals will pounce on your weakened state!\nTo win, it's all about watching your rivals moves, choosing your moments wisely and forcing your enemies to use up their cards while holding on to your own... \n Event Cards: Every round of Gladiatores requires an event card to be randomly drawn. The event cards detail the glory prizes for coming 1st and 2nd, the size of the crowd at the event (number of rose petals = crowd favour) and the conversion of crowd favour gained during the fight into glory (bottom box). The base game comes with 6 events (2 each of bronze, silver and gold level). Each has variable glory rewards.\nGlory tokens: The glory tokens gained during events are worth variable victory points (VP). Most players should win at least 1 or 2 glory tokens in each event. Glory is stored on each Player's Wheel of Glory. Being 1st or 2nd to complete this wheel scores big VP bonuses and gives a big boost to your chances of winning the game overall! \nVP collection and Wheel of Glory\nThe Player with the highest VP score after the chosen number of rounds is declared the winner and gains their rightful place performing shows before Emperor Caesar in Rome! \nWatch Ryan's detailed How to Play video here.\nThe lads at Playing BoardGames recorded a liveplay of Gladiatores in action.

Being a small indie publisher, we cannot produce this fantastic limited edition game in its present form without your support.\n Stretchgoals will allow us to add in more amazing content (such as new gladiator characters, new combat moves and sponsors), improve production quality and improve the game for you and for everyone. \n Backers make a great game greater! We listen to you guys and will work to include some of your great ideas in the final game.\n Backers receive more and a better game at a better price compared to what they would get after the campaign through a normal retail edition. \n Shipping will be from warehouses in Europe, USA, (and possibly Canada and Australia also) so you will get your game much faster than through retail and won't have to pay import duties and taxes.\n Christmas! is not here yet but our plan and aim is to get the game to all backers ready for the holiday season.

All rewards can be confirmed for each backer at the Pledge Manager stage after the kickstarter is complete.\nArena Playmat - not final\nThe game is card intensive so the arena playmat (~24x20cm) is a very useful component that helps to keep the tokens and stacks of cards organised for all players during the game. We only use quality neoprene for these and they are very hard wearing but easily foldable.\n This is the replacement Active Player Marker (G1) included in the Deluxe game set. Approx. 70-80mm tall. Miniature comes unpainted. You can add more than 1 miniature if you wish - just increase your pledge using the manage pledge button by \u00a39.50/$12 for each additional model you are ordering. \nHere are three fantastic paint jobs done for us. Please click on the images below and give these amazing miniature painters a thumbs up or like.\nWe have also unlocked 2 alternative gladiator sculpts! Your choice of which model(s) you want can be confirmed through the pledge manager after the kickstarter finishes. If you want more than 1 miniature, just increase your pledge by \u00a39.50/$12 for each additional model you are purchasing.\nWe all know that shipping games over 1kg is expensive and with current trade agreements in a state of flux this means that publishers have to be sensible and careful over shipping rates. So we are subsidising shipping to everywhere as much as we can and depending on our final funding amount, we will try to subsidise this further.\nUK backers will get FREE postage and all others get the price reduced shipping/postage added when you pledge. All final pledge amounts, add-ons etc and tracked services can be confirmed or adjusted by you within the Pledge Manager after the kickstarter finishes. (Note that some add-ons might trigger extra postage - for example ordering a 2nd game).\nFor shipping we are working with multiple international partners in USA, CA, UK and EU to find the most cost effective and safest way to get you your rewards. Only 1% of backers from our previous kickstarter had problems with delivery (usually due to changes of address). We will hopefully add Australia-friendly also if we get enough backers from that region.\nShipping costs shown below are for untracked services, based on recommended pricings provided by our fulfilment partners.\nHERO PLEDGE       CANADA - \u00a37, USA - \u00a37, EU - \u00a36*, RoW - \u00a315\nCHAMPION PLEDGE       CANADA - \u00a39, USA - \u00a39, EU - \u00a38*, RoW - \u00a318 \nWe will ship to our international fulfilment centres at our cost. Tracked shipping service upgrades and all additional extras (e.g. extra game copies) can be added in the pledge manager after the campaign has finished. We did this for our previous kickstarter with a similar box weight and backers were all happy.\nPlease note that we do not ship to: Russia, Brazil, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \n* Some EU countries will have slightly higher charges due to available delivery services.\nThe game is 100% finished and components are already being organised with the manufacturer.\nOur calculated estimate for delivery of this project is early December 2019 (in time for the holiday season). This estimate covers additional time for final tweaks, last minute changes and problems that might occur. Being our second kickstarter project, we know how to maximise both quality and speed to get a game project manufactured. Our previous project was delivered to all backers before the final estimate date. Delays in manufacture and shipping however can and do often crop up due to many circumstances outside our control. Therefore our deadline for delivery of this project is a calculated estimate. In fact we aim to beat this target by at least a month but are being sensibly cautious and adding in some extra time. We will keep you informed of our progress on all this as we work to fulfilment. \nIf you are a bricks and mortar retailer (including cafes that sell games) and would like to support this kickstarter, please pledge at the special LUDUS pledge level. This level is a deposit against the cost of carton/case multiples (5+ games/carton) of this KS edition game (base game or deluxe + all unlocked SGs) at the normal retailer-friendly discount off the KS price (contact us to confirm). You will also get a free demo set with your 1st carton ordered and access to all promo and special additions.\nOnce pledged, we will then message you to confirm your final order, how many of each version you want, confirm shipping and delivery address after the kickstarter has ended. We guarantee your order will get sent out at the same time as all other backers rewards allowing you to jump ahead and get your order many months before normal retailers will! You can of course contact us through KS messages or info[at]badcatgames.eu to discuss any of this in more detail.\n And here are some really cool Avatars for you to download and share the love of Ludus Leonidas.

We have already sent off some of the files for pre-production checks and will be ready to pick up speed and complete the file checking stage soon after the kickstarter finishes.\n\nThe game is 100% complete, requiring only tweaking, additional final artwork changes to be added depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked. This means we can be ready to give the final approval for production in plenty of time, so that we can get the games to all of you before the end of the year.

In the board game, you and your friends are deadly diseases, battling to infect and wipe out the world! (You can get the original game here).\nArmageddon takes Plague Inc. to the next level, supporting new play styles, expanding strategic choices as well as adding more variety to an already extremely replayable game. It also lets you play with an extra player!\nNew Fungus disease type: The Fungus is all about mobility and spreading across the globe. With its Spore Burst it can infect new countries with ease, but it can struggle to fully take them over. Puffball increases the power of future infections, and Fungal Bloom exploits empty countries to score DNA.\nNew Bioweapon disease type: The Bioweapon is fully focused on lethality. The Armageddon ability lets it kill without worrying about the Death Dice. The more it kills, the stronger it becomes as Festering Corpses generates DNA from dead countries. However, it has limited infectivity and will need to consider Genetic Targeting to avoid eradicating itself. \nGenetic modification game mechanic: During the game, players can spend DNA to get unique Genes which power radical tactics and specialise their evolution. Paying too much for a Gene or letting an opponent get it for too little can be the difference between domination and extinction!\nTomorrow's World Country Cards: New country cards reflect our changing world in the game and mean countries might not be quite as you remember them. Isolationist USA has no transport links, Brexit Britain isn't in Europe, and you can probably guess what happens to Global Warming Greenland...\nNew Event and Trait Cards: Loads of new cards can be added into the existing decks, increasing variety and giving you new ways to interact with (and mess with) your friends. \nExtra player: New Plague Tokens and Evolution Slides allow an extra player to infect the world. The game now officially supports 1-5 players. (or 6 unofficially if you got the previous 5th player expansion from Kickstarter!) \n\nIn return for your support, the Armageddon Standard pledge gives you a first edition copy of Plague Inc: Armageddon at a discounted price as well as a Kickstarter bonus - the Repeat Infection pack which adds a number of new extreme event cards which are particularly powerful and/or dangerous in the right hands.\nIf you are feeling particularly enthusiastic - the Armageddon Enthusiast pledge adds the Collector Pack, Storage Pack and Digital Disease Pack - providing extra content in and out of the game.\nIf you are new to Plague Inc: The Board Game - then you want the Armageddon Newcomer pledge which includes a copy of the base game along with everything from the Armageddon Standard pledge.\nAs more people back the project, stretch goals will be unlocked which will add additional content and features to the game for free (for all pledge levels). \n Here are some of the lovely things that the press have said about Plague Inc : The Board Game thus far:\n \u201cThe game just looks great. From your player mat being a microscope slide image of your disease, to the blood splattered Death Die, the visual design is perfectly executed...I absolutely recommend this game.\u201d - Geek & Sundry \n \u201cI\u2019ll tell you two things: One the game is good and two, it really does feel like the app\u2026 Dice Tower judgement: Excellent!\u201d - The Dice Tower \n \u201c... a surprisingly enjoyable, intelligent experience that also works as a superb single-player game\u201d - The Guardian \n \u201cIt deftly weaves simple elements together to generate meaningful decisions on every turn, and it\u2019s straightforward enough that I\u2019d happily introduce it to newer gamers.\u201d - Ars Technica \n \u201cThere\u2019s a fantastic theme running through the game, and the challenge of getting your fledgling little illness and turning it into (quite literally) a world beater never gets boring.\u201d - The Gaming Review \n\u201cWe all loved it and we've played it multiple times\u2026 We genuinely all enjoyed it equally - aged 8, 23 or 45. Ndemic have done an excellent job.\u201d - The Brick Castle \n\nAs the Campaign progresses, a number of stretch goals will be unlocked and added to your pledge for free! \n\nWant a closer look at Armageddon and how it changes the game? Well, here's a video! Warning - this hasn't been edited into a flashy promotional clip - it is simply me (James - the creator of the game) looking at the new bits of the expansion and explaining the gameplay / strategy implications of them. \nIf you want to learn more about genes and how they work - here is the new rulebook for you to flick through.\nPlague Inc. The Board Game is a strategic game of infection, evolution and extinction for 1-5 players lasting 60-75 minutes. Each player is a deadly disease competing against other players in a battle to be the first to infect and wipe out the world! \nPlague Inc: The Board Game combines the best bits of the original video game (which has infected 120 million players worldwide so far!) with a unique tabletop design. The result is a game with a realistic theme and engaging gameplay which can be enjoyed by anyone who likes the idea of infecting people with the plague! \nEach player is a unique disease. They start off infecting one country on the World Board - but soon they will spread.\nPlayers spread their infection across the world by placing tokens in cities - earning DNA points if they are dominant. Players choose which countries are placed on the board but they must be both climate resistant and connected to a country before it can be infected.\nDiseases start weak and unspecialised but as players develop symptoms - they will become stronger and spread exponentially.\nPlayers can upgrade their unique pathogen by evolving trait cards onto an evolution slide (with DNA points).\n The symptoms a player evolves on their Evolution Slide significantly changes how their disease behaves. Once countries become fully infected - the controlling player tries to kill them with the Death Dice! The more lethal the disease, the more likely the country is to be wiped out.\n\nIf you'd like an even closer look at the base game, you can view our series of How To Play videos here.  \nWe have been working on this expansion for 3 years now and have a fully scheduled and costed plan to deliver it to you! Throughout the campaign and afterwards, we will communicate regularly with you to let you know how things are going. \nShipping and taxes are automatically included when you make your pledge and include a shipping subsidy.\nWe use distribution hubs around the world to ship the game out to you as cheaply as possible. Shipping is US, UK, EU, Canada and Australia friendly to avoid any VAT / import fees (we believe in spreading plagues everywhere!)\nIf we do not offer shipping to your country - please fill in this form to request it. We will try to get shipping quotes for any country that has enough people request it. \nCurrently, the game is available in English. We know that Plague Inc. is popular all over the world, so if you would like us to translate the game into your language - please fill out the form here. If enough people request a translation into a different language - we will see if we can make it happen!\nPlague Inc: Armageddon has been designed by James - the designer of the original board game, James is also the designer of the best selling digital game Plague Inc. and our latest digital game Rebel Inc. The art was art-ed by Ollie, Daisy and Ryan and production was produced by Matt. We work with a great team at Panda to get the game manufactured. \nIn addition to the core team, a big thanks is in order to everyone else at Ndemic Creations as well as all the people who have playtested the expansion. We couldn't do it without you :)  \nThe game has been designed and extensively tested already. Now, your input and support will help make sure that the game is as good as it possibly can be (the more eyes and brains looking at things the better)!\nAs previous backers will know, throughout the campaign, we will be actively seeking out your feedback and input. We will read every single comment that gets posted and will also be posting polls/questions related to stretch goals and other design decisions to get your feedback (e.g. Which graphics do you prefer?  Can you find an exploit in our rules wording etc).\nJames is particularly keen to get people to find rare exploits in the new genes :)\nRemember - you can get the original game right now on Amazon here!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn the last 7 years, Ndemic Creations has successfully made games that are enjoyed by over 120 million people across the world.

It all fits back into the box! \nTiny Epic Tactics achieves endless layers of strategy and fun through utilizing a simple combat system with variable player powers and 3D terrain! \nNesting inside the game box are 5 smaller boxes and a map/scroll. Players will set up the game by placing these 5 boxes, plus the box bottom, onto the scroll in designated areas. This creates the environment that players will explore and battle across. \nConquer your opponents in tactical combat where every calculated move matters... or journey across the land and through the caves in a grand cooperative/solo adventure! \nIn competitive play, players will pit their teams against one another in effort to score the most victory points by the end of the game. Each turn, players will have 3 actions to assign across their team. They can move and/or attack with their heroes and different types of heroes have different ways of attacking.\nVictory points are awarded for area control, enemy heroes captured, and keeping your own heroes alive. Gaining complete control of one, or multiple, specific areas offers the most victory points in competitive play.\nGaining control of these areas requires your heroes maintaining majority presence in these areas over the course of a few turns. This requires a careful balance of offense and defense. The control of these areas can easily shift from one player to another based on which player has the majority heroes present in the designated spaces. Once a set number of areas are captured, or one of the players has lost all of their heroes, the end game is triggered. \nTiny Epic Tactics offers a distinctly different experience for solo and cooperative play. In these modes, players will adventure across the map, fighting spawning enemies and exploring caves (printed on the interior of each of the boxes).\nThe goal is to acquire treasures, that belongs to the enemy, from these caves while keeping your heroes alive. Once the end of the game is triggered, victory points are tallied based on how many treasures you took from the enemy and how many heroes you kept alive. \nYour team will consist of 4 heroes, regardless of mode you are playing. You will have one Fighter, one Wizard, one Rogue and one Beast! Each type offer different strengths and abilities.\nFighters are strong and versatile. With lots of hit points and a strong melee attack, they are a great unit to lead the battle. While their missile range is short, it proves useful when moving into position. Their special powers reinforce their ability to stand their ground or to unleash high damage in short range combat scenarios. \nWizards are powerful and resourceful. Their high damage output at long ranges can make them among the most lethal opponents on the field. However, their low hit points make them a target. If one gets caught without an escape plan, they won't be around much longer. Their special powers range from support to multiple-target attacks.\nRogues are swift and cunning. They offer good mobility combined with long range missile attacks. This makes them particularly useful in softening enemy units while bouncing from one control area to another. Their special powers range from weakening enemy units to reinforcing their pesky maneuvers.\nBeasts are relentless and reliable. They have good movement, high hit points and strong melee damage. This combination makes them an army of one. You'll be tempted to send them to one control area and the rest of your team to another. However, they lack any sort of ranged attack and their special powers typically benefit nearby teammates. So you'll want to weigh your options tactically. \nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Lanterns Mini Expansion\nThe Lanterns mini expansion adds a 'pick up and deliver' like mechanism to Tiny Epic Tactics furthering the options and replayability of the game. During the game's setup, each village is given an unlit lantern (backside of token). When a player sends one of their heroes through a portal (cave) they come out with a torch. A player can only have one of their heroes holding a torch at any given time. If a hero takes damage while holding a torch, the torch goes out. If a hero brings a torch to a village and lights the lantern of that village, the player who controls that hero collects the lantern for victory points at the end of the game. \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store. \nThe Maps Expansion is a set of box covers and scrolls. It includes everything needed to convert the 6 Evergreen Woodlands boxes into 2 different settings: the Winter Highlands and the Savage Wastelands. \nThe Maps Expansion is usable with ALL play modes. These are NOT just aesthetic changes! These change the gameplay drastically. Each map takes a different approach to where control areas are placed, how much space is between the control areas and what terrain surrounds them. This requires a different strategy on how to approach and defend the control areas resulting in a very different experience!\nNote: dungeon interiors will remain the same.\nCheck out the images and video below for a closer look at these alternative settings. \nMaps Expansion Includes:\n1 Winter Highlands Map Scroll\n 6 Winter Highlands Box Covers (to be placed over the Evergreen Woodlands boxes) \n1 Savage Wasteland Map Scroll\n 6 Savage Wasteland Box Covers (to be placed over the Evergreen Woodlands boxes) \n1 Reinforced Envelope\nThe box covers are constructed of thick premium cardstock and can be flattened after use for easy storage.\nManually add $12 to your pledge, or select the specific reward tier, if you'd like the Maps Expansion to ship with your copy of Tiny Epic Tactics.\nCheck out the video below for a rotating view of all 3 maps.\nPLAY\n\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included! \nDue to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Illustrated with over 1,000 pieces of unique, stylish art, it will take you on a fantastic adventure set in a dark reimagination of the Arthurian legends.\n Designed by Krzysztof Piskorski (one of the most well-known Polish fantasy writers) and Marcin \u015awierkot (owner of Awaken Realms, developer of Lords of Hellas, Nemesis, The Edge: Dawnfall), Tainted Grail will bring you adventure, survival and exploration mechanics perfectly paired with character development and exciting combat and diplomatic systems.\nImmersive, story-driven exploration will bring the world of Avalon to life, confronting you and your team with difficult choices that have far-reaching consequences. Over 100,000 words of branching story scripts provide many different paths to your goal as well as several different endings to your adventures!\nClick!\n                                                                    click!\n                           click!\n                               click\n                                                   \"The Tainted Grail is easily my most anticipated solo / co-op Kickstarter of the year!

After you survive it once, there are still lots of new things to see, and storylines to experience!\nAnd even if you make the same choices on your new playthrough, random Events, Encounters and randomized elements within the Journal ensure no two games play alike, while tense, survival-based gameplay lends itself to many unique moments of emergent storytelling.\nYour characters are not run-of-the-mill \u201cheroes\u201d. They are flawed outcasts, called upon after the true champions of the land failed or fell. Each has unique flavor, a powerful ability, one big drawback that you need to play around, and two decks of individual Combat and Diplomacy upgrade cards.\nRegardless of whether you play alone or in a group of four, the game scales up to provide an adequate challenge. What\u2019s more, you may add or remove players after each Chapter, modifying the group size as you go!\nYou will journey through a grim land based on Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology, exploring its daunting secrets. Your decisions will shape both your adventure and the game world around you, as each campaign is set apart by many years, revealing the long-term consequences of your actions. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike.\nIn a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by conflict, surviving each day is a challenge on its own. In addition, Guardian Menhirs, that ensure safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark, turning a simple map into an engaging puzzle.\nTo overcome these challenges, your character develops along several conflicting attributes such as Aggression / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of skills and lead to different deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.\nThe character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need brute force, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each conflict fun and exciting.\nTainted Grail will force you to make hard choices with consequences that might present themselves even several decades later, in a future campaign, changing the environment and the balance of powers on the island. This will make your every playthrough unique and will give you unmatched power to reshape both the world and your story.\nIn Avalon, there\u2019s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, this land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner.\nCreated by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has in fusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals.\nAt Awaken Realms, we have a quite an experience in making and delivering big games. So far, we have created four ambitious titles that expand the standard scope of a board game - all were critically praised and provided a lot of unique experiences to players all over the world.  \nWe also gathered vast practical knowledge about deep integration of various themes, and we've learned how to build interactive, branching stories that seamlessly connect with gameplay.

Each player is the owner of a famous unique gladiator school vying for glory and renown in a series of arena battle events. The winner will be the player than can impress the crowd, make devious plans, outmaneuver his/her opponents and show off the best sword skills in the arenas!\nIn Gladiatores: Blood for Roses each player gets to play a different gladiator in each event with a unique set of combat cards tied to that gladiator's style that varies in each game. Being a card game, there is no need for a complex board, the game narrative evolves through the choice and reactions to the cards played. Secret tactics and double bluffing abound making it tricky to know who will win and gain the most glory!\nSecutor card set\nRisk taking, tactical card play, impressing the crowd, outmaneuvering your enemies and clever use of special abilities is what you will need to gain the most victory point wreaths. Plan your moments to strike, learn from enemy mistakes or even bet on an enemy gladiator to get ahead and grab the glory!\nGladiatores: Blood for roses combines many well known game mechanics in a novel way. These include: \nA 3 player challenge at Tabletop Scotland 2018\nGladiatores' combat system is designed to emulate / simulate the visceral cut and thrust of actual combat. This 'counter-card' system takes a complex web of moves, counter moves and follow up options and presents them in a very easy visual and playable way - creating a narrative flow of 'take that' actions and counter-actions that feel like you are actually fighting for your life in an arena...\nAlmost every card played has some 'countering' options written on the card's banners. Play one of the cards listed in the banner and you BREAK the previous card making its effects no longer valid.\nJust take a look at the detailed combat exchange below for an example:\nBlow by blow 'counter card' system in action\n Very quickly you will be chaining these cards like a pro!\n\nThen it's all about watching your rivals moves, choosing your moments wisely and forcing your enemies to use up their cards while holding on to your own...\nSetup - takes only 2 minutes tops!\nFlexible game length - choose a quick battle or settle in for the more strategic season mode\nPoker-like - some tactical elements similar to poker (bluffing, hand management) but with swords, sweat and possibly tears!\nVariable gameplay - each gladiator plays completely differently, with different cards, strengths and weaknesses in each game.\nUnique experience - our countercard system allows for complex chaining of combat moves and countermoves - like a real sword fight! - while still being really easy to understand and swift to play.\nEndless replayability -  With different skill sets drawn each time you play + multiple ways for combat cards to be chained through player choices means huge replayability. (We've not done the maths on how many variations there could be but its a lot ok?)\nEasy to learn - card structure facilitates rapid understanding and quick play, check out the rulebook section below or watch a brief how-to-play video on our youtube channel.\nFantastic art - from acclaimed illustrators Anja Kryczkowska (Gloom of Kilforth, Evolution) and Brolken (Legend of the Cryptids).\nExpansions - Excellent expansion potential with new famous gladiator types, new combat moves and some secret plans we have for future campaign play...!\n2 play modes - see below...\nGladiatores: Blood for Roses can be played in a quick 'single event mode' when time is short (like last orders at the pub!) and takes approximately 10-15mins per player. However the game is designed for multiple event 'Season Mode' play where each player gets to accumulate glory from each event, in a race to win a coveted place at the colosseum in Rome. Each event takes roughly 30-40 mins to play depending on type of player.\nThe game scales very well from 2 players upwards and we hope to unlock the 6th, 7th and even 8 player sets with new unique gladiators during this kickstarter.\nJoin us as a backer and help make it happen!\nA 2 player grudge re-match at UKGE 2018\nNone of the following reviewers were paid for their reviews or opinions of the game.\nClick to read the review\nClick to read the review\n                                                                      Click to read the review\n                                                                     Click to read the review\n                                                                    Here is Board Game Coffee explaining the game in their own fantastic style. Enjoy!\n WHO DARES ROLLS video review...\n See what Nick thought of the game in his preview video...\nThe base game comes with these five unique gladiators (+ KS Exclusive):\n With many more unlockable through stretchgoals...\nJust some of the gladiators waiting to join\nGladiators: Each player must play a different gladiator in each event. Note that the winner of a previous event will get 1st choice thus giving the player a tactical advantage in 'season mode' matches !\nThe main gladiator cards\nEach gladiator card shows the type, armament, special ability (lower boxed text) and the variable glory rewards for betting on that gladiator (at top right of each card). \nCombat cards: Each gladiator has a unique set of combat cards that are augmented in each event by drawing extra cards randomly from the combat decks. These cards form the gladiator's set of combat skills for the event; ensuring variability each time you play.\nSecutor specific combat cards\nCounter Card System: Each Attack or Defense card played can usually be countered by one or more other cards (clearly labelled in the orange banners at left or right of each card). For example, the picture above shows a CLEAVE card that can be countered only by a PARRY or a BLOCK.\n\nWe refer to the cards in the orange banners as BREAK cards!\n\nIf your opponent doesn't have either of these Break cards, you get to trigger the card effects for that card. Thus, cards and counter cards lead to complex exchanges of attack and counterattacks (chaining cards) that leads to thrilling and deadly one on one battles within the melee.\n\nHere is a further example of chaining multiple cards between two gladiators.\nCounter card chaining example\nCareful hand management will be necessary because each combat card represents the endurance of your gladiator to survive the fight and defeat all challengers. Run out of cards and your fighter collapses to the sand, defeated!\nEvent Cards: Every game of Gladiatores requires one or more Event cards to be drawn (depending on whether playing 'single event' or 'season mode'). The event cards detail the glory prizes for coming 1st and 2nd, the size of the crowd at the event (number of rose petals = crowd favour) and the conversion of crowd favour gained during the fight into glory (bottom box).\n\nGlory tokens: The glory tokens gained during events are worth variable Victory Points (VPs). Most players should win at least 1 or 2 glory tokens in each event. Glory is stored on each Player's Glory Wheel. Being 1st or 2nd to complete this wheel scores big VP bonuses and gives a big boost to chances of winning the game overall!\nThe Player with the highest VP score is declared the winner and gains their rightful place performing before Emperor Caesar in Rome!\nYou can download the current Rulebook here (note this is a work in progress)\n                                                                                                                                               You can help guide the final components of this limited edition game.\nStretchgoals will add in more content, improve production quality and improve the game for everyone. \nBackers make a great game greater! We listen to you guys and will work to include your great ideas.\nBackers receive a better game at a better price compared to what they would get after the campaign through a normal retail edition.\nWithout your help, we won't be able to print this gorgeous game in all its glory and share it with the world. Without kickstarter there might never be a retail version. \nShipping will be from warehouses in Europe, USA, and possibly in Canada and Australia (if enough backers join us from there) so you won't have to pay import duties and taxes.\nThe game (originally designed way before the film Gladiator came out) has been playtested thoroughly over the past four years and is completely ready for production now. That doesn't mean with your help we cannot make some beneficial tweaks and add in some fantastic additions to make it even better though... such as:\nnew unique gladiators, \nincreased player count\nnew combat moves,\nspecial Star Players \nRPG elements \nanimal challenges\nand more...\nFor fun during the kickstarter we are doing something different with the stretchgoals!\n\nWith your help we are taking our gladiator school 'Ludus BadCat' as far as we can towards Rome and the fabled colosseum. Every point on the map of Europe below is another stretchgoal that can be unlocked!\nJoin us as a backer and you become one of our gladiators, helping to take the ludus all the way to Rome and unlocking some sweet stretchgoals for you all along the way!\n Here are just a few of the many stretch goals we have planned for you.\nWe love our FLGSs and their support of the hobby and indie publishers like us. If you are a bricks and mortar retailer (including cafes that sell games) and would like to support this kickstarter, please pledge at the special LUDUS pledge level. This level is a deposit against the cost of carton/case multiples (5+ games/carton) of this KS edition game (base game or deluxe + all unlocked SGs) at the normal retailer-friendly discount (off KS price). You will also get a free demo set with your 1st carton ordered and access to promo and special additions.\nOnce pledged, we will then message you to confirm your final order, how many of each version you want, confirm shipping and delivery address after the kickstarter has ended. We guarantee your order will get sent out at the same time as all other backers rewards allowing you to jump ahead and get your order many months before normal retailers will! You can of course contact us through KS messages or info[at]badcatgames.eu to discuss any of this in more detail.\nYou can include any further add-ons you wish from this list by using the big manage your pledge button at the top of this page and manually adding the cost of your chosen add-on(s) to your total pledge amount.\n\nAll rewards will be confirmed for each backer at the Pledge Manager stage after the kickstarter is complete.\nThis is the replacement Active Player Marker (G1) included in the Deluxe game set.\nPLAY\n\nWe are also super excited to be able to offer 2 alternative sculpts of this famous gladiator (your choice of which models you want will be confirmed during the pledge manager stage) mastered at PDModels in the UK. If you want more than 1 miniature, just increase your pledge by \u00a314/$18 for each additional model you are purchasing.\nAlternative gladiator sculpts\n You can follow us on these social media channels\non Facebook\non Instagram\non Twitter\nor direct on our website... \nAs is now standard on boardgame kickstarters, shipping will be charged after the kickstarter (within the Pledge Manager). This is as fair as we can be considering prices go up every year! We are subsidising shipping everywhere as much as we can and depending on our final funding amount, we will subsidise this further. Shipping costs shown are for untracked services only, based on estimated weight of the game (inc. upgrades and stretchgoals). We did this for our previous kickstarter with similar box weight and backers remained happy.\nUK - \u00a32\nUSA/CANADA - \u00a39/\u00a310\nEU - \u00a39\nEU2* - \u00a312\nRoW - \u00a315-\u00a320\n* Destinations inc. Iceland, Switzerland, Malta, Scandinavia & Slovakia\nWe will ship to our international fulfillment centres at our cost.\nWeight of final package is estimated as <2kg.\nTracked shipping service upgrades and all additional extras (e.g. extra game copies) can be added in the pledge manager after the campaign has finished.\nFor shipping we are working with multiple international partners in USA, CA, UK and EU to find the most cost effective and safest way to get you your rewards. Only 1% of backers from our previous kickstarter had problems with delivery (usually due to changes of address).\nBeing our second project, we know how to maximise both quality and speed to get a game project manufactured. However delays in manufacture and shipping can crop up due to many circumstances outside our control. Therefore our Aug 2019 deadline for delivery of this project is a calculated estimate. In fact we aim to beat this target by at least a couple of months to finish early for June 2019 but are being sensible and adding in some extra time. We will keep you informed of progress throughout with updated estimates.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter.

We have already sent off some of the files for pre-production checks and will be ready to pick up speed and complete the file checking stage soon after the kickstarter finishes.\n\nThe game is 100% complete, requiring only tweaking and final artwork to be added, depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked.

Dark water suddenly rose from the land, invading our homes and lives. They say it came from the depths inside the Loop. Whatever it was the Flood changed everything. Nothing would ever be the same again.\nWelcome back to the Loop. Things are different now. \nIn 2017, we released Tales from the Loop the tabletop roleplaying game based on St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s first art book. That game was an instant hit, selling out its two initial print runs and winning no less than five ENnies (including Best Game and Product of the Year) as well as three Golden Geek Awards (including Best RPG).\nNow, it\u2019s time to return to the Loop and continue the story. In Things from the Flood you play Teens in the 1990s \u2013 a decade of change and disaster. You're still balancing day to day life with solving exciting mysteries with your friends. But this is a darker time, and the stakes are higher.\nWe are the Free League, creators and publishers of roleplaying games such as Mutant: Year Zero, Coriolis - The Third Horizon, Tales from the Loop and Forbidden Lands. As well as the original publishers of Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s art books. The lead writer of this book is the seasoned Swedish game writer Nils Hintze, backed up by the entire Free League team who handle project management, editing, and graphic design. \nThe vast majority of the art in the game is done by Simon St\u00e5lenhag himself. Most of the art will be drawn from the pages of the Things from the Flood artbook - many scenarios in the game are based directly on illustrations in the artbook - but the RPG will contain some new original art as well, including the cover image.\nThe book will have approximately 200 pages, in the US Letter format.\nTales from the Loop Backer? If you backed the original Tales from the Loop RPG back in late 2016, you will get a PDF of the Things from the Flood core book, including the digital stretch goals in this Kickstarter, at no extra cost. You can still join this Kickstarter to get the printed book.\nThings are different now. \nThe world does not seem so innocent anymore. \nIts the \u201890s and the once mighty Loop has been shut down, the experiment abandonded and the land bought by Krafta, a powerful corporation. You are no Kids anymore, but Teens trying to find your way in a decade of change \u2013 both within and around you. \nThe Flood has transformed the once pastoral islands into a dark marshland. Some say that the dark water pouring out of the ground comes from within the Loop itself. Machines are afflicted by a strange virus turning them unreliable and dangerous. \nStill, your lives go on as before. You go to school, fall miserably in love, try to do everything possible to fend off boredom. When you hear about other teens going missing, and even turning up dead, you realize its time to gather the group again.\nOne way or another you fill find out what these Things from the Flood really are. \nYou play Teens growing up in the 1990s, trying to balance everyday life while at the same time solving dark mysteries together with your friends. \nThe core of the game is the same as in Tales from the Loop, but the themes are different. Gone are the childlike tales of wonder and discovery, in their place are dark threats to the Teens and their world. Everything is changing, everything is falling apart. Figuring out how to deal with this is a big part of the game. \nYou are no kid anymore, the world is both more exciting and more dangerous. Teenagers can get hurt \u2013 and even die. The stakes are higher than ever.\nBoth! Things from the Flood expands the scope of Tales from the Loop to the 1990s. You can continue your campaign with the Kids from the original game or create brand new player characters. We call it a \"standalone expansion\" because everything that is needed to play the game is included in the book. That\u2019s right, no previous experience is needed at all, just get the book and start playing right away.\nIf you\u2019ve read and played the Tales from the Loop RPG, you will find yourself right at home, this book expands the setting and introduces new exciting mysteries and threats to explore. \nThe game engine of Things from the Flood is the same as the one for Tales from the Loop RPG and is based on our previous game Mutant: Year Zero, that was awarded with a Silver ENnie for Best Rules at Gencon 2015.\nThe core mechanic is the same: To make a skill roll, you simply grab a number of dice for your attribute score, skill level and gear, and roll them all together. You need at least one six to succeed, and extra sixes can give you stunts and other bonus effects.\nThings from the Flood will be available in two languages: English and Swedish. The Swedish title of the game will be Flodsk\u00f6rden and you will be able to choose your preferred language in the pledge manager once the Kickstarter has concluded.\nWith your help, we can make Things from the Flood even more amazing. Below are the stretch goals we have lined up if we exceed our initial funding goal.\nSTRETCH GOAL 1: HARDCOVER BOOK \u2013 UNLOCKED! \nIf we reach this goal, we will print Things from the Flood core RPG book with a top-quality hardback cover.\nSTRETCH GOAL 2: UPDATED MAP OF M\u00c4LAR\u00d6ARNA \u2013 UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach this goal, we will print a updated large full-color map of M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna, the main game setting.

Simon St\u00e5lenhag is best known for his highly imaginative images and stories portraying illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian landscapes (expanded into America in his latest book The Electric State). Tales from the Loop was ranked by The Guardian as one of the \u201c10 Best Dystopias,\u201d in the company of works such as Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial and Andrew Niccol\u2019s Gattaca.\nNot only have St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s unique and cinematic images earned him a worldwide fan base, but have also made him a go-to storyteller, concept artist and illustrator for both the film and computer gaming industry. This year it was announced that The Electric State will be turned into a major motion picture and Amazon Prime ordered a full season of a TV show based on Tales from the Loop.\nDuring his twelve years as a game writer, Nils Hintze has written a great number of scenarios, articles and reviews, as well as being the main author of critically praised and award winning Tales from the Loop roleplaying game.

The conflicts in his games are often built on personal dilemmas, where thrill and mystery is not seldom mixed with humor.\nNils is educated in creative writing, but he normally works as a psychologist. Nils is also one of the three creators of the Swedish role-playing podcast Podcon.\nFree League Publishing is the international name of Swedish game and book publisher Fria Ligan AB.

What used to be virtual reality is now reality, and sports that once occupied your flat-screen now occupy the world stage. The largest of them embodies the evolution and integration of athleticism and machinery. Once every five years, hundreds of millions of viewers tune in to witness the spectacle that is M.E.C.H.s: Mechanized Entertainment Combat Heroes.\nSuit up your Meeples for the ultimate battle royale with...\nSome items displayed are stretch goals and will need to be unlocked.\nThe amazing ITEMeeples are snapped into your Mech when you earn it in play!\nMotion GIF may take a moment to load.\nTiny Epic Mechs is an arena-style player-vs-player action-programming game. It features ITEMeeples with plastic molded power armors and a Mech suit that the ITEMeeples actually go inside of. \nIn Tiny Epic Mechs, players take on the roles of highly skilled and athletic Mech pilots. \nThey compete in a free-for-all battle royale over the span of six rounds. In each round, players select four of eight available actions to program. \nThese actions keep you moving around the arena while allowing you to deploy high-scoring defensive turrets, plant explosive land mines with hidden values, collect resources, purchase weaponry, and power up into your Power Armor or eventually the highly-sought-after Mech Suit. While each player has their own Power Armor, there is only one Mech Suit, reserved for the king of the hill. \nYour programmed actions are played out one at a time around the table until all players have executed their four actions. When you cross paths with another player, combat ensues. During combat, players exchange fire until one player is out of ammo and must retreat, or they are defeated and forced to reset. \nCombat is fast, and you can use each weapon only one time per fight, so the more weapons you have, the longer you'll last. Weapons are categorized into three types, and each type counters one of the other types. If you time your weapons correctly, you can counter your opponent and unleash a more powerful attack and gain an edge over them. Dealing a lot of damage to your opponent will wow the audience and earn you lots of points, which brings you closer to victory. You also score victory points every other round based on area control and who controls the Mech. At the end of the game, you also earn points for each weapon you own. \nWhy Back This Project? \n Great Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action.

Blockchain data is open, decentralized, and immutable.\nFeatures encourage thoughtful content, altruism, and self-awareness, while discouraging reactive and hateful posts.\nNo ads. Peepeth is accountable to users, not advertisers.\nRelease schedule: web browser version (beta) available now! Easy-to-use web version coming January 2019. Mobile app coming in March 2019.\nFirst peep by the founder of Ethereum\nCoin Center demonstrating Peepeth to United States Congressman Tom Emmer of Minnesota\u2019s 6th District.\nSocial media is broken.\nAdvertising-driven social networks are taking a toll on our wellbeing. They:\nInvade our privacy & sell our data\nHave total control and custody of our online identities\nAre filled with trolling and harassment\nManipulate our feeds to keep us online longer\nCater to advertisers at our expense\nProblems with social media\nData is saved to an open, public, and permanent database (the Ethereum blockchain), so anyone can make a competing interface for your data. Peepeth does not own or control your account or content.\nNo ads: Peepeth doesn't optimize for ad impressions (which introduces perverse incentives).\nFeatures encourage positive contribution over quantity. Peepeth encourages you to think before you post or \"like\", support charity, and learn more about yourself.\nThe blockchain puts you in control\nOn Peepeth, accounts and posts (\u201cpeeps\u201d) are stored on the blockchain. That gives you exclusive control over your account and content. No intermediary is technically required for you to post or access data.\nNo edit or delete (& censorship resistant backend)\nPeeps are publicly accessible, potentially forever. This creates accountability and gives your words more weight. The result is more considered peeps.\nThe datastore is strongly censorship resistant, because of the blockchain's immutability. Note, however, that Peepeth.com will not display content that violates the terms of use. See the \"Can Peepeth be censored?\" section below for more.\nSpam resistant\nPeepeth is spam-resistant because it costs money to write to the blockchain. Don\u2019t worry\u2014 Peepeth foots the bill for you\u2014 but spammers lose their free-peeping privilege, making spamming a relatively expensive prospect.\nTransparency\nAll data is openly stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone can monitor the blockchain to see what Peepeth.com is not displaying. (Those who purchase the \"Authenticity badge\" or higher will be able to easily audit content that is removed from the main feed.)\nAlternate apps\nAnyone can start their own front-end interface that reads and writes Peepeth data (yourPeepeth.com), because the blockchain protocol is open.\nMonetize with tips\nAccept tips in cryptocurrency (Peepeth charges a 10% fee).\nVerifications\nVerify your identity by linking your other social media accounts through the blockchain. Twitter and GitHub currently supported; more coming soon. Peepeth charges a fee in cryptocurrency for verifications.\nOther blockchain services\nThere are many other possibilities for blockchain-based services in the future. Peepeth can interact with other smart contracts (self-executing computer programs on the Ethereum blockchain) to provide decentralized services.\nPeepeth's mission is to encourage positive contribution, both online and in the world. \nThe blockchain is only part of the story. Peepeth's features encourage thoughtful, responsible engagement, while discouraging hate, spam, and reactive posts.\nCharity badge\nHow can we do good most effectively? Buy a charity badge to support and raise awareness for an important, neglected, and tractable problem: malaria.\nYour charity badge is shown on your avatar, and bumps you to the top of follower suggestions (giving you serious Peepeth-cred).\nTogether, we\u2019ve purchases over 1000 long-lasting insecticidal bed nets from the Against Malaria Foundation, the top-ranked charity by several top Effective Altruism charity evaluators. Learn more here: https://peepeth.com/malaria\nOne \u201clike\" per day\nInstead of a Like button, Peepeth has the once-per-day Ens\u014d. Its rarity makes it more special to receive, and it encourages the creation of dignified, beautiful, and timeless content. An Ens\u014d is forever; there is no undo.\nEns\u014d (\u5186\u76f8 , \"circle\") is a circle that is hand-drawn in one uninhibited brushstroke. It represents creativity, freedom of expression, and unity.\nInsight badge (in development)\nThe words you use reliably predict your Big Five personality traits. Learn more about yourself by having powerful artificial intelligence derive your personality traits from your public peeps, and compare your results on Peepeth to your other social media accounts. Keep your results private, delete them forever, or display them on your profile.\nThis feature is a fun way to learn more about yourself, and to find others you might be interested in following. It's an optional paid service.\nInsight credits can also be gifted. One credit entitles you to perform this analysis on your peeps or on your content on another public social media account. Learn more here: https://peepeth.com/a/insight\nAre you sure?\nPeepeth periodically reminds you to review your post before committing it to the blockchain, resulting in fewer typos and greater reflection before posting.\nPeeps are forever. Reminders give you a chance to reconsider.\n#Politics\n(Under development) Many people find online political discussion frustrating and stressful. On Peepeth, users are urged to include the #politics hashtag in political peeps. This hides the content (but not the peep) by default (users must click \"reveal\"), giving users the freedom to ignore potentially toxic discussions. This is an evolving solution to a tough problem.\nLess \u201cme\u201d, more \u201cwe\"\nYou can pin a peep to your profile. Unlike Twitter, however, you must pin someone else\u2019s post (not your own). Pinning lets you recognize someone else's contribution.\nCode of conduct\nPeepeth\u2019s 130-word terms of use is adapted from a discourse on the Buddhist doctrine of Right Speech by Thich Nhat Hanh (in secular form). Peepeth.com's enforcement of the code is transparent.\nSee the code here: https://peepeth.com/a/terms\nMore on the way\nPeepeth is just getting started. There are other novel features in the pipeline.\nAlejandro Machado, \"\u00d0app User Experience Audit\"\nPeepeth\u2019s invite-only web beta is live, and is leading the way for decentralized app (dapp) usability.\nPeepeth is one of the few non-game and non-trading blockchain apps in use. It has pioneered novel techniques that make it very user-friendly. It has received 7500+ invite requests, and tens of thousands of peeps have been immortalized on the blockchain.\nIt is currently featured on every major mobile dapp browser (Trust, Coinbase Wallet, Status, Cipher), and by dapp portals such as App.co, EveryDapp.com, and other portals.\nPeepeth is one of the most usable decentralized, blockchain-powered apps. However, it isn\u2019t usable enough for mainstream users:\nUsers need cryptocurrency to use Peepeth. Getting it is hard.\nUsers need special software (a browser extension or dapp browser) to use Peepeth.\nNo mobile app yet.\nReaching the funding goal will help Peepeth become one of the first widely used dapps (decentralized applications):\nPeepeth will be free to use (currently, cryptocurrency is required)\nPeepeth will work without special software\nMore features critical to usability will be added\nDesign improvements\nFulfillment of backer's rewards\nThe Kickstarter goal is just a starting point. Reaching the stretch goals will give Peepeth a much better chance of becoming a self-sustaining mainstream platform.\n$250,000\niOS app\nMuch improved art and design\nMore novel features\nMore robust back-end\n$350,000\nMobile apps on iOS and Android\nGreatly improved design, branding, and messaging\nRobust and scalable back-end application\nBetter user support\n$1,000,000\nA top team\nWorld-class web and mobile apps\nBetter support and user education\nOutreach and partnership opportunities (integrations and widget)\nAll efforts will be made to achieve these goals regardless of the amount raised.\nHow can an advertising-free platform sustain itself?\nPeepeth sells features and takes 10% of tips. For example, it sells social media verifications, Insight credits (in development), and feature badges (such as the rewards here).\nThe success of verifications alone is showing that this model can be a viable alternative to advertising. Kickstarter funding will help build Peepeth into a product that can sustain itself without ad revenue.\nPeepeth\u2019s rewards enable special functionality on Peepeth.com. Most rewards consist of at least one blockchain badge (enabling special abilities), and Insight credits that can be gifted or used to gain personality insights from your peeps or other social media accounts.\nInscription on the blockchain\nSupporters at all levels will have their name immortalized on IPFS and the blockchain (including their link and message at some levels). This info will be shown on a special backers page on Peepeth.com.\nBlockchain badges\nIf your blockchain address owns a blockchain badge, Peepeth will detect it and grant your account special powers. Badges will be displayed on your peeps (except Authenticity badge).\nSome badges have unique names, images, or other unique inscriptions. If you are rewarded a unique badge, you can name / inscribe your badge on a first come first serve basis (or it can be done later, or not at all). Badge details will be displayed on your profile page.\nBlockchain badges are transferrable, but you'll need a small amount of cryptocurrency to send them (to cover the blockchain transaction fee). Insight credits are not transferred with the badge; you have to transfer them separately.\nSome badge privileges (automatic #nsfw flagging of peeps) can be deactivated if abused.\nExtra badges\nSome support levels include extra badges in addition to the main one.\nThe extra badges do not come with the Insight credits, tshirts, nested badges, or inner-circle privileges that normally accompany badge purchases. For example, the Penguin badge comes with two Honor badges. Honor badges, purchased by themselves, usually include Insight credits, tshirts, and lower-tier badges. However, the Honor badge that comes with the Penguin badge will not include those extras, just the core functionality of the Honor badge.\nInsight credits\nInsight credits are non-blockchain credits that can be used on Peepeth.com. Each credit can be redeemed for a personality assessment of your public peeps, done by advanced artificial intelligence developed by IBM Watson (substantiated by research). You'll receive a graph showing your personality traits and other characteristics, which you can display publicly on your profile, keep private on Peepeth.com, or delete completely.\nYou can re-test at a later time, and also compare your Peepeth results with your other social media accounts.\nInsight credits are giftable; you can bestow them on peeps you like.\nBehind the scenes\nAt some support levels, you\u2019ll get a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process, in the form of emails / video updates from the founder. Supporters will be kept in the loop in a way not commonly seen with other software development projects.\nThese updates will be more impromptu than formal; and give you a personal perspective on the process of building Peepeth.\nYour logo on Peepeth.com\nAt higher levels, backers will have their logo displayed on the front page of Peepeth.com for one year.\nThe more your company contributes above 10k, the higher and larger its logo will appear. Email contact@peepeth.com to learn how to contribute more than the Kickstarter max.\nWith funding, Peepeth will have a good chance of becoming the first mainstream dapp (decentralized application) and could introduce cryptocurrency and Ethereum to a mass audience.\nIn addition to its social media functionality, Peepeth will also be an easy introduction to cryptocurrency. It will teach users the basics, while not requiring them to buy cryptocurrency or install special software. Peepeth will also incentivize new users to acquire ether, because of the services offered on Peepeth and the opportunity to interact with other dapps.\nIs Peepeth scalable? Will it clog the Ethereum network?\nPeepeth has pioneered innovative techniques to batch content in a small number of blockchain transactions. No matter how many users it has, the core functionality will execute a constant number of transactions (not including other optional blockchain features).\nWhat does Peepeth mean?\nCheck out https://peepeth.com/a/name for more (including pronunciation)!\nIs Peepeth \u201cTwitter on the blockchain\u201d?\nPeepeth may look similar to existing services, but Peepeth is fundamentally different because of its use of the blockchain, its focus on encouraging positive contribution, and lack of reliance on ads.\nPeepeth is not neutral: it optimizes for thoughtfulness, self-awareness, and charity.\nPeepeth's back-end is open and immutable. Peeps are forever; which encourages more thoughtful posts.\nPeepeth doesn't control your account or content (you do).\nNo ads\nCan Peepeth be censored?\nPeepeth.com is a centralized, opinionated front-end for the Peepeth smart contract. The emphasis here is on cultivating positive contribution, mindful discourse, and self-awareness.\nPeepeth.com is not a neutral \u201canything goes\u201d platform, despite the immutability of its datastore. Peepeth.com is governed by a terms of use, and peeps that are not in accord with it will not be visible, by default, on the main feed.\nModeration is transparent on Peepeth.com, because of the open nature of the blockchain. That keeps Peepeth.com accountable to users, who are free to build and use another front-end for Peepeth data.\nIf the front-end can choose what content is displayed, how is it different than a normal social network?\nNo central body controls what gets posted to the blockchain. The data-store is open, so anybody can write to and read from the smart contract without Peepeth.com's permission. If Peepeth.com (or another front-end) imposes a too-strict terms of use policy, users will find out and move to another front-end.\nCan Peepeth be used for criminal purposes?\nPeepeth\u2019s criminal appeal is limited. Pairing payments and communications on the same channel reveals more info about criminals and their networks than non-crypto communication channels used with crypto payments. Pairing communication and money removes a level of anonymity because of the traceable nature of blockchain transactions.\nWill Peepeth be usable by people not versed in crypto?\nYes. The blockchain will be largely invisible when using Peepeth. Peepeth will, however, educate users about blockchain, and offer optional blockchain-based services.\nThanks to the thousands of people who\u2019ve shown support for Peepeth by requesting an invite, joining and peeping, or offering advice and suggestions. I appreciate everyone\u2019s contributions; Peepeth would not be possible without your help!\nCheers!\n-Bevan, Peepeth founder", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many challenges ahead for Peepeth. Building decentralized applications is hard; making them usable and scalable is harder; and bootstrapping a community is the hardest.\n\nNonetheless, Peepeth has made headway on all three fronts with limited resources. A lot of technical and design heavy lifting is done, and there\u2019s a small but strong community in this invite-only stage.\n\nThe next steps will be challenging, but with funding, I\u2019m confident they\u2019ll be completed.\n\nA general risk that Peepeth faces is the difficulty of predicting a timeline, because of the unpredictability of software development. To mitigate that risk, the estimates here are conservative. Regular updates will be sent to keep everyone informed of progress.\n\nScaling the backend application will be a challenge. It\u2019s more difficult to scale than traditional applications because of the complexity of syncing data across the blockchain and server. It will require more resources than scaling traditional apps but it\u2019s a manageable problem.\n\nA related challenge is the eventual possible strain on the Ethereum blockchain, as users may choose to use optional blockchain features. Note however that using Peepeth will not result in additional blockchain transactions, because of an efficient batching mechanism that Peepeth uses; so network impact will likely be minimal. Also, scaling efforts are underway for Ethereum itself, and those non-essential features could be throttled.\n\nThe technical challenges, difficult though they may be, are surmountable. The more difficult challenges relate to product appeal, usability, and bootstrapping a community.\n\nPeepeth is not a neutral platform, and its goal and value proposition will polarize. The charity aspect and positivity focus of Peepeth will grate on some, and others may not like how it attempts to encourage positive contribution. That\u2019s by design; but it will be important to get the branding and messaging right, so that Peepeth\u2019s intent is viewed accurately.\n\nThe perceived complexity of the blockchain is also a risk for wider adoption. Although blockchain will be almost completely abstracted from the user experience, users will still have to be educated about keys; and many lay users may simply abandon the process at the word \u201cblockchain\". It\u2019s unknown to what extent this will deter users; but a major effort will be put on on-ramping and educating users as painlessly as possible.\n\nExisting social networks pose a risk. The network effect of the incumbents is strong, so Peepeth will have to be focused in its approach and branding and make itself unique. Gaining mainstream traction could take time.\n\nGovernment regulation of crypto could also pose a risk. Crypto is restricted or illegal in some countries; and that could affect Peepeth\u2019s future.\n\nNew ventures are risky. Blockchain applications are perhaps especially so, because of the additional complexity and user confusion they can cause. However, Peepeth has made strides so far, and has a good chance of becoming the first mainstream dapp.\n\nNone of these risks would prevent the main goal set forth in this Kickstarter from being achieved.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Bevan Barton\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nHi, I'm Bevan.

This new board game, designed by Adam Kwapi\u0144ski, is the result of a collaboration between Awaken Realms (creators of This War of Mine: TBG, The Edge: Dawnfall and Lords of Hellas) and Rebel (creators of Drako, Dream Home and K2) . It's a 1-5 players semi-cooperative Sci-Fi horror where you and your friends try to survive while attempting to fulfill your secret objectives that may sometimes collide. It will also enable full co-op as well as solo play experience. \nNemesis offers one-of-a-kind gameplay, that you currently won't find anywhere else in the board game world. It has been in professional development for over three years, so it already plays very well, provides good balance and contains a multitude of interesting mechanics, as proven by the prototype reviews below. \n\nIf you like Sci-Fi survival settings and ships swarming with alien life forms, you will love it - and if that genre was never on your radar, this game is likely to change your mind! \nBy backing this project on Kickstarter you will get all unlocked Stretch Goals for free to every Core Box! \n        Click to see details about sundrop\n                   *Out of all reviews / movies two were paid: Cardboard Rhino (rules presentation / tutorial how to play that took a lot of time to make!) and Man vs Meeple (which is a preview showing the game in detail). All other videos were not paid. \n Asymmetric crew members \n                                                                                                       During the game, you will control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat. Soldier on the other hand... \nYour characters complement each other and will need to collaborate in order to survive. There's one catch: you are never sure who can you trust! \nCinematic experience\nYou drift back from the cold void of the hyper sleep. At first, you only feel a tingling in your mouth and a taste of your blood, but soon all the other symptoms hit you. Your head is exploding. Your stomach is turning. A strange noise rings in your ears. This sound is loud, piercing. An alarm!\nFighting through dizziness, you open your eyes, the lights of other hibernation chambers blinding you momentarily. Broken glass. Wet floor. A stasis pod burst open like a ripe watermelon, dripping with red. The thing inside was once your friend. Now it barely resembles a human, ripped open from the inside - damage too severe for a simple stasis pod failure. You raise up and check if your other mates are all right. The good news is: they are. You all gather in the middle of the room, shivering, half-naked. The bad news is\u2026 plentiful. Ship stuck in the middle of nowhere. Many systems damaged. Bulkheads breached. Unknown contaminants in the air. You also hear noises in the hollow halls of the ship. You\u2019re not alone! \n\nPlaying Nemesis will take you into the heart of Sci-Fi survival horror in all its terror. A soldier fires blindly down a corridor, trying to stop the alien advance. A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A hacker breaks into ship\u2019s navigational system and enables self-destruction. A pilot sets the alien nest on fire, while his friend seals himself in the control room. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. All this \u2013 and other memorable actions \u2013 await! \nShip exploration\nOne of most important parts of Nemesis gameplay is exploration. Every room of the ship may contain useful items and enables a different special action, from activating fire extinguishers to cutting out infected tissue. This makes it necessary to reveal as many room tiles as possible. But beware, while searching for a proper room, you will make noise that may draw some uninvited guests. \nShip's layout is randomized before each game, so you are never sure what to expect behind next corner... \nUnique combat \nThis game is more about surviving than killing. When you face horrors from outer space, you may panic, and even if you manage to put up a fight, you will never know how much punishment your opponent can take. Killing intruders is a tough challenge, especially since ammunition is a rare commodity on the ship. \nEvolving Intruders \nJerry, big news! We\u2019ve received the first transmission with some preliminary data. It seems it\u2019s an auxotrophic, anaerobic, mineral-based trans-dimensional life form (what a mouthful). No DNA, XNA or anything else we could expect. Instead, a strange self-propagating crystalline structure. Outer skin layer? Pure Lonsdaleite! We've never seen more than few grains on Earth, and this thing is covered in it! Fifty percent tougher than diamond, go figure. \nIt sheds this outer skin during each development cycle, thanks to a violent thermochemical reaction. But that's not the worst part. You've heard about this research into weird crystals with a structure partially hidden in other dimensions? Well, our guys say these creatures employ a similar process. Much of their growth happens... elsewhere. Then, when they gather enough energy, they shift modified organs and body structures back into this world. The may also be native to deep space, as they survive vacuum well enough to put Tardigrades to shame. Anne also believes they\u2019re an extremely adaptable omnivore. Sounds scary, right? I hope the top knows what they\u2019re doing with this one.\nIntruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes, the stronger they become. \nTime pressure\nEncroaching enemies are not the only thing that pushes you to work faster. The ship is already counting down to the emergency hyper-jump. If you fail to repair the engines before that happens, or if the jump catches you outside of your stasis pod, extreme acceleration is going to turn your character into a red splatter on one of the walls. \n\nWorld and design \nWe've reached for the stars. Asteroid mining was booming. Colonies on Mars and Venus approached self-sufficiency. Then, a wanderer came from far depths of the universe at half the speed of light. It glanced the Earth's moon, ripped it apart, threw out of its orbit, and caused catastrophic damage below. Solar system plunged into crisis.  \nStill, many chose to focus on profit, as the residue from the impact contained unknown minerals and exotic matter that made our plain old asteroids seem boring. Obsolete spaceships, previously used for colonizing the solar system, were refitted and crewed by people desperate enough to spend years in vast spaces between the stars, hunting for the next big catch. They became whalers of deep black, scavenging for comets, asteroids, dead proto-planets, and other strange objects coming from far corners of the universe.  \nClick to see full Intruder design\nMany disappeared. It was to be expected. Intercepting unknown objects at incredible speeds was not exactly safe. Then, there are rumors at least one crew found something they were not supposed to...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully finished 3 Kickstarter projects. While the Nemesis campaign goes live, we're in the middle of shipping the first wave of Lords of Hellas game. Soon after the end of this campaign, we estimate to start the shipping of The Edge: Dawnfall, which was delayed.\n\nThese two projects at this stage are managed production and delivery team, while Nemesis is on creative stage, so they do not collide. \n\nWe are confident about the delivery of the game - we have accumulated vast experience working on other titles and projects. The only risk factor, which can always happen, is a delay in delivery due to unforeseen circumstances. Even though the bulk of design work is already completed, as proven by many reviews, Nemesis is a huge and complicated title, and in pursuit of great quality it might take more time to complete. \n\nPlease note that this is not a pre-order and the final product might slightly change in the process or get delayed. We are fully devoted to creating an amazing experience and you can trust us that every choice we make will only be aimed at improving the standard of the final product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a370 or more", "title": "Core Box", "descp": "Nemesis Core Box including all unlocked Stretch Goals.\nThis pledge does not include shipping.

A mysterious outbreak has claimed the lives of nearly everyone there... what's worse is they are crawling the stores and commons as Zombies hungry for flesh. Only a few Survivors remain. Are you among the Survivors? Or are you one of the ravenous Zombies? The choice is yours in Tiny Epic Zombies!\nArm your Meeples for Survival with...\nBazooka and Katana included in Deluxe games only. Additional items unlockable through stretch goals.\n   Tiny Epic Zombies is a 30 minute, 1-5 player, game of survival that features 5 distinct play modes:\n1. Cooperative team-play with game controlled Zombies.\n2. Cooperative team-play with Zombies controlled by a non-team player.\n3. Competitive free-for-all with game controlled Zombies.\n4. Competitive free-for-all with Zombies controlled by a player.\n5. Solo.\nIn Tiny Epic Zombies, survivors are always on the run, collecting weapons, killing Zombies and working toward completing objectives. Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you.\nWhy Back This Project? \nGreat Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action. Variable survivor and Zombie powers, and several objectives, keep you playing time and time again.\nGenerous Discount! Save almost 20% by pledging on Kickstarter.\nKS Limited Exclusive Content! - Deluxe copies will NOT enter regular distribution.

However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store. \n  GENERAL INFO: 1-5 players, 30 minutes, 5 play modes including competitive and cooperative play.\nTHEME: Modern day Zombie outbreak at the Echo Ridge Mall.\nHOOK: Fast paced, portable, and tons of replayability. Play as the survivors or the Zombies. Plus ITEMeeples!\nWIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.\nOVERVIEW: Simplicity shines in Tiny Epic Zombies. \nBased on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.\nExample Survivor:\nNote: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.\nIf you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.\nAs a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!\nAfter you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.\nAfter you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.\nExample Objective:\nThis is one of many Scenarios in the game. Each Scenario presents an objective. You'll have 3 Scenario in each game. Complete all 3 and you win!\nExample Zombie:\nAs a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies.

So we did what we do best \u2013 got inside. \nFor the past year, we sent Patrik Hermansson undercover in the alt-right. He infiltrated the heart of the movement, and he caught it all on hidden camera. He heard them boast of ties to the White House, and he was among neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville.\nBased off our undercover research and infiltration into the movement, we have unique and unprecedented footage and access inside the international alt-right movement.\nThis story is too important not to be told \u2013 but regular production companies and distributors aren't comfortable taking it on. We know the only way to bring this project to life is to turn to passionate individuals who care about the future of this country's democracy. \nWe have one goal: finish the movie so that we can expose the alt-right for what it is: international, well-funded, and able to influence in the highest corridors of power.\nOnce finished, the movie will form the center piece of our \u201cRight the wrongs\u201d Tour of America. We will take our film to town halls and campuses as part of an educational initiative to shed light on the alt-right and develop support for how to combat it and close it down.\nPress\n\"Mr. Hermansson, who was sent undercover by the British anti-racist watchdog group Hope Not Hate, spent months insinuating himself into the alt-right, using his Swedish nationality (many neo-Nazis are obsessed with Sweden because of its \u201cNordic\u201d heritage) as a way in. It wasn\u2019t always easy. \u201cYou want to punch them in the face,\u201d he told me of the people he met undercover. \u201cYou want to scream and do whatever \u2014 leave. But you can\u2019t do any of those things. You have to sit and smile.\u201d\" \u2013 The New York Times\n\"Speaking of his experiences infiltrating the network of white supremacists, Patrik Hermansson said: \u201cFor almost a year I\u2019ve been at the heart of a world of extreme racism, antisemitism, Holocaust denial, esoteric Nazi rituals and wild conspiracy theories.\u201cWhat I found was a movement that sometimes glorifies Nazi Germany, openly supports genocidal ideas and is unrelentingly racist, sexist and homophobic.\u201d\" \u2013 The Independent\n\"In the Hope not Hate report, Hermansson writes about meeting Jorjani: \"I ask about AltRight Corporation and its aims and objectives and he explains how it is a \u201cgovernment in waiting.\u201d But then, out of nowhere, as though it was no big deal, he says: \u201cWe had connections in the Trump administration, we were going to do things!\u201d\" \u2013 Newsweek\nEndorsements\n\"It has been a honour to be involved in this very important project.

Eight times the people of this Earth, over vast millennia, built their civilizations, reaching heights we cannot even fully imagine now. They spoke to the stars, reshaped the creatures of the world, and mastered form and essence. They built cities and machines that have since crumbled to dust, leaving only their barest remnants.\nThis is the Ninth World. The people of the prior worlds are gone\u2014scattered, disappeared, or transcended. But their works remain, in the places and devices that still contain some germ of their original function. Some call these magic, but the wise know that these are our legacy. They are our future. They are the...\nSet a billion years in our future, Numenera is a tabletop roleplaying game about exploration and discovery. The people of the Ninth World suffer through a dark age, an era of isolation and struggle in the shadow of the ancient wonders crafted by advanced civilizations now millennia gone. But discovery awaits for those brave enough to seek out the works of the prior worlds. Those who uncover and master the numenera can unlock the powers and abilities of the ancients, and bring new light to a struggling world.\nThe original Numenera RPG was launched via a 2012 Kickstarter campaign that shattered every record (at the time) for tabletop RPGs. The corebook has seen four printings, and Numenera is enjoyed by tens of thousands of gamers in an active global community. We have published over 60 supplements and accessories, and released a terrific starter set for new players. The Ninth World has spawned a critically-acclaimed hit computer game, board games, an excellent short film, a line of novels, and other licensed items, and Numenera has been translated into many languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, German, and Portuguese.\nThis has been a fast-moving campaign, with lots of new information revealed and many stretch goals unlocked. If you're new to Numenera, scroll down. If you're familiar with Numenera and want a guide to the information and stretch goals unveiled so far, check out the info at the bottom of this update.\n  Numenera is a game in which player characters explore the ruins of aeons past to gather amazing treasures and help build a new future for a world struggling in darkness. Since the launch of Numenera in 2013, we have delivered well on the first part, but we\u2019ve always wanted to do a more thorough job exploring that second part. That desire has led us to Numenera 2 and this Kickstarter campaign.\nThrough this Kickstarter we\u2019re going to replace the existing corebook with two new corebooks. The first is called Numenera Discovery and the second Numenera Destiny.\nNumenera Discovery will be a book that covers familiar territory; it is basically a revision of the original Numenera corebook. Next summer, we will allow the original corebook to go out of print, and Numenera Discovery will take its place. In Numenera Discovery, you\u2019ll get some revisions to make things clearer and more fun, and to increase the options available to players. Nanos, Jacks, and Glaives will get an overhaul. Many foci and some of the descriptors might see some reworking. You\u2019ll have more options, clearer rules, and perhaps a bit of expansion to the regions of the Steadfast and the Beyond that are covered in the existing corebook.\n  But Numenera Discovery is not a new edition. We will make virtually no changes to the way the game plays mechanically\u2014and none of those changes affect the way NPCs, creatures, or items like cyphers or artifacts work. We also won\u2019t be making changes to the setting. So if you already play Numenera, your bestiaries, adventures, card decks, character portfolios, and books like Into the Night, Technology Compendium, and Jade Colossus will not be affected by these changes. We will not issue any \u201csecond editions\u201d of the existing supporting titles\u2014and if you choose not to get Numenera Discovery, future Numenera supplements will work fine with your existing Numenera corebook. Your ongoing campaign will flow smoothly through the change in corebooks. You will even be able to mix existing characters with those from Numenera Discovery into your game. In fact, the game can be played with both the existing corebook and Numenera Discovery in use at the same game table!\n(One small exception: Numenera Character Options and Numenera Character Options 2 will remain compatible, but will become substantially less relevant following the improvements to characters in Numenera Discovery. We will retire those titles.)\nAs excited as we are about Numenera Discovery, we may be even more excited about Numenera Destiny. This title will enable characters to truly become a part of the setting\u2014to help shape the future of the Ninth World. The people of the Ninth World are locked in a medieval-like state, a world of struggle and danger and often suffering in the shadow of the prior worlds\u2019 wonders. Numenera Destiny allows you to build adventures and campaigns in which players don\u2019t just explore the wonders of the past\u2014they utilize them to help lift the Ninth World out of darkness.\nYou can make the world a better place. Help a community defend itself from abhumans or the iron wind. Create centers of learning or trade. Innovate, build, and protect. Manage an entire community and help it prosper and grow\u2014or simply create a cool base or vehicle for your adventuring group. Numenera Destiny will allow you to take what you discover and make your mark on history as someone who elevated the Ninth World into the future.\nAdventuring\u2014exploring the weird and wondrous remnants of the prior worlds\u2014remains, of course, at the core of Numenera play. Numenera Destiny will give you new things to do with your discoveries, along with entirely new and epic ways to structure your campaigns. You\u2019ll discover materials, power sources, and treasures that you can utilize in an entirely new, robust crafting and building system. And perhaps best of all, Numenera Destiny will offer three new character types and a number of new descriptors and foci geared toward this innovative style of play.\n    You can back this campaign to receive either Numenera Discovery or Numenera Destiny, but you\u2019ll really want to get both books. When purchased in print as a set, they come in a beautiful and handy slipcase, giving them a truly deluxe feel. We've upgraded this through stretch goals to include some extra handy components and a beautiful Order of Truth medallion.\n  We at Monte Cook Games have a long and successful history with Kickstarter, and one of the things we love most is that it allows us to build the products we\u2019d really like to see and play. It\u2019s often too risky to add unusual or expensive features to an RPG product if you\u2019re just launching and selling it through normal channels. But through Kickstarter we can propose improvements and ideas through stretch goals, and if you fund them we can make them a reality.\nWe have some cool Kickstarter-exclusives as part of your rewards. But every upgrade to the new corebooks, the slipcase, or any additional titles unlocked through stretch goals will improve the product for everyone who plays the game\u2014whether they back this campaign now, or purchase the book at a game store three years from now. In other words, the more we can accomplish through this campaign, the better we can make Numenera for every player, ever!\nBut speaking of those Kickstarter exclusives. . . .\nA major focus of Numenera 2 involves helping and fostering the communities and people of the Ninth World\u2014making the Ninth World a better, safer place for its inhabitants. So, throughout this Kickstarter campaign, together we\u2019re going to build and grow a Ninth World community called Ellomyr. Your involvement will directly impact the story of Ellomyr as it (hopefully) grows and flourishes. And when the campaign is over, we\u2019ll take Ellomyr\u2019s story and make it into a sourcebook called The Trilling Shard. This is a Kickstarter-exclusive item not available anywhere else, and it\u2019s included (in PDF, print, or both) in every backer level. Pay close attention to this campaign, read the updates, comment and vote and help pull in more backers, and you\u2019ll contribute directly to the content of The Trilling Shard.\nIn addition, we\u2019re also going to produce a short Discover Your Destiny ebook that every backer will get in PDF format. It will be delivered ahead of the release of Numenera Discovery and Numenera Destiny.\nAs a skilled adventurer, you have traveled more than most and seen your share of small, isolated communities in the Ninth World. But there\u2019s something about the village of Ellomyr that has caught your attention. The folk welcomed you warmly when you arrived, sharing their food and their homes. These people clearly work hard to maintain a safe place to live and raise their families. Like so many little villages, it lies in the shadow of ancient ruins that no one completely understands. Among other weird relics of the prior world, Ellomyr\u2019s central square is built around the infamous and immovable Trilling Shard, an ancient symbol-covered stone that quavers with sound at rare times.\nBut the Ninth World is a harsh, unforgiving place, filled with dangers arising from the prior worlds. Raiders and strange biomechanical beasts, weird radiation and mysterious technologies, terrible plagues and dangerous storms all threaten the people here. They need your help.\nOver the course of this Kickstarter campaign, we\u2019re going to track the development of Ellomyr and hopefully watch as it grows and flourishes. But it will only do so if brave and capable individuals such as yourself help the people there overcome dangers and deal with challenges. As threats or needs arise, you, the backers, will help the community face these challenges. The more you participate in the campaign, the more easily the challenges will be overcome and the more Ellomyr will thrive and grow as a community.\n      In other words, you will become a part of Ellomyr\u2019s ongoing story. When The Trilling Shard is released, you\u2019ll be able to recount how you participated in the events that shaped the community. Will it become a thriving city that offers a safe and bright future for Ninth World citizens or will it be lost to the darkness and dangers that threaten it? We\u2019ll only know when this campaign is completed.\nSo please check back in and see the events of the story transpire as you follow along. Post snippets of your own character's story in Ellomyr in the comments, on social media, or on your blog (or all three). Where applicable, use the hashtag #Numenera2. If it's on social media or a blog, we might share it. While this is all in the spirit of a fun, joint experience, if we see something that really wows or entertains us, we might ask you if you'd like to contribute your snippet to The Trilling Shard sourcebook (and we pay our authors, of course). To begin, just introducing your character and stating that they're a part of helping Ellomyr is a great start. And if your favorite way to participate is art rather than writing, we'd love to see and share fan art of your character, of Ellomyr, or the events as they unfold.\n\nAs always, if you want to share a link to this Kickstarter, that's sincerely appreciated.\nNumenera Discovery and Numenera Destiny: Each of these titles is a 416-page, lavishly illustrated hardcover (that\u2019s the same size as the existing Numenera corebook). When purchased together in print, they come in a sturdy, beautiful slipcase that has been upgraded with premium production design, additional content, and a nifty Order of Truth medallion.\nThe Trilling Shard: A sourcebook on Ellomyr and its challenges, setbacks, opponents, solutions, and triumphs over the course of this campaign. The exact specs of this product remain to be determined (in part by your contributions to this campaign!) but at a minimum it will be a 64-page softcover with a poster map.\nDiscover Your Destiny: This PDF product will come out early next year (before Numenera Discovery and Numenera Destiny). It uses story to introduce players to the Ninth World, and focuses on the narrative concepts behind Numenera 2. It leads players\u2014both new and experienced\u2014through creating a character using some of the brand new material from Numenera Destiny and highlights some of the changes people will see in the transition from Numenera to Numenera 2.\nNumenera Player's Guide: Create characters, explore the setting, and learn the basic rules in this inexpensive second copy of key rules and setting material. The 64-page softcover is perfect for getting a taste of the game, for having an extra rules and setting reference on hand at the gaming table, or for game masters to hand to new players.\nBuilding Tomorrow: More installations and items to build, more allies to recruit for your community, more sample communities to build from\u2014and more challenges to face. Building Tomorrow is a 160-page hardcover sourcebook that expands on the community-related content introduced in Numenera Destiny.\nSlaves of the Machine God: A powerful overlord with an army of automatons: is this a simple, straightforward threat to you and your companions, or is there something more going on than meets the eye? An epic adventure of twists and turns in a 144-page hardcover with poster map.\nPriests of the Aeons: This 192-page hardcover with poster map includes new foci and descriptors, cyphers and equipment, and other options and items for your character. It also covers the Aeon Priesthood in detail, giving you information on working with\u2014or joining\u2014the Aeon Priesthood to help enlighten the Ninth World.\nRuin Deck: When the characters start plumbing the depths of a prior-world ruin, the GM needs as much help as they can get. This deck allows GMs to generate an exciting, vivid and\u2014of course, since it\u2019s Numenera\u2014weird set of ruins to explore. Limitless adventures in one deck of cards.\nNinth World Bestiary 3: More weird, wild, wondrous\u2014and generally dangerous\u2014creatures with which to populate the Ninth World. This 192-page hardcover with poster will feature over 150 all-new creatures for your Numenera campaign, perfect as threats to your growing clave or general encounters in the wilds of the Steadfast, the Beyond, or beyond the Beyond.\nTomorrow's Bones: Ancient ruins, strange ships, weird creatures, and Jaekel pirates all spell a Ninth World high-seas adventure with a Numenera twist. The third official Numenera novel, in deluxe hardcover and popular ebook formats.\nIo Deck: 100-card deck that GMs can use to generate iotum, shins, and cyphers found when the PCs salvage numenera. However, some of the cards also contain potential dangers that can arise, making every draw from the deck a possible game-changer.\nExplorer's Keys: A 96-page softcover featuring ten (yes, ten!) Instant Adventures. The unique Instant Adventure format is perfect for running low-prep games, making these adventures just as suited for an impromptu game as they are for adding to your ongoing campaign. Many are community focused, but all work great as exciting standalones as well.\nCreature Deck 3: This 100-card deck offers a selection of creatures from the Ninth World Bestiary 3 and other new sources so that you can easily reference them at the table in a handy format. Pull out just the creatures you need for a session, or even generate an encounter randomly with the turn of a card.\nMore products will be added to this section if we\u2019re fortunate enough to unlock them via stretch goals.\n   Add-ons are additional items you add to your reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. Check out our pledge calculator; it\u2019ll help you figure out exactly how much to pledge based on the backer level and add-ons you desire. After the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-ons items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\n        Retailers: The NINTH WORLD RETAILER level is a flexible way for you to decide how many copies of Numenera 2 products are right for your store, and to avoid tying up your cash between now and release. Your pledge is a down payment for an order to be placed, at a retail-friendly discount, when Numenera Discovery and Numenera Destiny are ready to ship. You can choose as many copies as you like of the corebooks individually and the slipcased set. For every copy of the slipcase set you order, you\u2019ll get a print copy of The Trilling Shard for free. You\u2019ll pay for your order (less your $80 deposit) at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. In addition to those books, you get a free deluxe Numenera PoP kit. You also get a copy of The Trilling Shard for yourself, in print and PDF, and the Discover Your Destiny PDF. MCG covers domestic US shipping.\n    IMPORTANT NOTE: \"SHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\" does not mean free shipping. It's Kickstarter's way of saying that backers anywhere can support this project. If you are outside the US and getting physical rewards, see below.\nREWARD FULFILLMENT Soon after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.\nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience.\nHere\u2019s how it works: when a reward is ready, we\u2019ll send you an email letting you know it is time to log on to your account on the MCG Shop and redeem your rewards, which you will do for free with coupons. You decide when to use the coupon, and give us your correct shipping address at that time. (So if you\u2019ve moved, or want to send the reward to a friend as a gift, you\u2019re providing a totally up-to-date address.) If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of some and bundle them together if that\u2019s more convenient for you (or you'd like to save on international shipping costs). We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE* Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge. You will be charged shipping at the time of reward redemption. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you, since you will not be charged importing/customs fees.\n*The UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nOTHER INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK or Europe: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $52, you\u2019ll pay $42. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the tenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games. All of our previous campaigns have been successful and jam-packed with rewards. Most of those campaigns are completely fulfilled, while those that are not continue to deliver their rewards on schedule. That means we\u2019ve delivered over 200,000 rewards to date. These include such varied items as corebooks for Numenera and The Strange, leather-bound deluxe corebooks, boxed sets, almost two-dozen hardcover supplements, signed bookplates, playtest access, special-access seminars, meetings and dinners with the creative team, online and in-person games, and so much more.\n\nThus, while there are always challenges that can arise, we've probably already faced them.\n\nWe are extremely proud of our track record. Of course, there\u2019s always the danger of meteor strikes, T-rex attacks, or catastrophic solar flares. But our staff is spread out across the country, so we\u2019re unlikely to all be wiped out at once. Unless the planetovores breach into the universe of normal matter to consume the Earth without Carter Strange around to save us, we are confident that the project will meet all its promises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "FIRST STEPS INTO THE NINTH WORLD", "descp": "You get a copy of the Numenera Starter Set, with rules, characters, adventures, dice, and everything needed to play.

Right now 66 million girls dream of going to school. \nOneSqin is already sponsoring girls in Tanzania to attend the SEGA school, through the non-profit organisation NurturingMindsInAfrica.org.\nSEGA Girls School in Tanzania\nThe SEGA Girls School is a residential secondary school for Tanzanian girls who otherwise are unable to attend school due to extreme poverty.\nStudents at SEGA Girls School\nThe SEGA students are vulnerable girls, who have left school before completing their primary education (up to 7th grade). Some have lost their parents to malaria, AIDS or other diseases; some can't afford uniforms, books or transport to traditional government schools; some work to support themselves and their families and have no time to attend school.\nSEGA Girls School Student\nTHE FUTURE\nScholarships at SEGA are just the beginning. As OneSqin grows, so will sponsorships of education for vulnerable girls across the world. Future plans include the launch of a dedicated factory, providing opportunities for women at risk of social exclusion. \nWHO WE ARE\nFounders Neil Richmond FRSA and Sinisa Jovic are supported by an international team of like-minded volunteers. We believe that if business doesn\u2019t revolve around profit, it can be a powerful tool for social change. \nThe choices we make as consumers have a huge collective impact on our world. OneSqin offers the chance to make it a positive one. \nOneSqin CIC is a UK registered Community Interest Company, a certified member of Social Enterprise UK and is supported by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and the Royal Society of Arts (RSA).\nThe OneSqin team: Ana, Avivah, Dora, Erik, Gillian, Hanna, Jason, John, Joy, Julia, Leesa, Leyla, Lucci, Neil, Petra, Rosie, Romana, Seb, Sinisa, Suzie\nThe OneSqin manifesto\nThere\u2019s a notion that real change has to involve great sacrifice. Sticking your neck out, risking what you love, swimming against the tide. But while there\u2019s always room for more heroes in this world, we respectfully disagree. (It\u2019s our belief that a little change can go a long way.) All profits from OneSqin products go to projects that empower girls in need, by removing barriers to education. So that now, simply by buying the things you need, you can help lift girls across the world out of poverty. Change doesn\u2019t always have to mean a battle. In fact, one small change made by enough people can transform many lives.\nThe #OneSqinEffect\nTo help girls across the world, OneSqin needs your help to become a social phenomenon.

It takes 2 minutes to set up, lasts around 30 minutes, and no two games are ever alike.    \nPlayers take the role of prisoners on a quest to Escape the Dark Castle, and must work together to overcome its many horrors, traps, and challenges - each of which is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card. \nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of dice and item cards to complete challenges.\nThe game is largely inspired by 80s fantasy classics like the TV programme Knightmare, the Fighting Fantasy gamebook series, Dungeons & Dragons, and Heroquest, but you don\u2019t need to know what those things are to enjoy this game. \nThis game has simple rules so it\u2019s easy to learn. You\u2019ll be able to get started within about 5 minutes. Below is an overview, and you can read the full rules here. You can also watch a full playthrough video in our Reviews section further down the page. \n\u2022 It\u2019s approachable - The game is designed with non-gamers in mind, but is no less rich and rewarding for it. Now anyone can enjoy the atmosphere of a classic fantasy quest. \n\u2022 It\u2019s quick - It takes 2 mins to set up and around 30 mins to play. No downtime, no elimination, and full player engagement throughout. No-one will be bored.\n\u2022 It\u2019s social - Many chapters offer a compelling choice for the group, stimulating regular player interaction and discussion. It's perfect for the pub or a games cafe, but can even be played solo!\n\u2022 It's different every time - You never know what the next chapter will be, so there is plenty of tension and suspense as your unique adventure unfolds each game.\n\u2022 It has a unique look - So many games look alike these days. Here is something truly distinct for your collection. We've worked hard to create a stylish look evocative of retro classics.\n\u2022 There are no heroes - The playable characters are refreshingly ordinary. No musclebound heroes or buxmon heroines here, and there is an equal mix of male and female characters.  \n\u2022 You choose your path - The decisions you make will change how each chapter turns out, and play a significant part in determining success or failure. \n \u2022 It\u2019s the start of something big - We plan to add new chapters, characters, items and advanced rules to expand the game, not to mention taking you beyond the castle itself.  \n \u2022 You\u2019ll fall in love with fantasy (again) - By focusing on immersion, we\u2019ve taken a tired, overused theme and created a refreshing, streamlined experience for everyone to enjoy. \nDon\u2019t just take our word for it. We\u2019ve been conducting public playtests for the last 6 months at the following venues:\nEach playtester filled in a feedback form after their session. Here is what the gaming public has to say about Escape the Dark Castle:\nWe'll keep this section updated with other third party reviews and features as they roll in:\n11/06/17 \n\"Elegant mechanics, with simple but significant decisions really make \u2018Escape the Dark Castle\u2019 sing....There is a great feeling of risk/reward with the combat system that makes the encounters feel increasingly desperate...Every choice feels important right down to who should turn over the next card, for you don\u2019t know what is lurking around the next corner!...Back it. Back it now.\"\n- Iain McAllister, The Giant Brain\n23/06/17\n\u201cThat was epic, I won\u2019t lie\u2026\u201d  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic set of mechanics\u2026\u201d  \n\u201cI love the way it tells a story, it's so different to what you normally see\u2026\u201d \nEnjoy a full playthrough with this video review from Beasts of War\nCriminal: \u00a31 or more\nThis pledge level is great if you want to support the project and follow it's progress.  \nYou won't get a copy of the game when the project funds, but you will have the satisfaction of knowing you helped to make it happen, and of course you'll have our heartfelt thanks no matter how large or small your pledge.  \nWe'll keep you updated as the campaign progresses, and you can always change to one of the other pledge levels later if you decide you want the game after all. \nWe're glad to have you onboard.\nPrisoner: \u00a325 \nThis is our standard pledge.

But keep an eye on it - cancellations are common in the last 48hrs of Kickstarter campaigns and if a slot opens up you might be able to grab it!\nPledging at this level means you\u2019ll get a copy of the game signed (on the box cover) by the designers, along with all unlocked stretch goals. You'll also get The Story Pack add-on for free, a collection of 16 stories delving into the backgrounds of the prisoners, and how they each ended up in the depths of The Dark Castle- see the Add-Ons section below for more details. \nBut there\u2019s one final reason to pledge at this level: If the stretch goal Become a Prisoner! is unlocked, you'll be one of only 100 people with the option to buy the limited add-on Become a Prisoner!, turning YOU into a character card! For full details see the Add-ons section below. \nShipping will be charged based on your location, but we've done our best to keep those costs to a minimum.\nCastle: \u00a375 \nThis is our retailer pledge.  \nYou must have a store to claim this reward, and there will be a verification process when the project funds. \nYou'll get 6 copies of the game, including all applicable stretch goals, at a great trade price. \nShipping will be charged based on your location, but we've done our best to keep those costs to a minimum.\nWe'll be working with our expert fulfillment partner Gamesquest to make sure your game is delivered promptly and with expert care. \nWe are EU, USA, and AU friendly, ensuring backers in these locations will pay no extra customs charges beyond the shipping cost itself.\nPlease note: For deliveries outside of these locations, check the rules and regulations on importing goods to your region before you pledge. \nThe following shipping costs will be charged based on your location and pledge level as shown: \nOur \u00a311k funding goal will cover the print run and associated logistical costs, but if we are fortunate enough to exceed that goal we'd like to offer you the following upgrades and add-ons:  \n(note that all stretch goal targets are in \u00a3 GBP)\nNaturally, the cards will be great quality regardless, but what we\u2019d really love to do is upgrade them from the standard you find in most board games to a thicker, more luxurious feeling card with a linen finish. Backers at all reward levels would benefit from this. \nThe dice will also be great quality as standard but, given the chance, we\u2019d love to go for larger dice rather than the standard size found in most board games. They\u2019d be that bit chunkier and more satisfying this way. Backers at all reward levels will benefit from this.\nWhen we reach this level of funding, we\u2019ll unlock the Become a Prisoner! add-on. That add-on will only be available to backers who pledge at the Boss level, which is limited to 100 backers so pledge early to avoid disappointment! For full details see the Boss pledge listing above, and the Become a Prisoner! add-on listing below. \nWhen we reach this level of funding, we\u2019ll add an additional Boss card to backer copies of Escape the Dark Castle at all pledge levels. This is a Kickstarter exclusive and will not be available anywhere else.\nWhen we reach this level of funding, we\u2019ll add 3 additional Chapter cards to backer copies of Escape the Dark Castle at all pledge levels. This is a Kickstarter exclusive and will not be available anywhere else.\nAt this level we'll commission experienced composer Alex Crispin (who also co-designed and illustrated the game!) to produce an original soundtrack, perfectly suited to accompany a game of Escape the Dark Castle.\nBackers at all reward levels will have access to this as a digital download for free, but we'll also unlock an amazing add-on option for those who want their OST on cassette! More detail in the Add-ons section below. \nWhen we reach this level of funding, we\u2019ll add ANOTHER additional Boss card to backer copies of Escape the Dark Castle at all pledge levels, meaning your base set will include 2 extra bosses. This is a Kickstarter exclusive and will not be available anywhere else.\nWhen we reach this level of funding, we\u2019ll add ANOTHER 5 additional Chapter cards to backer copies of Escape the Dark Castle at all pledge levels, meaning your set will include a total of 8 extra chapters. This is a Kickstarter exclusive and will not be available anywhere else. \nCombined with all the other stretch goals, this would give you a total of 10 Kickstarter exclusive cards on top of the base set contents.\nWhen we reach this level, we\u2019ll add a very special rare and powerful relic to the game \u2013 the Golden Axe! This is an additional item card which comes with its own special dice. In the game, the wielder of this awesome weapon will roll the special dice alongside their character dice in combat. It may be cumbersome, but it\u2019s devastating when you connect! This is a Kickstarter exclusive and will not be available anywhere else.\nAdventure Pack 1: Cult of the Death Knight\n\u00a312 + shipping\nAs an extra special treat for all your amazing support we\u2019ve decided to bring forward our first expansion, Adventure Pack 1: Cult of the Death Knight, at the kickstarter exclusive price of just \u00a312!\nWhat you get:\n3 New Characters & their Custom Dice - each a powerful specialist  \n15 New Chapter Cards \u2013 taking you to new areas of The Dark Castle \n1 New Boss Card \u2013 the Death Knight himself, Lord of Decay\n3 New Item Cards \u2013 Introducing Curses, terrible afflictions to thwart your progress\nWe\u2019ve made this expansion available as an add-on, open to all backers immediately. The best part is, it will ship at the same time as the base game, so you\u2019ll get all this great content in one big bundle! \nThe three new prisoners are all specialists in one particular area: The Mason\u2019s MIGHT knows no bounds, the Hunter can be counted on for CUNNING, and the Bishop is well-known for his WISDOM.

We\u2019ve added a chart below to help make this clear, so please check before you pledge.\n For example, UK backers need to pay an additional \u00a31 to ship the expansion alongside their base game, and should increase thier pledge by \u00a313 (12 + 1) to claim this add-on.  \nElsewhere in the world, the increase is higher, and sadly that\u2019s a reality of shipping over 2kgs (4.4lbs) of game to distant lands. Please be assured, we make no profit on the shipping \u2013 it\u2019s an unavoidable evil, much like many of the things you\u2019ll encounter in the depths of the Dark Castle\u2026\nThe Story Pack \n\u00a38\nPrepare to immerse yourself even further into the world of The Dark Castle with The Story Pack - a total of 16 dark tales penned by published game-writer and co-designer of Escape the Dark Castle, Thomas Pike. \nWhat you get: \n9 Character Origin Stories, each delving into the personalities of the prisoners, and of course the dark events which led to their incarceration in the depths of the Dark Castle.

We make immersive tabletop games with approachable rules and uncompromising artwork. \nA Labour of Love \nEscape the Dark Castle is our first game. It's a labour of love that's been in our lives for more than 3 years.\nIt started out as something we felt passionate about creating just for ourselves - the kind of game we wanted to play (and invite non-gamer friends to play) which just didn't exist on the market at that time. We wanted to capture the atmosphere of classic 80s and 90s fantasy games, but with none of the fiddly rules, piles of tokens or confusing special abilities that tend to clutter most modern games in this category. If we could do that without resorting to a whacky or comedic tone, we knew we'd be on to something. \nResisting overcomplication and staying true to our vision, we bonded uniquely over the following years of developing and crafting the game. As old friends living in three different cities, the development sessions became an excuse to get together, and in the end played a big part in keeping our friendship strong as our lives took us in different directions. It means a lot to us. \nEventually, the next natural step was to try and bring Escape the Dark Castle to a wider audience, and Themeborne was set up to launch the game and give you the chance to enjoy it as much as we do. \nWhy use Kickstarter? \nWe've put all the time and money we have into bringing the game to where it is today, from creating the content and artwork, to building prototypes, to attending conventions for playtesting. We've laid a solid foundation and given it everything. Now we need your help to make this dream a reality by crowdfunding the first print run of Escape the Dark Castle.\nIf you back this project, not only will you be securing your very own copy of the first edition, you\u2019ll be helping a talented new team of designers enter the industry. The team at Themeborne is deeply passionate about tabletop gaming, and we'd like nothing more than the opportunity to continue making great games for you in the years ahead. We have grand plans.\nHere is just a taste of what Themeborne has in store: \nMore Castle: Of course, we can expand Escape the Dark Castle with more chapters, characters and items. There is so much we can do from this solid base.\nMore Escape the Dark: We've always envisaged Escape the Dark as a series of games - the Castle set is just the beginning. The scope for other themes, settings and licences is absolutely huge, and we're very excited about going down that path.\nMore Advanced: Escape the Dark Castle is very deliberately simple and accessible, but from this basis we can craft a longer, more involving adventure for those who want something more elaborate and strategic. \nMore Games: Escape the Dark is not the only project we have simmering away at the studio. We've got several other designs in development already, from a pure-strategy game we believe is genuinely ground-breaking to a manic, team-based party-game like nothing else on the market today. \nAll told, we've got several years worth of games stored up, and all of them will be delivered with our trademark focus on theme, style and player experience. So, if you like the way we do things and want to see what we do next, back us today!  \nAre you a content creator? We\u2019ve got a press releases, logos, photos and more - ready and waiting for you here. We may be adding more as the campaign progresses, so check back regularly. \nNeed something specific?

We're confident in what we've created. \n\nIs it ready to print? \n\nWe didn't want to keep anyone waiting, so before we launched the campaign we made sure the artwork, design and development of Escape the Dark Castle was 95% done. All that remains is finishing touches. \n\nWill the materials be good quality? \n\nWe\u2019ve had in-depth discussions with more than a dozen experienced games manufacturers all over the world in the last few months, and been through the quoting process looking for the best materials that will work for our game. This will be a top notch production. \n\nWill it ever arrive? \n\nWe'll be working with our expert fulfillment partner Gamesquest to make sure your game is delivered promptly and with expert care.

An enigmatic monolith, eons old and sacred to all four races is the source of this wild force. The shaman who is most able to draw and manipulate this energy from the monolith to defeat their rivals wins the game and becomes the new Master Zee!\nElemenZ comes in two play modes:\n2 Player - a tense dice-based tug-of-war game where players attempt to complete combos to draw new dice from the central supply to aid them in later turns or to energise the monolith by locking in energy dice - while also blocking, stealing or denying dice from their opponent. The winner is whoever completes energising the monolith first.\n\n3-4 Players - a push-your-luck duelling game where each shaman player strives to control and manage their elemental energy better than their opponents, using combos carefully and tactically to drain their rivals energy pool while protecting their own - until they remain the last shaman standing.\nEverything you get in the game\n More stretchgoals to follow when we break through the \u00a310k barrier...\nAny future retail release of ElemenZ will only include the 2 player and 3-4 players games and will not include the KS limited promo Avatar expansion. This expansion will only otherwise be available at shows, conventions or our website so now is the best time to get the whole lot together at a great price!\nElemenZ takes the concepts behind many recent dice battle games and takes a big leap forwards in terms of interactivity, reduction of luck and rapid play. Instead of playing characters with Hit (life) Points that must be slowly reduced to zero, or other games that focus on dice roll outcomes with no chance of player interaction or negation, Elemenz folds the 'life points' into the dice themselves, limits luck using a 'wild' or 'joker' effect on the dice and keeps player involvement at the core of gameplay, by giving players multiple options to affect ('mess with') other shaman turns.\nElemenZ has a unique mix of mechanics that will be familiar to those players who know King of Tokyo, Bang! the Dice Game, Age of War and similar dice rolling games (the 3 roll rule, take-that style, symbol matching and end-of-turn risk results); but shakes these concepts up in innovative ways to make for a more tactical, risk-versus-reward decision making, bluffing, energy management style of game that keeps all players interacting in devious ways throughout each turn.\nThe Four Energy Totems\nSo what makes the ElemenZ dice special?\nEach dice in Elemenz has 2 faces with the colour element (e.g. water on the blue dice) meaning a 1:3 chance of rolling your own symbol and a 1:6 chance of rolling either the 'Z' or another element. Graphically it looks like this:\nThis reduces dice randomness and means players have a better chance to boost their Attacks, Defense or Heals with their own element symbol. However, a player may need to roll an alternative symbol and with only a 1:6 chance, increases the level of tactical risk taking in the game.\nClick the review for the YT video\nOf course you are not obliged to use the dice only for playing ElemenZ!\nSorceress doing some Waterbending\nThey make very good special dice for Sorcerors, Elementalists and Magicians in roleplaying games too!\nEach shaman player is armed with a pool of energy dice - their life points that is both their defense and offense in the duel. Each dice can become one of the four fundamental elements or pure wild energy (the 'Z'). Each player must manage and control this limited supply of wild energy carefully and cleverly to protect themselves while at the same time defeating all rivals. Shamans do this by manipulating combinations of the elements to create combos that trigger powerful effects.\nThe four alien shaman play boards\nEssential combos are presented on the main player boards. Shamans can activate as many completed combos as they like in their turn. It is up to the other shamans to disrupt this by using their own abilities and combos.\nAnatomy of the Shaman boards\nUsing the wild 'Z' symbol is a risk-versus-reward mechanic. A 'Z' on a dice can 'mimic' another element as long as it is partnered (termed anchoring) to a dice with that symbol. (The Example below shows an Ice Storm combo using a 'Z' anchored to the water symbol)\nUsing a 'wild' dice in a combo\nRolling 3 or more 'Z's at any time however causes an immediate Wild Surge effectwhich finishes the player's turn immediately and they cannot activate any combos this round. However, they can still interact by spending tokens or using Avatars (explained further on).\nEach shaman also has a unique race ability that influences their play style. The Water shaman for example has the chance to heal twice in a turn while the Earth shaman benefits from cheap defense.\nPrototype player Totem boards\nEach shaman also starts the game with a spirit totem board that buffs their abilities, protects them against various in-game effects and acts like a battery, supplying energy for the shaman's abilities in the form of Pulse. \nFinal Totem board - Air Shaman\nThis pulse energy (in the form of tokens) offers various additional effects (e.g. forcing dice re-rolls, adding a specific element or healing) to support the shaman or influence other player's combos.\nSet of Pulse tokens\nPulse tokens (similar to the energy dice) are a very limited resource that shamans must use wisely to keep them in the duel. A pulse token can only be used once and is then out of the game - making tactical choice on when to spend and when to keep pulse tokens at the heart of using the totem boards cleverly and efficiently. Further, pulse can be replaced or even removed by other shamans and should a totem become drained of all pulse, the totem is removed from the game also and its special abilities are lost to the player!\nIn addition, for the kickstarter limited edition, we've included an initial set of Avatar tiles (for FREE!). Avatars are energy sprites that appear from the monolith when the shamans duel. Each Avatar tile has a unique ability that can be harnessed by a shaman, but each tile can only be used once and costs a precious energy dice to buy. Once used the Avatar returns to a central pool available to all players. So a useful Avatar might give a shaman a moments advantage but may come back to bite the same shaman later!\nBase set of Avatar tiles\n Avatars can also be burnt (removed) from a player's control by spending a pair of dice of any symbol so attention must be paid to which Shaman is hoarding Avatars for later use. Full explanation of these rules and more along with suggested tactics is in the rulebook which you can download below.\nWe have many more Avatar tiles planned but need your help to unlock them!\nNote: Both the Avatar expansion tiles and/or the Totem boards are Modular and can be excluded from the game without affecting core game playability - ideal for younger players or those just learning the game!\n\nClick on the image below for an in depth explanation of both the 3-4 player and 2 player gameplay by Fluff and Crunch.\nMore gameplay summaries and playthroughs can be found on our Youtube channel.\n The 2 player game uses similar dice combo mechanics to the multiplayer but now the wild 'Z' dice 'locks' the dice out of action when rolled. The focus here is to use combo options wisely to draw the flow of energy dice to your side in a tug-of-war while trying to shut down your opponent's moves. Accumulating a good pool of all 4 types of dice is key (but not so easy to accomplish) while getting dice locked into the monolith positions quickly is also vitally important as your opponent will be doing the same! However every time you lock in a dice, you reduce your pool and options for future turns!\n2 player prototype gameboards showing dice 'locked' into the monolith\nThe winner of the 2 player game is the shaman who best controls the pool of dice and who first fully energises the monolith with all eight dice locked in.\nClick quote to read Eric's review for yourselves\n                    Click here for the current rules booklet (Both English and French versions currently - seperate PDFs) for both multiplayer and 2 player games.

It was an era when Scotland made the challenging transition from an agricultural country to an industrialized one, heavily relying on trade and export. \nAs proud members of the old clans you use your unique abilities and cunning skill to earn the greatest wealth and fame.\nThe game is designed by Juma Al-JouJou, a solo-entrepreneur and founder of Karma Games. Juma has also designed and self-published Green Deal which Tom Vasel rated as the 5th best economic game of all time. Clans of Caledonia is illustrated by Klemens Franz, the illustrator of award-winning games such as Agricola, Caverna and Isle of Skye.   \nThere are more than 220 custom wooden tokens! Click for larger view.\n   Clans of Caledonia has a unique blend of mechanisms and includes elements of engine-building games (e.g. Terra Mystica) and economic mechanisms such as a dynamic market (e.g. Navegador) and export contracts (e.g. Voyages of Marco Polo). \nThe way you produce whisky, bread and cheese from grain and milk is interwoven with the trade and export of goods. This makes it a highly interactive strategy game, with great strategic depth despite having a very accessible rule set.  \nThe modular board, the 8 different clans with unique powers and the multiple scoring and port tiles ensure outstanding replayability.\nA game example at the 2-player count. Click for larger view.\n     The modular board offering 16 different map setups.

Click for larger view.\n      In addition to all the components from the Clans of Caledonia pledge level including all Stretch Goals, the Premium Clans of Caledonia pledge level includes 70 metal coins and a KS exclusive box sleeve.\nMetal Coins\nMoney is so important in this game! Upgrading the coins to 70 metal coins is the best upgrade possible. It feels great to hold heavy coins in your hands and their jingling sound is music in the ears of their wealthy and proud owner! In addition, there is basically no wear and tear! Perfect for a game with such a high replayability. \nThe supplier is producing sample coins right now. The producer of the metal coins is the same supplier as the one for Scythe from Stonemaier Games, so expect some awesome metal coins! \n  Render image: Lily, The Lion Rampant of Scotland & Mary Stuart. Klemens designed the coins specifically for Clans of Caledonia. The coins have a diameter of 20, 22 and 24 mm respectively and will be 2 mm thick (just as thick as the coins in Scythe).\n       Add-on: You can also add up to four additional sets of metal coins as an add-on to your pledge of the game by adding \u20ac19 per set of metal coins. Please check the FAQ for details. \nExcess Premium copies produced by this campaign may be sold in limited number at retail at a higher price. \nBox Sleeve (KS exclusive)\nThe premium sleeve slides onto the game box for a premium hold. The front proudly presents the eight clan chiefs of Clans of Caledonia.\n  The sleeve features all of the clan crests on the sides and a map of Scotland on the back with the current clan seats. Click for larger view.\n  Exclusivity: The sleeves and metal coins will not be widely available after the Kickstarter. There will only be enough sleeves printed to cover replacements. Take note that we also reserve the right to print similar box sleeves for special releases. Due to the high cost of producing metal coins, it is expected they will be very limited in retail. \nWe also want to give you the chance to shape the final product in a truly unique way! You can make suggestions and vote first for an additional port tile, then for a scoring tile and finally for a clan tile. At certain points during the campaign, voting for these will take place and will end: \nParticipate and shape the final product!\n   You, Kickstarer backers, will add one extra port, scoring and clan tile that will be included in every single game in this print run! The additional 9th clan will also be eternalized on the box sleeve. These additional tiles will be clearly marked as untested. The community of players can playtest and balance these tiles after release together. \nThe earlier you join in, the more you can shape the final game! Join this FB group to submit your ideas and vote!           \nClans of Caledonia includes more than 220 custom wooden tokens, a modular map and a full solo variant including custom silk-screened dice. We recognise that many of these features are often added as stretch goals but we don't want to compromise a top quality final product. Also, we don't want to risk the game balance by adding content that was not playtested (and that is not marked as untested). \nEven though we think that is the case, we are still going to add a few more components with your help!  \nAll Stretch Goals unlocked!\nFacebook Shares \nRetweets \nBoardgamegeek Thumbs \nDownload your favorite clan as a social media avatar.\n                                      Videos\nReview by Man vs. Meeple\nPreview by Counter Culture\n First impressions by slickerdrips\n\nHunter & Cron (German)\n\nAntlab Games, 2-Player\nSlickerdrip, Solo\n2-Player with Juma, the Game Designer, and Nick-Nack\n\nWritten Reviews\nBoardgamequest: \"If you\u2019re a fan of games such as Terra Mystica, Clans of Caledonia offers something equally fulfilling in an equal or shorter playtime\"\nMeoples' Magazine: \"Clans of Caledonia is great with two, three or four players.The clans are well balanced.\"\n\nSpielkult (German)\n\nRead the rules here.\nAnd play the game on Tabletopia now!\n                                   Within a month of receiving your copy (or if you haven't received your game by Dec 31, 2017) you can return the game and we even pay for return shipping, no strings attached. \nDepending on how early you pledge, you will receive:  \n  The guarantee applies to your pledge amount. The pledge amount equals the tiers you chose plus shipping costs.  \nClans of Caledonia was heavily playtested and I continued tweaking and balancing the game even when everyone thought I should stop. Thus, I am confident that, if it's a style of game you usually like, you will love Clans of Caledonia!  \nI strongly believe it's a stellar product that is truly outstanding and can bear comparison with the best Euro games on the market today.\nInspired by the so-called Stonemaier Method, we will ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low. Country codes are here.\nShipping fee automatically added at checkout.\nBackers are limited to 2 games per pledge (any combination is fine; you will only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add an additional game beyond the first, manually enter the \u20ac total when making your pledge or click the \"Manage your pledge\" button at the top of the page. \n\nShipping costs are heavily subsidized. If we had subsidized shipping even more to make it free in the US, we would have had to increase the pledge by \u20ac10. So we deliberately kept the tier low so you can actually save money by pleding for two copies because you pay shipping only once per pledge.  \n\nWe will be shipping from within US, within EU, within Canada and within China to the respective backers. Depending on the success of the campaign, we may also ship from within Australia. \nCustoms & Duty Free Shipping in US, EU and CA\n\nThe game will contain two rulebooks, one rulebook in English, and one in German. Since the game materials are language independent, we plan to offer digital files of translations of the rules in various languages.\nThe game comes with printed rulebooks in English and German.\n  Translations in French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch will be provided as digital files online.\n  Juma is a solo-entrepreneur and game designer. There is no big publisher behind this project. Consequently Kickstarter is the only way for Juma to publish this game as it helps him to assess the level of demand for the game and to finance the costly production. \n  All Kickstarter backers receive a money-back guarantee, but the sooner you back the better your guarantee is. Backers during the first 3 days receive even a 110% money-back guarantee! \nShape the final product! Based on your suggestions and votes, we will add one additional clan, one additional scoring tile and one additional port tile. The earlier you pledge, the more you can participate. \n Approximately 30% off MRSP and subsidized shipping: you are not likely to get this game cheaper any time soon. We are known for keeping our prices stable. \nExclusivity: The sleeves and metal coins will not be widely available after the Kickstarter.\nThere is no big publisher behind Clans of Caledonia so without your pledges this game won't be produced at all. \nBy backing this Kickstarter, you allow me to devote more time to our awesome hobby and bring more great games to you soon!\n\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering either version of the game to retailers during the campaign. Retailer backers, just like other backers, will receive their rewards before the games will go into distribution. If you're a retailer, please contact Juma at juma@karma-games.de (please use \"Retailer\" in the email object) during the campaign for pricing information. \nAbout the Creators\nI am Juma.  \n  I am the father of a small family in Berlin (Germany) and an avid gamer. I studied Philosophy & Economics (bachelor's degree) and Innovation Management & Entrepreneurship / Business Administration (master's degree). No wonder I love economic games. \n\nKarma Games is just me - there are no emloyees, no marketing manager, I do it all! :)  \n\nWhen I was 16 I participated in a music school exchange program and was hosted by a lovely Scottish family on the Isle of Bute, west of Glasgow. I believe that the design process of this game can be traced back to that great experience!  \n\nKlemens Franz is the illustrator of Clans of Caledonia. Klemens has illustrated many award-winning strategy games such as Agricola, Caverna and Isle of Skye. Klemens is based in Austria: http://www.atelier198.com/   \nDan Cunningham, founder of Iron Kitten Games, reached out to me, a few months ago and asked if he could help. He was incredibly helpful with various tasks, from creating 3D renders and animations, to production, Tabletopia implementation and Kickstarter related issues (a truly multitalented individual!).\nMichael Csorba, recently asked if he could help and supports me with communication and running the Kickstarter. He is the only one who also resides in Berlin, it's great to see a team member face to face once in a while! \nAdriano Rahde, from Ao Amor in Brazil, has created the amazing Kickstarter video trailer! Thank you! \nPlaytesters: More than 50 regular playtesters helped to create this awesome game. I'm grateful that you were all willing to play the prototype again and again -  even in the early stages of development when it was still rough around the edges. Your contribution and feedback was invaluable! \nA lot more people actively reached out to me and offered help, some Boardgamegeek users who helped so much with editing the rules (especially Francois Landry Corbin, Mike Poole, Steven Barba and many more). The truth is: without the many people who volunteered to help, this game would not be as great as it is. It was a real community effort. I was, and still am, amazed how awesome so many board game enthusiasts are. Thank you all! \nOther Products\nJuma designed two other games that you can order from the Karma Games website.\n\n  Fette Ernte is a card game for 3 to 5 kids to learn about growing vegetables (only available in German).\nPlease feel free to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter here: http://www.karma-games.com/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI do have some experience with managing and fulfilling a crowd funding project. My last campaign was delivered one month ahead of schedule and only four months after the campaign finished. That game was also called 5th best economic game of all time by Tom Vasel. \n\nDespite my experience, there are still some risks involved that everyone backing the project must be aware of.\n\nThere could be delays: freight and worldwide fulfillment is complex and involves numerous companies. I read everything about the topic on Stonemaier Games' blog (an invaluable resource, thank you Jamey!) and consulted other creators for tips and tricks on how to manage fulfillment the best way possible.\n\nIn addition, I decided to work with the best fulfillment partners even if it comes at a higher cost. \n\nDue to proximity to the fulfillment centers or the factory some backers will receive their games significantly earlier than others. The majority of backers should receive their games around October 2017, ideally a few weeks before the game fair in Essen, though. If delays arise it may happen that the game is available at the game fair in Essen before some backers received their copies. \n\nI will do my best to solve any problems that may arise and keep you regularly updated.\n\nClans of Caledonia features variable player powers. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game. In the beginning the game was playtested with 50+ different play testers. They provided diverse qualitative feedback that led to the final gameplay mechanisms. \n\nOnce the game mechanisms were nearly final, I focused on balancing the clans. Therefore, I playtested again and again with the best players of Clans of Caledonia only because the stats were far more reliable than with new players whose skills varies a lot. I gathered the stats, fine tuned the clans and made some quantitative analyses in Excel that indicated that the clans are very well balanced. My playtesters agreed. \n\nNonetheless I am aware that other games with variable player powers ended up being perceived by players as much less balanced than the creators predicted. In order to mitigate this risk, I included a Clan auction variant that ensures nearly 100% fairness. Furthermore, one can also play this game without variable player powers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Sl\u00e0inte", "descp": "Join in and suggest the additional clan, port and scoring tiles.

It is easy to learn, simple to play, and won't take up your entire weekend. It is a Scott Almes design after all, designer of the Tiny Epic series.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea is this simple: each player performs two actions per round. You can take a Capital Action, which could be followed by other players by using a serf. Or, you may take a Conquest action, which can be mustered to allow you to double down on your own actions. After each player has taken their two actions, players will collect resources based on the regions they control and then start a new round. This continues until a player triggers one of the four end game conditions: Expand, Exploit, Explore, or Exterminate! \nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, Scott has us warring across a giant game board (26 x 26 in. that extends to 39 x 26 in.), sailing the great blue sea in boats that actually hold your minis!\nAnd soaring through the clouds with minis on the backs of dragons, griffins, and in airships!\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea is the classic tale of orcs vs humans and the warring factions of a fantasy realm. It is a game of territory control, resource management, mastering your faction and exploiting your opponent's weaknesses.\nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea you'll have 3 heroes, each with special abilities that will become more powerful as the game goes on. You'll have 5 warriors, which will defend your capital city and conquer regions across the land. You will also have 12 serfs, who are used to collect resources, build buildings, as well as take extra actions through a clever follow mechanic. Serfs are a limited resource, so you must deploy them wisely in order to ensure victory.\nWill you rely on the resourcefulness of the Human's? The strength of the Orc? The ingenuity of the Dwarves? or the magic of the Elves?\n      In Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, every decision is a meaningful decision and players will need to be clever to claim victory. One way to surprise your opponent is through well timed use of SPELLS! The effects of which range from resource gain and buffs to your army to interrupts and counter spells. \nBut the focus is always on the 4 X's: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate! Each of them represent an end game trigger.\nEXPLORE  \nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea features a giant 26 inch by 26 inch beautifully illustrated 4-fold game board, and expands to 39 inch by 26 inch with the Expansion board!\nClick to see the Full Map with the Extended Board! \u00a9 2017 Gamelyn Games, all rights reserved.\n  During play, the land and water regions will feature exploration tokens that offer surprises to the players brave enough to enter.\nOnce the final exploration token is revealed, the end of the game is triggered.  \nEXPAND  \nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea you will need to expand your kingdom, your army and your reach. Building certain structures in your Capital will allow you to recruit Heroes! \nAnd, Heroes become better as you level up your Capital City.\nRecruit all of your serfs and warriors and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nEXPLOIT \nThis wouldn't be much of a 4X without the most important X, exploitation! Simply collecting resources and turtling in your castle won't get you very far in Heroes of Land, Air & Sea. Players will need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their faction and that of their opponents to assure victory. Part of that is knowing when and where to build your towers to secure area control. Build 3 towers and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nEXTERMINATE\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea features a luckless combat system that requires timing and wits. To resolve a war, players compare the strength value of their armies, as modified by their selection of a single Tactic Card, highest strength wins. Each player has an identical deck of 7 Tactic Cards and, in each war, must secretly choose one of the 7 to play in conjunction with their army.\nThis gives players perfect information on the potential maneuvers of their opponent. But, how you will exploit this during play is up to you to discover!  \nDestroy an opponent's Capital City and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nVICTORY  \nVictory points can be earned during play for winning wars, casting spells, and certain hero abilities; and at the end of the game for certain units trained, regions controlled, buildings built, towers built (based on their distance from your Capital City), and the level of your Capital City. \nWhoever have the highest victory points at the end of the game, wins!\nEXPAND YOUR GAME\nDon't miss out on expanding your game to support 5 and 6 players and getting 4 more incredible factions. The stalwart Lionkin, the ravenous Undead, the tribal Lizardfolk, and the sprawling Goblins! You'll want to try them all!\n      MERCENARIES\nMercenaries are a Kickstarter promo that will not be available in retail, though future players will be able to buy them directly from Gamelyn Games. For backing us on Kickstarter, you are getting them for FREE! \nIn game, the Mercenaries are essentially super buff Heroes available to purchase for any player. First come, first serve. They are usable with any number of players. If a Mercenary is ever defeated in battle, it returns to the general supply and is again available to all players. \n.\n  $79 Core Game Contents:\n1 Game Board (26x26in., four-fold)\n80 Miniatures (20 unique designs)\n32 Constructs (8 per faction)\n4 Capital City Boards (1 per faction)\n15 Screen Printed Wood Resource Tokens \n8 Action Tokens (2 per faction)\n4 Score Tokens (1 per faction)\n1 Screen Printed Wood First Player Token\n94 Exploration Tokens (including stretch goal tokens)\n12 Hero Cards (3 per faction)\n28 Tactic Cards (7 per player)\n8 Solo Enemy Cards\n60 Spell Cards (including stretch goal cards)\n4 Plastic Stands (for aerial constructs)\n1 Rulebook\n$139 Deluxe Expansion Contents:\nAll Core Game Contents PLUS...\n1 Extension Game Board (26x13in., two-fold)\n80 Miniatures (20 unique designs)\n32 Constructs (8 per faction)\n4 Capital City Boards (1 per faction)\n6 Screen Printed Wood Resource Tokens \n8 Action Tokens (2 per faction)\n4 Score Tokens (1 per faction)\n12 Hero Cards (3 per faction)\n14 Tactic Cards\n4 Plastic Stands (for aerial constructs)\nREAD FIRST: videos of the game do not depict the exact components you will receive. It is too cost prohibitive to create prototypes with 80 miniatures. So, the prototypes featured in the videos have standee characters instead of miniatures. Also, some rules may have been tweaked during development but these videos will give you a great feel for the game so we've decided to include them. For exact details on the components that you will receive in the game please see the components list and images above. For the most up to date rules, please download the prototype rules HERE. Thank you.\n  ATTENTION\nWe're doing things differently than other projects. We are not \"gutting\" the game only to give it all back to you as Stretch Goals. We are offering a fully loaded premium product right from the start. Essentially we have already built into the game the majority of the \"would be\" Stretch Goals. Therefore this project may not have as many Stretch Goals as you are used to seeing. We hope that you enjoy this fresh approach and offering, and we hope that you are still willing to share this project up to the end. \n  Additional Stretch Goals are given to every backer of the Core tier or better, unless otherwise stated on the Stretch Goal graphic.\n                  Click to find us on Facebook!\n                                Click to find us on Twitter!\n  This concludes the stretch goals for Heroes of Land, Air & Sea.

You will NOT be hit with additional shipping charges from us after the project ends. In most cases, you will not be hit with customs or VAT either as we are offering Customs Friendly Shipping to the countries where most of our backers are located. \nYour rewards will be shipped at our cost to our international hubs. Based on where you are located, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or New Hampshire (USA and the rest of the world).  \nBackers who do not complete their pledge manager by the deadline, which will be made clear via an email notification, may need to have their rewards shipped from the US. This may incur additional shipping charges to international backers that would need to be paid for at that time. \nDue to the size of the rewards and risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. \nShipping Rates are described below: (Base / Deluxe)\nUnited States, Canada, Germany, China: $15 / $20\nEuropean Union, United Kingdom, Australia: $20 / $25\nHong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan: $25 / $30\nNew Zealand: $30 / $35\nLatin America, Rest of World: $55 / $60\nThe most effective way to assure that we reach all potential upgrades is to share this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, blogs, etc. Share this project with EVERYONE!!

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have many years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with our long time partners Panda Game Manufacturing. Who we've worked with on over 10 separate projects and have a great relationship with. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping.\n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 5 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment. I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! Let's bring Heroes of Land, Air & Sea to game tables all around the world!\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe offer a full refund, including fees, up to 14 days after the project ends. After 14 days and until your game has been packed, we offer a no questions asked refund minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover).

Refunds within 14 days are issued through payment reversal via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is funded in USD. All refunds will be issued in USD in the exact amount of USD received, minus applicable Kickstarter and payment processing fees depending on the time of your refund request.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you accept that the final look of the game, its components, materials, and rules, may differ substantially from what was presented while the Kickstarter was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our email notification requesting your pledge confirmation, via our pledge manager service, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligation to you in full for your pledge or donation. We may however, at our discretion, still refund or ship your reward if you contact us after the 8 week period.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our email notification requesting your pledge confirmation, via our pledge manager service, you agree that our responsibility is to ship your order as entered and confirmed in our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery of your order to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be required to receive your order.

Since we love The Strange and its fans at Monte Cook Games, we decided to give them the most spectacular experience with The Strange that we can create with a deluxe boxed edition.\nAs you can probably imagine, we want to make it absolutely beautiful and crammed full of all the coolest extra content we can come up with: character sheets, XP cards with a brand new design, and maybe even a gorgeous cloth version of the Ardeyn poster map, if we hit some stretch goals. We did it once before, and with your help, we\u2019re going to make that dream a reality again, this time to create a deluxe boxed edition of The Strange! \n(Already own The Strange? Don't worry\u2014we've got some things that will interest you as well as those new to the game.)\n       Our \"sharefest\" goal was to get 100 shares of this Facebook post and 100 retweets of this Twitter post so Bruce would record a 10-minute video of himself reading an excerpt from Myth of the Maker, the novel that inspired the creation of The Strange RPG. We hit that goal, and you can now watch that reading video on our YouTube channel! Thank you very much for helping spread the word about this Kickstarter campaign! \nThe Strange RPG is where stories, movies, myths, novels, and even comics and games come alive in limited alternate dimensions called recursions. Player characters explore these recursions, accumulate treasures and wonders, and defend the Earth from entities they discover who are jealous of\u2014or want to consume\u2014the real world. Recursions float in a medium that scientists call dark energy, but that PCs call the Strange. Sometimes, fictional characters and creatures in a recursion wake to the realization that they\u2019re not real. Then they seek to break out of their limited dimensions and reach Earth. As do far more vast and completely alien creatures called planetovores that have been swimming in the Strange for who knows how many millions or billions of years.\nCritically acclaimed, The Strange was nominated for the Origins Award for Best New Roleplaying Game and received 3 ENnie awards, including awards for Best Setting, Best Game, and Best Art. A novel of The Strange is about to hit store shelves, called Myth Of The Maker. \nFor more about The Strange, please visit TheStrangeRPG.com.\nArt by Matt Stawicki\n  The standard edition of The Strange RPG is a stunningly beautiful 416-page hardcover. It\u2019s currently in print (and will remain so) and is available from the Monte Cook Games store, your local game store, and online sellers such as Amazon. So why a boxed edition?\nA few years ago we created a boxed edition of Numenera that proved incredibly popular. The Reliquary box we ended up with by the time the campaign was finished was nothing short of stunning. It even ended up winning a Golden ENnie award! And as we mentioned, fans of the Cypher System have been wondering when we\u2019d give The Strange the same treatment. That time has come at last.\nThe Strange Boxed Edition Is Exclusive to This Kickstarter This is your only chance to get this edition directly. Except through a select few retailers who might support this Kickstarter, the boxed set will not be available in stores.\nA Deluxe Box\nOne of the cool things about not selling this box through retail stores is that it doesn't have to be marked like a retail product. We can leave off the bar codes and sales text and that sort of stuff. That means the entire outside of the box can just reflect the amazing esthetic of The Strange. So we\u2019re going to make it look awesome\u2014front, back, and sides! The box itself will be of sturdy design, with a deluxe linen finish. It\u2019ll be a great way to carry The Strange around, and it\u2019ll look absolutely wonderful on your game shelf. \nThis boxed set is not a new edition for The Strange. The box (see THE STRANGE BOX backer level) will contain the same content you find in the existing hardcover rulebook, but in easy-to-use, smaller books. This way, the GM can be paging through the setting guide, and a player can be looking up a new ability at the same time.\nThe books in the box will all be softcovers. With the exceptions noted in the table above, their content is not different than the existing hardcover rulebook, so if you already have that, it's not new material. And, conversely, if you don\u2019t own The Strange yet, this box gives you all the game content you\u2019d find in the hardcover. It\u2019s the same game either way. The difference is in the format.\nWe think an ultimate boxed set edition could be so much more than just that, though. What we want to do is create a boxed set so deluxe that its mere existence will seed an entirely new recursion. As stretch goals are reached, the content described as already being in THE STRANGE BOX will be improved by additional components! \nThe LIBRARY OF IMPOSSIBLE THINGS\nThe LIBRARY level includes everything provided in THE STRANGE BOX, as described under the rewards to the right. Since it grows as we unlock stretch goals, the main page is the best place to see where we are at any given time.\nBut in addition to that, backers ALSO get a PDF copy of ALL the previously published books from the original game line. All told, that\u2019s a collection of 27 titles exceeding $150 in value.  \nThe ESTATE VAULT has all the contents of THE STRANGE BOX, which means that you get all the in-box and box-upgrade content added to the campaign thanks to stretch goals, which could significantly improve the size and contents of the box. (It also has all the additional titles of the LIBRARY level.) However, the ESTATE VAULT will be even more special and deluxe, as it will be handcrafted from wood! In addition, we will add a physical Estate Badge, a book safe for storing your dice or other secrets, and a deluxe dossier to keep track of your current cases. Finally, you will get every item added by stretch goals, even goals that are not in-box upgrades to content.\n    But I Already Have The Strange!\nDon\u2019t want all the content, but really want a deluxe box to keep your stuff for The Strange in? Back at JUST THE BOX backer level and get what it says: just the box. Your existing The Strange corebook will fit nicely within it, and there\u2019ll be space for two or three additional books, plus dice, pencils, an XP or Cypher deck or whatever, and so on. If you want more than one box, choose Empty Box as an Add-On.\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. Check out our pledge calculator to help you figure out exactly how much to pledge based on the backer level and add-ons you desire.\nWant some helpful aid for calculating your total pledge amount if you want some add-ons? Go to the pledge calculator by clicking here. Once you know the total amount, return to the Kickstarter page and click Manage Your Pledge, then Change Your Pledge, then just add the new total into the Pledge Amount. You'll be able to specify the rewards you want after the campaign using BackerKit.\nArt by Matt Stawicki\nShipping and Reward Fulfillment\nSoon after the Kickstarter campaign for A Strange Box ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.\nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience. \nHere\u2019s how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll send you an email with a coupon code to redeem them. You decide when to use the coupon, and give us your correct shipping address. If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of some and bundle them together if that\u2019s more convenient for you (or you'd like to save on international shipping costs). We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date. This applies to all methods of shipping described below. \n\nIf you change address between reward shipments, you won't need to tell us, since you'll enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient's shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward. \nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge. You will be charged shipping at the time of reward redemption. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you. Plus, those of you in the UK and EU will not pay customs/importing fees.\nThe UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK or Europe: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $52, you\u2019ll pay $42. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.\nArt by Matt Stawicki\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMonte Cook Games has previously released a boxed edition of a similar-sized game (that being Numenera) to such great success that we\u2019re doing it again with The Strange. All our previous campaigns have been successful and jam-packed with rewards, and most campaigns are completely fulfilled, while those that are not continue to deliver their rewards on schedule. That means we\u2019ve delivered over 200,000 rewards. These include such varied items as corebooks for Numenera and The Strange, leather-bound deluxe corebooks, boxed sets, more than a dozen hardcover supplements, signed bookplates, playtest access, special-access seminars, meetings and dinners with the creative team, online and in-person games, and so much more.\n\nThus, while there are always challenges that can arise, we've probably already faced them. Especially considering that we\u2019ve created a deluxe boxed set edition for a different title not long ago.\n\nWe are extremely proud of our track record. Of course, there\u2019s always the danger of meteor strikes, Ebola pandemics, or catastrophic solar flares. But our staff is spread out across the country, so we\u2019re unlikely to all be wiped out at once. Unless the planetovores breach into the universe of normal matter to consume the Earth without Carter Strange around to save us, we are confident that the project will meet all its promises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "JUST THE BOX", "descp": "You get a beautiful, sturdy box to store game materials for The Strange that you already own.

Armed with 7 custom energy dice and a spirit totem that buffs their abilities, the players do battle - controlling wild energy forces carefully and cleverly to protect their own energy while defeating all rivals to become the Master Zee!\nWhy is ElemenZ different from other dice battle games? The dice in ElemenZ are both the way that players can complete combo effects and the life points of the Shaman. Instead of having a constant pool of dice and a quantity of life points, in Elemenz players must think carefully how best to protect their dice while removing the dice of rivals. Using the powers of their Totem wisely and accessing the dangerous wild 'Z' energy helps to do this - but it can be risky because too much 'Z' will backfire leaving a player vulnerable and the totem energy can quickly run out!\nHighlights\nDifferent Shaman specific powers\nPush-your-luck elements\nTake-that style of play\nRisk-versus-reward\nTactically and thematically rich\n2 different games in 1 box (2 player and a 3-4 player game)\nFast paced (approx. 15-30mins) but easy to learn\nNo two games ever play the same\nYou Get 2 Games in 1 box. ElemenZ offers 2 different games to suit your playing style!\n\nThe basic game is a tight and quick paced dice battle game for 3-4 players, ideal for families, those just learning the game or those wanting a quick challenge with friends. The (KS exclusive) expansion comes with an extra four totem boards plus 31 energy tokens offering more of a tactical energy management game - ideal for more experienced gamers.\nThe 2 player game is an energy tug-of-war game where players manipulate the pool of elemental forces (dice) in a bid to be first to energise the enigmatic monolith on planet Zee.\nGame 1 - 3-4 player dice challenge game\nGame 1 expanded - 3-4 player with Totem boards and tokens\nGame 2 - 2 player tug-of-war dice challenge game\n     Kickstarter components List:\nLimited edition game box design - different artwork from retail version\nx4 double sided boards - 1 side is for multiplayer, other side for 2 player\nx28 custom engraved dice (15mm) - 4 custom coloured sets (7 per player) \nx4 KS exclusive Totem boards - for use in the expanded game\nRulebook - will contain both English and French rules versions (more languages to follow).\nx31 KS exclusive energy tokens - for use with the totem boards\nFuture retail versions of ElemenZ will only include the 2 & 3-4 player basic games, not the totem expansion to the game. The totems will only be available as part of this KS print run and as promo items sold at shows so jump in now as a backer to get the whole bundle together.\n  The five elemental forces of nature (Air, Earth, Fire, Water and Wild 'Z' energy - called Zee) are represented by symbols on the dice and on the tokens. The dice are the energy store that each Alien Shaman player has available to dominate and defeat their opponents.\nIn the 3-4 player game players use various combinations (combos) of dice symbols rolled to trigger effects that aim to reduce enemy player's dice pools, until only 1 player is left. 'Z' symbols are wild and mimic symbols on other dice.\n\nBut the wild 'Z' is a risk versus reward mechanic - rolling 3 or more 'Z's at any time causes an immediate Wild Surge which finishes the player's turn immediately and they cannot trigger any combos (including defense combos).\n  We've provided a handy 5 point infographic that explains how the expanded 3-4 game works (the basic game works the same - only without the totems and tokens).\nThe 2 player game (pictured below) is similar but rather than defeating your opponent, it's a race to energise the enigmatic monolith - by using complementary elements. Doing so requires a healthy pile of energy dice drawn from the central pool by using combo effects. Combos must also be rolled for every dice locked in to the monolith.\nHowever, you must stay alert as the best chances of completing the monolith lie in your opponent's dice and you will need to steal some of them quickly to get ahead in the race!\n Watch the complete trailer below for a more detailed description of the alien shamans and the worlds they inhabit.\n  Click here or on the picture below for the current rules booklet (English only currently) for both games. You can also find Print-n-Play files for the boards and tokens + instructions on how to customise D6's to play the game there.\n             This game is fully tested and ready to go to the printers. That's not to say that with your help we could make it so much better/nicer/groovier (add your chosen adjective here). We have some excellent stretchgoals planned but need your help to make them real. So take a look at the first few below - if we smash through these we have plenty more planned but don't want to reveal all secrets yet... (hmm, ok then, just one... Avatars).\n    On a windswept ridge, four Master Shamans, ambassadors of their race, climb towards an enigmatic rocky and ancient monolith atop the summit. This planet, Planet 'Z' as it is called in all four languages, is a wild uninhabited place of raw and uncontrolled primal energy - the cosmic forces that shape life on all planets.\nExcept for every seven years. \nThen, the Master Shamans arrive to do battle, summoning their elemental totems, energetic forces of wild energy from deep within the world, channelling the primal energy in a duel to decide which culture will gain ascendancy for the next seven years.\nYou take on the role of one of these alien Shamans.

We can therefore keep the shipping as simple and cost effective for you as a backer as we possibly can by taking on some of this large cost ourselves with the safety of a company that really knows it's stuff.\nThus we are able to offer reduced rates for the EU, US and Canada - which is why we can proudly offer hassle-free 'friendly' shipping to the EU, USA as well as Australia and New Zealand (there should be 'no' extra customs or tax fees to pay) when you get your pledge reward. \nNote: The expected weight of the game is ~1.5kg per copy and our shipping costs reflect this which is why we will use a tracked postage service for international backers pledging for 2 or copies and for the Master Zee pledge level.\nCanadian Backers: We can probably 'friendly' post to Canada also for single game copy pledges (but we cannot guarantee this as the threshold for personal imports is quite low).\n      ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDESIGN: \nElemenZ is ~90% complete. We need to reformat the rules and translate to French and would like to improve the graphic design elements a little but essentially the game is ready to roll! Even with potential stretchgoal unlocks and additional artwork acquired, we will not be far from completion. We have factored in these additional time elements to our projected plan and can still aim for release latest in November 2017.\n\nMANUFACTURE: \nOur chosen partner for production is Whatzgames from Shanghai, the team behind Iello's and Repos manufacturing among many others. They produce high quality games, are reliable and know the industry inside out as well as the requirements for Kickstarters. BadCatGames has every confidence in them to do a sterling job and produce a stunning game for us on time.\n\nFREIGHT & SHIPPING: \nOur haulage, shipping and fulfillment partner in the UK is the highly regarded GamesQuest that has fulfilled kickstarters for CoolMiniorNot, Modiphius, Stonemaier Games, and many more. Through them we can offer very cost effective backer shipping rates, quality control and rapid distribution anywhere in the world. Although our worst case deadline is Nov 2017, we are really aiming on delivery and fulfillment much earlier than that and we will keep you all informed every step of the way.\n\nUNFORSEEN EVENTS: \nThe BadCatGames team has been in retail and distribution between us for over 20 years so we know what can potentially go wrong. However, there is always a small chance of odd things happening - such as boats sinking, fires in warehouses or us being carried off by Byahkee if we play any more Arkham Horror. Rest assured, BadCatGames needs to prove itself to the gaming market and we aim to do this with flying colours and 100% happy backers!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "BadCat Games\n4 created \u00b7 88 backed\nBadCatGames is an indie tabletop game design studio and publisher of exciting games like Elemenz and Gladiatores: Blood for Roses.

Deluxe CORE Backers and CORE Backers will receive unpainted minis. STANDEE CORE Backers will receive STANDEES.\n Featured Reward Tiers:\n     Heroes of Land, Air & Sea is a 4X style board game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) for 2-6* players that plays in 2 hours, and features 80 highly detailed miniatures, including an option for pre-painted hero figures, and over 30 constructs! *To play with 5 or 6 players you would need at least 1 added Faction Pack. The core game plays 2-4 players.  \nDeluxe Reward Tiers offer an option to have your Hero Miniatures come pre-painted. Miniatures in Heroes of Land, Air & Sea are made of PVC and ABS on a 28mm scale and with 24mm bases.\n Heroes of Land, Air & Sea breaks the mold of regular 4X games in that it is easy to learn, simple to play, and games only last 2 hours. It is a Scott Almes design after all, designer of the Tiny Epic series. \nIt's this simple: each player performs two actions per round. You can take a Capital Action, which could be followed by other players by using a peon. Or, you may take a Conquest action, which can be rallied and allow you to double down on your own actions. After each player has taken their two actions, players will collect resources based on the regions they control and then start a new round. This continues until a player triggers one of the four end game conditions: Expand, Exploit, Explore, or Exterminate!\n  In Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, Scott has us warring across a giant game board (39 in. x 26 in.), sailing the great blue sea in boats that hold your minis and soaring through the clouds with minis on the backs of dragons, gryphons, and in airships!\n  Heroes of Land, Air & Sea is the classic tale of orcs vs humans and the warring factions of a fantasy realm. It is a game of territory control, resource management, mastering your faction and exploiting your opponent's weaknesses. In Heroes of Land, Air & Sea you'll have 3 heroes, each with special abilities that will become more powerful as the game goes on. You'll have 5 warriors, which will defend your capital city and conquer regions across the land. You will also have 12 peons, who are used to collect resources, build buildings, as well as take extra actions. Peons are a limited resource, so you must deploy them wisely in order to ensure victory.\nWill you rely on the Human's resourcefulness? The Orc's strength? The ingenuity of the Dwarves?\n  or the magic of the Elves?\n  In Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, every decision is a meaningful decision and players will need to be clever to claim victory. One way to surprise your opponent is through well timed use of SPELLS! The effects of which range from resource gain and buffs to your army to interrupts and counter spells. \nBut the focus is always on the 4 X's: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate! Each of them represent an end game trigger.\nEXPLORE  \nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea features a gigantic 39 inch by 26 inch beautifully illustrated 6-fold game board!\nClick to see the Full Map! \u00a9 2017 Gamelyn Games, all rights reserved.\n  During play, the land and water regions will feature exploration tokens that offer surprises to the players brave enough to enter.\nOnce the final exploration token is revealed, the end of the game is triggered.  \nEXPAND  \nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea you will need to expand your kingdom, your army and your reach. Building certain structures in your Capital will allow you to recruit Heroes! \nAnd, Heroes become better as you level up your Capital City.\nRecruit all of your peons and warriors and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nEXPLOIT \nThis wouldn't be much of a 4X without the most important X, exploitation! Simply collecting resources and turtling in your castle won't get you very far in Heroes of Land, Air & Sea. Players will need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their faction and that of their opponents to assure victory. Part of that is knowing when and where to build your towers to secure area control. Build 3 towers and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nEXTERMINATE\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea features a luckless combat system that requires timing and wits. To resolve a war, players compare the strength value of their armies, as modified by their selection of a single Tactic Card, highest strength wins. Each player has an identical deck of 7 Tactic Cards and, in each war, must secretly choose one of the 7 to play in conjunction with their army.\nThis gives players perfect information on the potential maneuvers of their opponent. But, how you will exploit this during play is up to you to discover!  \nDestroy an opponent's Capital City and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nVICTORY  \nVictory points can be earned during play for winning wars and casting spells and at the end of the game for certain units trained, regions controlled, buildings built, towers built (based on their distance from your Capital City), and the level of your Capital City. Whoever have the highest victory points at the end of the game, wins!\n        Updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\n  Box Contents:\n1 Giant Game Board (39x26in., six-fold)\n80 Miniatures (20 unique designs), OR 80 Standees (based on tier)\n32 Constructs (8 per faction)\n4 Capital City Boards (1 per faction)\n21 Wood Resource Tokens (for up to 6 players*)\n8 Action Tokens (2 per faction)\n4 Score Tokens (1 per faction)\n1 First Player Token\n90 Exploration Tokens\n12 Hero Cards (3 per faction)\n6 Decks of 7 Tactic Cards (for up to 6 players*)\n48 Spell Cards\n6 Plastic Stands (for aerial constructs)\n1 Rulebook\n*The Core Box comes with 4 factions to support 4 players; but is does include 2 additional Tactic Decks and 6 additional Wood Resource Tokens to potentially support up to 6 players if additional factions are available.

Click to Follow on Twitter!\n      *The Caves and the Sewers sets have 153 cards in each of them: The only cards that are in both sets are 3 weapon cards, 150 of the cards are unique to that set.  Each set contains 27 Double sized cards (126*88mm) and 126 poker sized cards(88*63mm).  See below for more details.\n     In Legends Untold 1 to 4 players* take on the role of unlikely heroes, the final hope of a conquered people.  Starting with only your wits and a crude weapon you will explore the Weeping Caves trying to gain access to the great free city of Dun Mordhain.\nWe want to make Legends Untold because we love to play immersive adventure games but don't have the time to set them up and play them very often. Inspired by \u201cChoose your own adventure\u201d books, RPGs, and fantasy board games, Legends offers a deep adventuring experience that sets up in 5 minutes, has no player downtime and you can finish in an hour.\n * The game can be played with up to 8 players if more than one set is purchased.\nFor more details checkout our wiki at https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/198832/legends-untold/wiki\n        We have more stretch goals planned beyond this.   \nWe have huge plans for this game described in the sections above but to give you an idea of what we have mapped out to date, that content would include: Various packs at higher Ranks (Apprentice, Journeyman and so forth). Culture packs helping describe the lands and cultures of a people: e.g. the Celti or the Acheans. Bonus Occupation and Mastery paths which will add another facet to gameplay such as Alchemy, Crafting and Druidism. For now though we now we need to walk before we can run!\nWe were finalists in the Wyvern's Lair (the gamers answer to Dragons Den / Shark Tank) competition at the UKGE in June 2016. Here are the reasons to buy this game we gave in that pitch:\nConvenience\nPortable with small shelf space requirement. \n5 minute set up, no player downtime, \n1 hour play time. Drop in drop out functionality. \nDepth\nNot just hack n' slash in this game you can: disarm or bypass traps, navigate obstacles, investigate curiosities and encounter NPCs. Surprise mechanics which reward scouting and good marching order decisions assist rapid, interactive combat, where you can help or hinder your colleagues with historic weapons which perform differently from one another. Advantage/disadvantage rules require teamwork and utilise a range of upgrades and choices to help build your hero. \nFlexibility\nModular Hero build, 1000s of combinations with no restrictions. \nPlay this game solo or coop as a boardgame no GM required. \nAdd a GM and play it as an RPG. \nReplay Value\nLegends Untold is designed to give you a different experience every time. The base Caves set has over 360,000 possible maps which you will create as you explore. Dynamic environments produce physical effects like floods and cave ins. Mix any foe with any environment. Play Goblins in Caves or Lizardmen in Sewers or Undead in Crypts or mix them up as you desire. Or combine them all to create a Multi Environment Giant Adventure (MEGA) game.\nPacking more game into a smaller space.\n Legends has a huge amount of depth and so we've tried to squeeze as much content as we can onto the cards.  There are no duplicate cards in Legends, a lot of the hero cards can be rotated to give you an upgraded version when you level up.  The talent cards all have a number of abilities on them giving you multiple effects on the same card.\nThe Stretch Goals section below shows our plans to give you a game which is almost 50% bigger if we can unlock them.\nIn the Caves and Sewers* starter sets we need to cover off the foes you will fight, the environment you will explore, the effects you may sustain (poison, fear etc) and the modular components of your Hero.  To help explain this here is a listing of the card composition for the Starter sets prior to any stretch goals being unlocked:\n* Please note the campaign builds on a concept of eight heroes splitting into two parties of four to help save their people. The first party is represented in the Caves starter set.\nIf we can unlock a degree of funding that makes it commercially viable then we will make the Sewers starter set available as an add on.  The Sewers set will have an identical composition of card types (Foes etc ) but with the exception of three cards (the bow, the axe and the spear which represent the three most commonly available weapons to the Heroes all of the cards in the Sewers deck will be different to those in the Caves deck. For example the Barriers, Obstacles etc. will all be different.\nAll hero cards are interchangeable across both the Caves and Sewers Sets giving you for example 32 Skill Talents (which is 96 individual abilities) to customize your Hero with. The foes from the Sewers set (Lizardkin) can be played with the Caves set giving a huge amount of added flexibility.\nWill you accept the challenge and head forth into the Weeping Caves?  \nEach turn you will be required to make important decisions to determine the fate of your heroes. Let's show you those decisions and explain the game.\n Let the Adventure begin!\nYou are in the Weeping Caves, before you proceed you must decide:  \nWhich exit will you take deeper into the caves?  \nWhich of you will lead the party and scout the path ahead?  \nWho will take guard at the rear of the party?  \nWill you proceed slowly and with stealth, or avoid wasting what precious time you have?  \nAll of these things impact your readiness in this location, whether you are alert, bold or careless impacts everything you can do in a turn.\nDynamic Mapping\nThe scout draws the new location, matching the lighting levels where possible, and adding it to the map as you journey onwards.\n  Obstacles\nThe amber ringed man pushing a boulder icon means there is an obstacle on the way into this location. Drawing from the adventure deck you find that a chasm blocks your path!\nWill you use rope to help you swing across?\nCan you make the jump, quick but dangerous?\nShould you climb around, slow but safe?\nBeing alert and having a light source will help you, and it being a team trial, the entire party can put their hero's talents to use in assisting. Each test shows what happens if you pass (in the green column) or fail (in the red column).  \nExploration\nNow you are past the chasm, the magnifying glass in the cave shows a search zone, a place where there could be useful loot or strange curiosities to be found.\nWill you search carefully and burn time or search quickly and risk being caught off guard. \n What will you find - loot, a trap perhaps?\nThis time your search finds some Lobgourds, crudely made firebombs that some goblin has left behind.\n Barriers \nThe blue ringed barrier icons show that your way forward is blocked and you will need you to figure out a way past them - this one is an old wooden door:\nWill you?\nPick the Lock, which takes time\nForce it open, but perhaps hurt yourself in trying\nLever the hinges off you get through, but give whatever is on the far side time to hear you coming\nAfter each barrier you draw to see what lies beyond it... will it be the Goblin Shaman?  A spiked pit?  Captured merchants?  An ancient shrine?  The game will be different and unique each time you play .\nContinuing into the darkness of the weeping caves you will find combat, bizarre curiosities and characters to converse with alongside fully customizable heroes and a campaign system to grow your heroes' talents and equipment.  This is the essence of Legends Untold.\n     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         This is our first game and we are trying to keep things really simple to get you guys the game as quickly as possible.  We have spoken to a number of fulfillment suppliers and given the small size of the box involved there is only a marginal difference in shipping worldwide.\nWe have therefore adopted a flat rate of \u00a37 to cover shipping costs to any destination.\nPlease note we will not ship to Brazil or Russia.\nContent:  Currently we have designed 80% of all the cards for both the Caves and Sewers packs.  The remaining 20% has come from suggestions made via the reviews seen above as shown in the Stretch Goals section.\nGraphic Design: The card templates are 90% complete, the only remaining tasks are finalising things where mechanics have dictated a change.\nArt: Many of the cards require final artwork.  We have used placeholder art on a number of the cards where necessary.  In some cases it is a matter of commissioning an entirely new piece, in others it is colouring an existing ink drawing.  For example all 10 of the basic Foe cards in the Caves set have an ink drawing but we have only had the Shaman coloured up to show a final copy.  We have an established team of Artists alongside our Graphic Designer ready to go to complete this work for us. So in essence we need your help to take concept art and turn it into finished cards:\nRules: The mechanics are complete, we have play tested this game continually over three years.  Our biggest challenge is explaining the game in the rules owing to its depth. 9 times out of 10 when we demo this game people love it, however there is no Inspiring Games App (the Kev App as Hugh jokingly calls it) which you can call on just to explain rules at any point.  This is a challenge we recognise that we need help with.  Our intent is to contract an external Editor to improve the layout and terminology within the rules. We wanted to get the rules out to reviewers first to get their opinion on the game.  Thanks to those reviews and the community on BGG we have identified improvements which will help with this communication and ease gameplay.  When we have locked down the contents of the game (i.e. which Stretch Goals have been unlocked) we can then proceed to contract with the external Editor to improve the rulebook.  Feedback from gamers has been consistent, retain the depth but lose unnecessary complexity, we intend to deliver that for you in the final rulebook.\nLegends Untold is our debut game but one that we hope will be around for many years to come.  We have planned an immersive campaign for you to help you build out your adventure and world at a pace you desire.\nYou begin as a reluctant hero at Novice rank and have nothing but a crude weapon and some talents to help you along the way.  In the Caves set you will undergo 8 scenarios leveling up each time you succeed until you achieve Apprentice rank.\nBut what of the other party, those other 4 heroes we mentioned? They chose the alternate path and descended to the Great Sewer.  Well if we can reach a certain funding level (we don't want to walk before we can run) that second party will be available via the other Novice rank starter set as an add on.\nBoth parties are trying to reach a way into the enormous city of Dun Mordhain, which remained free against the onslaught of the Newcomer conquest.  These two Novice rank starter sets are entirely interchangeable giving you an incredible amount of choice in your set up. Both sets will lead you to another part of the underworld of Dun Mordhain.  Upon progressing to Apprentice rank you will be able to continue with your journey through either The Crypts, The Silent Dark or the Brethren Works.  These packs will require you to complete 12 scenarios before you finally find a way into Dun Mordhain.\nThe Heroes will now have achieved Journeyman Rank and at this point our vision would be that they must spend 16 Scenarios in and around the City to finally negotiate a permanent home for their people. Dun Mordhain is truly huge and we would anticipate an environment which includes, the defences, the midden, the harbour, the castle, the merchant district and many more places. \nAt this point the heroes will have reached Skilled rank and be ready to set off into the wider world in a direction of your choosing. \nThis animation shows you the anticipated career path tree for the Student:\n     The year is 2725 in the reckoning of the Brethren.  Two years have passed since the Siege of Dun Mordhain and the Treaty of the Peoples has been signed. \nAt Skilled rank you choose where to go next and have your own adventure in a huge open world environment that we want YOUR help to build. We will lay down the bones but want you the gamers to help flesh out the world and tell us what you would like in it.  Why?  Because we are asking you to invest your time and money in our game so we want to make sure we give back that sense of identity and love to you. We are making this world together for you to share for many years to come.  \nThe Map above shows Mor Nadar (Big Country, the world known to the Celti peoples).\nAt Skilled rank you could for example travel East to Aes Nu, the great falls of Evermist and investigate its hidden secrets. Or West to the Legendary Areten, the first people with innate magical abilities whom no one has seen in centuries.\nAlong the way you will travel though vast wilderness environments.  Here you have a choice, you can instant time that travel and proceed directly to your chosen Environment, or play out that travel using the Wilderness packs available.  \nHere a whole new dimension to the game will open up.  You must deal with weather, time keeping, getting lost, finding food and shelter as you travel. \nAnd here is where we want you to be able to reuse all of those assets (caves, crypts etc) you may have purchased on the way.  If you are journeying between two cities and are in the woods and see a cave...well if you have the caves set you can play your very own open world side quest using the existing assets you have already purchased.\nSo it's up to you really, it is YOUR open world and your adventure.  Will you journey north to the Lands of the Jotnar to help free the Viki from their tyrannical masters, or South to glorious Achean City States?\nThe decision is entirely up to you. \nOK we want to let you play the game.  We will try and ease you in using a Level 0 Scenario.  This means you don't need all the rules right now just the ones relevant to the situation.  We hope this playable demo is fun, let us know how you got on in the comments section please!\n    Kevin Young - CEO, Inspiring Games\nA gamer since the age of 10, starting with Red Box D&D (yes I'm that old) and being a lifelong fan of RPGs, board games, card games and all things tabletop really.

The first player to complete the puzzle by positioning their heroes accordingly collect the quest card and its benefits. \n  Each round is broken down into two phases, the day phase and the night phase.\n  In the night phase, players will roll adventure dice in a communal press-your-luck fashion to try to accomplish the tasks at the locations they ended at during the day phase. This could be fighting a goblin, learning a spell, or delving into a temple. But be careful, if you take too much damage you may exhaust and lose all that round's progress and more! \nPlayers keep track of their heroes' collective health, power and progress on personal adventure logs.\nAnd when you acquire powerful items, you equip them right to your ITEMeeples\u2122! \nPlayers keep track of their spell progress, and the rounds magic level on a community magic mat. As the round's magic increases, goblins become more threatening and even your own power turns from good to bad!\nAfter five rounds, the game is over. While you may not have single handedly saved the world, did you accomplish more than the other players?

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with our long time partners Panda Game Manufacturing. Who we've worked with on over 10 separate projects and have a great relationship with. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked again for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 4 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment. I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress.\n\nThank you for your trust in us!

Now, we want to take the next step by delivering beautiful physical books and PDFs to our fans. But we can\u2018t do that without your help!\n\nIf you have played roleplaying games in the past, you may be wondering What makes Open Legend worth my time? What makes it different? The secret\u2019s in the title: Open. Ok, maybe it's not such a secret. Everything about the game is about opening up the doors of possibility for a flexible narrative that still has lots of strategic choices and a solid game aspect that delivers in the fun department. Here are a few things that are unique about Open Legend.\nOpen Narrative. The rules respond and react to your narrative, not the other way around. So you can get deep into the strategy but have the freedom to shape many stories from each combination of character attributes and feats. It's not the first time a classless system has been attempted, but we believe that both the strategy of character development and the storytelling of freeform roleplay can compliment each other. So we've merged the two in a fresh way that (through much testing) has proven very rewarding to veterans and newcomers alike.\n\nYou aren\u2019t tied down to a limited subset of character options or a pre-chosen path, archetype, or race. Instead you paint a picture of your character in your imagination, and then use the rules like a paintbrush to bring forth your creative masterpiece. The only limit is your imagination (and maybe the GM\u2019s veto power). This is accomplished through feats, attributes, perks, and flaws. All characters can access all of the options for each, rather than being forced into a list of set classes with a menu of skills, you freely chose from each set of options and create an infinitely variable and unhindered character.\nOpen Genre. We designed Open Legend for all genres, so the core rules are compatible with any setting. The mechanics focus on resulting effects rather than causes, allowing you to explain the cause in a way that tells the most satisfying story at your table. Struggle for survival in a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland. Or soar amidst the clouds on your crystal-powered airship in a steampunk-inspired campaign. Or explore an alien-infested space station abandoned at the edge of the universe. The possibilities are endless.\nOpen Dice. In Open Legend, dice EXPLODE! That means that whenever ANY die rolls maximum, you get to re-roll it and add the new roll to your total, ad infinitum. The volatile nature of dice rolling makes every roll count. Each session of Open Legend is full of tense moments and the tides can turn at a moment\u2019s notice, for better or worse.\nOpen Source. That\u2019s right. The core rules are written with accommodation for free use in commercial and non-commercial 3rd Party publications. That means anyone can publish their own adventures, rules supplements, and more. We\u2019re excited to see what unexpected additions to Open Legend come next!\n (cover art proposed, but not final)\nAfter years of testing, we brought Open Legend to the public eye in February 2016 (over 8 months ago) and we've got tons of great actual play footage to check out. If you're interested in the Amaurea's Dawn Campaign Setting, head over to YouTube to watch either Hyper RPG or Encounter Roleplay to see our LIVE actual play sessions that highlight a number of the important plot threads woven into the fabric of Amaurea.\n    We've created a system that rewards creativity and strategy without the strenuous bookkeeping of bulkier systems, but with all the epic high points you\u2019d expect when the dice tumble unexpectedly and explode in glorious triumph or untimely disaster. Open Legend gives you all the tools to play that character you've dreamt of but couldn't find the right expansion book for while also seamlessly working with tried and true character concepts.\nWe wanted to do more than just give you a rules set and set you loose, though we love all the world-builders in our community! To demonstrate Open Legend's multi-genre capacity we're releasing a companion book, the Amaurea's Dawn Campaign Setting. Written by legendary storytellers such as Ed Greenwood and Matthew Mercer, Amuarea\u2019s Dawn serves as as an exemplar campaign setting with a genre-bending and narrative rich world. Breathtaking illustration by world-class illustrators accompany and reveal the deeply layered world.\n\nSo, enough of that -- let's hear the story!\nIt was years ago the portal closed. None who passed through had ever returned. Driven to the brink of self-destruction, the Council of Three re-opened the old portal. Stepping through once more in a desperate gamble, they hope to discover untapped resources and save their dying planet, the people of Schlectenberg struggle to survive in the savage jungle world of Amaurea. But with new hope comes hidden danger for the settlers\u2019 -- their unwelcome pilfering does not sit well with native elven houses.\nHouse Valurien, a collective of savage shamans tap into \"The Weave\" but are tainted by nightmare energy. Driven by blood magic, their minds blaze with trances fueled by hallucinogens.\nAt the root of their defilement lies Naruthagol (brought to life by Matthew Mercer), a dread terror that is often spoken of but never seen. His powerful connection to a tainted manifestation of The Weave is slowly poisoning their minds. \nHouse Rhuviel prizes beauty and harmony above all else. Once noble and heroic, their glory wanes, as their leader is blinded by bitterness over his tragic loss.\nHouse Nivenilya manipulates the basic building blocks of life despite the protests of the other Houses, working without sleep in an unending push toward a bio-engineered perfection -- one of their own design.\n Dark forces undermine diplomatic relations between the worlds and threaten the delicate balance. There are those who aim to profit from war. Wielding dark magic, they\u2019ll stop at nothing to restore Schlectenberg's place as a proud conquering nation that devours everything in its path.\nSet forth as a Schlecten pioneer, seeking adventure in the new world, or as a loyalist pillaging Aumarean resources, or resist the invasion as a native Amaurean standing resolutely to halt the tide of Manifest Destiny.\n In life cycles, the dusk of one often heralds the dawn of another... but is this.... Amaurea's Dawn?\n      *** Backer's Choice Mini-Campaign Setting Options \nThe Legacy of Eight - In the ashes of the Immortal Empire, new alliances and successors vie for control of the universe.

It is also available for immediate purchase and delivery HERE, if you'd rather not wait. If you're a retailer and would like to carry Tiny Epic Galaxies please inquire HERE.\n                    Deluxe content features the Drones mini-expansion, which integrates with the pilots, and four additional pilot cards. Additional pilots to include TWO very special cameo appearances by Andy Weir and Tim Schafer!! See them compete in Tiny Epic Galaxies on TableTop Season 4 (coming soon)!\n  ***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

Pilots (Variable Powers)! Now players compete to hire the best pilots, with powerful abilities, in addition to competing over the best planets.\nPilots are hired by activating 2, or 3, like dice. You activate 2 like dice if the pilot you're hiring is trained to fly the ship you're assigning them to, or you activate 3 like dice if you need to assign the pilot to a ship they are not trained to fly.\n2. Exploration (Press-Your-Luck)! Now you can send your ships into unexplored space on a hunt for resources or exploration badges! But beware, you may end up in the orbit of a black hole or being forced to lose resources of your own. To explore, you simply move a ship onto the exploration card. Then, if there are any exploration cards face up, you may take one. OR, you can flip over the top card of the deck, if it's red, you must take it and stop exploring. If it's green, you can take it, or go again until 3 exploration cards are face up, at which point you would have to take the next card you flip.\n3. Badges (Set-Collection)! Thought you had a handle on everyone's scores in Tiny Epic Galaxies?? Now you'll have to think again. Players will be collecting exploration badges from pilots they hire and exploration cards they acquire. After the game is over, players are rewarded bonus victory points for each badge type they have the most of. These points can stack up fast and provide opportunities for come-from-behind victories! \n  Since Tiny Epic Galaxies Beyond the Black is an expansion to Tiny Epic Galaxies, we will grandfather the component qualities from TEG into TEGBTB.\nFREE COMPONENT UPGRADES\n2mm Box Thickness\nSpot UV Box Logos\nBox Interior Printing (using the hangar image at the top of the page)\n310 gsm Ivory Core Linen Cardstock\nCards with Rounded Corners\nBelow are additional upgrades the game will come with if we are able to reach the listed goals.

To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a small discount for ALL shipping, but no shipping is free.\nRegarding customs: because this game comes in a tiny box with a low declaration, most international backers, of 1 and 2 copies, will not get hit with customs or import fees. The games will be delivered right to your door. We have shipped thousands and thousands of copies of Tiny Epic games to international backers without any occurrences.\n  Add-ons, such as base and deluxe copies of TEGBTB, Premium Print & Plays (including the TEGBTB premium PnP), previous Tiny Epic games, play mats, and more, will be offered in PledgeManager. Though the full menu won't be offered until the PledgeManager is open.\nAll reward tiers offer access to PledgeManager. \nYou MAY add to your pledge for add-ons shown on the above PledgeManager menu and your additional funds will be available for you in PledgeManager. \nPlease do not add to your pledge for items not shown on the above PledgeManager menu. \n      The 6 design goals of a Tiny Epic game!\n\"Tiny Epic\" is an exclusive series of small box games produced by Gamelyn Games and designed by Scott Almes.  \nEach game in the series is entirely unique but strictly adheres to TWO core values: TINY and EPIC!  \n\u2022 TINY referring to the small box used for each game AND the simple, easy to understand, set of rules each possess.  \n\u2022 EPIC referring to their surprisingly gratifying gameplay.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with our long time partners Panda Game Manufacturing. Who we've worked with on over 10 separate projects and have a great relationship with. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China. \n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked again for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 4 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Also, Vi includes a range of ear gel sizes to ensure a custom fit that\u2019s comfortable for extended wear.\nFor our first release, we\u2019ll focus on creating a complete experience focused for RUNNING.

The Board Game is a strategic game of infection, evolution and extinction for 1-5* players lasting 60-90 minutes. Each player is a deadly disease competing against other players in a battle to be first to infect and wipe out the world! \nBased on the bestselling video game \u2018Plague Inc.\u2019 with over 70 million players worldwide, Plague Inc: The Board Game combines the best bits of the original game with a unique tabletop design. The result is a game with a realistic theme and engaging gameplay which can be enjoyed by anyone who likes the idea of infecting people with the plague!\nPlague Inc: The Board Game has been in development for almost 2 years and is fun, polished and has been extensively tested. Now we need your help to get the game manufactured.\n(* Base game is 1-4 players with 5th Player expansion available)\n  In return for your support, you will get a first edition copy of Plague Inc: The Board Game at a discounted price as well as a Kickstarter Exclusive - the Patient Zero Pack with extra cards which add new strategic options alongside some mildly humorous crowdfunding themed content. Other pledge levels are also available which expand the player count to 5 and add extra Plague Inc. content for enthusiasts.\n  As more people back the project - stretch goals will be unlocked which will add additional content and features to the game for free. (For all pledge levels)\n    In Plague Inc: The Board Game, players spread their infection across the world by placing tokens in cities - earning DNA points if they are dominant. Players choose which countries are placed on the board but they must be both climate resistant and connected to a country before it can be infected. \nEach player is a unique disease. They start off infecting one country on the World Board - but soon they will spread.\nDiseases start weak and unspecialised but as players develop symptoms - they will become stronger and spread exponentially.\nPlayers choose which genetic traits they want from their hand of Trait Cards. More powerful traits cost more DNA points.\nPlayers can upgrade their unique pathogen by evolving trait cards onto an evolution slide (with DNA points).\nThe symptoms a player evolves on their Evolution Slide significantly changes how their disease behaves.\nOnce countries become fully infected - the controlling player tries to kill them with the Death Dice! The more lethal the disease, the more likely the country is to be wiped out.\nWhen a country dies, players may receive Event Cards which can be played to gain an advantage - or hinder an opponent.\nEvent cards have unique and powerful effects. Experienced players may save them for use in devastating combos.\n  So - now you probably want to know how the game actually works!\nYou may be lucky enough to know someone who has playtested Plague Inc: The Board Game but for everyone else, here is a video to explain things a bit more. Warning - this hasn't been edited into a flashy promotional clip - it is simply me (James - the creator of the game) explaining the rules, playing a few turns and infecting a billion people or so to help you get a feel for the game.\nYou can also read the rules for Plague Inc: The Board Game here. (If you have any feedback - please share it in the comments section) \n  \u201cI can see it becoming a favorite at the various evil masterminds' tabletop nights.

Shipping fees are automatically added to your pledge at checkout. Shipping is US, UK, EU, Canada and Australia friendly to avoid any VAT / import fees (we believe in spreading plagues everywhere!) For all other countries - we will try our best to get it to you as easily as possible as well!\nIf you want - you can add an extra copy of the game to your pledge without paying extra shipping. See the 'Extra Copies' section below for more information. \nUPDATE 20th May - extra copies now possible!\nEach pledge level comes with a copy of the game - but sometimes people might want to add an extra copy to their pledge to save on shipping. \nTo add a second game to your pledge, you must increase your pledge by the correct amount for the game version that you want (so $30 for the standard game, $36 for the Plague Plus game etc.) To do this, manually increase the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nPlague Inc: The Board Game has been created in house by Ndemic Creations - the company behind the original Plague Inc. which has been played by over 70 million players worldwide.\nJames Vaughan (Lead Designer), Collette Tarbuck (Artist), Peter Choate (Designer), Rosanna Vaughan (Designer), Lynx (Cat)\nIn addition to the core team - a big thanks is in order to everyone else at Ndemic Creations as well as the hundreds of people who have playtested the game. We couldn't have done it without you :)\nThe game has been designed and extensively tested already. Now, your input and support will help make sure that the game is as good as it possibly can be!

It is designed for a party of between four and six 1st or 2nd level characters, taking them up to at least 4th level at the end of the chapter.\nThe Village of Solis is a modest village at the Southern tip of a far away continent, isolated from most other known settlements.\nAlmost a century ago, the village suffered through a dark time where evil ruled the land, and back then that evil was vanquished by a group known only as \u201cThe Five\u201d. After the defeat of the unknown evil and the disappearance of \u201cThe Five\u201d, Solis rebuilt itself. As such, it has been at peace for decades.\nNow a new, unknown evil looms, threatening to spread darkness and destruction over the land and dominate the continent. The village has grown peaceful since its first encounter with this evil and is no longer equipped to deal with this threat, so the call goes out for new adventurers to come to the aid of Solis and protect it from whatever may threaten it.\nThat might sound a little vague... that's on purpose. The party starts off with an idea of who the \"big bad\" is and what kind of threat he may pose to the village, but there are much more powerful forces at work that threaten the world.\nIt is designed to be somewhat of an introductory adventure, designed for a group of five 1st or 2nd level characters. \nThe adventure is divided up into three acts:\nAct I - Homecoming: The players arrive in Solis and hope to gain employment as mercenaries working for the village elders, but are quickly caught up in a surprise assault on the village by an elvish warlock named Arlen and his undead army.\nAct II - The Darkened Vale: After defending Solis, the players are tasked with retrieving a powerful artifact before it is acquired by the forces of evil. They must travel the perilous road north to the ruined city of Atrus and the Tower of Light.\nAct III - Into the Light: Upon arriving at the Tower of Light, the players must ascend the tower, confront Arlen and retrieve the artifact.\nThe campaign is in a \"far away land\" (which, as it stands now, doesn't even have a name) and designed to be setting agnostic, not bound to any existing campaign setting. This was done not only for legal reasons and to remain compliant with the System Reference Document, but it allows this campaign to be inserted into your own world or any setting you may already have established with your players.\nThe concept of The Coming Dark originated from an alternate reality game we were once developing called Rachel's Walk. Due to personal strife at the time, that ARG never manifested itself but a lot of concepts from it found their way into TCD.\nTo say TCD has been in development for some time is somewhat of an understatement; it has been in development for close to five years, and has been converted to at least three other game systems (4E, 13th Age and Pathfinder) before finding its place in 5th Edition. Through the years, it has also been significantly streamlined; it was once close to 200 pages in bloat, but with the assistance and feedback of playtesters (it's been run on at least three online forums) and those who have read the campaign, it has been dramatically improved and has evolved into what it is now.\nThis campaign is being published for 5th Edition through the OGL and under the guidelines set forth in the System Reference Document 5.0 as provided by Wizards of the Coast. \nDigital and printed copies will be fulfilled through Drive Thru RPG.\nThere have been a lot of other companies and individuals publishing content for 5E. A lot of these have done little more than take a Word document and export it to PDF, with no regard for the overall appearance and quality of the product, so long as they are first to market. We're not like that, and that's part of the reason this has been in development for so long: this project is very personal to us, and we want to make it the best that we can before the world sees it.\nSo if you're expecting another \"black wall of poorly formatted text on a white background\" style adventure, prepare to be disappointed...\nSample tactical map from TCD1, Act II : Wayside Inn and Roadside Keep\nAll the existing cartography was done by myself (using Adobe Fireworks CS6 and creative assets from ProFantasy Campaign Cartographer 3). The adventure includes eight pages of maps, detailing all areas in the Tower of Light as well as supplemental areas such as The Wayside Inn and the village of Solis.\nSample tactical map from TCD1 : Village of Solis and surrounding area\nCreating exterior maps isn't exactly our strong suit, so if this Kickstarter does absurdly well we may commission a cartographer to re-create our world and city maps. There are certain well known cartographers that we would really, really, really like to do maps for this campaign.\nThe Coming Dark, Chapter One: Into the Light is pretty much written (clocks in at 85 pages), and is comparable in size to other hardcover adventures like Rise of Tiamat...\nSize comparison with the 5th Edition DMG (not included in backer rewards). Don't mind the temporary cover...\n(NOTE: The temporary cover was created only so that the proof could adequately go through the Drive Thru RPG review process; they are picky at times, we couldn't get a proof without making a cover so there it is. Obviously, once we get a proper cover - which is what this Kickstarter is for - it will be replaced) \nInterior of hardcopy proof, compared in size with the 5E DMG (not included in backer rewards)\n...but it has not gone through editing and - besides the maps some very simple images of certain key elements - does not have a cover or any interstitial artwork. This Kickstarter is meant to raise the funds necessary to give it the proper editing treatment it deserves and to at least get a decent cover worthy of the product. Stretch goals, if any, will be used to add more interior art and to make the product better.\nThe Coming Dark, Chapter Two (subtitle pending, but tentative subtitle is In Search of the Fallen) and The Coming Dark, Chapter Three: The Black Citadel are outlined and some writing has begun, but they are nowhere near being ready at this time. Depending on the success or failure of this project, we'll see what happens with those.\n$1 Level: Thanks! Every little bit helps! You will get your name listed in the final product's credits.\n$8 Level - Digital PDF: You will receive a code to download both a full color and a \"printer friendly\" PDF from Drive Thru RPG, as well as any stretch goals we decide to include at this level.\n$15 Level - Digital PDF + Print-on-Demand: In addition to receiving the full color and \"printer friendly\" PDFs through Drive Thru RPG, you will also be able to order the full color softcover or hardcover through DTRPG's \"print on demand\" service at the cost or printing and shipping, with no additional markup. You will also receive any stretch goals we decide to include at this level\n*NOTE*: At the $15 level you will still need to pay the printing and shipping costs to Drive Thru RPG but there will be no additional markup from us. We're still waiting for our proofs, but initial estimates put the printing cost at anywhere from $8 (softcover standard) to $16 (hardcover premium).\n$40 Level (limit 20, four separate sessions of 5) - Online Exclusive: In addition to everything included in the $15 level, you will also get to attend a private game hosted online (likely through Roll20) at a mutually agreed upon time, where I will guide you through Act I (or more, time and fun depending) of TCD: Chapter One.\n*NOTE*: Guidelines for character creation will be provided well in advance, or we can provide pregenerated characters if you are so inclined.\n$75 Level (limit 4) - Circle of the Five: In addition to everything included in the $15 level, you will also get to create your own NPC as one of the members of the \"Circle of the Five\". Your creation will make a small appearance in TCD, Chapter One (as a memorial statue inside the Tower of Light) but will play a more prominent role in TCD, Chapter Two and TCD, Chapter Three . You will also automatically receive digital versions of TCD, Chapter Two and TCD, Chapter Three once they are written and ready (after their respective Kickstarters launch and complete), assuming of course those projects go ahead as planned.\n$100 Level (limit 1) - Chosen One: The \"Circle of the Five\" has, surprisingly enough, five members. But one of the five members plays a pivotal role in TCD, Chapter Two and TCD, Chapter Three. In addition to everything included in the $15 level, we will allow you to create said NPC, including all aspects of their persona (within reason, that is), as per the \"Circle of the Five\" tier above. You will also automatically receive digital versions of TCD, Chapter Two and TCD, Chapter Three once they are written and ready (after their respective Kickstarters launch and complete), assuming of course those projects go ahead as planned.\nThe #1 thing that stretch goals will allow us to do is create art, art and more art. We'd like to keep our artist(s) as busy as we could, and the more money we have available the more we can fill the product with cool stuff.\nAdditional goals are still pending, but if we get that far along we'll think of something. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves just yet.\nDon't worry... we'll think of something soon.\nDavid Flor has been a software developer and game designer for over twenty-five years.

Quite frankly, we would rather not deal with shipping a physical product - which is one of the more common cause for Kickstarters ending up in the red - ourselves and would much rather have the folks over at Drive Thru RPG/OneBookShelf deal with the printing and shipping of our product. They seem to know how to handle that part of the business.\n\nLike we stated above, the product is written (currently stands at 85 pages, without any interstitial art) but it needs some serious review by a professional editor.

Players choose from a number of core character classes and explore dangerous locations full of monsters, treasures, and deadly boss fights.\nDesigned specifically for the Dark Souls\u2122 universe and introducing a number of innovative gameplay mechanics, with world-class miniatures faithful to the rich universe, this game delivers an experience that captures the very essence of the original video games.\nClick here for Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game 101\nWe don\u2019t like complicated Kickstarters, so we\u2019ve made this one as simple as possible. There is just one pledge level for gamers, and one pledge for retail stores.\nAs the campaign progresses, some stretch goals will unlock an \u2018Add-On\u2019 which is an optional item to purchase; to buy one of these, simply increase your pledge amount. This also drives the campaign total up thereby unlocking even more stuff!\nThe best bit is that every 'non Add-On' stretch goal that gets unlocked during the campaign will be included in your pledge! So the more people that support the project, the more goals get unlocked, the more value we can squeeze in, and the bigger the box we're going to need!\nRead the FAQ Here\nClick here to read the first AMA with Mat Hart, one of the Game's Designers.\nClick here to read the second AMA with Mat Hart.\nClick here to read the third AMA with Mat Hart.\nClick here to read the Reddit AMA with Mat & Rich\nClick here to read the fourth AMA with Richard Loxam\nDark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game is much more than a classic dungeon crawler. Just like the Dark Souls\u2122 video games, this is a game that requires strategic thinking, clever planning, and exemplary execution to succeed.\nDragon Slayer Ornstein & Executioner Smough\nTo triumph, players must explore dangerous locations, discover and defeat enemies, and collect equipment and treasures before ultimately facing the boss in an epic fight to the death.\nThe Player Characters - Knight, Warrior, Herald & Assassin\nPlayable in either Solo or Co-op modes, players choose their role from a number of core Dark Souls\u2122 character classes. Each class has a distinct role to play in the game, with a unique set of strengths and abilities.\nWith multiple difficulty modes and a high-level of replayability, this is a game designed to be deep enough to satisfy hard-core tabletop gamers whilst remaining accessible to newer players.\nDark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game features an exciting \"fast setup, long reveal\" mechanic that gets you into the game faster and builds the location and encounters as you explore.\nWith no fixed scenario layouts, it\u2019s as simple as choosing the direction to explore, placing a new tile down and flipping a card from the Encounter deck.\nEach time you decide where to go, you will experience a new danger as you explore, with each new location a real risk to your hard-won progress. If you die, then you drop everything you have collected and reappear at the nearest bonfire. So do you return to the bonfire to rest and spend Souls to strengthen up, but in doing so fully reset the locations? Or do you press on and pray that the next encounter isn\u2019t beyond your capabilities? After all, the next location may contain a clue to the Boss and how to defeat them\u2026\nCombat is both fast and deadly. Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game rewards clever players and punishes \u2018button mashing\u2019. Players must learn enemy behaviors in order to fight more effectively, with classic fighting game style combat windows. \nThe Titanite Demon mini-boss\nThe game features a \u201cdynamic positioning system\u201d which makes combat fluid and ever-changing. With the game state constantly shifting as combatants move around the battlefield, players must stay alert to danger and opportunities. \nEquipment, armour, and weapons are discovered or earned during play, but with limited slots players must think carefully about what is best to keep and use. Using a simple stamina management system, players can potentially leave themselves exhausted and vulnerable. Death is usually swift to follow a poor decision in combat.\nThe Dancer of the Boreal Valley boss accompanied by a group of Hollow\nUsing our advanced miniatures development pipeline and working with one of the finest board game manufacturers in the world, the quality and detail in the miniatures is world-class.

With our previous project - Guild Ball, we committed that after the project had launched all further products within the range would be direct to retail. We kept that promise. With Dark Souls\u2122 - we go one step further and are building support directly into the Kickstarter itself.\nThe Retailer Pledge level contains 6 copies Dark Souls\u2122 - The Board Game along with a number of other benefits:\nRetailer Bonus Unlocks - We have built into the Kickstarter several additional retailer bonus unlocks that once unlocked (via the number of retail backers in the campaign) will provide 'Add-On' purchases available only at retail and not purchasable during the Kickstarter by backers. These will not be limited runs but a general release available to all customers upon launch of the game in shops.\nCurrent Bonus Unlock Items\nExclusive Timed Access - You will be the first stores to receive the Core Game and the only stores to have 4 weeks early access to the launch day products and retailer exclusive stretch goal products upon release.\nExclusive Point of Sale Items - Along with your retail stock, we will send exclusive point of sale items as a thank you for supporting us from the start.\nTo help retailers guarantee their initial stock, you may purchase additional Retailer Pledges by increasing the pledge amount.\nWe will be supporting localisation options for the game and have confirmed the following languages currently: \nEnglish\nFrench\nSpanish\nGerman\nItalian\nWe are also considering other localisation options depending on demand during and after the Kickstarter campaign ends.

The content in this Kickstarter will provide at least two full years of awesome Cypher System campaigns\u2014plus the tools and content to build your own incredible games\u2014all straight from the minds of the legendary Monte Cook Games creative team. We\u2019re brewing some awesome books, and if this campaign does well, we\u2019d add more cool stuff, like expanded rules and maybe even some fiction. \nWe're Monte Cook Games. Our team of eight dedicated gamers works hard to create tabletop roleplaying games that set new standards for creativity, production values, ease of play, and fun. Monte, Shanna, Bruce, and Dennis\u2014our core creative team\u2014have some awesome ideas for the Cypher System, and we want to bring them to your gaming table. Let us tell you a bit about them.\nThe Cypher System is the critically acclaimed, award-winning RPG ruleset that powers Numenera and The Strange. Character generation in the Cypher System is smooth and concept driven: Your character is literally defined by a sentence\u2014I\u2019m a [_____] [_____] who [_____s]. \nI'm a Driven Explorer who Hunts with Great Skill. \nI'm an Honorable Warrior who Stands Like a Bastion. \nI'm a Tongue-Tied Adept who Exists in Two Places at Once. \nYour stats, skills, abilities, and even your connections to the other characters are defined by those choices. Character creation is really easy, and puts concept first. At the GM\u2019s end of the table, the Cypher System is a dream to run. The game system frees you from onerous mechanical details and lets you focus on building awesome, imaginative campaigns, encounters, and stories. \n(Want to check it out? You can learn more here or download a free preview of it here.)  \nBut don\u2019t take our word for it. Here\u2019s what just a few of the reviews have said: \n\u201cThe basics of the Cypher System are as equally brilliant as they are simple.\u201d\n\u201cA real joy, taking the emergent gameplay of mechanically complex RPGs and blending them with the narrative flow of new-school games.\u201d \n\u201cThe Cypher System Rulebook is a master-class product that manages to become one of the most accessible generic rules I\u2019ve had a chance to see.\u201d \n\u201cMakes life really easy for the GM!\u201d \n\u201cEasy to learn, quick to play\u2026designed and custom tailored for\u2014anything you want to do!\u201d \nThe Cypher System Rulebook came out last summer, and now we want to take it to the next level. (Don\u2019t have the Cypher System Rulebook yet? It's available now, or you can get it through this Kickstarter campaign as an add-on or through the NEW TO THE CYPHER SYSTEM backer level.) We\u2019re creating a suite of support titles\u2014including three complete campaign settings\u2014that will give you at least two years\u2019 worth of awesome Cypher System gaming! \nHere\u2019s a little bit about why we\u2019re Kickstarting. If this isn\u2019t interesting to you, skip down to the next section and I\u2019ll talk a bit about what we want to make for you! \nA couple of years ago, after the amazingly successful launch of Numenera, we were working on The Strange, our next RPG. It was based on the same game engine\u2014the Cypher System. As Monte and Bruce worked on The Strange, they found that converting Numenera\u2019s rules to a new game\u2014even a game with an infinite number of micro-settings in almost every imaginable genre\u2014worked really well. Which got us thinking: Why not make those rules available for you to run your own campaigns, in any setting of your choice?\nThis was the genesis of the Cypher System Rulebook. At that time, though, we were still thinking this would be a minor release\u2014probably just a 160-page rulebook with little more than the existing core rules. But as Monte worked on the CSR, he kept finding more and more ways to make it better. The book\u2019s specs kept growing: A 224-page hardcover. A 320-pager. \nThe more Monte worked on it\u2014and the more we ran our own Cypher System adventures and campaigns\u2014the more we realized how awesome this book could be. By this time last year we\u2019d grown it into a full-sized, 416-page hardcover corebook. \nFor well over a year now, we\u2019ve been running our own Cypher System games. Horror. Superheroes. Space opera and hard science-fiction. Even dungeon crawls. And some of us have started building and running more unique standalone settings. Just as it took us a few months and some hands-on work realizing the Cypher System deserved full-fledged corebook treatment, we\u2019ve also come to realize that the CSR deserves full-fledged game line support. \nIf we\u2019d been thinking this way from the beginning, we would have Kickstarted the CSR. Why? \nA Kickstarter campaign lets us do things we can\u2019t do for a product\u2014or a line\u2014that goes to market in the conventional manner. We can reach for stretch goals that improve the product. We can add new titles. We learn from your feedback about what you like most in the product, and can tailor it accordingly. And we can take risks on things we think are really cool\u2014but that we couldn\u2019t gamble on in the old-fashioned publishing methods. Because we sort of evolved our way into it, we didn\u2019t do that for the Cypher System Rulebook. \nBut there\u2019s no time like the present!\nWe want to help you run great Cypher System campaigns. The place to start is, of course, the Cypher System Rulebook if you don't already have that. But we also want to give you new tools for making those games awesome and taking them into even more realms of play. We want to bring our vision for some cool settings to life, to fire your imagination for roleplaying games that go beyond what you\u2019ve seen before. We have a ton of ideas, and if this campaign goes like some of our previous campaigns, we think we\u2019ll be able to offer even more than our starting point. \nThe old gods are dead. Burning and crumbling, the divine realm dropped from the sky and smashed into the world like a vengeful star. The earth was plunged into darkness. Hope shriveled. Life has become cheap, brutal, and short. But from the ashes of this catastrophe, you can awaken your own divine spark. Claim a dominion; declare yourself the god of War, of the Hunt, of Winter, of Fire, or of the realm of your choice. And if you can complete your divine labors, fulfill prophecy, and throw down the despots that rose in place of the fallen gods, you might redeem a world fallen into evil. You might truly become\u2014a god! \nThis 192-page hardcover is epic fantasy of the highest order, but with the creative twists you expect from Monte Cook Games. Gods of the Fall is already written and in editing, and will ship in June. It does not rely on the success of this Kickstarter to be released\u2014although we do hope this campaign will allow some cool upgrades to the book through stretch goals. \nAn asteroid will soon wipe out all life on earth. You know this\u2014and you know when\u2014because it\u2019s in the history books your grandparents brought back to the Cretaceous period with them. Now your small society is trapped in prehistory, desperate to find a way back to your time. But at least you're not alone. You have tech, weapons, vehicles, and science from the future\u2014you even have the ability to bioengineer the dinosaurs around you. Can you use these tools to survive a dangerous world on the brink of extinction? \nIs that the sound of thunder you hear? \nPredation will be a 192-page hardcover. Like the other campaign settings funded by this campaign, it\u2019ll have setting info, new character options, creatures, cyphers, and everything you need to run a complete campaign.\nWhen they locked you up, you made the mask. When you wear it, you can do the impossible. Just like the comic books.\nBut the mask has always done more: It shows a world beyond the everyday grey skein of cities and people. Something golden and perfect. But the longer you wear it, the more your old self slips away. It's like drowning. But the power calls to you.\nThere are others like you, good, bad and indifferent. All searching for what they call Magonia\u2014the place from their ruined childhoods, where they once escaped from this broken down world. And they all know, as you know, that something terrible is coming.\nUnmasked is 192 pages of super-powered psychological horror. Like the other campaign settings funded by this campaign, it\u2019ll have setting info, new character options, creatures, cyphers, and everything you need to run a complete campaign.\nThe Asset Deck adds a whole new dimension to Cypher System gameplay. Assets are things that help you in completing tasks. They represent the circumstances being in your favor, the perfect tool for the job, and so on. Each card in this 100-card deck has the details of one such asset that a GM can award to a player and that the player can in turn choose to play at any time. Maybe a PC needs to talk her way out of being arrested by the police, and so the player plays the \"Perfect One-Liner\" card, suggesting that the character recalls that perfect joke at the perfect time, thus making the task easier. Or maybe a PC needs to pilot a starship through an asteroid field. The player plays the \"It's Like I've Been Here Before\" card, suggesting that he's either flown through it before, or seen a map or diagram in the past. These cards don't guarantee success, but they put some ability in the players' hands to control their fate.\nAnd More? \nWhat if we hit some stretch goals? In our previous campaigns, stretch goals have allowed us to add additional titles to the lineup, and we\u2019re hoping to do the same thing in this campaign. Among many other ideas, we\u2019d like to expand upon the content in the Cypher System Rulebook, add some support for The Strange\u2014and maybe even build upon the fiction line we launched in the Into the Ninth World Kickstarter campaign.\nMost of the backer levels to the right contain one or both of these packages.\nAll the Ebooks: You receive all the books funded by this campaign in PDF format, along with a PDF version of the Asset Deck. If we unlock new books as stretch goals, those PDFs are added to your rewards automagically!\nAll the Print Books: You receive all the print books funded by this campaign, as well as the Asset Deck in print. If we unlock new print books as stretch goals, you get them as part of your reward. Please see the shipping information, below. (International backers: Please be aware that international shipping is expensive. We subsidize a portion of your shipping, and you can bundle your rewards to save even more. But be sure to read the shipping section, below.)\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. Check out our pledge calculator; it\u2019ll help you figure out exactly how much to pledge based on the backer level and add-ons you desire.\nYou can find more details about all of our add-ons at the pledge calculator.\nAfter the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-ons items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nWe offer a variety of backer levels with some great rewards. The reward level details on the right can\u2019t be edited once a campaign is underway, but we can make changes to the words you\u2019re reading now\u2014so the notes below are up to date, including upgrades or additions we may make to the backer levels as the campaign progresses.\nULTIMATE CYPHER GM: Run your game with efficiency and style!

Details on shipping are below.\nPLAYTEST AND EARLY ACCESS: Gods of the Fall's playtesting is complete, but Predation and Unmasked will each have a playtest phase. As a backer at this level (and most of the higher levels), you can join the ranks of the official playtesters! You'll get all the playtest materials when the official playtest starts, and your playtest comments and observations are welcome (but not required, if you'd rather just enjoy the early access).

The topic will be the design of the Cypher System, with a peek behind the scenes at the hows and whys of the game. Monte will also talk about designing your own Cypher System material, for your home game or for publication.

You'll have to work within the guidelines provided by the designers for your contribution. The quality of our products is our first priority, so while we'll adhere as closely as we can to your contribution, our designers reserve the right to ask you to modify your suggestion, or to make changes themselves.

There are three backer levels that will be of interest to you. Bruce will host a game session of Gods of the Fall, Shanna will run a playtest of Predation, and Dennis will offer a playtest of Unmasked, all at Gen Con 2016. These three are not only great GMs, but in the Predation and Unmasked games, you'll be able to provide feedback that will shape the finished product. Gods of the Fall will be out by Gen Con, but the other titles will still be in development, so these will be actual playtest games. NEW: This level now also includes GM Gear (see the add-on of that name to see what you get)!\nYou also get the All the Ebooks package and All the Print Books package, a custom autographed bookplate with a designer message for each book, playtest access/acknowledgement, and an invitation to the design seminar.

(Bruce will be done with design on Gods of the Fall before this campaign ends, but he'll communicate about his Gods campaign and other ongoing design projects.) You'll get a personal Skype call with your designer. And when the development of the title is complete, you'll get a bunch of physical items from the process: Things like the author's design notebook, sketches of maps or images sent to our illustrators, actual character sheets used by our team during playtest, and physical props and handouts actually used in the designer's personal campaign. And perhaps a few additional items you can use in your game, hand-picked by the designer. We can't tell you exactly what you'll get\u2014we won't know until design is complete, and it will vary by designer\u2014but you can count on it being cool and utterly unique. And we'll send it all to you in a special keepsake box suitable for storing your own campaign materials as well.

We have a great track record of producing premium-quality products and have delivered scores of different rewards on or before deadline for multiple Kickstarted projects.\n\nBut every publishing project carries risks. We have a small staff, so if one of us gets lost hiking the wilds of the Pacific Northwest, it would have a bigger impact on our work than a larger company might see. And we rely on outside suppliers and shippers for printing and manufacturing, which involves possible risks there we can\u2019t foresee or control. But we deal with those concerns all the time, and continue to put out high-quality work on schedule.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s always the danger of meteor strikes, catastrophic solar flares, or the zombie apocalypse.

We are Artists working with different mediums, exploring our shared creative vision - Mujuworld.\nMiss Muju sculpting the Star Traveller\nWe have been making and exhibiting sculptures, paintings & prints for over 10 years.  You can see more of our work on our website here : www.mujuworld.co.uk\nOur latest project...\nThere are 10 billion galaxies in the observable universe.  \nEach time we look up into the stars the same question arises...  \nAre there other beings out there?\nThe possibilities of intergalactic travel and the concept of multidimensional reality inspire our creative vision.  It is this fascination that led us on the journey to create the Star Traveller.  \nIt began life as a drawing in a sketchbook, and from there we developed the concept and sculpted it into it's final 3D form. We then created a mould and cast the sculpture in bio-resin in our studio. The prototype sculptures were then handpainted and varnished.\nWith your support we hope to release the Muju Star Traveller to a worldwide audience.\nWhy we need your help...\nThe pre-production costs involved in releasing a new sculpture are high.\nWe choose to cast our sculptures in bio-resin, which is a non-toxic and more sustainable material than traditional resin.  However it's significantly more expensive than polyurethane resin.\nBio-resin is also a harder material to work with than standard resin, and takes much longer to set.  With some investment we will be able to make multiple silicone moulds to enable us to increase our production rate.\n\nIn order to produce perfect casts we will need to invest in a vacuum de-gassing chamber for the bio-resin, and we hope funds from this project will help us to buy this essential bit of casting equipment.\nProject Cost breakdown:\nBulk buying bio-resin to cover production run = \u00a3450\nSilicone for multiple sculpture moulds = \u00a3100\nVacuum de-gassing chamber = \u00a3350\nKickstarter fees and bank charges (8-10% of pledges) = \u00a3100\nTotal needed = \u00a31000\nEach Star Traveller sculpture is totally handmade and hand-painted by ourselves, which also requires a big investment of our time.  Pre-order sales through this Kickstarter campaign will enable us to fund a production run of this handmade sculpture.\n*     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *    *     *\nREWARDS...\nGalaxy Star Traveller: \nGalaxy Star Traveller Sculpture\nThis reward is for the Galaxy edition of the Star Traveller sculpture.

Like using a building there, gaining instant influence, or doubling down for extra influence at the risk of not getting any.  \nYou will play a poker hand at EACH location you send a posse member to.\nWinning will get you the \"poker pot\" and any extra influence from a \"double down\" spot.

Players can now use their influence to acquire one building from a location where they have a posse member. Remember, hitting up the Sheriff's Office can get you an extra buy during this phase; that can be a real game changer!\nBuildings offer you victory points, access to their abilities, and industry influence. \nAt the end of each round, the player who had the best poker hand at the Town Hall advances one of three industries forward in their rank.\nAt the end of six rounds,or as many bullets as a revolver can hold, the game is over.

The games will be delivered right to your door.

We\u2019re Scrivened, a newly formed company comprised of up-and-coming RPG professionals. Our first project is Swans of Black, an 80+ page tome providing a number of Swans: scalable events for your story-crafting pleasure. Each Swan is a tool for the DM, containing storylines, encounters, NPCs, monsters, and more. It\u2019s also valuable tool for the player, as it features numerous character archetypes, feats, spells, equipment, and character portraits. These rules are designed to be compatible with the relatively new 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. In short, we want to make stories DMs want to run and players want to take ownership over. We want to provide awesome tools as well as inspire new ideas.\n\"So what's the deal with the name?\"  \nWe thought you might ask that! Way back when, the statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb came up with the idea of 'Black Swans,' events so far out of the norm that they can throw everything else into chaos. Empires fall, new empires emerge, and opportunities abound for intrepid individuals to claim the day. If you take this idea and apply it to fiction, you've got the most essential element of good storytelling. But most adventure modules only give you one of these, and you can rarely do anything interesting with it. We thought of a better path. Why not give players and dungeon masters a whole slew of these, with advice for how to connect them and change them to fit wherever they might want? That's the product we've put before you now.\nSwans are stories. They might be the main plot of your campaign or they may be in the background adding a bit of flavor to your game. They could be small problems, kingdom-scale events, or world busting incidents. They begin, change things, progress, and potentially end.\n\u201cHow is this different from the countless adventure modules already out there,\u201d we hear you asking. Great question!\nFirstly, the scalability we provide allows you to have a Swan start small and become a larger threat as the story progresses. Larger adventure paths often track you into the bigger narrative, forcing DMs to constantly draw players back into the fold. This is entirely counter to maybe the greatest strength of tabletop RPGs: fluidity. As players and DMs, we wanted to create a story format that allowed narrative flexibility, responsive to players\u2019 choices rather than designed to constrain them. The Swans are our answer to that problem.\nInstead of moving from plot point A (e.g. the kobolds attack the encampment!) to plot point B (e.g. the kobolds were paid by the Duke!) to the inevitable ending (e.g. the Duke was actually a lich!), we came up with a system where point A, B, and C are tied together conceptually. You can take any seed we provide and scale them to match not only your characters\u2019 level but also to fit organically in any stage of the plot. They\u2019re collections of ideas to explore rather than textbooks to follow.\n\u201cThat sounds amazing!\u201d you\u2019re thinking, \u201cbut what would that look like?\u201d Let\u2019s give you an example.\nOne of our Swans sees a moon moving out of its normal orbit. This causes the tides to shift in strange ways, drawing up forgotten creatures from the deep seas. If that didn\u2019t wreak enough havoc, creatures around the planet spontaneously develop psionic powers as the nature of magic changes. But the timeline is entirely up to the DM. This could happen globally, all at once, or it could be seen as odd portents manifesting in a small group of orcs. Let\u2019s go with the latter. Those orcs, suddenly made brilliant, begin to rally other barbaric races to their banner. This newfound nomadic nation becomes a vastly powerful kingdom, affecting political actions around the world. And that\u2019s only one combination!\nOur goal is to give you a toolbox that can be used, time and again, to create whatever stories your players will most enjoy. Other products hold your hand so tightly the circulation gets cut. On some level, we suspect they don\u2019t trust you. That\u2019s not our style. Trust is the only way forward. What we want is to show you the path back to where RPGs started, to show you what made them great in the first place. Creativity is the name of the game, our friends. It\u2019s hard to create the world you want to live in. We\u2019ll happily help you there.\n We\u2019re a new company called Scrivened, a coming together between author Ryan Chaddock and artist Avery Liell-Kok. Along with Ryan and Avery we\u2019ve assembled a team from a few of our talented friends.\nAvery Liell-Kok (Artistic Director). Avery is a professional illustrator with experience creating beautiful artwork for the roleplaying game industry. She\u2019s incredibly excited to take the lead on a project of this size and scope and hopes this will be just the beginning for Scrivened.\nRyan Chaddock (Lead Writer and Developer). Ryan is a jack-of-all-tradesman, holding a degree in applied economics and public policy with a background in software engineering, theatre, and retail customer service.

Joseph was born, raised, and currently lives in Manhattan, New York. In his short life he has spent much time introspectively, some creatively, and less productively.

Go to www.secrethitler.com for the most up-to-date information. There you can also read the full rules and download the game to print-and-play for yourself right now!\nSecret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it\u2019s too late.\nEach round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.\nSecret Hitler is designed by Max Temkin (Cards Against Humanity, Humans vs. Zombies) Mike Boxleiter (Solipskier, TouchTone), Tommy Maranges (Philosophy Bro) and illustrated by Mackenzie Schubert (Letter Tycoon, Penny Press).\nIn Secret Hitler, each player is randomly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists know in advance who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is. Since the liberal team always has a majority, the fascists must play like moles, gaining the trust of the liberals to sabotage their plans and make them suspicious of each other.\nThe objective of the liberal team is to pass 5 liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass 6 fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after 3 fascist policies have passed.\nEach round, the President selects a Chancellor. The whole table votes \"Ja!\" or \"Nein!\" on their ticket; if a majority of players vote \u201cJa!,\u201d the elected President and Chancellor take the following actions to pass a new policy:\nThe President draws 3 policies from a random deck.\nThe President discards 1 policy and passes 2 to the Chancellor.\nThe Chancellor discards 1 policy and enacts the final one as law.\nIf a fascist policy passes, the President gains a new power that she must use immediately. These include:\nIf Hitler is executed, the game ends immediately in a Liberal Victory.\nSecret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre.\nThe first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor\u2019s word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team.\nThe second new mechanic is the \u201cHitler\u201d identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players\u2019 trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately. This creates incredible moments of tension and relief in the game.\nSecret Hitler is a love letter to hidden identity games like Werewolf/Mafia, The Resistance, and Avalon, but it's also a new design that fixes some of our biggest problems with those games.\nNo moderator: Secret Hitler doesn't require a moderator - everyone can join in the game.\nNo early player elimination: We love the suspense of player elimination, but Secret Hitler saves that drama for the very end\u2014assassinated players will rarely have to wait more than ten minutes before the game ends.\nIn games like Werewolf, you can only act on your gut feeling. Secret Hitler creates a much more heady experience - there's almost enough information that you can solve the game like a puzzle, but not quite enough. Players always have enough information to make meaningful choices, but we've simplified the decisions to avoid analysis paralysis; each round the President nominates a Chancellor, and the table votes yes or no to that ticket.\nSecret Hitler is enormously replayable because the ways the presidential powers are used and the table position of the players is never the same twice. We've played hundreds of rounds of Secret Hitler, and the metagame is still evolving in very exciting ways.\nWhy is Secret Hitler set in 1933 Germany? We believe that the theme and setting of a game work best when they help explain the story and mechanics.\nHitler\u2019s takeover was, for a dictator, surprisingly political: he wasn\u2019t a general who subverted a popular revolution, he wasn\u2019t backed by foreign interests, there wasn\u2019t a total collapse of government he took advantage of. He used the rickety systems of the Weimar Republic to gain power mostly legally; he was handed the Chancellorship by men who thought they could \"control\" him.\nHitler and his allies spent years manipulating the levers of democracy, accumulating power in a snowball effect. He divided and intimidated his rivals. He used national crises to strengthen his own position. His followers were organized and brutal, and his rise was equally engineered and opportunistic. There were good men who didn't understand how dangerous he was until it was too late, and there were bad men who wanted power for themselves but were outmaneuvered.\nSocial Deduction games are about a well-coordinated minority trying to convince a confused majority to vote against its interests. It's an inherently political genre.\nWe set out to make a game to help us reflect on the ways that others - good, bad, indifferent - were complicit in Hitler's rise to power. Our game doesn't model the specifics of German parliamentary politics. Instead, we try to model the paranoia and distrust he exploited, the opportunism that his rivals failed to account for, and the disastrous temptation to solve systemic problems by giving more power to the \"right people.\"\nSecret Hitler has a unique capacity to create intense, memorable play sessions. Frankly, none of us had ever playtested a game that gets this kind of a reaction before.\nAt Gen Con in 2015, we were shocked to see demo sets of Secret Hitler sweep through an industry party full of game designers. By the end of the night, every single table was playing, with people jumping out of their seats to shout and and cheer at the end of each game.\nWe played Secret Hitler at San Diego Comic Con 2015 with Richard Stevens (creator of Diesel Sweeties) who monitored his heart rate on a Apple watch throughout the game. By the end, he was registering 121 BPM - that's on the high end of what an astronaut will experience during a shuttle launch.\nRichard Stevens' heart rate during a game of Secret Hitler\nHere's what some of our playtesters had to say about the game:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe'd been playtesting Secret Hitler for nearly a year when we launched this Kickstarter, and we're so excited to get it into your hands.\n\nOur team has a lot of experience manufacturing and shipping games.

Tin Man Games is bringing it closer towards its tabletop role-playing game roots, complete with a rich interactive 3D map, collectable digital miniatures, an updated combat system and the ability to explore Firetop Mountain with multiple characters. This is our first step towards our grand vision for the Fighting Fantasy universe and we want YOU to be part of it.\nThe game will be available first for PC, Mac, and Linux on Steam and DRM-Free. It will also be coming to smart phones and tablets late 2016.\nhttp://fightingfantasyapps.com/paypal-backers/\nWhy do we want to digitally re-imagine The Warlock of Firetop Mountain? We love the original book-style adventures and with our pedigree of developing over 30 digital gamebook apps, we know just how much further we can take it in the digital space.\nWhile we have funded and developed the technology for The Warlock of Firetop Mountain ourselves, we need more art to flesh out the new environments and characters. Moving from purely text based adventures to this new visual style has significantly increased the artwork required and associated costs.\nWe are also developing additional content to expand the stories surrounding the legend of Firetop Mountain. You are no longer simply \u201cThe Hero\u201d, but many potential heroes or even the inhabitants of Firetop Mountain themselves. Take a miniature into the dungeons and catacombs, each with their own motivations. This allows for many different adventures that will access hidden locations and give you new ways to interact with characters and creatures you meet.\nWith this being our most ambitious adventure yet, we want to give YOU the opportunity to be involved! If you're into fantasy role-playing games and worlds then come and join us us for an epic journey into a rich and detailed landscape over thirty years in the making.\nRUSS NICHOLSON ARTWORK\nSix (6) new artworks from Russ Nicholson, the original illustrator of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain.\nADVENTURER'S PACK\nThree (3) new adventurers available. Vignor Firestorm, Haldar Eriksson, Ophelia Lapwing will be added to the \u2018Orc Guard\u2019 tier and above ($50 AUD /  $36 USD / \u00a323 GBP / \u20ac32 EUR).\nCLASSIC STYLE GAMEBOOK\nThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain digitised in our original engine. For this stretch goal, we will be making a black and white version, featuring our traditional dice combat (don\u2019t worry, the current game will have an option for dice combat too!). This will be available to the \u2018Rock Grub\u2019 tier and above ($20 AUD / $14 USD / \u00a39 GBP/ \u20ac13 EUR).\nCOLOURIZED ARTWORK\nRuss Nicholson's art will be colourized!\nBATTLEBARDS MUSIC & SFX\nWe're going to be working closely with the crew at Battlebards, creators of downloadable fantasy audio and tools for tabletop RPGs, to help bring Firetop Mountain to life. Reaching this stretch goal means we have even more options to add individual music tracks and sound effects to the various locations within Zagor\u2019s stronghold.\nENGLISH VOICEOVER\nEnglish narrative recording of all the story text within The Warlock of Firetop Mountain. We\u2019ll be working with Jacek Tuschewski, audio director and sound designer on League of Geeks\u2019 recent hit Armello!\nFIGS LOCALIZATION\nAll the stories within The Warlock of Firetop Mountain will be translated into French, Italian, German and Spanish.\nIn 1982, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, co-founders of Games Workshop and the first distributors for Dungeons and Dragons in Europe, wrote the first Fighting Fantasy gamebook - The Warlock of Firetop Mountain. In a time when videogaming and the RPG industry were in their infancy, the adventure gamebook allowed wannabe adventurers to journey to other worlds, engage with evil forces and decide the fate of themselves and the quest they were set upon.\nWith the success of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain came a whole series of Fighting Fantasy adventures, over 50 of them with supporting novels and tabletop role-playing systems. Tin Man Games has already developed and released 8 of the original books as digital gamebook apps.\nThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain is nearing the end of pre-production. This means that the story, tech, and design have been finished and we have a detailed plan for the rest of development. We need to implement the remainder of the artistic elements for the game itself, prepare sound and music, and finish design of the user interface. Should the Kickstarter exceed our initial goal, we will be looking to localise to several languages.\nWe've signed a deal with Otherworld Miniatures in the UK to use their range of pewter figurines in The Warlock of Firetop Mountain. \nTo replicate the handmade look and feel, we first 3D scan the figurines into the computer and then digitally paint them to replicate a similar style to physical miniature painting.\nFor the more unique denizens of Firetop Mountain, such as Zagor above, or for hero characters or creatures that do not have pewter figurines, we will be modelling and texturing these from scratch.\nDeep in the caverns beneath Firetop Mountain lies an untold wealth of treasure, guarded by a powerful Warlock \u2013 or so the rumour goes. Several adventurers like yourself have set off for Firetop Mountain in search of the Warlock\u2019s hoard. None has ever returned. Do you dare follow them?\n Wait... that's just one adventure. How about we try something different?\nFurious at the cowardice of your Orcish lackeys, you, the Orc Chieftain, decide to take matters into your own hands. You will single-handedly infiltrate Firetop Mountain and drive out those foolish dwarves. And you will do it for the glory of almighty Zagor!\nOr how about this?\nDeep in the caverns beneath Firetop Mountain, your dwarvern ancestors once made their home. However, they were drawn out by an army of evil Orcs, who have since taken over the mountain for themselves. Will you venture into Firetop Mountain and reclaim your ancestral home?\n\nIt looks like there are more stories to be told within Firetop Mountain than first thought...\n\nCombat has always played a big part in the Fighting Fantasy series. We have developed a new combat system, known internally as GridBluff, where both you and your opponent move or attack simultaneously. Enemies use different attack patterns and you must anticipate their moves whilst positioning yourself for the fatal blow.\nFor old-school Fighting Fantasy fans, we will also be including the option to use the standard dice rolling mechanics as found in the original books.\nThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain was the entry point to the Fighting Fantasy series and introduced readers to the world of Titan, in particular the notorious land of Allansia. We have a grand vision and want our version to do the same for a new digital generation of adventurer.\n\nFollowing the release of Warlock, we plan on expanding our reach in Allansia and will be adapting a number of classic Fighting Fantasy titles such as Deathtrap Dungeon, the trap-filled and monster-infested labyrinth of Fang where many heroes compete in the Trial of Champions, followed by Citadel of Chaos and City of Thieves.\nWe also want give players the opportunity to take digital miniatures from one story into another and further expand those locations. What would happen if Throm the Barbarian from Deathtrap Dungeon turned up in Firetop Mountain or Bigleg the Dwarf from The Forest of Doom decided to enter the Trial of Champions?\nTin Man Games was founded in 2008 and released their first title, Gamebook Adventures 1: An Assassin in Orlandes, in March 2010.\nA strong release schedule followed and in 2012, Tin Man announced they were working with Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson to produce titles from the Fighting Fantasy series. Eight FF adaptations have since been developed using the original Gamebook Adventures Engine, including The Forest of Doom, House of Hell, Starship Traveller and Caverns of the Snow Witch.\nTo date, Tin Man Games has released over 30 digital gamebooks across Steam, Humble, the App Store, Google Play and the Amazon Appstore. These also include licensed titles based on Judge Dredd, Ryan North's To Be or Not To Be, Gary Chalk's Gun Dogs, Zach Weinersmith's Trial of the Clone and Matt Youngmark's Choose-o-matic series.\nFrom left: KG Tan, Oscar Francis, Clinton Shepherd, Kamina Vincent, Ben Kosmina, Neil Rennison, Ed Blanch (not pictured: Emma Rennison)\nFighting Fantasy is a trademark owned by Steve Jackson & Ian Livingstone \u00a9 1982, 2002, 2010, 2015.

The remnants of these civilizations shaped the Ninth World into a place of incredible beauty, wonder, and danger. And weirdness. Oh, so much weirdness. Explorers who undertake the challenges presented by the Ninth World look not only to the wilderness, but also to the night sky, the ocean depths, and even into the worlds beyond that they cannot easily perceive.\nThis Kickstarter campaign takes us into these realms through several new titles that expand the Ninth World beyond Earth's shores. We're launching this campaign to fund Into the Night, Into the Deep, and Into the Outside, each an all-new 160-page hardcover supplement, along with the 100-card Numenera Artifact Deck. But with your help, we'll take these books even further, and maybe add some new titles as well!\nEarly this year we started an in-depth exploration of the Ninth World, the setting of the Numenera roleplaying game, with the Ninth World Guidebook. Numenera fans were excited to see the world expanded, as that in turn expanded the options for their own campaigns. We knew we wanted to keep going, and that the Ninth World had many more fascinating lands and cultures to explore. But those conventional (sort of) lands are just one aspect of the Ninth World. There were other sorts of realms, inspiring and unique, many of which had been introduced in our previous products but never really explored in depth.\nThe obvious first direction was up! The eight previous worlds had all, to one extent or another, reached beyond the embrace of Earth\u2019s gravity. Remnants of those civilizations linger in the Ninth World\u2019s datasphere, and were touched on in adventures such as Vortex and discussion of the moon in the Ninth World Guidebook. This is an aspect of the Ninth World we\u2019ve wanted to develop since\u2014well, since Numenera came into being!\nSo we started work on Into the Night, a sourcebook that allows characters to explore the moon, Mars, and much, much farther beyond that. Here and there over the past year, we've let slip hints that this was the next big book for Numenera.\nBut then we got thinking\u2014what if we kept going? After all, the sea\u2014particularly under the sea\u2014is as uncharted, as exciting, and as alien a place as another planet. We began talking about multiple \"Into the Ninth World\" themed books, with the next one being called Into the Deep. And beyond that, an exploration of the other dimensions unlocked by the previous worlds: Into the Outside.\nAfter that... well, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We decided the smart thing to do would be to see if these topics interest you as much as they interest us. In this campaign, you can get any of these books\u2014or all of them. And if things go well, we have lots of other ideas in mind for exploring the Ninth World. Furthermore, hitting stretch goals can allow us to make these books something really fantastic, as well as possibly add more to the Numenera story. New corners of the Ninth World to explore? New character options unlocked by these exciting environments? New creatures encountered there? New stories? It all depends on you!\nInto the Night is already written. It\u2019s in editing, and will go to press before this campaign ends. That said, there\u2019s still time to make it even better\u2014to add elements we wouldn\u2019t normally be able to risk through the normal publication process. In fact, our first stretch goal will add a Kickstarter-exclusive poster map to that book. We have some great ideas for that and for what follows, and we\u2019d like you to be a part of it. So here\u2019s what this Kickstarter is all about:\nWe\u2019re going to further broaden the horizons of the Ninth World, first with Into the Deep and Into the Outside and then with\u2014well, some other pretty cool titles that we\u2019ll unveil as this campaign progresses.\nWe\u2019re going to make Into the Night, Into the Deep, and other titles funded by this campaign as cool as we can, offering elements we normally wouldn\u2019t be able to put into a book developed in the conventional manner.\nWe\u2019re going to give you a voice and a chance to interact with the content of these books. To have a hands-on role in shaping them.\nInto the Night: This 160-page hardcover takes Numenera players and GMs beyond the grip of Earth's gravity, to locations pioneered by the previous worlds on the moon, elsewhere in the solar system, and in remote reaches of the galaxy. Into the Night releases in late September. It's already written and in editing, and it does not rely on the success of this Kickstarter to be released\u2014although we do hope this campaign will allow some cool upgrades to the book through stretch goals.\nInto the Deep: Delve into the depths of the Ninth World's oceans in this 160-page hardcover book. The prior worlds extended their empires into the seas\u2014as previously touched on in the Numenera corebook and The Devil's Spine\u2014and the wonders to be found there are every bit as glorious, mysterious, exciting, and just plain weird as the landbound realms of the Ninth World. Into the Deep will release in the spring of 2016.\nInto the Outside: It's well known that the denizens of the prior worlds bent time and space to their liking, creating links to realms outside the normal world. This 160-page hardcover book takes us into these other worlds, exploring pocket dimensions, the realms of ultraterrestrials, and parallel universes. Into the Outside will ship in the autumn of 2016.\nNumenera Artifact Deck: Experienced Numenera GMs agree that our decks (such as the Creature Deck and Cypher Deck) are great for inspiration, and huge time-savers in game prep and during play. We're going to add an Artifact Deck full of all-new content to help you generate artifacts quickly and easily while getting ready for your game, or when you need one at the gaming table.\nAll the Ebooks: You receive all the books funded by this campaign in PDF format, along with a PDF version of the Artifact Deck. If we unlock new books as stretch goals, those are added to your rewards automagically!\nAll the Print Books: You receive all the print books funded by this campaign, as well as the Artifact Deck in print. If we unlock new print books as stretch goals, you get them as part of your reward. Please see the shipping information, below.\n                Add-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. Check out our pledge calculator; it\u2019ll help you figure out exactly how much to pledge based on the backer level and add-ons you desire. Find more details on these add-ons at our pledge calculator. \nAfter the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-ons items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nWe offer a variety of backer levels with some great rewards. The reward level details on the right can\u2019t be edited once a campaign is underway, but we can make changes to the words you\u2019re reading now\u2014so the notes below are up to date, including upgrades or additions we may make to the backer levels as the campaign progresses.\nINTO THE PLAYTEST: Into the Night's playtesting is complete, but Into the Deep and Into the Outside will each have a playtest phase. As a backer at this level (and most of the higher levels), you can join the ranks of the official playtesters! You'll get all the playtest materials when the official playtest starts, and your playtest comments and observations are welcome (but not required, if you'd rather just enjoy the early access).\nYou also get the benefits of the lower levels, including the All the Ebooks package and All the Print Books package, and a custom autographed bookplate for each book. Details on shipping are below.\nNINTH WORLD PARTIER: We're holding a Ninth World party, and we hope you'll be there! The party will be held at the AFK Tavern in Renton, Washington, during the month of October. The MCG creative team will be there, along with backers at this level and above. You are responsible for travel to the party, so if you aren't in the Seattle area you'll have to get yourself there.\nYou also get the benefits of the lower levels, including the All the Ebooks package and All the Print Books package, a custom autographed bookplate for each book, and playtest access. Details on shipping are below.\nARTIFACT PATRON: We want your contribution to the artifacts of the Ninth World (and beyond)! If you back at this level, you may contribute an artifact concept, which Monte and the creative team will adapt for the Artifact Deck. (Select items may also appear in one of the books, but there's no guarantee that'll be the case.)

A scientist examining a strange artifact found on a distant planet that, unbeknownst to him, opens a mysterious gate to a nightmarish dimension when a button is pushed.\nThese are just a sampling of the myriad images which come to mind when we think of Hell. Codex Infernus: The Savage Guide to Hell, brings those images to life and shows you how to plug them into your games, regardless of what genre you love to play!\nThe goal of Codex Infernus: The Savage Guide to Hell is not to produce a \u201cOne Size Fits All\u201d book on Hell which pigeonholes you into a certain style of play. Concepts of Hell, Demons, Devils, etc. mean many things to many different people. While this book includes a built-in, ready to use Infernal Realm, it also gives you everything you need to design a Hellish dimension that caters to your specific group, because the concepts  and rules we introduce in this book transcend genre, encouraging you to explore new possibilities for your Savage Worlds game.\nWant to play a game set in a distant future, where fringe science has ripped a hole in the fabric of reality, unleashing the hordes of Hell on earth?\nHow about a gritty, \"Constantine-esque\" type of setting where demons and angels fight a shadow war, with humanity caught in the middle?\nMaybe an Over-the-top 70\u2019s style super hero action game in the vein of the Nocturnals, Hellboy, Ghost Rider, Spawn, or Clive Barker\u2019s Harrowers is more your style?\nPerhaps you\u2019re looking to run a fantasy game in the vein of Robert Jordan\u2019s Wheel of Time epic, or the Diablo III and World of Warcraft franchises, where your heroes must confront the forces of darkness to save the world?\nWe\u2019ve got you covered.\nWith this book, you can easily create your own unique, sinister realm, and memorable villains that compliment those types of games.\nSo, what\u2019s in this 128 page full color  Graphic Novel-size book?\nIn a word: Potential.\nPotential to create character concepts ranging from anti-heroes, champions of the light, tragic heroes cursed their own choices, and everything in between.\nPotential to design new creatures, demon cults, and entire Hellscapes using advice from the best writers in the genre, specialized setting rules, and genre trappings!

In total, there are 30 adventures from some of the best writers and game designers in the industry!\nAdventure Pack 1: John Dunn: \"Prisoner of Time\" Teams of heroes confront the immortal demon Maltheus in different eras. Each attempts to recapture it and contain its militant and destructive tendencies.\nAdventure Pack 2: Gareth Michael Skarka: \"The Spectacular Supernaturals!\" Gareth delivers some old-school comic action, writing five 70s-horror-hero-inspired Infernal superhero adventures in the vein of Marvel's GHOST RIDER, SON OF SATAN, and WEREWOLF BY NIGHT, and DC's DEADMAN and SWAMP THING!\nAdventure Pack 3: Sean Patrick Fannon: \"The Final Trumpet Pact\" It began in Sarajevo in 1914, and it continues a century later in Sevastopol - a desperate cat-and-mouse game and running battle between those who've worn the pins of the Silver Blade and those who seek to hear the sound of the Final Trumpet. A secret order works behind the scenes of terrible strife and crisis, trying to stop demons and their cultists from sounding the call for Armageddon.

Since the other angels won't act without God's Word and Hell can't act directly on the mortal world, the Lords call on those touched by Hell's power; the Infernals. These dark heroes must protect humanity...or there will be Hell to pay.\nShane Hensley: The creator of Savage Worlds himself brings you \"Shrouded Turin\" Some say the famous Piazza Statuto depicts an angel watching over the souls of fallen workers of the Frejus Tunnel--crushed to death in the dark bowels of the earth. Others say the figure atop this strange and macabre statue is no angel. They point to the inverted star above its head, the \"blessing\" cast with its left hand, and the horrible, pallid, crushed figures beneath as proof of a much more Hellish origin. Are the sewers below truly a doorway to Hell itself? What foul things may even now be slinking forth from the depraved depths to cast the city--perhaps even the world--in darkness?\nJohn Wick: \"Hell Hunters\" The players take the roles of angels hunting down demons who have escaped the Pit. Their jobs are simple: get the demon, throw it back down. At least, the job sounds simple.\nJohn Goff: \"Good Intentions\" The heroes respond to an urgent request to rescue a local noble and his household who are under attack by a band of brigands. Upon arrival, they find the raiders appear to have far darker goals than mere robbery or ransom, as the noble's residence sits atop an old Templar stronghold--one which legend claims guarded a gate to Hell itself.\nAdventure Pack 7: \u201cDead Planet\u201d David Jarvis takes you to a distant future and crash lands you on a planet that isn\u2019t supposed to exist; Nibiru.

In the last few months several banks have been approached, but in the current climate they are not keen to lend to a restaurant which bizarrely they view as a \"new business\".\n(That was the first of many excellent videos courtesy of @JJ_Campbell our Burrito Bandit, starring the Jackaholics at one of our infamous parties!)\nWhile we were open we won a bunch of awards such as The Observer Cheap Eat Award for Scotland as well as UK Runner-up, and the UK Social Buzz Chairman's Award. More importantly though, we had a hardcore army of supporters: the self-styled \"Jackaholics\" and it is to them and the wider world I am now turning. Have found a great unit on St Patrick Square near Edinburgh University, and having secured a new head lease for the premises the project is underway. Professional designers Cubit 3D have been commissioned to give the place a warmer cosier feel than the old restaurant, and to adapt the business to the challenge of operating in a smaller space. Quite major renovation will be needed from the existing set-up, and a good deal of refridgeration required as well as a new kitchen in order to replicate the standard and speed of service of food we had before. And so am launching this Kickstarter to help get Scotland's original burrito place back open and create 14 new jobs. In return my commitment is to be as generous as I can with food and cool stuff in order to say thank you to our supporters. \nTacos!\nCombo Fajitas!\nAnd finally a massive thanks to Ian for his time and self-deprecation, and to Dr Phil for writing the script, as well as Ben Glasgow for shooting the video.

There are many small details and things I've learned from Lothian Road which have wanted to incorporate. Crucial to this is the use of space: moving from a large unit with huge amounts of storage, to a smaller one with very limited storage has been a substantial challenge. Working closely with Cubit 3D in Musselburgh and shopfitter Kraftworks here in Edinburgh, am confident this has now been overcome. Following on from that has been the kitchen redesign: the existing kitchen isn't fit for purpose in the slightest and local firm James Scott and Sons have done a great job producing a plan and remodelling the space to meet both the cooking requirements as well as the health & safety ones. So am most relieved to finish the week and say am happy with both the works quotes for the kitchen and main refit, it has simply taken a few weeks to get the detail (and price) right."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "The grand re-opening!", "update_content": "Evenin' all!\nWas wanting to wait until I had met the design guys at Cubit 3D in Musselburgh before posting an update, and met them yesterday and also this afternoon so here goes.

I couldn't see the problem but fortunately she put me right and the change to the layout makes a lot of sense.

It comes with a SIM card and an affordable data plan for low-bandwidth things. Plus it's available for more than 100 countries worldwide!\nImagine a cellular-connected Arduino, but with a more powerful processor and a SIM card. It also comes with Spark's development tools and cloud platform for managing and interacting with your new connected hardware.\nStretch Goals: Free Months of Data!\nCellular and free don\u2019t usually go together, but we\u2019re making an exception for our backers. We've passed $400K, so we'll give you 2 free months of our 1MB data plan for every Electron purchased during the Kickstarter campaign!\nCellular is hard.\nYou've probably heard of the Internet of Things. In the cellular world, it's called M2M (Machine to Machine).\nThe M2M world was set up for the types of companies that make industrial products like shipping containers, vending machines, and ATMs. These old-school industries still have old-school practices. If you want to get some M2M SIM cards, you've got to get on the phone with somebody. You need an account manager, you've got to sign a bunch of paperwork, and it'll be months before you even see a price sheet. The industry is set up for big, established companies that already know how to navigate telcos, not for individuals. And if you're not in the club already, it's hard to gain entrance.\nM2M feels like it's ripe for disruption; we want to make it a lot easier for people to create cellular-connected products.\nThe Hardware: a tiny 2G/3G dev kit\nA closer look at the Electron\nThe Electron is a tiny cellular development kit. It's a circuit board about the size of your thumb* that fits in a breadboard and consists of a microcontroller, a cellular modem, and a bunch of other useful stuff**.\nIt works like an Arduino. It runs a single application, which you can write using Wiring (Arduino's programming language) or C/C++, or ARM assembly, or whatever. It's open source, it's easy, and it's fun. \nPlus, the Electron plays well with the rest of the Spark family. It'll be a bit longer than the Photon or Core due to the size of the cellular module, but we've designed it in a way that allows it to be backwards compatible with our existing shields.\nLike specs? Here are some:\nSTM32F205 ARM Cortex M3 microcontroller\n1MB Flash, 128K RAM\nCellular modem: U-Blox SARA U-series (3G) or G-series (2G)\n36 pins total: 28 GPIOs (D0-D13, A0-A13), plus TX/RX, 2 GNDs, VIN, VBAT, WKP, 3V3, RST \nBoard dimensions: 2.0\" x 0.8\" x 0.3\" (0.5\" including headers)\n* Unless you have crazy weird huge thumbs.\n** Voltage regulator, buttons, LED, antenna, SIM card slot, crystal, resistors, capacitors, inductors.\nOur SIM card: Worldwide!\nIncluded with the Electron will be a SIM card. Whose logo is on the SIM? Ours.\nWe\u2019re becoming a carrier. We'll provide SIM cards and manage the cellular connectivity completely via your Spark account, giving you the power to control your account with no contracts.\nWe\u2019re working with Telefonica, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, to support our global mobile network for cellular-connected hardware. Our network will provide coverage in more than 100 countries through carriers like Telefonica, AT&T, T-Mobile, O2, Movistar, Vivo, Telenor, Rogers, and many more.\nFor a full list of the countries we'll support during this initial run please check out the massive list at the end of the campaign. \nA note about 2G and 3G: Some U.S. carriers are planning to sunset their 2G networks beginning in 2017. Therefore we recommend the Electron 3G for our backers in the U.S., while the rest of the world can expect 2G to keep working for the foreseeable future. If you're having trouble deciding between 2G and 3G check out our FAQs for more information.\nThe data plan: Cheap. And no contracts.\nYou don't need 4GB of data for a connected product, and you also don't need to spend $40/mo. We've negotiated global low-cost data plans for low-bandwidth products. \nHere's the story for most of you (U.S., Canada, Europe, most of Latin America, a few others):\n    $2.99/month for 1MB (approx. 20,000 messages per month)\n$0.99/each additional MB\nNo Contracts\nNow, pricing varies a bit by country. Here's a rough outline:\n1 MB doesn't sound like a lot, but our messages tend to be 50 bytes or less, so you should be able to send and receive 20,000 messages per month (a bit less than once every two minutes) under our basic 1MB plan.\nAlso, our data plan has no contract; deactivate your devices at any time from our website. \nAwesome developer tools\nWe make developer tools. We built some great software around the Spark Core and Photon, our first two development kits, and all of that same software is available with the Electron. Here's some of what you'll get:\nArduino-like development: Ever played with an Arduino? You'll feel right at home. Spark uses Wiring, the same code framework as Arduino.\nA REST API for hardware: Control hardware your way: Interact with your hardware as if it were a web service like Facebook or Twitter. Use SparkJS to control your Electron with Javascript. Or webhooks. Or IFTTT. You get the idea.\nTinker: Prototyping without code: Not a code ninja? Use Tinker to control your Electron from a smartphone. No code required!\nOver-the-air firmware updates: Reprogram your Electron wirelessly, and never worry about cables again.\nWeb IDE and Spark Dev: Write code in our Web IDE, or download Spark Dev, our professional IDE based on Github's open source Atom project.\nOpen source software and hardware: Spark's developer tools are open source, hackable, and extensible. We use open standards like HTTP, AES, RSA, and CoAP.\nBackwards compatibility: The Electron is just like the Spark Core and the Photon, except it\u2019s got a cellular module instead of a Wi-Fi module. That means we've designed it to be user-friendly and easy to jump into whether you're an experienced embedded programmer, web designer or just a weekend hacker. The Electron runs the same code as our other boards and uses the same development tools and cloud back-end. It\u2019s a tad bigger, but it\u2019ll still fit on a mini-breadboard. If you\u2019ve ever used an Arduino or heard of a REST API, you\u2019ll feel right at home.\nCool stuff you can (and should) build \nAccess to easy to use but powerful tools means you can create all sorts of things with the Electron:\nAn Amazing Community\nWe pride ourselves in having one of the best communities out there. Visit our forums to get help from some of the most talented (and patient) folks out there, or check out our projects page for some project inspiration.\nWe are endlessly proud of our community of users, and we wouldn't be where we are today without them. Being an open source project and active community means we're always listening and open to input and ideas. There is a strong (and growing!) community of more than 25,000 users to help you through your project.\nHold up. Weren't you on Kickstarter already?\nExcellent question friend. We were. And we're back for a good reason. What we're trying to do with cellular is going to be disruptive to a rather large, well-funded and established industry. We want to demonstrate that there is a community desire and need for a better solution for creating cellular-connected things. The best way to disrupt an industry is to raise a rumpus, and we think that Kickstarter is the perfect venue to do just that. \nHelp us spread the word via social media:\nDetails: The Rewards\n   A few more details about the Sensor Kit, Solar Kit and Asset Tracker:\nSensor Kit: The Sensor Kit will fulfill your dreams! Crush your enemies! Revive the dead! It's also a collection of our favorite sensors for remote applications like temperature, motion, distance, sound, and air quality.\nAsset Tracker: Use this combination of shield and Electron to monitor the location of anything! Cars, boxes, pets, livestock... whatever you dream up. The Asset Tracker will come with a GPS module, a battery for power and a project enclosure. \nSolar Kit: Power from the heavens! This shiny new kit will keep your projects alive way off the grid. It includes a 6-watt monocrystalline solar panel, LiPo battery, a shield to handle charging with a prototyping area, and an enclosure to hold the electronics. Oh, and an Electron of course.\nMeet the Team\nSince the Core campaign we've gone from 4 people to 24. We have an incredible global team made up of engineers and people who love engineers.

We've done our research on the industry and believe we've made the choices that will ensure a wonderful experience for our backers, however there are factors over which we don't have control. That said, we've built a strong network within the industry and believe we are well placed to respond to changes as they arrive.\n\nWhile we will soon be in a position to announce partnerships with mobile operators, we do believe there are risks to the timeline as we formalize these relationships.

In the first closed beta release we won't have game sound.  That is the final asset we're redoing, and we're lucky enough to have a great sound designer working on it.

Woohoo!!  nofringe.org\nIcarus showtimes\n We are presenting a retelling of the Greek myth Icarus, told through aerial hoop, corde lisse, harness work, and some seriously raw physicality.  Our reappropriation sees our hero not drowned after his great fall, but rather washed up on a strange shore, quite broken and lost.  This is how we begin our story.  In the true spirit of the Fringe, Icarus is an experiment in circus arts, dance, experimental theater, and exactly how much creation you can wring out of a brain in a day. \nFrom its conception to its rapidly approaching realization, the help we have received from our collaborators has contained a degree of synchronicity and harmony that pushes us to go farther; from musicians to photographers to our graphic designer- a collection of talent we are truly honored to stand beside.  \nThe help we need at this time is what we haven't managed to collect so far- which is the funding to offset the cost of travelling us, our stage manager, and all of this lovely equipment to the Crescent City and back again.  This is our first self-produced work and we are learning there is always more to purchase in the ways of rigging supplies, marketing materials, and set dressings and any excess funds will go to fulfilling these details as they arise.  \nWe hope to create in Icarus something timeless, innovative, and achingly genuine.

I'm Frank.  I'm the guy behind Southern Boy Teas.  I am a southern boy. I grew up in Alabama and Tennessee, and graduated from Robert E. Lee High School in Huntsville, Alabama. [Only place in the world where they name a high school after a defeated general.]\nAnyway, iced tea holds a special place in my heart.  It's why I got into the tea business (that and the fact that I really hate accounting).  My Southern Boy Teas are specifically made for iced teas.  I use only the best high-grown organic Indian black teas and organic flavors.  In fact, that's all I put in our teas.  Check out the ingredients on our label and see for yourself.  \nBut speaking of flavors, I love creating new and fun flavors.  Here's just a few of the flavors we have:\nWe've been selling these teas online for some time now and you can visit our website at www.southernboyteas.com to read some of the nice things folks have been saying about these teas.\nWhat we're trying to do\nI imagine this would be an important bit of information to share with you.\nThe thing is, our teas are blended by hand.  We measure, fill and seal the teabags by hand, then we label, stuff and seal the outside pouch by hand.  Well, that's part of what makes us unique, but I wouldn't mind speeding up the process a little where we can.  So I found this machine the other day that would help us quickly apply labels to the pouches, which would speed things up a bit for us.  So we're trying to raise $500 to buy the label applicator machine.\nOf course, if we go over our goal, I have some other ideas for things I'd like to do to speed up our process or otherwise help us get our iced teas into more people's hands.  We'll post stretch goals here if we exceed our goal.\nWhat you get\nFor as little as $3, you get to choose one of our iced tea flavors to receive.  We'll ship it to you anywhere in the world.  Our teas come in convenient 2-quart teabags, one per package to preserve optimum freshness.  Most folks find they can re-steep one of our teabags to get a full gallon of tea out of each one.\nWe only need 167 people to contribute $3 and get a cool iced flavor in the mail for us to reach our goal, but if you want more than one of our iced teas (and who wouldn't?), you can get four for $10 or ten for $25. Or, if you want to do something really cool, you can contribute $75 ($50 if you get in on the early bird discount), get ten teas and the opportunity to give me a new flavor to create.  You want a peanut butter and jelly tea?  A chocolate eclair tea?  Maybe a bacon marshmallow banana tea?  You just tell me what it is and I'll do my best to make it.  (I reserve the right to refund your money if you ask for something I just CAN'T make, but I think I should be able to accommodate most requests--I've been at this a while.)  How cool is that?\nIf you're looking for a cool gift idea, you can also sign up for a subscription and get four iced teas (two each of two different flavors) every month for six or 12 months beginning in December.\nNew Reward!\nOur 12 Iced Teas of Christmas Gift set includes 12 mystery iced teas (all unique), one for each day from December 14-December 25.  Each iced tea has a date on it telling you when you can scratch and reveal the flavor of the tea.  These are going to make really fun Christmas presents!\nThe circle will be made from scrath em stuff you can scratch off to revel what tea it is.\nReviews\nJust so it's not just me saying our teas are great, I grabbed a handful of reviews written by our customers to share:\nRazzleberry\n\u2022 YEAH! BABY! Razzleberry, I love you. You are the best flavored iced tea I have ever had.\n\u2022 Just offered hubby some more of the tea. He points out the most gigantic drinking glass we own, now empty, but apparently moments ago filled with this tea. I guess I better order some more quickly!\n\u2022 My daughter made both the Sherbert and Razzleberry Iced Teas and shared them with me. I absolutely love them both! They are probably my favorite for iced tea so far. The flavor is excellent and natural tasting ( not artificial at all) The base tea is perfect as well! Both these teas are very refreshing especially during this heat wave we are having! I will definitely buy more of these iced teas and actually want to try a few others after tasting these\nCotton Candy\n\u2022 This one is another stunner\u2026. It\u2019s delicious \u2014 sweet, sugary, airy cotton candy goodness. It smells strongly of cotton candy, it tastes strongly of cotton candy. Once again, the black base is detectable, but it just seems to enhance and support the flavouring rather than mask it in any way. I have no idea how Frank achieves these extraordinary flavouring feats. What I do know is that, as iced tea goes, these are unbeatable. Yum yum yum is about the most coherent thing I can say about this right now. Please excuse me while I go and drink some more.\n\u2022 It won't last. You'll drink it all. We drank up the last of the rainbow sherbet and I made this. Have you ever had a taste of something and just stared for a moment, not at anything in particular, but just thinking to yourself, what is happening on my tongue, and why is it so wonderful? I get the feeling I should expect this from Frank's teas. \"Wonder what -this- tea tastes like!\" It tastes like exactly what it says it is, but more delicious than you hoped. I steeped this one a little long and don't regret it. I found the flavor intense in a good way and it really does taste like cotton candy. The smell in the package is very mild, but the flavor comes out well. I shared some with my family and they were impressed. I'm sneaking some into work tomorrow to share with my coworkers, and I don't expect any to be left when I get home, so I better order more. This would be perfect any fanciful party or event.\n\u2022 It's off to the fair we go! Take a pitcher of ice tea and that big beautiful cone of flossy spun deliciousness; aka Cotton Candy and combine (minus the cone of course). That is what I imagine when I drink this tea. A new addiction for sure, especially when brown rock sugar is added during the steep\u2026. I just bought a whole bunch more. LOVE IT!\nRainbow Sherbet\n\u2022 I was a bit of a doubter at first, because I didn\u2019t see how tea could taste of ice cream or sherbet, jello or bubblegum. Somehow, though, they do. This one is no exception, and it\u2019s another all-round great taste experience. I will definitely, definitely be buying more or these. They\u2019re just too good to miss!\n\u2022 The first word that came to mind (after the expletives, haha) was whoa. This tea is soooo creamy. Tangy, fruity, and creamy, just like sherbet. I\u2019m pretty weird in that I don\u2019t actually like ice cream/sherbet/sorbets because a lot of the time its too sweet. Also I prefer to drink cold things, not eat them, and I don\u2019t necessarily find milky things to be that refreshing when the weather is hot. I\u2019m a right ball of fun, I know. So that this manages to somehow sidestep all of my ridiculous criteria is pretty miraculous. It\u2019s got a creamy full texture which tea usually just doesn\u2019t have on it\u2019s own. The only way I get this texture in tea normally is by adding milk, but iced tea is not something you can add milk to (Ew. just the thought of that\u2026) It tastes like ice cream without being ice cream. And I\u2019m drinking it on its own, without a meal \u2013 it\u2019s like dessert! Um, LOVE. I hope I can get another 2 quarts out of this\u2026 but even if not I just went ahead and put one of each of the SBT iced tea flavors in a shopping cart because MY MOUTH IS SO HAPPY.\n\u2022 \"Each individually packaged teabag will yield 2-quarts... of the best iced tea you've ever had.\" Don't doubt it. This is delicious, improbably delicious, and in fact the tastiest -and- the most interesting iced tea I've ever had. From the moment you open the package and smell it, to when you've got a cup, you'll just know. I brought some in for my coworkers to sample and it was a hit with them. Now everyone wants to know where I got it, but I'm not telling them until -after- I get my next paycheck... I didn't know how strong the rainbow sherbet flavor would be, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it isn't so mild that you can't immediately taste it, or so overpowering that it no longer tastes like tea. It's just right, and the taste is spot-on.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nClearly the biggest risk here is keeping up with demand if we get a LOT of orders.

We are both artists, and although we specialise in different mediums, we work together exploring our shared creative vision - Mujuworld.\nTeam Muju\nMujuworld is an imaginary dimension filled with organic landscapes, inhabited by guardian spirits and elemental forces.  These characters come to life through drawings, prints, paintings and limited editions of resin sculptures.\nHaving a studio so close to the Atlantic Ocean means we spend a lot of time either watching or riding the waves.  It's these many experiences with the ever changing wave forms that inspired the latest Muju sculpture.  \nAs the ancient Hawaiians were the first wave riders, we felt their word for wave 'NALU' should be the name of this character.\nWe also both have a passion for film and photography, which was born out of a shared love of old film cameras.  We are always happy to explore the rugged landscapes of Cornwall looking for new locations to document our Muju sculptures.\nMaking our Kickstarter video was a collaboration of all the creative elements we love.\nYou can see more of our work on our website here : www.mujuworld.co.uk\n\nWe'd like to say a special thank you to East Forest for allowing us to use their track 'Hold On' in our video.\nGo and check out more awesome music on their website: www.eastforest.org\nWhy we need your help..\nThe pre-production costs involved in releasing a new sculpture are high.\nBio-resin is a non-toxic and more sustainable material than traditional resin, however it is significantly more expensive.\nEach Nalu sculpture is totally handmade and handpainted by ourselves, which requires a big investment of our time. \nPre order sales will enable us to fund a production run of this handmade sculpture.\nREWARDS...\nPostcard Set:\nNalu Muju Postcard Set\nThis set of 4 postcards will be available through a number of different rewards.

It means \"fearless.\"\nNIRBHAYA is a play, but it also a call for societal change. In NIRBHAYA the play, the rape and death of Jyoti serves as the catalyst for each performer to bravely come forward and break their silence- recounting their own intimate and personal experiences of sexual and gender-based violence.\nNIRBHAYA\u2019S vision is to do nothing less than CHANGE THE WORLD by ending the silence on sexual violence and creating a fear-free society.\nNIRBHAYA is written and directed by internationally acclaimed  writer/director Yael Farber, in collaboration with an extraordinary cast and creative team from India.\nFor more details visit our Facebook Page -\nwww.Facebook.com/nirbhayatheplay\nFollow us on Twitter @NirbhayaThePlay\n WHAT DO WE NEED?\nNIRBHAYA premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2013 where it touched the lives of each and every one of over 6,000 audience members who packed the theatre. \nWith your help, we will raise the funds to bring NIRBHAYA to India where it can serve as a catalyst to change the lives of women and men. Our hope is for a revolution by lifting the veil of silence on sexual violence.\nWe need to raise \u00a350,000 ($80,000/\u20ac60,000) now to make the early 2014 India tour a reality. (We have already secured \u00a330,000 out of the total tour costs of \u00a380,000.)\nOur ultimate ambition would be to galvanise a broad base of support, with  thousands of people registering their support of our goal to change the world and break the cone of silence around sexual violence by pledging.\nHOW WAS NIRBHAYA BORN?\nJyoti Singh Pandey, a young physiotherapy student, died after a gang rape so violent that her intestines were ripped from her body. Despite her severe injuries, during her last two weeks, she found the strength to testify against her attackers, and ensured the perpetrators were brought to justice. In a society that often blames the victim for their own sexual assault, she used her dying days to demand accountability. Legally prevented from revealing her real name, the press called her \u201cNirbhaya\u201d -- \"fearless one\u201d.\nIn response, the streets of India rose in protest against a system indifferent to and often critical of survivors of sexual assault. The Indian government attempted to quash this response with riot police, water cannons and arrests - but the protesters defied such intimidation. This furious Indian response was mirrored across the world. This young woman's death was a tipping point. The time for change had come.\n\nIt was in this volatile aftermath that an impassioned Indian actress, Poorna Jagannathan, reached out to playwright and director Yael Farber to come to Mumbai and create a production that would turn this spirit of the streets into an action that would endure. Jagannathan and Farber sought performers who were survivors of sexual violence, who were prepared to tell their personal stories. Edinburgh Fringe production company, Assembly Theatre, came on board as producers while the play was still being created.  This extraordinary production was created in Delhi in a matter of weeks and premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the world's largest arts festival, to universal acclaim, in August 2013.\nNIRBHAYA at the Fringe\n\nAs well as receiving rave reviews, NIRBHYA won three prestigious awards: The Amnesty International Freedom of Expression Award, The Scotsman's Fringe First Award, and the Herald Angel Award. \nAudiences openly wept and sought the performers after each show to share their own stories of sexual violence, or to simply thank the cast for their courage in leading the way towards breaking the silence.\n NIRBHAYA is now poised to take its message around the world and become a powerful agent for real social change. With the help of our Kickstarter backers, the NIRBHAYA tour will start early 2014 in the place where it is most relevant, where it all began: India.\nWHAT WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTION HELP US DO?\nWe cannot bring NIRBHAYA's vital message to India without your donations \nBy raising the money via this Kickstarter campaign, we free the production from producers or sponsors who will expect profit or may try to water-down our message. The NIRBHAYA team is fully confident that once the first shows are reviewed that demand for the show will be overwhelming. But we need your help to provide the seed money for this tour.\nWHAT IS THE COST?\nThe initial cost of mounting the tour is \u00a380,000 ($108,000/\u20ac96,000). This money will finance 10 performances in 2 cities, Mumbai and Delhi. We have already raised \u00a330,000 through donations. We need \u00a350,000 to fund the first tour. Raising over \u00a350,000 means more performances in additional cities for our current tour. Our goal is to include 5 additional performances in Bangalore and 5 in Kolkata. Each additional show costs about \u00a35,000. Our ultimate goal is to take the show to many more cities in 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe initial sum will cover all our expenses, including the rehearsal process, sets, travel and accommodation for cast and crew, advanced publicity, and security (which must be provided due to the content of this work).\nTo ensure maximum impact, each performance will be accompanied by a post-show discussion, which we want to expand to include forums, support groups and awareness programmes. We intend to ensure we have a section of seats always set aside for students at no cost or at a highly subsidised rate.\nPlease note: Any excess funds raised will go towards future productions of NIRBHAYA in India in 2014 and 2015. Because there are so many moving pieces when it comes to planning a tour in India, there is a chance that by the time we have raised the funds, theatre spaces are no longer available. In that case, be assured the money will be used for an Indian tour in 2014. Whilst, we hope in time to be invited to perform and to receive subsidies thereby reducing our costs, it must be emphasized that revenue from theatre like this in India, in intimate spaces, is very low (ticket prices averaging \u00a33). Box office revenue only covers a small portion of the overall costs.\nTHE JOURNEY AHEAD\nBE PART OF THIS GREAT PROJECT\nWe need your support. We need to raise \u00a350,000, but we would love to raise much more, so that we can make a real difference with NIRBHAYA. We\u2019d love to tour many more cities and college campuses across India in the upcoming years. We\u2019d like to harness the momentum and build tools with which we can affect real social change. NIRBHAYA is part of a growing movement of people refusing to be silent. We hope you can share our vision to do nothing less than CHANGE THE WORLD by ending the silence on sexual violence.\nOur dream would be to raise \u00a3500,000 from 500,000 people each pledging just a \u00a31 or \u20ac1, sending a clear message to end sexual violence. But if you really do believe in NIRBHAYA, then please do give more, so we can harness the power of theatre to create a FEARLESS world.\nWHAT THE PRESS AND AUDIENCES HAVE SAID ABOUT NIRBHAYA\nAnd here are just a select few of the hundreds of tweets we have received:\n And some extracts from blogs and letters by audience members:\nVIDEO REVIEWS\nCheck out these video reviews from the Edinburgh run:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUr3ftjt1rg\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7W7zMj5v8c\n Kickstarter video credit: Gabriella Sonabend", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNirbhaya is the result of a profound development process between the creative team and the performers themselves, whose individual experiences and perspectives are core to the production. The current company has committed to the next phase of presentation in India but should any individual be unavailable, the production can be re-shaped in response to additional performers\u2019 testimonies and perceptions. \n\nWe are passionate about sharing this groundbreaking production with as many people as possible \u2013 this passion spurred us on to create the piece in Delhi in time to take it to Edinburgh this summer, making possible the ambition to present in India this December. The date is important because it marks a year since the death of Jyoti Singh Pandey, and a year since the public outrage which accompanied coverage of the attack and set the chain of events in motion leading to the play\u2019s creation. Nirbhaya remains as vital a piece of theatre as when it was first performed this summer, and if we are unable to put everything in place for the proposed December dates, the tour will go ahead as early as possible in 2014. \n\nThe collaborative nature of touring theatre means that challenging situations will inevitably crop up, but we are a very experienced team and have the skills, knowledge and drive to overcome any obstacles and ensure that this unique piece of testimonial theatre is experienced by audiences in India, and where it is needed most.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "New York City announced!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "NIRBHAYA Indian Tour - Breaking the Silence", "update_content": "Team NIRBHAYA in India"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "NIRBHAYA is coming to INDIA March 18 - March 28", "update_content": "As we prepare to open NIRBHAYA in London as part of the Women of the World Festival at The Southbank Centre, it is with great happiness that we officially announce NIRBHAYA will be doing a 3 city tour of India from March 18 to 28.

Our engineers worked throughout the weekend testing the Apex with the Air, and they are pleased to say that the Apex is already working pretty well.

Originally our circuit design allowed for ~ 8 hours of constant on-time from a single battery.\nWe\u2019ve decided to make one final modification to our circuit board that allows the Apex to run more efficiently.\nThe result is a > 2X improvement in battery life. So the Apex will now last for at least 16 hours of constant \u201cnote-taking-time\u201d without needing to replace the battery.\nThe Apex circuit boards on order are all being modified with the new design and should start to arrive at our factory in November.\nSince we originally had about a 3 to 4 week buffer in our production ramp schedule, we are actually still on track to deliver initial production units to backers in December and high volume production units in January.\nUpdate #1--\nThank you all for your support!!! We are thrilled that we were able to reach and surpass our initial project goal in under 48 hours!\nWe would also like to take the time to thank you for the great questions and feedback. Based on trending comments and questions we have developed a FAQ page which we hope will be helpful to current and future backers.\nWe have made a couple updates to the project.\nFirst, since the nib is a very important part of any stylus, we are pleased to announce that we will be shipping each Apex out with one installed nib and two additional nibs for no extra cost to our backers.\nNext, due to popular request, we have added ANOTHER reward level!\nThanks again to everyone!\nYour Link to a Paperless World starts now...\nApple revolutionized the world with the iPad, and our goal is to bring that same elegance and simplicity with the design of the TruGlide Apex.\nThe TruGlide Apex is the next generation stylus. Our engineers worked hard to develop a super-fine, hard-point stylus that delivers a realistic pen to paper writing experience.\nBy using brass fittings, a metal stylus body, and a brushed silver coating, the Apex has been designed with quality in mind.\nWhat makes this different from other styluses?\nWith our innovative circuitry, the Apex boasts a reduction of over 90% in tip area compared to most soft rubber styluses. \nAlso, unlike other electronic styluses appearing on the market, the Apex Fine Point Stylus is not limited to specific applications.\nOur engineers have succeed in making the TruGlide Apex work universally across all apps without the need for additional attachments or plug-ins.\n\nHow does the TruGlide Apex work?\nThe TruGlide Apex uses active circuitry that creates an electronic interruption of the field coupling between the drive electrode and the receive electrodes of the mutual-capacitance touch screen panel and controller IC. This interruption to the flow of electrons simulates a finger, allowing the device to register a \u201ctouch\u201d.\nAn inside look at the TruGlide Apex\n The Apex works with an AAAA replaceable battery and can be turned on and off with a simple rotation of the specially designed fin on the top of the stylus body.\nIt's simple. Pick it up, turn it on, and let your ideas take flight!\n\nSpecifications\nPhoto of the TruGlide Apex\nTip: 2.4mm replaceable hardened rubber nib\nHeight: 1.3cm (0.5\u201d)\nLength: 14cm (5.5\u201d)\nWeight: 1.1oz\nComposition: Brass barrel and fittings with plastic end cap for circuit isolation\nProcess and Development\nThe research phase of the TruGlide Apex project started near January 2013. In this phase, we teamed up with the Loyola Physics Department to develop our concept into a usable product.\nOnce we had the basic development complete, we went to work on the electronic aspect and engineered the circuit prototype.\nAfter the initial engineering of the circuit prototype, we were able to move into circuit debugging in March. Then, we took detailed steps to ensure the industrial design fit our needs and desires for the TruGlide Apex.\nThis past May we were able to revise the design for improved performance. The revised design led us to prototype development and testing to ensure the high quality of our product.\nWe are delighted to now have a working prototype of the TruGlide Apex and are ready to move toward mass production. Our goal is to raise enough funding to start production and bring the Apex to market by January of 2014.\nWho is the TruGlide Apex for?\nWe provide a product we know all types of people can use and enjoy.\nThe TruGlide Apex is perfect for anyone.\nFrom children to adults, professionals, students, artists, and everyone in between, we can ensure everyone will find a use and appreciation for the TruGlide Apex.\n\nRewards\n\nBringing the Apex to You\nWith your help, we plan to move into mass production the first week of November 2013. Our working prototype is made from plastic 3D modeling, so the first step will be to create a production mold. The final product will feature a brass barrel, metal fittings, and high grade plastic construction.\nWithin 3-4 weeks after the initial tooling and manufacturing process starts, we plan to have our first TruGlide Apex styluses completed. During the production time, we will finalize our packaging and marketing concepts.\nBy early December, our goal is to begin shipping out our first TruGlide Apex styluses. The first TruGlide Apex\u2019 will go to the early bird backers who opted for delivery by Christmas!\nBy January of 2014, we plan to have added the TruGlide Apex to our existing line of TruGlide styluses which are sold through our eCommerce store, Amazon.com, and other retailers. The TruGlide Apex will then be available to everyone!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe wanted to make certain we could really produce this product before asking our fellow Kickstarters to back us. We have worked through all the design issues and our TruGlide\u2122 Apex works as shown in our video. \n\nThe people in the video on the street outside the Chicago Apple store were truly random and were experiencing our fully functional prototype for the first time. It was a risk not knowing exactly what these people were going to say or how they would react to our new product. But then again, we would never bring a product to people that we didn\u2019t believe in 100%.\n\nOur circuit boards and components have been ordered and the only thing left to do is to fund the investment in high volume manufacturing tools so we may move the TruGlide\u2122 Apex into mass production. \n\nTherefore, as soon as we have enough backers to cover our tooling costs (the $24,000 in our campaign goal) we will launch our tooling order, and within 3 to 4 weeks we will be producing our Apex stylus. This means, if we get enough backers really early in our campaign we could be ramping production right when our campaign ends in November!\n\nIn the meantime, our engineers are finalizing the manufacturing and processing steps that will be tightly controlled in our production line to ensure the quality of our product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Our Flip!

So any funds that come in beyond the \u00a38,000 target level will be used to enable us to make it a larger print run. To print 2,000 decks will cost in excess of \u00a314,000 but if we can get near to that level I would go for it. On the basis of the interest shown so far, I'm pretty certain that the initial 1,000 decks will be gone within 6 months, so it really makes a lot of sense to get 2,000 printed at once.  (Nov. 8th) So all new pledges are greatly appreciated even at this point!\nI grow orchids, and I photograph them, a lot. We have a small greenhouse next to our house, where we have about 600 tropical orchids, both species and hybrids. We make something called \"flower essences\" with the orchids, and we ship these out around the world. I run a (very) small business on a very small island in the Inner Hebrides in Scotland, and have been making these orchid flower essences for over 14 years now. And my wife runs a very small dairy farm at the north end of the island. \nFront & back of one of the cards, shown smaller than actual finished size, in order to show them here side by side.\nIn 2007 we produced a small set of photo cards based on the photos of the orchids I had been taking over the years. These were very popular with our therapist customers, and with the public who like to use our orchid essences. The first set showed just 50 orchids, and 3 years later we brought out another small set showing a further number of orchids, and also of combinations which we make with the orchid essences. My initial intention was that the small set of cards was just the first phase, and we would also bring out a set of larger-sized cards. But as it happened that first phase has lasted fully 6 years, and finally now I have pretty much completed the design of a larger set of cards. These larger cards will be 3.5\" x 5\" (89mm x 127mm), a little more than double the earlier card size, and there will be 130 of them. They will come in a firm cardboard box, that will enable the cards to be well looked after for years to come.\nFlowers help keep us sane - imagine a world without flowers! They do this in many ways, at different levels. They can calm us down simply by their beauty, or transport us with their fragrance. But they also have another level of action, a bio-electric level, which we access by pouring some water over the blooms and then adding cognac as a preservative. This is the tradition largely begun by Dr. Edward Bach in England in the 1930's. People around the world make use of the essences he created then. But the principles he explored in his work are also valid when applied to other flowering plants, and with the orchids, we enter into wonderful new territories of healing.\nThe front of the cards will look like this. Card is shown at more or less finished size.\nThe reverse side of the cards will look like this.\nFor many reading this project proposal, the notion that there can be a healing benefit from the very subtle bio-electric qualities of orchids will seem a remote possibility, or even downright absurd. I can fully sympathise, and can only assure you that once you explore the topic, and perhaps try a few orchid essences, you will very likely feel the need to ponder first principles freshly for the first time in many years. (I address some sceptics' questions in my book Orchid Essence Healing which was published in 2010.) But the cards do not need to be approached on that basis. They are certainly healing tools, and act as the first stage in experiencing the energetic healing powers of these remarkable flowers, which can be further experienced from the essences themselves. But they can also stand alone as simply a beautiful testament to the extraordinary world of orchids.\nSide A of Love's Secret card, actual finished size.\nSide B of the card\nThe cards show 81 different orchids, of which 43 are natural species, and 38 are hybrids. 37 of the cards show the orchid combinations we have created, and then there are also 2 rhododendrons, an emerald, and some rather special sphagnum moss. There are several 'informational' cards as well, including a few depicting body-maps that are useful for muscle-testing.\nThe Orchid Healing Cards will show on one face the best photo I have taken of the orchid. On the reverse will be the name of the orchid, the essence name, and also text describing the healing qualities of the bloom, as well as a secondary photo of the orchid. The set will be presented in the box in two 'decks' of 65, so that the cards in the box can easily be posted and fit through most letterboxes. The box will be printed in full colour, depicting orchids on it as well. The whole item should make an excellent Xmas gift.\nWing\u00e9d Messenger card, side A, actual finished size.\nSide B of the Wing\u00e9d Messenger card, actual finished size.\nBoth sides of the Angelic Canopy card.\nTwo sides of one of the two Body-map cards\nThe cards are primarily designed as adjuncts to the range of orchid essences we make, which are sold mainly in 15ml (1/2 oz) stock bottles. Our customers are kinesiologists, naturopaths, homeopaths, aromatherapists, flower essence therapists and people working within many other modalities of complimentary therapies. The full range of 125 essences is presented in 3 wooden boxes, two of which hold 50 bottles and one which holds 25. The range is described on our website, and in our brochure, and in my book which was published in May 2010.\nOne of the 3 wooden boxes of our full kit.\nOne of our most popular combination essences.\nMy book which describes the orchid essences.\nI also wanted to mention that in 2012 I came to Kickstarter to help fund a music license for one of the time-lapse videos I made with one of the orchids. As that Kickstarter campaign was a success, it seems only right to share that timelapse video with its soundtrack by Keith Jarrett here, as it helps to convey something of the wonder and magic that is found amongst the orchids.\nAs I mentioned above, we live on the small Isle of Gigha in the Inner Hebrides, population about 160. Six miles long and about a mile wide more or less, we're 3 hours drive and (and a short ferry ride) from Glasgow, just off the Kintyre coast. Our views to the west are of sunsets over the Paps of Jura and of Islay. \nThe Isle of Gigha, Argyll, Scotland\nThe Paps of Jura seen from Tarbert Farm, Isle of Gigha.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe design work is nearly complete, and will be finished by about the 3rd week of October. Of course production delays are possible, but I have worked with the card printers before several times, and I have spoken with them about this project.

I have been designing and printing colour brochures and flyers for 20 years or more, and know what I am doing in this type of project. \n\nThe major risk is simply that of not meeting the target of getting the card sets and other rewards to people by the middle of December, to make sure folk have them by Xmas. Being aware of the risk means I am taking all possible steps to ensure that we meet our target deadlines, and do not disappoint people. I can assure you I will be conscientious on this matter, and I expect we will make people happy with the rewards they receive.\n\nIf our funding target is exceeded by a substantial amount, the extra funds would go towards having a larger print run of the cards.

If you got a deck of the Orchid Healing Cards last year, and want to get it updated with the further 17 cards we are printing in the coming 6 weeks, this will be your best opportunity to get them at a keen price.\nThe Extension Set will sell for \u00a37.95 once the Kickstarter campaign has finished, but the first 100 people pledging support this time are able to get the set for just \u00a34.\nThere is another Reward option you may like: if you pledge \u00a320 you get 2 of the Extension Sets of 17 cards, and also a deck of the original 135 cards. In other words, this is the pledge you should choose if you wish to update your own deck, but also wish to give a up-to-date deck to a friend this Christmas.

Sometime in the next two or three weeks I expect to launch it.\nThe challenge of printing these cards arises from the fact that they are printed lithographically, which is also called Offset printing. This involves the printers in making a \"plate\" that will print 45 cards on a sheet. So that presents a problem when you only need 11 cards. Of course we will double up on the cards we need, so we will get 1,000 sheets printed, giving us 2,000 sets of the 11 missing cards. The extras will be a sample card which we will send out in a mailing to the rest of our customers. (In the event that any other new essences are made before we go to print, they will of course be added to this print run. Any additions will not affect the cost of the supplemental set.)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Note about the new Aura Sprays", "update_content": "I forgot to mention that the new Aura Sprays will have different colour coding for the essential oils which are added to each. So if you are familiar with our aura sprays from the last few years, when they have been in cobalt blue glass bottles, you will need to examine the new ones carefully as some of them have switched colour.\nThe key point is that any of the aura sprays that have Rose Otto in them are now going to be in the bottles with labels that have a blue background. As this is one of the key oils in the range, it made sense to bring order to the offering, and we believe that this will make life easier for everyone once the transition is over.

Built upon the power of the Unity 3D engine, \u201cDeathfire\u201d utilizes a first person view that gives the player the feeling of being there. A solid role-playing engine that utilizes over forty visible character attributes, along with countless invisible ones to track behavior. They make up the heartbeat of the game, and allow us to analyze and adjust gameplay on the fly, and react to the player\u2019s actions, shaping the story around these actions and decisions.\nCharacter interaction is another key ingredient in \u201cDeathfire: Ruins of Nethermore,\u201d as the player will encounter many denizens of the game world and will be able to recruit numerous ones to follow along as non-player characters in the party. Ripe with personality, opinions, phobias and their own little peccadillos, these characters will enrich the game and create unique gameplay twists\u2014as well as many memorable moments, for sure. (Don\u2019t forget to share them with us, when they occur\u2026)\nA look at the role-playing stats under the hood [Click to enlarge]\nWith a variety of large outdoor and indoor environments, the game will offer a rich game setting with party-based gameplay and turn-based combat that allows for tactically infused battles.\nDoesn\u2019t that sound like the game you\u2019ve always want to play?

Thumbs up, mein Freund!\u201d \u2014 Nancy Holder, Fiction Editor, FTL Games, creators of the original Dungeon Master\n\u201cThere is no doubt Guido is a Role-Playing Master\u2026 with his 30 years of quality and expertise, I\u2019m really looking forward to \u201cDeathfire\u201d and its ability to please Role-Playing fans everywhere.\u201d \u2014 Mark Caldwell, Co-Founder of New World Computing, creators of the Might & Magic series\nBy now you may be curious as to who we are, and what would make us qualified to create this particular game. Do they even know what they\u2019re doing? may be a valid question on your mind.\n\u201cDeathfire: Ruins of Nethermore\u201d is spearheaded by Guido Henkel, an award-winning veteran game designer, programmer and producer, who has been at the helm of countless computer role playing games in the past. Most notably, he was one of the creators of the original \u201cRealms of Arkania\u201d trilogy, also known as \u201cDas Schwarze Auge\u201d in Germany, a series of games that won countless best RPG awards throughout the years. He was also the producer of \u201cPlanescape: Torment,\u201d another award-winning game that is still celebrated as one of the best in the RPG genre.\nA mysterious encounter [Click to enlarge]\nOver the past months, Guido has gradually built a solid team of veteran game developers around him who help bring the \u201cDeathfire\u201d vision to live. Many of the team members have already worked with Guido on \u201cShadows over Riva\u201d and many other games over the past 20 years.\nCurrently consisting of six team members and a freelance illustrator, this team of game developers has worked on titles, such as the \u201cRealms of Arkania\u201d series, \u201cPlanescape: Torment,\u201d \u201cFallout 2,\u201d \u201cNeverwinter Nights,\u201d \u201cSpellforce,\u201d the \u201cDivine Divinity\u201d series, \u201cHeroes of Might &Magic,\u201d \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d and the \u201cSacred\u201d series, to name but the biggest successes. As we secure funding for the project, we will fill additional positions in the team with equally enthusiastic game developers, some of which may very well be recruited from the computer gaming or fan community.\nBy now you have undoubtedly heard the tenor how Kickstarter has revolutionized the game industry and how it makes it possible for creative people to finally get their own projects off the ground. You may have heard it so often, in fact, that you\u2019re getting a little tired of it, but here\u2019s the scoop: It is true\u2026\nThe team behind \u201cDeathfire: Ruins of Nethermore\u201d has been involved in the creation of games for over 30 years. Let that sink in for a moment\u2026\nThat means, since the dawn of computer games, actually. Collectively, we have been working on games for about 140 man years\u2014though such a summation hardly makes any sense\u2014 on many different platforms, with many different publishers and with many different licenses, but the bottom line is, the only way to be able to put creative decisions before commercial ones is to develop a game independently, and we are asking for your support to help us do just that.\nA look at one of the dungeons [Click to enlarge]\nWe may not wield a AAA-budget, but at the same time, we are not going to waste the money on huge trade show booths, legions of bloodsucking lawyers\u2014unless we put them in the game and allow you to chop them to pieces\u2014and a mahogany row of executives with seven-figure salaries.\nWe are the game developers without a yacht. We are the people who actually make the games, and we are willing to put our best foot forward, and work with you to bring you the most engaging role-playing experience we can.\nAs you can see from the way we have covered the development of the game on our blog over the past months already, we will continue to give fans and backers a constant close-up look at what is happening, allow them to share in the decision-finding process with us, and become part of the overall process.\nOver eight months of work have been put into this game, testing the core engine as a proof of feasibility, developing some of the components that make up the game, and creating a solid amount of art and design in the process. All of this has been created by a skeleton crew of four with each of us pulling double-duty and personally carrying the financial burden.\nWe have recently added new members to the team and with your support we will be able to scale the team up some more with developers who will bring not only their expertise to the mix as well, but who will then allow us to ramp up production and get things done more quickly. Our plan is to add one more Unity programmer, one additional designer/writer, and another artist/animator to the team full time, while we will contract out music and sound effects, as well as other, very specific tasks.\nThe money we are asking for in our main goal will help us put together a team as outlined above. There won\u2019t be any spare money to float around and we will have to be very careful with our investments, but at least it will be enough money to complete the game and keep food on the table for everyone.\nAn encounter with Rat Troopers [Click to enlarge]\n Naturally, our hope is to exceed the base goal, in which case our constraints will be a little more relaxed, and we will have the ability to add additional team members. That, however, is entirely up to you, as you have our fate in your hands. The more support we get, the more talent and energy we can put behind making \u201cDeathfire: Ruins of Nethermore.\u201d\nThis is the best part, really. \u201cDeathfire: Ruins of Nethermore\u201d has been designed with expansion in mind, and through stretch goals, we can expand the vision and scale of the game almost seamlessly.\nTherefore we are planning a number of stretch goals that will increase the scope of the game. One of our proposed stretch goals will add the player option for tactical Third-Person Combats to the mix, allowing the player to decide whether he wants to switch from a first-person camera to a more removed third-person view for the game\u2019s combats. Another one of our planned stretch goals will add Towns to the game, complete with locations such as Healers, Armorers, Weapon Smiths, Taverns, Temples, and so on. One additional goal we have planned will add an Overhead Map to the game, complete with Overland Travel, Hunting and Gathering. At this point we will no longer have a linear game, but will also add additional main story lines to the game so that you can really go out and explore. Expansions to the crafting and enchanting system could also be part of the game at this stage. It also deserves noting, however, that upon reaching this stretch goal, our development timeline will have to be adjusted by an additional six to eight months, in order to accommodate the design, creation, and implementation of all the additional content and, more importantly, the testing that will be required.\nAnother stretch goal we have in mind will expand the game to also include a fully editable Journal and Quest Logger.\nOne of the outdoor areas (Work in progress) [Click to enlarge]\nAt this time, however, let us not put the horse before the cart. Let us get closer to the main goal first, before we lay out more detailed plans for stretch goals. We would not want to be remiss, however, that with enough funding, the potential is there\u2014and accommodated for\u2014to turn \u201cDeathfire: Ruins of Nethermore\u201d into a full-blown world, similar to the immersive and open experience you found in games such as the original \u201cRealms of Arkania\u201d trilogy, the \u201cWizardry\u201d or the \u201cDivine Divinity\u201d games. The sky\u2019s the limit\u2026 as long as we don\u2019t run into fire-breathing dragons.\nWe understand, of course, that no matter how many pledge reward categories we offer, we will never be able to meet everyone\u2019s ideal constellations. Some packages may contain too much, others too little, and others yet will simply not contain the items you are really interested in, without having to blow your budget.

Time that could have been spent working on the game, but was instead used up by preparing materials, creating videos, perfecting specific scenes for screenshots, collecting, consolidating and writing up all the information for the pitch. Not to mention, running the actual 30-day campaign, which included answering questions and emails virtually non-stop, constantly pursuing the press for coverage, doing written interviews, podcasts, video interviews, while also preparing the regular Kickstarter updates along with the new information, images, footage and reward overhauls that came with it."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "A Note about the Backer Portal", "update_content": "I wanted to take a moment real quick to let everyone know that we are working with the utmost urgency on getting a proper backer account system and backer portal in place on the \u201cDeathfire\u201d website for people backing us via Paypal.

Don't let it's size fool you, though. We've designed this stylish wallet to hold everything you\u2019ll need - from as little as a single card to over 10 cards plus cash, receipts and more. The easy-access thumb slot makes swiping your most frequently used cards a breeze, and when not in use, the SLIMplistic leaves an almost unseen imprint in either your front or back pocket.\nWe\u2019ve taken the SLIMplistic as far as we possibly could on our own, and have now turned to our fellow Kickstarters for the support needed to fund and begin production. Your pledge will help us get one step closer to reaching our minimum goal of $5,000, allowing us to meet minimum production requirements, which then enables us to offer you the SLIMplistic Wallet at an affordable price.\nWith your pledge, you\u2019ll receive a SLIMplistic Wallet in the color of your choice. Colors available include either black or brown, with stretch goals of at least 3 more additional colors (green, blue & red). You\u2019ll also have your choice of choosing which logo embossment you prefer - plain (no color), silver, gold or black.\nThank you for taking the time to learn about the SLIMplistic, and thank you for your pledge. Your support is essential to making this project a reality and we couldn\u2019t do this without YOU!\nTake a look below to see the key features that make this one-of-a-kind wallet a step above the rest, as well as to see our Stretch Goals, where everyone wins!\nFeatures\nSUPER THIN\nOnly 1/8\u201d of an inch (.125\u201d inch) thick -- The same height as 2 quarters laying flat on top of each other -- making it both comfortable, and barely noticeable in either your front or back pocket.\nTOP VIEW - Loaded with 6 credit cards and 4 paper bills.\nSIDE VIEW - Loaded with 6 credit cards and 4 paper bills.\nBACK VIEW - Loaded with 6 credit cards and 4 paper bills.\nWhich would you rather sit on?\nSUPER LIGHTWEIGHT\nIt weighs ONLY .4oz -- Yes, less than half of one ounce, the same weight as just 2 quarters! Again adding comfort-ability while keeping it barely noticeable in any pocket.\nSUPER STYLISH\nWith all edges tucking and rolling into each other, no detail was over looked, keeping it aesthetically clean, simple, balanced and modern.\nSUPER CONVENIENT\nThe easy-slide ergonomic thumb slot is perfect for quickly accessing your most frequently used cards and essential for quick-swipe capability.\nSUPER SECURE\nUnlike other \u201cslim\u201d or \u201cminimalist\u201d wallets, which leave some or all of your wallet\u2019s content exposed, we keep it all tucked away. The center-panel recessed-notch gives you access to press all of your cards easily, and securely into place below flush at the top, as well as access to remove the inner most cards with ease.\nSUPER DURABLE\nMade from the finest Italian leather, utility nylon fabric, and locally woven custom elastic, the SLIMplistic was intently designed with longevity in mind, capable of enduring the tests of even the most extreme lifestyles.\nSUPER VERSATILE\nThis wallet is capable of holding as much or as little as you need. It securely holds anywhere from 1-15 cards, as well as cash, receipts, keys, or anything else you can imagine you\u2019d need from your wallet.\nSUPERB QUALITY\nNot only is it made from the finest materials, it\u2019s also manufactured right here at home, locally, by the finest leather workers. 100% designed, handcrafted and made in the USA.\n\nOur Process & Progress\nDon\u2019t let its simple, sleek, design fool you. Over 8 months of designing, prototyping, product testing as well as an immeasurable amount of thoughtful planning went into refining and redesigning the wallet you see today.\nLike many projects, the idea for the SLIMplistic Wallet came from necessity \u2013 a search for a problem that didn\u2019t seem to yield a suitable solution \u2013 until now. One day we were just hanging out and somehow stumbled upon discussing how large and ridiculously fat our wallets were. We had quite a few laughs as we pulled them out comparing their sizes. This prompted us to look into solutions available online. And yes, there are options out there for smaller wallets, but all of them had at least one fatal flaw, making them completely unsuitable in our eyes.\n\nMost of the wallets that claimed to be \u201cslim,\u201d either leave your cash exposed, a portion of your cards exposed, are difficult to use, or limit how much you can or can\u2019t hold.\n\nOur mission at this point was simple: Design something that is classy, slim, practical/easily accessible, fully encases all your cards and cash, and at the same time can expand to hold as much or as little as you need. The seed was planted and it was time to start sketching and testing some designs.\nIt started with some collaborative brainstorming and about 10 sketches. From there it was time to gather supplies and make some homemade prototypes.\nAfter making and testing the various designs that made the most sense, we whittled down the list to a single superior design, which we then began to refine.\nOnce we reworked and tested our prototype, we took our idea to a local manufacturer who we\u2019ve partnered up with to help further fine-tune our wallet. Working together hand-in-hand, we\u2019ve experimented with alternative materials and different techniques.\nAfter roughly half a dozen more tweaks, improving the SLIMplistic's performance in addition to making it production friendly, we\u2019ve completed the prototype process, product testing, and brought us to where we are today.\nFinal Design/Construction Process\n\nOur Manufacturing Plan \u2013 The Next Step & Beyond\nWe are now ready to take the next step forward and begin production. Once successfully funded, we will be able to purchase all the materials and final tooling needed to produce the SLIMplistic on a large enough scale to fulfill your pledge rewards as promised. Our manufacturer already houses all the materials and equipment needed to begin and complete the job, so there will be no lead-time needed in this area. We\u2019ve been given a conservative estimate of 2 weeks to complete our first production run. As we\u2019ve mentioned a couple times throughout this campaign, the leather shop we are working with has been around for over 40 years, is family owned, and are a great group of people. We couldn\u2019t ask for anyone more qualified to bring this project to life.\nWe will begin production as soon as we meet our initial goal of $5,000. At this time we will also order our packaging for your wallets. We\u2019ve been given a 10-day lead-time on the delivery of the packaging from our local print house (who we\u2019ve used before on other projects), which means we should have the packaging in-hand several days before the wallets themselves. As we receive the wallets they will be inspected for quality control, and packaged. Once our campaign comes to a close, and funds are transferred, we will immediately ship you your wallet/rewards!\nTake a peek into just one of the rooms that houses some of the machines that will be used in the production of your wallet:\nJust a few of the many sewing machines available.\nOh yeah, here are a few more.\nOne of the dies used on the pneumatic press for our prototypes.\nHere is the die of our logo and the press used to emboss it.\nBecause of you and your pledge, our future is bright and we plan on continuing to offer the SLIMplistic Wallet online through our website. Once all of your rewards are fulfilled and shipped, we will begin production of our website, MSTRMNDcollective.com.\nStretch Goals\nDon't get us wrong, we're not trying to be cocky, and we'll be ecstatic if we reach our minimum goal... But with a potential opportunity to over-fund our project, we'd love to show our extreme gratitude to our backers. So, as an extra THANK YOU and incentive for you to share our project with your friends and family, everyone who pledges will be eligible to receive these extra rewards!\nStretch Goal: $10,000\nAll pledges receive MSTRMND key chain (up-cycled from your actual wallet!)\nStretch Goal: $15,000\nAll pledges receive a MSTRMND sticker pack (4 stickers)\nStretch Goal: $25,000 - Unlock Color: Kickstarter/Envy Green\nStretch Goal: $30,000 - Unlock Color: Pretty Pink\nStretch Goal: $35,000 - Unlock Color: Bright Blue\nStretch Goal: $40,000 - Unlock Color: Cool White\nStretch Goal: $45,000 - Unlock Color: Rich Red\nThese and more stretch goal Fem-freindly colors to come!\n\nThank you!\nWe\u2019re extremely confident that everything will go off without a hitch and we will keep all of you up-to-date with emails on the status of your SLIMplistic Wallet.

But the fans want an even better, bigger Rebuild. And just like your own personal zombie butler (spoiler??), I am here to serve.\nRebuild 1 was almost a prototype; I used my own stick man art and only released it as a free Flash game. People liked it, so a year later I teamed up with artist EvilKris to make Rebuild 2. It had gorier graphics, deeper characters and more story, and was the first game I sold on iOS and Android where it's known as simply \"Rebuild\".\nStill, fans asked for a third game and filled my inbox and the Rebuild 3 ideas wiki with awesome suggestions. How could I not make a third Rebuild game? They were practically writing it for me! But this time I wanted to make it much more epic than the first two games.\nRebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville will be the first PC downloadable game in the series, released on Steam for Windows and Mac. To give an idea of scale, I've already spent more hours working on it than Rebuild 1 and 2 combined, and it's only half done.

Since most Rebuild fans have only played the free Flash version, will anyone pay for a more fully-featured downloadable Rebuild game? Can I afford to make it truly epic?

We the TESLA team with the incredible fast acting cooperation of KICKSTARTER resolved this takeover today and although the TESLA team is once again firmly in control of this profile the damage has already been done, the campaign is coming to an end and it will not meet its goal. \nI must bear the responsibility for not acting more quickly to resolve this problem, I should have contacted the great folks at Kickstarter much sooner but I was hoping to keep this matter internal and resolve it through good human nature, unfortunately, that did not happen. \nAs was always the case with Nikola Tesla, we the TESLA team WILL NOT GIVE UP! He would not have given up, and neither will we!!! We have regrouped, reorganized and we will be re-launching this campaign again with a more modest goal in hopes that all of you who already donated or are considering to donate will commit to this great project.\nFor those of you who already donated, you won\u2019t be donating again as your funds never left your credit card account the first time since this project did not reach its goal in part due to the sabotage we endured.\nThe re-launching of the project will be soon. We look forward to your ongoing support. And to all of you who supported us the first time and do so again, you will receive a special added bonus official TESLA reward regardless of the pledged amount.  \nBelow we have compiled a brief description of the project and introduction to Nikola Tesla.

Unfortunately we did not retain control of the profile sooner so we could not perform more thorough repairs.\nWe encourage you to visit our new \u201cTESLA\u201d profile COMING SOON.\nYours Truly  \nD. Daniel Vujic  \nProducer-Writer TESLA \nWHO WAS NIKOLA TESLA\nNIKOLA TESLA was an Serbian-American Inventor, visionary and genius, a \u201cFuturist\u201d much like Tony Stark (Iron Man) but unlike him, Tesla really existed, a man who was ahead of his time and perhaps the most prolific Inventor of the 20th century.\nTesla\u2019s name is honored today in many of products one of which is the TESLA CAR. \nTesla was controversial in that he invented and built an energy tower in New York in 1901 (Wardenclyffe Tower) that could emit wireless electrical energy throughout the world for people to use for free, but the invention was suppressed by Governing powers in the US and around the world and today it is still suppressed. Over 700 patents were issued to Tesla worldwide during his lifetime up to his death in 1943. \nFor a world of information on Nikola Tesla click on the Google logo!\nHere are just a dozen of Nikola Tesla's inventions that are widely used around the world today.\nRadio  \nCellular Communication\nWireless Data Transfer (Internet, Wi-Fi and Email)\nWireless Remote Control Devices\nStar Wars Defense System (US Military Air Defense)\nRADAR (the detection of moving objects on land air and sea)\nElectro-Magnetic Motor (electric motors in today\u2019s toys, appliances and power tools)\nFlorescent Light Tube (commercial light and now widely used for domestic light too) \nAC Generator (everyday basic power generator)\nAnd of course, his most famous invention the Alternating Current better known as \u201cAC\u201d it\u2019s what gives the entire world LIGHT & ELECTRICITY. \nTHE PROJECT\nOur plan is to develop \u201cTESLA\u201d into an  motion picture that will depict the life of perhaps one of history\u2019s most under-appreciated inventors, visionaries, geniuses, Nikola Tesla. \nIn considering this film's epic length (140 minutes) and the extensive special visual effects, some of which have never before been seen in motion pictures and saved exclusively for this film, it will take almost 2 years for the film to reach the theater screens around the world, in time for Nikola Tesla\u2019s 159th birthday July 10th 2015.\n2013 has become the year of \u201cTESLA\u201d. There are nearly a dozen Tesla feature films in preparation in the United States, Canada, the UK, Russia, Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia. And countless more documentaries, stage plays, audio-video presentations and special exhibitions dedicated to Tesla around the world. Finally, the world is taking note of the man, who among other things gave us \u201clight\u201d.\nWe cheer all things \u201cTesla\u201d and wish each and every project related to Tesla great fortune and smooth sailing!\nSince Nikola Tesla\u2019s death in 1943, films about him are few and probably the most exciting depiction of Nikola Tesla was in the blockbuster \u201cThe Prestige\u201d although the film was not about him, his role in \u201cThe Prestige\u201d enhanced the film considerably. We aim to complement to that with an equally exciting film dedicated entirely to the subject of Nikola Tesla.\nVisit \"TESLA\" on the Internet Movie Database IMDB click on icon\nThis profile is CLOSED but its not too late to support Tesla the feature film.

Keep Running is Horror. Keep Running is a silly game about friends being chased by very hungry bear...\nAll these cards can (and will!) be yours. If you'd like extra copies of the game, simply add \u00a316 per copy to your pledge.\nDesigned by Sprocket Games' own Michael Fox, it's a quick-playing game based around the apocryphal tale of the two guys being chased by a bear in the woods. One of them briefly pulls up, grabs a pair of running shoes from his backpack and hastily throws them on. \"What are you doing? You'll never outrun it!\" yells the guy who is still moving. \"I don't need to outrun the bear,\" replies the first (who by now has rapidly overtaken his friend) - \"I just need to outrun YOU.\"\nSo, yes. This is the game of that, where players will be able to force and fight their way to the front of the pack, leaving their friends in their wake as The Bear gets ever closer (we've called him Harold, but just because he has a silly name it doesn't mean he's not hungry and terrifying). Each player has a rapidly diminishing hand of cards, one of which must be played every turn. Roll a die to see how fast you're going, but don't forget the modifier on the card you've put down! Some cards allow you to get more in your hand, keeping you in the game longer, while others will let you attack your opponents, pushing them ever closer to that ever-chasing bear. Run out of cards and you're no longer running - you're dinner! \nThere's no room for gentlemanly conduct when a bear is in pursuit.\nWe'll be using the funds raised in our Kickstarter campaign to get Keep Running! produced to the highest possible quality. Here at Sprocket Games, we really want to do our best to keep the whole project in the UK; everything possible will be sourced from providers in this country. This not only supports businesses here, it also means that we can keep an eye on things and deal with any issues that may crop up during the production process in a much quicker period of time (plus we've delivered Fox & Chicken and FrogFlip on time using these suppliers, so we trust them!). With all the cards, dice, instructions and shipping, those funds will be depleted pretty quickly! \nOh yeah. We also have to make bears.\n\"Portrait of the Designer with Harold the Bear\" (2013)\nWe've had a bunch of people ask us about getting add-ons for Keep Running, and after going through some numbers we're now able to offer the items you see above. First of all, if you've been involved in any Sprocket Games project previously you'll be well aware that we love our Button Badges - so we're doing a mini-set for this campaign! Witness the terror inducing Harold the Bear as he scares Pinky and Orange witless! Three badges will set you back \u00a33.\nOur previous campaign, FrogFlip, was a cracking game that really deserves a lot more attention. Not played it? It's the tale of a hungry frog (named Jake E. Bughop by the game's three-year-old co-designer) who is looking to eat as many flies as possible through the medium of flipping a wooden disc. It is awesome, and you can get a copy added to your Keep Running for \u00a35.\nFinally, our most popular request - Card Sleeves! You'll receive enough card sleeves for the whole Keep Running set, whatever level we hit and however many cards are included! Get them added to your package by increasing your total pledge by \u00a35.\nWell, yes. We tried to run a campaign for the game last December, but our dreams were a little too lofty. In response to that, we've worked hard to scale back the game to just four players, but have plans in place to expand it all the way up to eight players if the Kickstarter goes well. This means that we'll be able to create the game for a much lower amount, but the option to add more players will be entirely down to you, our backers. In fact, rather than hiding the numbers, we'll tell you exactly what targets we need to hit in order to add more players right here.\nWe've run games from four players all the way up to eight and are happy that it retains its balance. The base set will come with 68 cards and four dice, and for each additional character that we add to the game, you'll receive extra cards, specific dice in their colours and their own double-sided Flippy Card which represents their current status in the game - it's a terrible name but it seems to have stuck.\nWe've currently reached the point where we can produce a version of Keep Running that can handle eight players - our next target is \u00a34000 which will bring our bonus character, Purple, into the game! This will also mean we get to include some Kickstarter Exclusive cards that will allow Purple to enact sweet revenge upon her frenemies!\nAlso, as you're an intelligent person you'll realise that if all the characters are unlocked we'll be looking at nine of them. Nine? In a game that maxes out at eight players? Well, yeah - Purple is an extra character who you can switch out for any of the other runners to play the game, and if she's unlocked you'll also get extra cards to add to your set. These will be exclusive to backers of the campaign, so you can show off and say that you were there from Day One. We've also got plans beyond the Purple Promo Pack - here's hoping it's a huge success!\nOh, and if you'd like a quick How To Play, here's a video (using the first version of the prototype that doesn't have any art):\nPretty much everything is good to go. The art is done. We have our quotes from the printers and suppliers, so know precisely how much we'll be spending. Assuming everything goes well, we're aiming to get Keep Running! to your tabletop by January 2014, and having now run two successful projects (Fox & Chicken and FrogFlip), we reckon Sprocket Games can be trusted to deliver a quality game in a decent time period.\nYup - we've got a basic Print and Play version of the game available for you to try out for nothing. There's not much art in there - it's the version you see in the How to Play video, and we've got to hold back something... - and you'll have to provide your own dice and a few sheets of paper plus printer ink. It's recommended that you sleeve everything before you play. Click on this here link for the PDF and rules, have a play and let us know what you think in the comments! And if you really like it, consider pledging for the finished product!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project where you're relying on suppliers to deliver, our timescales are dependent on others doing their work. However, we've developed a great relationship with our printer over the last year and know that they do excellent stuff. The fact that they're in the UK also means that any issues can be dealt with in a matter of hours, not days or weeks! Our last project, FrogFlip, is currently shipping to backers worldwide, and we're really looking forward to seeing what people think - we're very pleased that we've managed to deliver it on time and are excited to show it off at Essen Spiel in Germany in late October!\n\nWe've worked hard to build a reputation with our previous games and will do our level best to continue that with Keep Running! - it's been tested thoroughly and we're sure you'll enjoy it. That's why we offer the free PnP version of the game, so you know precisely what you'll be getting before you even pledge.\n\nSprocket Games is only a small company, true, but we're bloody good at what we do.

Also, as a nominee of Hollywood Music in Media Awards, I have a chance to bring this new track with me to the awards show and industry conference this November, and share the limited edition CDs with 250 attendees at the show including leading directors, producers, and composers - as part of my portfolio showing continuous development and new goals in composition.\nI have been working on sketches for \"Legends\" since 2011, and the entire 11-track CD was orchestrated, recorded, and produced between March and August 2013 - thanks to the incredible support of my wonderful backers who not only made it possible but also inspired and advised me throughout the project and helped so much!!! You are welcome to visit our project updates for the complete story of making the CD, - and check out the video for track \"Spellbound Dream\" which helped us get the CD started:\nThe CD includes 11 tracks - \"Prologue\", \"Legends\", \"Merchants of War\", \"The Eastern Gate\", \"The Messenger\", \"Spellbound Dream\", \"Tavern Dance\", \"Northern Star\", \"Haunted\", \"The Storm\", and \"The Last Journey\".\nFrom \"Legends: Fantasy Violin\":\nHollywood Music in Media Awards\nPast nominees and winners include music by Ron Jones (Family Guy, Fox), Hans Zimmer (Inception, Warner Brothers Pictures), Clinton Shorter (District 9, Tristar Pictures), Ramin Djawadi (Medal of Honor, EA), Artie Kornfeld, John Debney, Christopher Young; soundtrack compilations and music supervision for The Muppets, Twilight, Glee,The Incredible Hulk, CSI Miami, Dragon Age: Origins, Iron Man...\nIt is an incredible honor to receive nominations for \"Legends\", \"Spellbound Dream\", and \"The Messenger\"!\nRewards and Timeline\nWhile we ought to set the official delivery month as December (to be safe and to ensure the timely delivery of international rewards) - I am really hoping to have everything shipped to you in November in preparations for Holiday season!\nSome of our rewards are already designed - posters (Legends and Portrait by Bramasta Aji) and the full conductor's score of album's title track:\nTHANK YOU for your support!\nYour support is PRECIOUS - not only because it makes the production possible, but because it conveys incredible inspiration and happiness to me as an artist.

See the Kits section, below.\nMonte Cook Games is thrilled to announce its next big tabletop roleplaying game: The Strange! Written and designed by Bruce Cordell and Monte Cook, The Strange is a game that crosses multiple worlds, called recursions, which player characters can explore and defend. In The Strange, your characters change with each world they travel to, taking on new aspects suited to help them function in that recursion's unique laws and structures. But dangers found in these recursions threaten not only characters, but also our very own Earth. If characters persevere, however, they can not only save themselves and Earth, they may even gain the ability to create a recursion of their own! \nIf you enjoyed the inspiring scope of games like Planescape, Gamma World, or Numenera, or mind-bending scenarios like Moorcock's Eternal Champion series, the TV show Fringe, or movies like the Matrix, you're going to love The Strange.\nWe've assembled a great team to work on The Strange. In addition to Bruce and Monte, the exceptional Shanna Germain will serve as lead editor, and she's developing some amazing concepts both for the game and the presentation of the material. Superstar artist Matt Stawicki serves as the lead artist. He's working with us to create a unique visual look for the setting. But we'd love to see you join the team too, either as a backer, or even a contributor (see the backer levels for more information).\nFor more information, please visit TheStrangeRPG.com. A lot of news about the game can be found there, and much more is coming! And keep checking back for frequent updates and more previews!\nIf you've pledged to a Kickstarter before, there are some aspects to this Kickstarter that are a bit different than others you may have seen. The differences are primarily in the way we are organizing the rewards we're offering, and the way we are handling shipping.\nMany of the rewards for this Kickstarter are grouped together into packages and kits. One of the things we learned from our prior Kickstarter for Numenera is that all the different rewards and add-ons can get confusing, particularly as we reach stretch goals. So the backer levels, all listed on the right-hand side of the page, grant you access to different combinations of packages and kits to help organize your rewards and ensure you get what you want.\nPackages are the way we group the primary rewards of the Kickstarter--the books, mainly. You get these based on the backer level you choose. For example, the \"Real Deal Package\" offers you the main game rulebook in print, which we call the corebook, and a unique character card. The \"All the Ebooks Package,\" on the other hand, offers you the corebook in PDF form, as well as the PDF of the Player's Guide, the PDF of The Dark Spiral adventure, and the PDFs of any books that are offered as stretch goals. Stretch goals may unlock additional packages. Read more about packages below.\nKits are collections of extras The Strange Fan Kit includes items serious fans of the game won't wan to be without. The Strange Player's Kit includes game aids that are great to have around the gaming table. Stretch goals may unlock additional kits, or additional features for these kits. Read more about kits below.\nBoth packages and kits will grow larger and more valuable if we reach the stretch goals we have planned. Plus, entirely new packages and kits will be offered if we reach certain stretch goals. \nLastly, as you're glancing through the backer levels, you'll notice a reference to credit toward shipping. We're doing shipping differently for this Kickstarter--rather than dictating to you the shipping method we'll use, we're putting that decision in your hands. When the products are ready to ship next year, you'll be able to give us your current address and tell us how you'd like us to ship your stuff. If your package or kit gives you a credit toward shipping, you can apply that to the cost of your preferred shipping method. If you're in the US your shipping credit is designed to cover the entire cost of basic shipping--so shipping will be free. But we're giving you the flexibility of upgrading, at the time of shipment, to faster or more trackable shipping options and apply the credit toward that cost. Read more about shipping below or on The Strange website.\nThe Strange is a cosmos-sized artifact built in the afterglow of the Big Bang. The original alien builders lost control of it eons ago, but their dark energy network remains \"beneath\" our universe. For those on Earth who've discovered it, everything is different. These select few know that the Strange hosts recursions: unique but limited worlds with their own laws of science and even magic, seeded into the network by the creative resonance of pure imagination, but still nonetheless very real. Thus, the Strange is a place where fictional worlds become realities of their own. One prominent recursion, Ardeyn, is a land of extravagant sorcery, imprisoned devils, and lost gods. Another, called Ruk, has hidden in Earth's shadow since before humanity evolved, populated by creatures that were never human, born of the fiction of somewhere else. And those are just a few of the hundreds of recursions that speckle the dark energy web around Earth. Each recursion is a place of wonder, but each risks drawing the attention of vast entities that scuttle through the primordial reaches of the Strange like bloated spiders on a web: voracious planetovores that eat worlds, recursions and prime worlds (such as Earth) alike. Many PCs are going to want to champion one or more these worlds to defend them against these horrific threats.\nThe game system that drives The Strange is the same one used by Numenera, which means it's fast-moving and streamlined, facilitating the stories the group wants to create, the imaginative places and creatures the GM needs to share, and the amazing ideas encouraged by exploring the Strange. If you're familiar with Numenera's game system\u2014referred to as the Cypher System\u2014you already know how to play The Strange. \nIf you're not familiar with it, that's okay too. The Strange is a stand-alone game. Character generation is fast and fun, because you create a sentence based on the choices you make: I'm a Clever Vector who Wields Two Weapons at Once. I'm a Strong-Willed Spinner Who Utters Words of Power. And so on. Each part of that statement helps determine your stats and abilities. \nAn experienced player will find a whole new wrinkle, however, as her character's focus (the third part of that statement) actually changes based on which world she visits. A single adventure may span many different recursions, so through the course of the game, a character will change and adopt new aspects and abilities to deal with the challenges she faces.\nWhile the Strange could potentially be host to a multitude of recursions, we focus primarily on two--Ardeyn and Ruk--in addition to the prime world of Earth, because they are the most prominent and the first two discovered by humans. As your characters explore the Strange, they may find many more. GMs will be able to add their favorite fictional settings, brand new recursions of their own creation, or even past campaign worlds from other RPGs to help populate the Strange. The possibilities are endless!\nOn Earth (and by that, we mean modern-day Earth), The Strange is an RPG of espionage, intrigue, and sometimes horror (particularly when creatures from recursions come to our world). Characters become involved with organizations like the Quiet Cabal, whose members are invested in the Strange and aided by mysterious backers; the September Project, which may have a link to a monstrously powerful figure in Ardeyn called the Betrayer; or any number of additional secretive groups that have interest in or knowledge of the Strange. Earth is a prime world, a hub of information and secrets. If you control a prime world, you control its recursions. Most new PCs in The Strange will start on Earth. \nArdeyn is a world of magic and monsters, created by humans on Earth and nested--only recently--in the Strange. Despite its genesis as a fictional world, Ardeyn has become a real place, with real inhabitants and and all too real sorcery. The denizens of Ardeyn wield mystic blades sheathed in living souls, use the dead to guard an imprisoned god, and ride incredible flying dlamma. Not all Ardeynians are human, either. The qephilim are tall, dark, angular-faced creatures with varying innate connections to the magic of their realm. It is known as Ardeyn, the Land of the Curse, and Lotan's Prison.\nRuk is an unimaginably ancient artificial construct that traveled through the Strange. While on the run from the horrific planetovores, it \"ran aground\" in the shoals of the Strange around Earth, long before humanity evolved. \n\nRuk can be thought of as part alien world and part cosmic shipwreck. The inhabitants are masters of biotechnology to the point where they shape and reshape their bodies as needed and--as we are just now discovering--they have been coming to Earth for millennia in human form for some mysterious purposes. The inhabitants of Ruk are not a unified group, and not all of them are humanity's friends.\nThe Strange corebook will be a 416-page, full-color hardcover book done in the highly beautiful, art-heavy style of Numenera (although with its own sensibilities, of course). The two books will look very nice on your shelf together. The Strange corebook will include the rules of the game, character creation information, the details of the very unique setting, some creatures and NPCs, some GMing advice, a double-sided full-color poster map, and even an adventure to get you started.\nThe Strange Player's Guide will be a 96-page full-color softcover book that collects all the character creation information from the corebook, plus an overview of the setting. This book is intended for players.\nThe Dark Spiral will be a 96-page full-color softcover book that contains a number of linked scenarios which take characters from Earth to both Ruk and Ardeyn, as well as into other minor recursions. This book is intended for GMs.\nThe Bestiary will be a 160-page full-color hardcover book chock full of creatures native to Ruk, Ardeyn, and the Strange itself.\nStrange Recursions will be a 160-page full-color hardcover book with additional detail on Ardeyn, Ruk, and other recursions.\nCharacter Options will be a 96-page full-color softcover book chock full of interesting options for characters from Earth, Ruk, Ardeyn, and possibly other recursions as well.\nThe Strange Compendium will be a 160-page hardcover book covering new Ruk tech, Ardeyn magic, Earth gear, and items and cyphers from other recursions and the Strange itself.\nMore Strange Adventures (working title) will be a 96-page full-color softcover book with several Strange adventures.\nThe deluxe corebook is identical in content to the standard corebook, but will be a leather-bound, gilt-edged edition with a cloth bookmark, special endpapers, and extra color plates. This will be a Kickstarter exclusive, with few if any copies available by any other means.\nIf you've seen the Numenera corebook, the Player's Guide, or The Devil's Spine adventure, you know these books will be beautiful. Numenera fans will find The Strange products to be excellent companions to their books, with new descriptors, types, foci, creatures, and more that they can use (the rules for the two games will be entirely compatible).\nCheck out the many reward levels we're offering on the right-hand side of this page. You'll notice that many of The Strange rewards come in packages to make them easier to understand. The contents of these packages are described below. Further, should we reach our goal and proceed to stretch goals that add additional rewards, these rewards will be added to the appropriate package, expanding the packages greatly with no additional cost to you!\nAll the Ebooks Package: You receive all the PDFs funded by this campaign. Plus, your name goes in The Strange corebook, listed by contributor level.\nThe Real Deal Package: You receive The Strange corebook in print. You receive a unique character usable in the game keyed to the world that you choose to ally with in the How Strange Are You? Quiz. Plus, your name goes in The Strange corebook, listed by contributor level. You also receive a $10 credit toward the cost of shipping.\nAll the Print Books Package: This includes all the print books funded by this campaign. You receive a unique character usable in the game keyed to the world that you choose to ally with in the How Strange Are You? Quiz. Plus, your name goes in The Strange corebook, listed by contributor level. With this package, each print book carries a credit toward shipping (the corebook shipping credit is $10, the Player's Guide shipping credit is $5, and The Dark Spiral shipping credit is $5, the Bestiary is $10, Strange Recursions is $10, Character Options is $10, Strange Compendium is $10, More Strange Adventures is $5, and other books provided by stretch goals will have their own).\nKits are like packages, but they are add-ons that can be added on to any pledge. (They are also included in a few backer levels.) To start with, we have one kit, The Strange Fan Kit. More kits may be created by future stretch goals!\nThe Strange Fan Kit: This kit includes an exclusive, numbered, deluxe bookplate hand-signed by both designers, Monte Cook and Bruce Cordell. Further, they will personalize it as you request (subject to some restrictions on length and content). The kit also includes an 8.5-inch by 11-inch art print of the cover of The Strange corebook cover art signed by concept artist Matt Stawicki, a backer certificate in your name signed by Bruce and Monte, a 22-inch by 33-inch (approximately) double-sided poster map (an extra copy of the map in the corebook), and four stickers. More might be added to the kit if we reach upcoming stretch goals. Shipping of The Strange Fan Kit is free.\nThe Strange Player Kit: This add-on is the perfect player's companion to The Strange game. It includes a set of custom Strange dice, specially marked for use with the game, along with a Strange notebook, a Strange T-shirt, an XP deck, and a custom playmat that's perfect for this players-roll-all-the-dice game, a pad of 25 character sheets, a folder for keeping your character and game notes in, a mechanical pencil, and a bookbag to carry your corebook and other goods to and from the game. Like The Strange Fan Kit, we may add content to this kit if we hit future stretch goals. Shipping of The Strange Player Kit is free.\nAdd-Ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level by increasing the amount of your pledge. You'll be able to check your pledge and designate which add-ons you want after the Kickstarter campaign is over.\n$8 Cypher Deck in PDF. Generate cyphers quickly and easily on the fly with this 120-card deck.\n$8 Creature Deck in PDF.

In addition to the 100+ card physical deck, you also receive the PDF.\n$25 Autographed Bookplate. This adhesive bookplate will fit nicely into your corebook. It is individually hand-signed by both Monte Cook and Bruce Cordell, designers of The Strange.\n$50 The Strange Fan Kit. This kit includes an exclusive, signed, numbered, and personalized bookplate, an 8.5-inch by 11-inch art print of the cover of The Strange corebook, a double-sided poster map (an extra copy of the map in the corebook), and 4 stickers. Free shipping is included.\n$60 The Strange Player's Kit. This kit includes a set of custom Strange dice, a Strange notebook, an XP Deck, a Strange T-shirt, and a custom playmat. Free shipping is included.\n$20 The Strange Player's Guide in print. Along with the book, you receive a $5 credit toward shipping.\n$25 The Dark Spiral in print.

Along with the book, you receive a $10 credit toward shipping.\n$25 Character Options in print. Along with the book, you receive a $10 credit toward shipping.\n$60 The Strange corebook in print. Along with the book, you receive a $10 credit toward shipping.\n$60 The Strange print corebook upgrade to deluxe. Applicable only to rewards that include a print corebook. You will receive a deluxe corebook instead of a standard print corebook.\n$120 The Strange deluxe corebook. This is the deluxe version in addition to your regular rewards (as opposed to an upgrade that replaces your print corebook). Along with the book, you receive a $10 credit toward shipping.\nAs mentioned above, we're doing shipping a bit differently. Instead of locking you into a single shipping method of our choosing, we\u2019re giving you some options. We\u2019re doing this by including a shipping allowance with most of our physical rewards. For example, if you are getting the Real Deal Package, you'll get a $10 credit to shipping.\nWe've designed this allowance to cover the cost of basic shipping in the United States, which will cost $10 or less. Thus, if that's what you want, you shouldn't have to pay a penny more.\nBut you aren't limited to that option. When it\u2019s time to ship your rewards, we\u2019ll ask you how you want yours shipped. You can choose a faster or more trackable method, but it will probably cost more. If your shipping allowance doesn\u2019t cover it, you can pay the difference at that time.\nInternational backers will have the same options, but the final cost of even basic shipping will probably require some additional payment. (That's why we don't have any special, more expensive rewards levels for overseas backers, or require any additional payment at this time.) But just like domestic backers, international backers apply their shipping credit to the cost of their shipping, reducing it accordingly. And just like domestic backers, international backers will have the choice to use an expedited method.\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how much shipping will cost\u2014shipping rates change, we may gain some efficiencies that save us money, and it can vary dramatically by destination, shipping method, and how many rewards you\u2019re getting. Rest assured, since we're paying a portion of everyone's shipping ourselves, we're going to try to get the best rates.\nAnd here's an extra bonus: If shipping your reward costs less than your shipping allowance (which is likely for US backers choosing basic shipping), we'll apply the surplus as a credit to purchases from the Monte Cook Games online store, so you can get even more cool stuff if you'd like.\nYou'll choose your shipping method in the weeks just prior to the delivery of your rewards.\nAlthough the estimated delivery date is listed as August 2014, it is our intention that Kickstarter backers will receive their copies of The Strange corebook and The Strange Player's Guide before they are generally available elsewhere (this includes retailers that are backers of the Kickstarter, who will, of course, be able to sell the books as soon as they arrive). Having recently fulfilled the Numenera Kickstarter--the largest, most complex RPG Kickstarter campaign yet fulfilled--we have the expertise to handle shipping quickly and efficiently.\nAs a final note, please be aware that while the estimated delivery date listed on each backer level is based on The Strange corebook, some rewards may come earlier, and some--such as The Dark Spiral and certain stretch goal products--will come later.\nFor additional information about shipping, visit the Kickstarter section of our website.\nWe are very excited about this project, and we hope that you'll join us in making it a reality. With your support, we'll all have an amazing new game to play next year! \nSpecial thanks to artists Matt Stawicki, Reece E. Ambrose (Epic Realities & Graphics Corporation) and Lee Smith for their gorgeous images and graphics. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe chose to Kickstart this project at its very earliest stages to enable backers to get involved in the playtest and be in \"on the ground floor\" of The Strange. That means, of course, that the product is not created yet. That's our biggest challenge. But as we showed with Numenera, creating a fantastic game book is what we do best.\n\nIf The Strange Kickstarter gets big, fulfillment is also a challenge, of course. We learned so much with Numenera (the largest RPG Kickstarter, by far, ever to reach the fulfillment stage), however, that we feel that literally no one knows how to do that better than we do. Although we experienced setbacks as we blazed a trail with Numenera, we overcame all them to deliver the vast majority of products on time to delighted backers. And shipments of later products (such as the recently-fulfilled The Devil's Spine) have gone almost flawlessly. \n\nLastly, if a meteor hit Seattle and killed the entire creative team in one fell swoop, that would also be a setback.

Being huge fans of the sci-fi genre, we wondered why spaceships feel so empty? What\u2019s missing? Looking back to all the TV and Movies that inspired us, like Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica or Firefly, we realised games are missing something integral: a crew. A ship without a crew feels hollow and meaningless, so we\u2019ve taken space travel to the next level. The dangers of space should not only test your metal, but your flesh.\nWe wanted to make a game where you\u2019re not a solid, singular object in a sky-box; you are a captain in an evolving, dynamic ship that hundreds of people call home. They adapt to you, and grow with you as you fight alongside them, and if you suffer losses, you\u2019ll feel the loss that comes with that.\nThat\u2019s where the drama is, that\u2019s where the story happens, and it\u2019s the interacting with people on the deck that makes this a complete experience.\nWe want to create a complete sci-fi RPG experience.\nWe want to explore the war-torn depths of space, engage in political intrigue, lead troops on the deck of a ship, command a fleet from the bridge, and sate our thirsts for glory \u2013 and we want you to join us.\nFor the first time in a game of this type, players will be able to board vessels taking the combat into an RTS environment whilst your friends still fight from their ships in space.\nAs the captain of a ship, you\u2019ll lead your men through battles, boarding operations, and space exploration through a hierarchy of officers, selected and honed by you.\nYou\u2019ll explore your vessel isometrically, discovering the inner workings and day to day life of the officers and crew who serve under you. Invite dignitaries to your chamber, or defend your vessel from attack on foot (in the style of Jagged Alliance, X Com.)\nAs you lead your men to victory, yourself and officers who survive will have access to upgrades and talents, affecting gameplay and offering new tactical opportunities. Make the wrong decision, and expect to lose your officer for good with our rogue-like chain of command.\nConcept for ingame Bridge view\nBattles from space are orchestrated from the classical perspective (Star Trek Online, Klingon Academy, Freelancer, etc.) Whilst in this view, your crew will take their battle stations within the ship, affected by hazards \u2013 even being sucked out of a hull breach. Whatever happens outside of the vessel, affects those within it.\nBoarding operations allow you to isometrically zoom in on your units, or zoom out into Space Battle View at your disclosure. Fight the war on two fronts. Battle in the style of games like Men of War at the same time as fighting battles reminiscent of Klingon Academy.\nTrust your crew? Allow them to fight autonomously, and deal with the ships hands on.\nConcept for ingame boarding\nOur modular design will allow you to build your ships (link to Ship designer) and space station to fit your play style. With thousands of combinations, and the potential for thousands more over the period of the campaign and launch, it\u2019s possible to create something completely unique.\nChange the design for tactical, defensive, and strategic capabilities \u2013 skin, colour, and mix-and-match to your heart\u2019s desire. \nThe Mandate is a sandbox RPG (similarities with Pirates! And Mount and Blade), allowing you to travel the galaxy through a series of jump-gates, opening doors to new systems.\nIf you or your friends are in trouble, instantly jump to their location from outside of the game using Steam.\nEach system of the universe offers a series of procedurally generated content which varies every time, as well as hand-crafted story-driven content for you to take advantage of. What you do in The Mandate is entirely up to you, but as you gain power and unlock more systems, you\u2019ll drive the story forward.\nWith new factions to be found in each sector, and Starbases to be scavenged, looted, and built, watch your empire grow as you conquer and explore the depths of space, where new quests and unexplored territories will reward the most experienced of captains.\nAt its core, that\u2019s The Mandate \u2013 a fantastical space RPG about betrayal, scavenging, exploration, combat, and honor. These elements are eloquently wrapped in an all-original history and lore, waiting to be discovered.\nWith both iterative and entirely unique mechanics and concepts, we\u2019ve been inspired by franchises such as X Com for our upgrading system, Fallout for scavenging and survival, Battlestar Galactica for the sense of home and community, crewmanship, Star Trek Online and Klingon Academy for space battles, and Jagged Alliance or Men of War for RTS style boarding operations. We\u2019re taking the best of what was, and reinstating the old-school \u2013 and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re doing it right.\nWe've written 1500 years of history. It's up to you to write the future. The explorable reaches of space mix hand-crafted and procedurally generated content and is packed with historically relevant easter-eggs offering insight into the Mandate's rich lore.\nEach level of the game, from the political tier of warring empires, through the strategic level of individual star systems and naval battles, down to personal interactions with other characters impacts on how your story develops.\nThe decisions you make in Mandate affect the world around you, and your crew. Every action has a consequence, and as you push your ship to the farthest reaches of the universe, diplomacy, and morality are pushed with it.\nAffect the world with your actions, not with your words. The Mandate will not be challenged with a dialogue wheel.\nIn the far future, mankind has abandoned the exhausted, dying world of Earth and gone on to colonize hundreds more worlds. These colonies were united under the rules of the Imperial Mandate, and linked by faster-than-light travel gates. As civilization continued to expand, corruption within the Mandate and dissent in the outer systems fomented a rebellion against Imperial rule.\nThe untimely death of the last Emperor gave the rebels their opportunity. The military was recalled to his state funeral and the investiture of his successor - a young and inexperienced Empress who took the throne with limited political support. Seizing the moment, the outer systems declared their intention to break away from the Mandate.\nThe Empress dispatched the Grand Fleet to restore order, but saboteurs redirected the travel gates, and the fleet ended up scattered across the galaxy. The Empress was left vulnerable without the protection of her navy.\nDesperate times called for desperate measures. The Empress founded the Corsairs, a new fleet captained by disgraced ex-Mandate officers jailed for breaching the Articles of War. Reinstated under the promise of redemption, these veterans are the last hope of the Mandate. You are a member of the Corsairs. With a small ship, you must move swiftly and make your way to the far reaches of Mandate space. Your mission - to discover the fate of the Grand Fleet and restore order to the outer systems.\nThere was a time when gaming wasn\u2019t about running through a corridor, firing off rounds into hordes of enemies. There are hundreds of mechanically magnificent titles out there on PC, and hundreds of teams equipped to make them. The only reason they\u2019ve declined is that they don\u2019t sell as well as something you\u2019d find on the consoles. We want to change that, and we have the knowledge to do so.\nThe Mandate is an ambitious title, but we are tackling each of the core elements with equal attention. By making each gear in the mechanism function correctly and optimally, our end result will be something mechanically interesting, with a lot of depth.\nWe\u2019ve taken inspiration from some of the finest strategy and RPG titles from past and present; working iteratively with their ideas and concepts. These are ideas that have worked in the past, but unfortunately declined with the changing PC gaming demographic. We know you\u2019re out there, and we\u2019re bringing them back. With tried and tested game mechanics, and some completely original ones, all it takes is the knowledge to bring them together \u2013 hard-earned knowledge that our team members have gained through years of games industry experience.\n\u2022 The ships of The Mandate are modular designs, allowing us - and you - to manually mix and match various parts, or to randomly generate any number of designs for the game world.\n\u2022 One of the themes of The Mandate is that ships are home to many of the world\u2019s inhabitants. Space stations and ships will be our cities. They are naturally much smaller than lunar structures \u2013 however, there will be many of them.\n\u2022 Whilst much of space in The Mandate is hand crafted, there are also procedurally generated areas to keep things fresh and offer replayability and interesting battle options in multiplayer. This allows us to offload some of the work to a complex world building algorithm.\n\u2022 Most importantly, we have experience building massive worlds. Many of our team hail from some of the most successful MMO projects ever created.\n\u2022 We\u2019re careful \u2013 using several middlewares to streamline development and reduce risk, increase efficiency, and most importantly, avoid wasting time. Unity3D is a great tool for this.\nCreating a new RPG world isn\u2019t easy, what have you done differently?\nThe biggest mistake a storyteller can make in gaming is to believe they are writing the future. The future is up to you: the gamers. Because of this, we\u2019ve taken the time to do a lot of research into building a believable past. We believe the story to be so important to The Mandate, that we\u2019ve written 1500 years of history based on Tsarist Russian lore and history. What if the Tsars ruled space?\nThe Mandate is part alternative-history, part fantasy. You\u2019ll be writing the future in The Mandate, it\u2019s simply our job to provide you with the context. Throughout our kickstarter period, you\u2019ll be introduced to our characters, how they\u2019re designed, their names, and their pasts. Even you, the player, will be able to choose your path from families dating back to the Tsarist period. The world of The Mandate did not happen spontaneously \u2013 there are reasons for the way that it is, and throughout this campaign and the games launch day, you\u2019ll enjoy exposition and story updates offering insight into our rich new world.\nWe are an international team: Canada, USA, Sweden, Norway, UK, France, Slovakia.\nWe are a team of veteran developers who decided to go Indie together and come from different game developers each with their own strengths [ex-EA, ex-2K Games, ex-Ubisoft, ex-Funcom]. Previously we have worked on and shipped both singleplayer, multiplayer and MMO AAA productions with team size ranging from 30 to 200\nSome of the titles we have worked on and shipped include: Assassin's Creed 1&2, Mafia 2, Alan Wake, FarCry 2&3, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures,Call of Duty 3, Splinter Cell, Planet of the Apes, Saga of Ryzom, FIFA ONLINE, FarCry Evolution, Rainbow 6 Vegas, The Secret World and more.\nPlease refer to the FAQ for full team statement. Portfolio links:\nGarret (Art Director)\nVegard (Tech Director)\nWe are big fans of sci-fi, be it video games or series like Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Babylon 5 or Firefly. We are CRPG players and some of our favourites are Fallout, Baldur's Gate, The Witcher, Gothic, but we also remember classics like Ultima 7 or Microprose's Darklands. We are strategy players and have fond memories of the original X-Com, Carrier Command, Jagged Alliance and more! We love pen & paper tabletop: D&D, Pathfinder, Deathwatch, Traveller, Shadow Run and more! And also we are board game geeks: Warhammer, Warmachines.\nWe plan on taking all our inspirations, hobbies and diverse development experiences to ensure we deliver a game you will want to play for many hours both alone in dark space and together with your captain friends.\nTier reward information can be found here.\nCLICK HERE for digital add-ons. If you wish to pick a digital add-on simply increase your pledge by the corresponding amount. E.g. if you wish to name a marine ($25) and get the base game with soundtrack ($20) then you would pledge $45 in total and pick the $20 reward tier. After Kickstarter is over, we will transfer your unused credits over to BackerKit where you can spend them on digital add-ons. \nKickstarter is the preferred backing avenue but if you for some reason cannot use Kickstarter, then you can visit our PayPal store.\nReward tiers that grant extra copies [so $150 and above] also include the Cossack Captain tier (alpha, beta, season pass etc) for each extra copy.\nWe have put a lot of thought into thinking about fairness \u2013 especially when it comes to games and their PR and marketing teams. For this reason, to say thank you for your vote of confidence reflected in your pledge amount, we are putting our entire marketing team in the darkest airlock on-ship.\nThey have each been issued a \u201cFairness Directive\u201d, a set of rules they have to follow to make sure there is a coherent and direct flow of information between you and the developers. They have been ordered to be firm, frank, and fair.\nRewards are certainly mentioned in the Fairness Directive, and we will not be selling alpha or beta access at inflated prices. We believe access to the game should be included in the relevant pledge tiers, and we should not profit from your willingness to provide feedback. You are part of the team, and we respect you.\nTherefore, as the pledge tiers scale, you\u2019ll see access to exclusive content that we consider real value for money. Many of these will not be sold separately, and you will not see some of them sold on Steam. They are a thank-you for your continued feedback and support, and there is some exciting stuff such as the Season Pass (access to the first expansion pack and content updates), and access to all early builds of the game (pre-alpha).\nAs you continue to browse the tier pledge rewards, you will even get a chance to completely change the game, and leave a permanent mark on the world of The Mandate. \nRemember, any breach of the Fairness Directive will result in a swift ejection through the airlock, replacing the guilty party with a robotic AI (they are cheaper to feed, anyway).\nAs the Empress placed her trust in the Corsairs securing her a grand victory, your trust is well placed in us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUPDATE\nSome backers have asked to see a clearer cost breakdown. We will not be providing a \u201ccake diagram\u201d as we believe that gives a false sense of security. Instead we have put together a development timeline to illustrate the allocation of manpower for the different stages of development. Keep in mind we are on Indie salaries. The Kickstarter campaign will cover the positions outlined and some devs are prepared to work for free as an additional buffer.\n\nhttp://ships.mandategame.com/images/20131015_KS_dev_budget.png\n\n\u201cWe are taking the pre-production process very seriously indeed. The combat prototype has been in development for almost a year, and only a subset of it is shown in the ship designer. We will get back to this in more detail later in the campaign. \n\n\nPre-production features a skeleton size unit of full-time staff. Other staff are kept informed of creative decisions and when their roles will be needed once production starts. This saves time, money and allows the skeleton team to focus their efforts. Once the production tools are ready, we will ramp up and assign additional full-time staff to their positions. Additionally, we have no big corporate HQ and minimal expenses. Our producer does not have a driving license and as such expenses for company cars will be minimal... (but we might buy him a bike!)\n\nWe are economically efficient, utilizing resources (such as your pledge money) in the best ways possible. We do contingency planning and set aside buffer time to have a reserve. We have funded the prototype so far with side-income and by working late nights.\n\nOur staff understands our budget limitations and the implications for roadmaps and scheduling. We will only hire for position X when it is necessary -not before, and since we have access to a large network of game industry professionals this simplifies the recruitment process. Because we have a clear focus we do not need to give people a task to do merely because they are sitting around. This would be inefficient and wasteful. We will not have Day1 DLCs for the Mandate, and our focus is on delivering the best possible experience at launch to everybody who buys the game. Proper content updates and expansion packs will be planned before launch but developed after based on input from the community, particularly the Kickstarter donors who are our bosses.\n\n\nOn the technological side, Unity3D (the game\u2019s engine) comes with a working world editor, a build system for creating versions of the game, and the ability to deploy to multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and Mac. It has its own eco-system with 3rd party plugins which we purchase for a reasonable price and can use in our project. This saves us time and allows us to do things like push the visual fidelity with one example being TC Particles which allow GPU accelerated DX11 particles. Check out the ship designer and study the impact effect on the shields. It just looks awesome. TC Particles is just one example and we have other bigger plugins or middelware available to us as well like a stable, tried and tested network engine which we have already gained valuable experience with. This greatly reduces the time and effort needed beyond integration, bugfixing and maintenance. \n\nOur team has half a century of game development experience between us, including major MMOs. This is a much smaller project than an MMO, which traditionally demands very capable content production tools. We are taking our combined knowledge and experience to setup and structure efficient workflows and production pipelines. This includes decoupling dependencies between art, code and design to minimize the amount of wait-time and avoid blockers. \n\nMiddleware is the key and we would prefer to license something which has been tried and tested rather than reinventing the wheel. This frees us up to focus on the game and avoid unnecessary distractions. At the moment, we are evaluating several character creation middleware tools which will make the process of setting up characters a breeze for the artists. At the same time players will have access to extensive character customization options. A common theme for both art and game design is to apply a modular and reusable approach. On the art side the procedural textures are an excellent example and if you have tested our ship designer, you will appreciate the versatility it provides even at this early stage. On the design side we are heavily data-driven: our tools must support major changes to content without requiring the involvement of programmers, which would create unwanted dependencies and blockers. \n\nOne final point to make, if you inspect our reward tiers you will see that we do not have any physical rewards. This means we do not divert Kickstarter funds to produce physical goods and instead we can use the funds to fully realize the actual game. To compensate for this we are providing what we believe are fair reward tiers where backers even at lower tiers get to put their mark on the game. Higher tier rewards are bundled with additional copies of the game so backers can split the cost among friends.\n\n\nStill, we understand that some backers would prefer physical copies and merchandise and here is a promise:\n\n\nOnce our funding goals are reached, we will add physical reward tiers and outsource the production and shipping to our backers who will pay for only production and shipping. If people want t-shirts made we will supply the graphics to make your own t-shirts or other merchandise. We will not make a dime off of you ordering that set of China with the Empress Anastasia on it that you always wanted. We are game developers -not Manchester United! \n\n\nTo summarize: we have the necessary know-how, experience and technology, and our overhead is minimal. The Mandate is the love child of some very experienced game developers who all want to see this project succeed. We are doing smart things with smart technology and will pick the right tools for the job to optimize the work-load and streamline our production pipelines and workflows. This allows us to produce content in modular blocks which is more efficient and allows us to reuse, thereby saving time. \n\nSo could everyone and their grandma make The Mandate for $500,000? Probably not. Can we? Hell yes we can.\u201d\n\nRemember: One rule, no quarter. With efficiency, a driven vision, and a careful understanding of what made traditional strategy games and RPGs so great, The Mandate will delve deep into mechanics of old, iterating and improving on them, ultimately delivering a vast and unique RPG experience.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "Latest community Update", "update_content": "Dear backers,\nIn March we went through difficult times, the team size was reduced to only a core team since January, as consequence of the still ongoing negotiations with our publisher about the remaining funding.

Discovery of an ancient Martian radio signal known as the Aeon Wave leads to the development of advanced technology known as Aeontech. The shift of technological power topples governments and gives rise to the megacorps that wage a silent war over the remaining priceless secrets held within the Aeon Wave. Fueled by the greed of the megacorps, humanity finds itself on a path of ecological and economic destruction that points to extinction in 200 years. In the city of New Tianjin, freelancers ride the razor\u2019s edge between the megacorps as they fight for power, wealth, anarchy, or to save humanity from the fate portended by the Aeon Wave.\nAeon Wave Color Cover Draft by Kurt Komoda\nWhat Is Aeon Wave?\nAeon Wave is a cyberpunk themed scenario for Fate Core. It will be released as a PDF (currently estimated at 50 pages) with a full-color cover by Kurt Komoda, editing by Amanda Valentine, and graphic design by Erik Nowak.\nAeon Wave's unique story is based on the themes of great cyberpunk and science fiction stories such as Blade Runner, Neuromancer, Snow Crash, AI, and Altered Carbon. Aeon Wave is designed to be run as a single session adventure or short campaign with little to no preparation ahead of time. The scenario includes all the tools the GM and players need to play the game including the scenario summary, locations, non-playing characters, a player's guide, player handouts, and pregenerated player characters. The scenario also includes enough information to develop new PCs and expand the scenario out into a short multi-session campaign.\nWhere Your Money Is Going\nAeon Wave has been already written and has gone through playtesting. The money from this Kickstarter will fund artwork, editing, and page design.\nArtwork: Kurt Komoda, the artist for Fate Core as well as numerous other RPG products, will develop a full color cover for Aeon Wave. If we meet our stretch goals, he will develop black and white internal art as well.\nEditing: Amanda Valentine, the editor of Fate Accelerated and many other Fate-based products, will edit the product and ensure it fits well in the wide range of existing Fate material.\nPage Design: Erik Nowak, the page designer behind The Lazy Dungeon Master and other RPG works, will ensure the Aeon Wave PDF looks awesome and fits well with the theme.\nReleased in the Creative Commons with an Open Gaming License.\nLike Fate Core, the text of Aeon Wave will be released under both a Creative Commons and Open Gaming License. This will let you extend and modify Aeon Wave any way you wish without having to worry about licensing agreements. Aeon Wave is intended to be a project that expands our community and gives freedom and value to game masters and Fate designers who love the cyberpunk genre.\nDownload A Sample\nYou can download a Kickstarter sample of Aeon Wave that gives you an idea of what sorts of things you'll find in the final scenario. Keep in mind this version doesn't include the page design, artwork, and editing of the final version \u2013 that's what your backing pays for!\nDiscounted Print Version\nIf you select the $12 ebook package, you will get a link to purchase the discounted print version from RPGNow. I expect the price to be no more than $5 plus shipping, a steep discount from the $10 it will go for when the Kickstarter is complete!\nStretch Goals\n$1,500 Additional Art (REACHED!): If we reach $1,500 in funding, we will commission four pieces of internal artwork by Kurt Komoda. This artwork will depict some of the characters and locations the PCs will encounter in the scenario.\n$2,000 Improved Character Sheet Design & a .mobi Ebook: If we reach $2,000, Erik Nowak will design improved versions of the character sheets to better fit the cyberpunk / science fiction theme of Aeon Wave. We will also add a .mobi version of Aeon Wave to the ebook package so you can import it directly onto your Kindle!\n$2,500 More Art: At $2,500, we will include four additional pieces of art used for player handouts and to further fill in the city of New Tainjin!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince the scenario itself is already written, backers at $7 and above will definitely receive a copy of the scenario.

Battle sea-beasts, pirates, sentient coral. Explore a map that changes every time you play. Discover islands. Establish staging posts. Win fame as a navigator. Learn the stories of your crew: assist them, seduce them or consume them as you see fit.\nSunless Sea is a game of exploration, survival and loneliness set in the award-winning Victorian Gothic universe of Fallen London. Take the helm of your customised steamship and set sail for the unknown! Light and darkness are your greatest allies, but a stout set of cannon and a gunnery officer with a grudge will come in useful too.\nAnd Sunless Sea is a game of stories; the dark pasts of your crew, the hidden coves of the soul-smugglers, the tentacled nemesis that you chased from Hunter\u2019s Keep to the shores of the Elder Continent. \nGameplay concept\nYour choices will determine the events of every game. Will you return to Fallen London with a hold full of loot or succumb to madness and cannibalism on the black waters? Will you free the colonies of the Carnelian Coast, or keep them in the Empire\u2019s grip? Will you betray your father\u2019s legacy or reclaim it?\nYou are the captain. It\u2019s your call.\nOur influences! ... FTL; Don't Starve; Strange Adventures in Infinite Space; Sid Meier\u2019s Pirates; Taipan; Elite; roguelikes; the Crimson Permanent Assurance; the Irish immrama myths.\n\"Thirty years ago, London was stolen. Now it rests on the shore of the Unterzee, that old dark ocean under the world. Hell is close, immortality is cheap, and the screaming has largely stopped. Steamships ply all the wild black zee, between the Iron Republic and the Elder Continent, between Hunter's Keep and the Travertine Spiral and the Dawn Machine. Welcome. Delicious friend.\"\nSunless Sea is set in the same universe as Fallen London, our award-winning browser game. Fallen London (formerly Echo Bazaar) is a dark and hilarious Victorian-Gothic underworld, where every choice has a consequence, from the style of your hat to the price of your soul. \n\u201cSuperlative... every bit as vividly drawn as the worlds built by Rockstar in Red Dead Redemption, or Irrational in Bioshock, or Supergiant in Bastion.\u201d -Tom Chick\n\u201cDripping with lore, obscure and refreshingly odd... the word-forging and world-building are quite brilliant.\u201d - Rock, Paper, Shotgun \n\u201cA complex web of short stories and deliciously moist slices of fiction.\u201d - PC Gamer\n\"This is hands-down one of the best browser games we've ever played.\" - Gamezebo\nSunless Sea will combine the choice-based storytelling style of Fallen London with real-time exploration of a dark and threatening ocean. \nChoose your ship, name your captain, and leave the bustle of the docks for the wild and lightless depths of the Unterzee. Some areas, like Fallen London itself, are fixed and will always appear where you expect them. But once you get beyond the trade lanes, the Sunless Sea is unexplored, and the map will change every time you play. One time you might encounter a corsair's village in a forest of stalagmites, another you might come face to face with the vicious war trimarans of the New Khanate or the golden agents of the Dawn Machine.\nPlayer ship concept\nYour ship controls like a steamship, with a rudder for steering and an engine telegraph to control speed. Fuel and supplies are finite resources. Running out of either may leave you in terrible peril.\nExplore and survive. Grow strong and wise and rich and feared. With luck and skill you may achieve an endgame goal: find your father's legacy, found a pirate princedom or sail beyond the Unterzee into the strangeness at time's heart. \nRecruit officers on your travels - some are familiar faces from Fallen London, some are new. Officers provide bonuses to your ship's stats - Iron, Veils, Mirrors, Hearts and Pages -  but more importantly they're a source of stories. Get to know your First Officer and she might share the co-ordinates of a secret smugglers' cove stuffed with drowning-pearls. Feed your ship's cat a moonish sprat and it may begin to glow in the dark. Invite your surgeon to dinner in your cabin and... well, who knows?\nCombat occurs in (pauseable) real time, with abilities on a cooldown. You and your opponent each have an array of abilities for defence, damage, healing and trickery. Your Iron stat allows you to attack; your Mirrors stat allows you to Illuminate your enemy, leaving them vulnerable; your Veils stat hides you from your enemy's Illumination; Hearts and Pages allow for healing, drugs, trickery, diplomacy. Your Officers enhance all these, so equipping the right Officers may unlock further abilities.\nOnce again, light and dark are key. Begin a battle with your enemy in your prow-light to have them begin the battle Illuminated, or turn your lights off to ensure your own Illumination starts low.\nAs your stats rise, and as you purchase new equipment for your ship, the number and power of your abilities will grow. Begin with a Splinter-Salvo and Evasive Manoeuvres: aspire to the Rarefaction Cannon and the terrifying Unclear Bomb...\n\"We went dark: we extinguished the prow-light, even the running-lights. We stalked the Pirate-Poet, the lap of the waves on our hull and the the soft throbbing of our engines the only hint of our presence. Her lookout heard them at the last.\"\nThe Unterzee is a realm of sombre beauty. The false-stars in the cavern roof glimmer: the lamps of the cities below answer them. It is always night. See the shapes of islands loom through the gloom, the distant glows that might be phosphorescent seaweed or running-lights or the eyes of monsters, and turn to pursue or avoid. You'll turn up your lights to see farthest, or let them sink low to escape detection... or to become the hunter.\nLike everything else in Sunless Sea, light has its cost. Turn your light to its highest setting and you'll see farthest; but not only will you alert more monsters, you'll burn through your fuel faster, and risk leaving yourself adrift at the mercy of the tideless black.\nUnterzee mood concept\n\"So here you are, boilers stoked, hold awash with chittering crab-things. Your scarred first officer pipes a melancholy tune. Your ship's surgeon strops her razors to a hearty stropping-song. Phosphorescent tentacles uncoil in dark waters. Cast off. Don't look back.\"\nEvery foray out from London may end in shipwreck. Stay among the near isles, where the seas are known and the rewards are small, and you'll be fine if you're careful. As you head farther out, you'll need to balance your remaining supplies against the tantalising possibilities lying just out of reach, and the lurking dangers. If you want to cross the Unterzee and explore the unknown ports there, you'll need to find staging posts and safe routes - perhaps use ocean currents to speed your progress and make best use of your provisions.\n\"We broke into the galley today and found appalling things: corpse-candles, graven images, and the mortal remains of Able Seaman Ayrton, rendered partially to stock. The wretched cook would only cackle: You liked him better salted...\"\nKeep your crew's Hunger low with Supplies; keep their Terror low by limiting their exposure to horrors, allowing them shore leave, encountering wonders. If Hunger and Terror rise too high, the fun begins: stories of quarrels, despair, nightmares, madness, cannibalism and mutiny. Too much of this, and you'll lose your crew, your captain and your ship.\n\"We sighted Mt Nomad again today, still afloat but listing, her dark glass flanks scored and pitted from the cannon-fire in our previous encounter. This will be the last battle. This monster has harrowed the seas too long.\"\nYou'll meet pirates, monsters, ill-tempered customs officers, many of them interchangeable. But some of your enemies will flee from you, to change and grow as part of a larger arc until you can finally hunt them down. Perhaps they'll become your obsession: perhaps you'll risk everything to end them.\nThe dreaded Angler Crab\nEverything in Sunless Sea counts towards your personal story. We're using an offline version of our award-winning StoryNexus engine from Fallen London to build and recombine chunks of story, giving you a non-linear, choice-heavy, personalised experience. It'll take dozens of games to explore all the sub-plots, grand arcs, alternatives, mysteries, relationships and romances in the game.\n\"This is the day I finally listened to my dreams. I climbed the ladder to the attic. The box was there in the farthest corner. In the dream I had opened it and the crows had poured out like a black fog, but of course that was nonsense... there was nothing in there but the map, and the lamp. And my father's sword.\"\nThe Unterzee eats ships and their captains. Your character will die (or disappear, or lose her mind, or be hollowed out and filled with candle-wax and haunt a cliff-top chapel)... but their legacy may survive. Your next character may be a daughter, a student, or just someone who found an old ship's log in a curiosity shop. The risk of death remains, but that sting of frustration that makes you rage-uninstall will be lessened. You'll build up your own story across generations of zailors who braved the Unterzee and lost - or won...\nAs an Unterzee captain, you\u2019re not limited to one role. You can be a privateer and a merchant, but also an explorer and a scientist \u2013 as much Charles Darwin as Francis Drake. Consequently, the riches of the Neath are more than mushroom-brandy, spider-silk, drowning-pearls. Those riches are also charts, secrets, journal entries, and the world\u2019s hastiest and most terrified sketch of the Bound Shark. And you\u2019re going to need riches \u2013 not just to improve your ship, but to cover the cost of supplies and fuel and repairs. That\u2019s part of the \u2018survival\u2019 element. And Sunless Sea being the story-driven game it is, you don\u2019t know when your hold might be more exciting than you\u2019d expected. If you carry zoological specimens from a Benthic College encampment, they might escape. If you carry sealed shipments from Hell, will you risk cracking them open to unravel their secrets?\nThere\u2019s more to the Unterzee than the surface. Travel beneath the waves and wax-winds or descend to the sea-bottom in a zubmarine; or keep your surface-ship, but send landing parties in diving-suits down below. Explore coral colonies, the Fluke-Legions, and the Drowning Feast.\nThis stretch goal adds submarines, or more correctly, zubmarines. We\u2019ll peel away the surface layer of the Unterzee and let you manoeuvre and explore in the depths. It\u2019s darker down here, but the rewards can be great. Of course, you\u2019ve just exchanged the more familiar perils of the surface for the misbred, pale-skinned, bulging-eyed vileness of the sea-floor\u2026\nIf we achieve this goal, we expect to deliver it as an expansion to the main game at the end of the third quarter of 2014. Anyone backing Sunless Sea at the Zailor (\u00a310) level or above will get the expansion free of charge.\nDirigibles are expensive. But they\u2019re fun. The fuel will cost you, but you can travel above the sea in safety. Well, mostly safety: there\u2019s the feral bat-flocks, the moon-misers, the blood-stealing Mosquito Zeppelins \u2026 \nWith this stretch goal, we\u2019ll add Dirigibles to allow you to explore the roof of the Neath \u2013 the vast cavern that contains the Unterzee. Fuel keeps range short, so this won\u2019t spoil the fun of exploring the far archipelagoes, but the roof has its own dangers and its own rewards. Buzz New Newgate prison. Gather glim from the carapaces of creatures from outside the sky. Refuel at the stalagmite-citadels of the Starved Men: assist them in their desperate battles against the infection overtaking the roof\u2026\nIf we achieve this goal, we expect to deliver it as an expansion to the main game at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. Anyone backing Sunless Sea at the Zailor (\u00a310) level or above will get the expansion free of charge.\n--\nWant to know more about Sunless Sea?

Our goal is to create a lasting gaming experience you can\u2019t get anywhere else that we\u2019ll all be playing, upgrading and supporting for years to come. It\u2019s more than a game it\u2019s a labor of love!\nOur team grew from humble beginnings making mods for games and those roots have taken seed. But we haven\u2019t forgotten where we came from. We want to build more than a game we want to build a community and relationship with our customers taking input, feedback and ideas early on and working them into the game. It\u2019s not just our game is everyone\u2019s game!\nThe average 7 Days to Die Team member has over 14 years of experience in Game and Software Development working with or for many AAA Video Game Companies.\nWe have wanted to make this game for over a decade and can finally see the end of the tunnel. We have seen so much support by so many fans saying this is the game they have had in their heads for years and finally someone\u2019s making their dream game. Not only can you help us make this game as reality but you can play a big role in shaping the ongoing development and future design choices for 7 Days to Die.\nWe realize the importance of growing a strong vision with the support and passion of the people we\u2019re making the game for.

We\u2019ve recently added a couple more part time guys but just think how good it will be in May 2014 if we double our team size and everyone can go full time.\n\nYou might ask how did we do all this in 7 months and honestly I\u2019d have to say we knew what game we wanted to make, had a unified vision and just started making it. This is truly the best example of vision, meets passion, meets talent, meets experience that we\u2019ve all had the privilege to be part of.

Initially, it was a softcover book of 80 pages. The English version is twice as big, resulting in a fully colored hardcover book of 196 pages.

The additional content for the Limited Edition is almost finished. Soon, all there will remain to do will be to send it all to our printer!\n\nWe have previously organized two Kickstarter campaigns, and we have learned valuable lessons from them. This time, we have designed a campaign with stretch goals that will not slow down the crafting process. These additional rewards will include PDFs, but also other kinds of bonuses that we hope we will get to reveal. This way, we are certain that we will be able to send you your rewards this October \u2013 perhaps earlier, but let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Making deliveries on time is very important for us!\nAn adventure shared with the French-speaking community\nA unique feature of this campaign is that it has a twin on the European crowdfunding platform Ulule: http://fr.ulule.com/esteren-voyages/\n\nFor this double campaign, we will put a second financing bar where the funds gathered in both campaigns will be combined to unlock new stretch goals! Feel free to go on the Ulule page to speak with the French-speaking community. You can also meet them, as well as other English-speaking fans, on the official forums: http://www.esteren.org/forum/\nAny questions or suggestions?\nIf you have any questions or wish to share your impressions, feel free to post a comment. You can also go to the forums to take part in the discussions there. A crowdfunding campaign is a living project subject to evolutions, and we always welcome feedback!\nHere are the contents of the Limited Edition of Book 2 \u2013 Travels available through the Farl Collector pledge:\nAugmented Book 2 - Travels\nThis 196-page edition will be a hardcover book limited to 600 numbered copies. It includes all the content of the first version of Book 2 \u2013 Travels (descriptions of places, gallery of characters, scenarios, bestiary), with more than 100 pages of fully original additional content: new characters, game aids on locations, additional rules for traveling, an augmented bestiary, and an expansive scenario written by Iris: \u201cA Life Choice.\u201d\n\u201cTravels\u201d Box\nA gorgeous 3-inch-tall box illustrated by Yvan \u201cGawain\u201d Villeneuve, in which you can keep your limited edition books.\nGame aids\nSeveral game aids for the scenario \u201cA Life Choice\u201d (maps and character portraits) in a specially made folder.\nTravel Journal\nFour pages to complement the standard Character Sheet on which the Players can take notes, write down the highlights of their games, and keep track of their traveling equipment.\nNote that this edition (the box and its other contents) will only be available during this Kickstarter campaign and on special events. Retailers may also order some copies, but in very limited amounts (see the \u201cGouvran Merchant\u201d pledge).\nThe higher the contributions to this campaign get, the more bonuses we can finance.\nIn addition to the stretch goals reached by this Kickstarter, other ones will be unlocked according to the total sum obtained by combining the donations from the Kickstarter and Ulule campaigns.\nHere are some pictures summing up the various available pledges. In the next section, you can find a more detailed description of each item.\nIn this Kickstarter campaign, there are two types of options:\nStandard options: Delivery this october with your rewards.\nOnly reserved for those who have chosen a tiers containing physical rewards. To get these options, simply add the required sum to your pledge, no additional shipping costs\nSpecial options: Items from this KS campaign and some special items. Second delivery later in 2014.\nTo get these options, simply add the required sum to your pledge + add $20 for shipping for US & Europe or $60 for internationnal.\nIf you purchase $120.00 in options above your base pledge level (standard and special options combined), you will get your second delivery for free. Also; to avoid this extra shipping cost,\nyou can renounce to your october 2013 delivery (see below).\nFor our new campaign, we have decided to focus on delivering as soon as possible. This is a real challenge for us: all the files have been prepared to be ready in due time. We do not want to delay delivery because of too much stretch goals with physical rewards.We explained this in this update.\nActually, the only reasonable solution to add physical rewards is to schedule two delivery dates: one in October, as planned (Standard options with the green label), and one much later in 2014, with all of the other bonuses (Specials options with purple label).\nIf you have any question about each items, look at the paragraph below \"description of the items\".\nWe give you two ways to avoid additional shipping cost:\nYou take $120 options in total above your base pledge level, including Standard options AND Special option. For example, if you take $80 of Standard option + $40 of Special option, you will avoid extra shipping and you will get two deliveries without additonal fees.\nRenounce to your october 2013 delivery and kindly wait for the second delivery, later in 2014, with ALL your rewards in once : your reward + standard options + special options. Beware! Delivery can be very late because we can not accurately predict the creation time. Be delivered in December 2014, a year and a half from now, is a possibility. Of course this is the worst case but it can happen so please think about it.\nAt the end of the Kickstarter campaign, we will send you a survey in which you will be asked to list exactly what you have chosen, the number of deliveries chosen, etc.\nThis very limited offer will give you the opportunity to get an original drawing (8 inches x 6 inches on fine art paper) made by Gawain. You will receive this unique piece of art with your reward. You can choose the theme of the illustration, which you will be asked to describe in a few words. For example, \u201can illustration of the Temple,\u201d \u201can Osag warrior,\u201d etc. With this pledge, you can help an artist live off his art!

This section was made for you!\nShadows of Esteren is a medieval role-playing game, with an emphasis on the horrific and the Gothic. Drawing inspiration from Celtic myths, this universe has a discreetly fantastic side hidden under a bleak, realistic surface. This world is populated with humans who have to cope with tough daily lives, and face a supernatural threat lurking in the dark. With the focus of its adventures being investigation and survival, Shadows of Esteren is a game that favors an immersive mood and interactions among the Players.\nThis particular atmosphere is drawn from several sources of inspiration: the harshness and romanticism of Mel Gibson\u2019s Braveheart; the universes of Tim Burton, particularly the one of Sleepy Hollow; Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke; as well as Berserk, the manga by Kentaro Miura. Regarding role-playing, Shadows of Esteren would be somewhere between Ravenloft, Game of Thrones and Call Of Cthulhu.\n\nWe have also put online an extract from the PDF of the core book, Book 1 \u2013 Universe. You can download it freely here.\nMusic is a very important aspect in Esteren. Here are some extracts: a bonus track from the first album released and two excerpts from the next album, the OST of Dearg, the official campaign.\nThe game system of Shadows of Esteren has been designed to support the atmosphere and encourage interactions among the Characters. Therefore, it relies on simple, intuitive mechanics so as not to burden the narration, particularly during combats, which are meant to be quick and violent. A particular importance has been given to the creation of the Characters, and the evolution of their mental condition. In Book 1 Universe, the game system takes about a hundred pages out of the 280 that make up the book.\n\nHere are the main characteristics of this game system:\nA Detailed Character Creation. The creation of a PC goes through ten steps. The Characters are designed \u201cinside-out\u201d: you determine his psychology with 5 Ways that define how the Character sees and affects the world. Thus, there are no attributes such as Strength, Dexterity and so on, but there are Combativeness, Creativity, Empathy, Reason, and Conviction. By default, all the Characters are equally strong, fast, good-looking, etc. However a Character can purchase Advantages and Disadvantages to flesh out some of these physical attributes (\u201cStrong\u201d, \u201cWeak\u201d, \u201cHawkeye\u201d, etc.), or provide him with allies, extra funds, etc... Skills are then picked according to several stages of his life (youth, professional training, miscellaneous activities).\nThe System of the Ways. The Ways are characteristics that determine the major traits of the Character\u2019s personality: the Player allocates the scores 1, 2,3,4,5 among the 5 Ways. Ways are rated from 1 to 5: 1-2 is considered Minor, 4-5 is considered Major. Therefore, a Character will have 2 Major Ways, 2 Minor Ways and an average one. This makes it possible to roughly determine the way he thinks, his emotional tendencies, etc...\n\nAdditionally, there are five Faults, one for each Way: Passion (Combativeness), Subversion (Creativity), Influence (Empathy), Doubt (Reason), and Guilt (Conviction). The main aim of these characteristics is to give references for role-playing, but the Leader (GM) can ask a Player to make a Test roll in one of his Character's Major Faults to see if his Fault gets the better of him in a heated situation.\n\nAlso, a Character chooses 1 Flaw and 1 Quality based on his Major or Minor Ways (a Major Way can imply both a Flaw and a Quality). As shown in the example below, a Major rating in Combativeness can result in an Optimistic behavior, but also an impulsive one.\n\nExample for Combativeness:\n\nQuality:\nMajor Rating: combative, optimistic, dynamic, brave, pugnacious, etc.\nMinor Rating: calm, phlegmatic, cool-headed, peaceful, etc.\n\nFlaw:\nMajor Rating: impulsive, presumptuous, prideful, stubborn, arrogant, boastful, etc.\nMinor Rating: pessimistic, spineless, sad, weak-willed, fearful, self-conscious, coward, etc.\nA Resolution System Based on a D10. When a resolution roll is required, the Player adds the Character's rating in the appropriate skill + his rating in the associated Way + 1d10, and must beat a given Threshold. The margin determines the quality of success or failure. There are critical successes and failures as well. This resolution system is used for every aspect of the game, from fighting to using skills and calling upon mystical powers.\nQuick and Violent Combats. Combat is clearly deadly. Fighting attitudes have been designed to define how the Character fights. Moreover, the amount of Health Points defined at the creation of the PC (which is most of the time the same for every Character) does not increase as the PC improves in the various skill fields. The basic principle is that the human body is fragile: for example, close combat remains dangerous, no matter how good a PC is in a given domain.\nA Complete Sanity System. Dying is not the only danger that threatens the PCs: their psyche can be sorely tested, and they can even sink into madness. This is an important aspect of the game: where the combat system has been summed up in only three pages, the sanity system plays a much more important part and provides several tools to embody a psychically unstable PC. From the creation of his Character, the Player chooses a latent pathology for him, which may come to light if mental traumas become too heavy.\nThree Types of \"Magic\". Although Shadows of Esteren is defined as a low-fantasy universe, supernatural elements still exist. Magical powers are meant to be most often rare, but powerful, and their use is never without consequences. The game system details the Demorth\u00e8n arts (druidic/animistic tradition); the Miracles of the Temple, granted by the One God to the Elect; and Magience, a science using \u201cFlux\u201d, a fuel harvested from nature.\nThe illustrations and the visual atmosphere of Shadows of Esteren are a very important aspect of the project. We have wished for the illustrations to bring a meaningful support to the imagination of the Leaders and Players, once more with the objective of optimizing the mood during the sessions.\nHere are a few samples:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter two successful Kickstarter campaigns (one for Book 0 \u2013 Prologue and one for Book 1 \u2013 Universe), we are aware of logistics-related difficulties, but also of how tricky it can be to propose stretch goals that end up hampering the whole process... For this new campaign, we are confident that we will be able to realize the content announced in the pledges in due time. For this campaign, we are not taking chances.

Inspired by the predecessors of this hallowed genre like Valkyria Chronicles, Final Fantasy Tactics, and the X-COM franchise, WARMACHINE: Tactics seeks to break new ground for turn-based tactics games by delivering a never-before-seen level of dynamic battlefield combat.\nAs you\u2019ll see in the video, the development team has worked around the clock for several months to prove we have the experience and the ability to turn WARMACHINE into an incredible video game worthy of your pledge.

This is a land dominated by iron giants and their heroic human controllers, a fantastic realm marching to the progressive cadence of an industrial revolution, where magic and technology have found common ground in the form of a new science, called \u201cmechanika.\u201d\nDominating the field of battle are the WARCASTERS, rare individuals who have mastered both sorcerous magic and martial combat and who possess the singular ability to command the mightiest warriors of the Iron Kingdoms\u2014ten-ton, flame-belching, lead-spewing machines of destruction called WARJACKS.\nWarjacks are the warcasters\u2019 greatest weapons\u2014titanic, steam-powered automatons with arcane brains, magically linked to their warcaster controllers and capable of executing their every devastating order. Together, a warcaster and his warjacks possess the power of a small army. When leading a military force, they are unstoppable.\nThe wars that engulf the Iron Kingdoms are waged by four powerful nations: imperialistic and conquest-driven Khador; heroic Cygnar, with its cutting-edge technology; the fanatical Protectorate of Menoth; and the undead \u201cNightmare Empire\u201d of Cryx. Bolstering the forces of these factions are countless mercenaries, drawn from all corners of the continent to profit from the endless conflicts. Other nations beyond the Iron Kingdoms have also entered the fray\u2014ancient and inhuman races, some who ally with the human factions and others who would see humanity destroyed.\nFor a deeper look into the world and factions of WARMACHINE, visit WARMACHINETACTICS.COM.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics is a squad-level, turn-based tactics game featuring both a single-player campaign and online synchronous and asynchronous head-to-head multiplayer options.\nWhether playing the campaign or multiplayer, the command and management of your squad is key. Not only will you make defining choices about the warcaster, warjacks, and warriors that comprise your squad, but you will also utilize strong tactical direction of their strengths and abilities in battle as well as astute guidance for how they evolve over time.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics is designed around the philosophy of synergy between the members of a squad. Every unit is part of the whole and can interact with other units for greater effect. Similar to the concept of creating ability combos in a trading card game, units in WARMACHINE: Tactics can combine effects and abilities that support each other\u2019s efforts and increase one another\u2019s effectiveness. Careful and creative selection of a squad\u2019s warcaster, warjacks, and warriors is essential to an effective strategy. Plus, it means you can design exactly the force you want to put onto the battlefield.\nThen once your squad takes to the field of battle, your tactical command of their actions will govern their success. Will your squad advance cautiously, utilizing cover and outmaneuvering the enemy, or will they charge furiously into melee combat where brute force and resilience will win the day? In battle, how you command your warcaster, warjacks, and warriors and the tactical decisions you make to adapt to your enemy will determine your squad\u2019s fate.\nIn WARMACHINE: Tactics, you\u2019ll be able to save multiple squads in different configurations so that you can always pick the best load out for the mission or opponent at hand. And if you want to see how your squad stacks up, you\u2019ll be able to pit them against an AI opponent in order to try out your strategies and evaluate their performance before putting them to the true test against opponents from around the world.\nThe Iron Kingdoms are populated by rare individuals who possess incredible arcane talents in addition to unmatched combat skills. Even more important, they can mentally command and channel their power through the most devastating weapons of war\u2014warjacks. In WARMACHINE: Tactics, your squad is led by such a warcaster, one of many unique characters drawn from a colorful pantheon that makes up the epic cast of this setting. Each warcaster possesses an arsenal of weapons tailored to his personal fighting style as well as a unique combination of spells and skills. These include a defining arcane feat that, when used at the right time, can turn the tide of battle.\nWarcasters possess a replenishing reservoir of magical energy, called focus, which endows them with their superhuman abilities. Focus is used to cast spells, charge the protective fields of their specially created battle armor, and increase the effectiveness of their combat abilities.\nEvery warcaster interacts with his or her warjacks and warriors differently. One warcaster may promote aggressive strategies and bolster her squad\u2019s performance in melee combat, while another warcaster may provide greater defense and longevity to his squad, encouraging a more methodical approach to victory. The interchangeability of warcasters in WARMACHINE: Tactics provides nearly infinite replayability and ensures that no two game experiences are ever the same.\nThe spearhead of the WARMACHINE fighting force is the warjack. Outfitted with an array of wicked weaponry, these imposing constructs of steel and iron are brought to life through a fusion of steam power and magic and controlled with deadly precision by the warcaster.\nA warcaster is in constant telepathic contact with her warjacks and can channel her focus through a warjack to boost the machine\u2019s combat abilities and enable it to execute devastating power attacks.\nThe relationship between warcasters and their warjacks is as close as the kinship between any brothers in arms. Over time, a warjack gains experience and may bond with its warcaster, taking on unique personality characteristics and developing new aptitudes.\nFleshing out the squad in WARMACHINE: Tactics are the warriors. Encompassing a wide range of disciplines and roles, warriors are selected for the fighting capability and supporting tactics they add to your squad based on how you want the force to operate on the battlefield.\nSquads in WARMACHINE: Tactics are small, elite units, and the warriors that comprise them are all heroes in their own right. The warriors bring with them a gallery of incredible weapons and abilities that can make a squad perform efficiently and effectively in any situation, from rapid assaults to stealthy hit-and-run maneuvers and everything in between.\nEach battle awards warriors, warjacks, and your warcaster with experience that unlocks new options for your squad, like tactical feats for the warriors or bonds between the warcaster and his warjacks that affect the performance of the warjacks in specific situations. This ever-growing list of options can be accessed during squad building to customize your force to your precise strategy.\nEach campaign will focus on a single novice warcaster character and allow you to play through the formative experience that evolves that character into a full-fledged warcaster, also playable in multiplayer.\nThe campaigns will deliver an extensive, story-driven experience. Although conducting your squad during campaign battles works exactly like combat in multiplayer, you\u2019ll also have the opportunity to choose how the central character develops her abilities through the course of her evolution.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics will ship with the \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d campaign, featuring Cygnar\u2019s Lt. Allison Jakes, a young journeyman warcaster trained as a duelist who is unexpectedly thrust into a position of great responsibility and leadership before she is ready. Under your command, Lt. Jakes will rise to the occasion in the face of horror and adversity in this harrowing story that will define her character forever in the ongoing saga of WARMACHINE.\nFuture campaigns will explore all the factions of WARMACHINE and feature a cast of characters uniquely designed for both the video game and the tabletop.\nOne of the most exciting aspects of WARMACHINE: Tactics is being able to play against your friends no matter where you are or what time it is. Online multiplayer will support both synchronous and asynchronous play, so you can compete head-to-head against a live opponent on the other side of the world, or you can play the asynchronous \u201cplay-by-mail\u201d mode, which allows both players to take turns at their leisure. If you don\u2019t have a friend available and still want to get your battle on, you\u2019ll be able to find an opponent with automatic matchmaking. And WARMACHINE: Tactics will offer casual, ranked, and tournament play to suit the style of every player.\nMultiplayer will be supported with regular releases of new maps, units, and even whole new factions. We want to ensure that your game experience is consistently fresh and offers new challenges every time you play.\nOur funding goal allows us to produce the single-player campaign and the multiplayer mode featuring playable forces with multiple warcasters, warjacks, and warriors for the Cygnar and Khador factions as well as some Cryx units that appear in the single-player campaign\u2014about three dozen units in all. We hope to get a whole lot more in there by achieving our stretch goals: the WARMACHINE tabletop game currently includes over 500 distinct warriors, warjacks, and warcasters, and our ambition is to bring as many of them into WARMACHINE: Tactics as possible. Our goal is to deliver regular expansions to the game in the form of campaign and themed bundles that will add new characters to your faction rosters and new stories to experience. Multiplayer maps will also be released regularly as free downloads, available to play by everyone.\nWe\u2019re not just going to show you some pretty pictures and expect that you\u2019ll back our project. We\u2019re going to entice you with what we hope are tantalizing offers you can\u2019t refuse!

This collaboration has allowed us time to bond, to learn to work effectively and efficiently, and to develop the trust required for two entities to undertake the challenge of bringing a dream to life. Individually, we bring vital expertise and resources to the WARMACHINE: Tactics project, and together we can achieve more than either of us ever could alone.\nPrivateer Press Interactive and WhiteMoon Dreams have made a considerable investment in time and money to pay for the initial development of WARMACHINE: Tactics. We accepted this risk so that we could present a project worthy of your confidence. Our belief is that by promoting this project on Kickstarter, we\u2019ll raise the profile of the game and expand awareness of WARMACHINE to an even wider audience that will help us achieve the funding necessary to produce the best version of WARMACHINE: Tactics possible.\nIn early 2013, Privateer Press Interactive and WhiteMoon Dreams officially joined forces to co-produce WARMACHINE: Tactics without the traditional support of a publisher.\nPrivateer Press Interactive was founded by Matt Wilson, owner and Chief Creative Officer of Privateer Press, Inc., the leading independent producer of tabletop miniatures games, best known for WARMACHINE, the game of steam-powered combat set in the fantastic world of the Iron Kingdoms. The mission of Privateer Press Interactive is to bring the tabletop gaming worlds of Privateer Press into the digital medium.\nWilson, who created WARMACHINE, has worked in the game industry for over 18 years as an artist, art director, writer, and award winning game designer. Prior to the twelve years of titles he has generated at Privateer Press, Wilson art directed and was the lead concept artist for Magic: the Gathering at Wizards of the Coast, as well as contributing artistically to Dungeons & Dragons, FASA\u2019s Battletech and Shadowrun lines, and AEG\u2019s Legend of the Five Rings, where he also created the world and developed the game.\nFor six years, Los Angeles-based WhiteMoon Dreams has worked with companies all over the world to bring their games to market and has been heavily involved in game technology R&D with partners including Disney, Intel, and Tencent. WhiteMoon Dreams is helmed by founder and CEO, Jay Koottarappallil, who has spent 18 years in the video game industry working on a range of titles, including the Myth, Ratchet & Clank and Medal of Honor series\u2019.\nKoottarappallil has assembled a team of design heavyweights including Creative Director Scott Campbell, one of the key minds behind the original Fallout, and Game Director Kevin Mack, who ushered Fear Effect and Medal of Honor. Projects at WhiteMoon Dreams are managed by Executive Producer Rusty Buchert, a revered icon for indies everywhere for his work at Sony on such titles as Flow, Flower and Journey as well as being responsible for some of Interplay\u2019s biggest games, including Descent, several Star Trek games, and many others.\nBy combining and sharing resources between our two companies, we are able to move rapidly and efficiently through the development process of video game production. WARMACHINE: Tactics is a true collaboration, and because of the constant communication and the fact that WARMACHINE'S creator, Matt Wilson is part of the game\u2019s design team, we are able to ensure the most faithful interpretation of the WARMACHINE setting possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA letter from Privateer Press Interactive founder, Matt Wilson:\n\nVideo games are complex undertakings. Everything presented on the screen has been painstakingly created by many disciplined professionals\u2014artists, animators, programmers, designers, and audio and effects engineers. Games are a meticulously orchestrated symphony that, when well presented, create unforgettable interactive experiences for those who play them. If the concert isn\u2019t well executed or conducted, the result is sluggish performance, a frustrating interface, low-quality art, or missed deadlines.\n\nThese variables make predicting the outcome uncertain, but every potential problem is surmountable with the proper application of time. Ideally preparation and experience will help avoid any pitfalls, and carefully planned contingencies will make it less disruptive when one is unavoidable. The most significant challenge in software development is simply delivering what\u2019s been promised on time.\n\nWhile it may appear Privateer Press has made some bold moves in the past, the truth is, we are risk averse. We make our decisions cautiously, with great consideration and calculation. Privateer Press Interactive, being composed of the same executive team, is no different. We know our greatest risk in this is the reputation of the Privateer Press name we have built over the past twelve years, and we have not undertaken this project lightly.\n\nThe decision to launch this project on Kickstarter came after nearly a year and a half of observation and analysis of other crowdfunded projects, and our decision to make this journey with WhiteMoon Dreams follows nearly five years of friendship and trust developed from our professional association. This is not a quickly conceived scheme, nor are we entrusting our beloved WARMACHINE to an unknown quantity. We have weighed the alternatives and considered the variables, and we\u2019re confident in our choice of development partners. But that\u2019s not enough. Just like you, we needed to see it in action.\n\nTo be sure of our decision, along with WhiteMoon Dreams we have funded several months of development on WARMACHINE: Tactics so we\u2019d be able to show you something credible and worthy of your pledge. We didn\u2019t want to just show concept art and offer lengthy descriptions of the game we envision; we set out to prove we have a team with the talent to bring this world to life. New progress is made on the game daily, and we\u2019ll be sharing that with you regularly throughout the campaign and right up until the product launch. We\u2019ve chosen a realistic funding goal that will support the required development, and we\u2019ve committed to a comfortable timeline with built-in contingencies should we encounter unavoidable delays. And we have planned our current funding beyond the end of this Kickstarter so that our team can remain focused on its continued development without skipping a beat.\n\nWhen we undertook this project, we also made a pledge: we will not launch another Kickstarter project until WARMACHINE: Tactics has released and has achieved all we have promised to deliver in the basic game as well as all the stretch goals we reach. We view this Kickstarter campaign as our one shot\u2014our single opportunity to create this game on our terms, and with your support.\n \nWe will honor your support above all else.\n\nNo one knows the future. When I met Jay Koottarappallil of WhiteMoon Dreams five years ago, neither of us imagined we\u2019d someday be making our WARMACHINE game this way. But now, more than ever, I am confident it will get done\u2014and I can\u2019t wait to play it with you.\n\nMatt Wilson\nOwner & CCO\nPrivateer Press, Inc.\nPrivateer Press Interactive, Inc.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #85", "update_userinfo": "LATEST DEVELOPMENTS", "update_content": "Greetings WARMACHINE: Tactics Backers!\nWhiteMoon Dreams is forging ahead with the development of WARMACHINE: Tactics and has some great news about the latest patch, available today, and what's coming up.

The dynamics between husband and wife, the unity and discord of competition, and the domestic tensions from their marriage that are forced out into the open will be familiar to anyone, regardless of your familiarity with the game.\nAlso there are penis jokes.\nL.A. SCREENING NOW AVAILABLE\nWe are making a limited number of tickets to our Los Angeles Cast and Crew Screening available to backers.  This is a chance to bring together the crew that got us through production and you backers that carried us through post.  Afterwards, there will be a reception where you can meet the cast and crew, hear the war stories and poke our bruises.\nIf you would like to attend, simply go to \"Manage Your Pledge\" and increase your pledge by $30 for one ticket or $50 for two tickets.  Afterwards, RSVP to lordofcatan@hamstervalhalla.com.  \nIn addition, all backers who pledge over $200 are automatically signed up to receive two tickets if they can attend.  Date and location TBA.\nPOSTERS ALSO AVAILABLE\nLimited Edition Lord of Catan posters are now available to order.  The posters, which will measure 20\"x14\" are being designed by the amazing Mark Dos Santos.  Plus, each poster is individually numbered and SIGNED by his Lordship Fran Kranz!\nWe're only printing these for Kickstarter backers. Once the campaign is over, the posters will cease to be available.  You can see some of Mark's art below.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nA huge thank you to everyone who has made this a successful fundraising campaign.  The support has been overwhelming.  Even though we've hit our initial goal, there's still a lot that can be accomplished.  All funding over our initial goal will allow us to devote even more care and attention to the film, specifically:\nVFX -- On set, our visual effects guy said to me, \"Anything's possible. It's just a matter of time and money.\" So with more to put into the VFX budget, the more perfectly we can make the film fit my vision. Also included in this are titles and graphic design.\nMusic -- with a higher music budget, we can not only get an amazing composer, but also license one or two choice songs that I used in my temp track for the rough cut which perfectly fit the film.   \nFestival Entry Fees -- way more expensive than you'd think.\nTheatrical Screening -- We are still working out some details, but one of our stretch goals will be to put on a theatrical cast and crew screening. Any backers who donate to the screening will get a ticket to the event you made possible. I will let you know when this reward is going up.\nOnline Distribution -- apparently, it's a costly process to get a film cleared for iTunes and other such venues. If we can cover those costs, we'll be able to eventually share The Lord of Catan with all those Johnny-come-latelies who weren't cool enough to join the Kickstarter.\nSeductive Packaging -- Since we surpassed our fundraising goal, one of the first things additional funds will be used for is to make sure the DVD and BluRay packages can sit on your shelf in style. Or your floor. If you're like me, you ran out of shelf space for your DVD's and books a long time ago.\nPERSONAL STATEMENT FROM THE WRITER/DIRECTOR\nHey, look! It's the guy from the video!\nIt was like remembering something that had never actually been forgotten.  It had just been set to the side.\nQuick bullet points. Always knew I wanted to be a writer. Loved movies. Hated quotation marks. Went to USC Film School. Studied Screenwriting. Graduated in '05. Spent the next eight years in the trenches of the studio system. Wrote some comics. Got paid for some stuff. Nothing got made. Realized I was just feeding the machine.  I am Jack's organ grinding monkey dancing for the corporate overlords.\nRemembered that I had gotten into this game to make movies.\nDecided to make a movie.\nThe problem was that every time I sat down to write something to shoot, I ended up with a script that would cost approximately a bajillion dollars to make. What I needed was something simple. Something small. Or at least small-ish.  Then the universe slapped me across the face and said, \"Here you go, you idiot! A movie about two people in one room. No space oceans. No six-phalanged magical gunslingers. A monkey could make this for five thousand dollars!\"\nAs it turns out, the universe was underestimating by a factor of ten (maybe eleven or twelve). I never do anything simple. In fact, I'm sure I'd be a much more successful screenwriter if I didn't put so much effort into twisting layer upon layer in pursuit of a singular goal: to create a tapestry of awesomeness that will blow your mind into an alternate dimension.\nThe script was simple. The way I planned to shoot it was not.\nTo fully express what we self-important types call MY CREATIVE VISION for the film, I would need the kind of equipment usually reserved for Michael Bay movies. I was going to take a story about two people in one room and present it in a way as epic as Frodo and company crossing the cliffs of Middle Earth. It would blend a wide variety of influences from Aronofsky and Kubrick to Woody Allen, John Woo, Werner Fassbinder and Japanese anime (namely Furi Kuri for any otaku out there).\nAfter months of preproduction, when we finally got on set, it was like coming home. The crew was top notch, and as you can see from the video, the actors tore apart the fabric of space and time with their performances. I'm very excited to share this film with the world.\nBut we're not quite there yet.\nSO WHAT DO YOU WANT?\nWe shot the film in early May. It's in the can. Now is where you come in. I'm asking for your help to get the film through post-production as soon as possible, so we can get the movie looking and sounding pristine, at which point it will be beamed through your eye holes and into your brainpans where it will impregnate your medulla oblongata and rip a hole in the fabric of the 11 dimensions of the cosmos.  Reaching our Kickstarter goal will allow us to complete post production and finish this film.  Any additional funds we raise will be used to cover the debts and expenses accrued during physical production of the film so that I don't have to continue pimping out my kitten to cover the rent.\nIn addition to the knowledge that you have saved an innocent kitten from a life on the streets, our Kickstarter supporters will be the first ones on earth to see the film. Everyone else will have to wait for festivals. You'll also get access to all kind of awesome schwagg. Thanks for checking out the campaign and please consider joining me, my fellow Lords of Catan.\nSome of the perks (mainly the props and art) will be available soon after the campaign is over. The actual film (digital downloads and DVD/Blu Rays) will be available after its festival run. However, the Online Premiere Party lets you see it BEFORE its festival run!\nThrough the magic of acting, Amy Acker and Fran Kranz brought Krysta and Todd to life.\nWHY SHOULD I HELP?\nBecause you are awesome and you like things that are awesome and want to help bring more awesome things into your world.  Besides that?\nIf you are married, you will love this film.\nIf you have a boyfriend or girlfriend with whom you have completely ridiculous arguments, you will love this film.\nIf you like movies that live on the fringe and push beyond border of reality, you will love this film.\nIf you think Amy Acker is freaking awesome, you will love this film.\nIf you want to break into Fran Kranz's house and wear his face like a hat, you will love this film.\nBecause if you don't stand up and support the kinds of movies you want to see, some business major will decide for you.\nAlso sheep.\nNOW FOR THE BRIBERY!\nCheck out all our PIMP SAUCE REWARDS!  For only $15 you get to participate in an exclusive online premiere of the short film months before its release!  You'll also get a Special Thanks on the website and a digital download of the film when it is released!  We're also offering DVDs, BluRays, props, artwork used on set, and much, much more! \nREQUISITE \"WHY KICKSTARTER?\" PARAGRAPH\nKickstarter is the perfect venue for The Lord of Catan.  In the 70s, the studio system collapsed and it was a Golden Age of original filmmaking.  In the corporate world of today's studio system, such a thing could never happen.  But with Kickstarter, there is no barrier between the artist and the audience.  This is even more the case with short films since they have no real market.  They are made purely for the love of the medium--the definition of independent cinema.  This means that you, the fans, are the most important factor.  Your mind is the theater of our Catanian ambitions.  And that is why I'm asking you for your help.\nINTERVIEWS\nCheck out writer/director Stu Paul's interview with Sci-Fi Pulse: http://scifipulse.net/2013/07/interview-stuart-c-paul-on-indie-movies-comics-kickstarter-and-the-lord-of-catan/\nAnd another one here at Word of the Nerd: http://www.wordofthenerdonline.com/new-kickstarter-project-the-lord-of-catan-features-joss-whedon-favorites/\nAnd for those who prefer old-timey radio, check out this podcast interview with director Stu Paul and actor Fran Kranz on Giant Fire Breathing Robot: http://gfbrobot.com/2013/06/26/episode-174-director-stu-paul-and-actor-fran-kranz-talk-about-catan-and-the-settlers-thereof/\nCAST AND CREW\nAmy Acker (Krysta) and Fran Kranz (Todd) are no strangers to working together.

We are meeting on Friday July 19th to hammer out the final details so we can then complete the production of the video. It will be posted next week, so stay tuned! If you're interested in Darkling Plain, then please consider even a $1 tip jar pledge so that you will be notified when the example of play video is posted.\nFor something new, here's a video by FuelFX, the Houston-based sister company to Nocturnal Media. It shows off some very simple yet still quite cool augmented reality effects. Enjoy!\nWelcome to our Kickstarter project! Darkling Plain is a miniatures board game that is powered by augmented reality (AR). Darkling Plain combines all the best aspects of a traditional board game such as Settlers of Catan or Ticket to Ride and a video game such as Final Fantasy or World of Warcraft. Board games offer a social experience and depth of play, while video games offer immersion, glorious eye-candy, and computational wizardry.\nHopefully we answer your questions here, but feel free to ask questions. More information is also available from game designer Stewart Wieck on Twitter. Follow him @stewartwieck.\nThere are no actual miniatures in Darkling Plain. You place cards that represent your units and other features, like a ring of standing stones or a village, upon a full-color game board. When the cards or board are viewed through the camera of a smart device or computer, the game comes to life like a video game. Spectacular special effects abound as a fantasy battle bursting with the magical and the medieval consumes your tabletop.\nImportantly, the AR component of the game is not simply window-dressing. We are treating augmented reality as an important tool in the play of the game. It communicates vital visual clues to players, such as a unit\u2019s readiness. It also allows features like truly invisible movement, real-time play, and airborne forces that are actually above the playing surface.\nA game of Darkling Plain begins by selecting a region depicted on the full-color game board. While viewing the map through your smart device, you simply select the region and it will come alive in AR. The region surrounding Aezogoth\u2019s Pyre will be the first battlefield developed, but others will eventually be offered and might even be unlocked with stretch goals in this Kickstarter project.\nOnce the battlefield is selected, the game board transforms with augmented reality to display what we call the Strategic Map. Play on this map unfolds with your physical pieces (cards) and is reflected in 3D with the help of your smart device.\nWhen opposing forces move into close proximity on the Strategic Map (or otherwise force conflict through use of special abilities), play moves instantly to the Tactical Map. The Tactical Map exists solely within the realm of your smart device and the battle there takes place in real time. You select units and issue commands for them. Once you and your opponent have issued all the desired orders (you gain an advantage when completing yours first!), the action resolves and surviving units may receive new orders. Victors of a tactical battle emerge to rejoin their allies on the Strategic Map.\nDepth of play results not only because of the interaction between opposing units as they receive commands and use their special abilities, but also from the interface of the physical board and the augmented reality elements.\nMany people ask: do I need to hold my [insert your device name] up in the air the entire time I play Darkling Plain?\nIt's a fair question, and the answer is \"no!\". You will use your device to view game elements in augmented reality, but don't worry, the game design overall is more elegant and interesting than one that requires you to constantly hold up your device. The game involves examining the battlefield with your device, and you'll look for visual clues that hint at your opponent's plan, but plenty of game play does not require you to hold up your device. But when you do...! We promise you'll be awed by the animations and stunning particle effects! \nDarkling Plain is the name of both our game and the region of our fantasy world from which dark powers emanate. Eventually, the game will expand to offer any region of the world as a battleground (including the Darkling Plain itself), but play begins in the northern part of the world among the Viking-like people called the Jotnar.\nTwin brothers who ventured forth from these lands on a shared vision quest that the Jotnar believed would guide their people into the future. Instead, when all the sacred animal totems visited only one brother and ignored the other, the twins became enemies. Aezogoth, the foul god who dwells in the Darkling Plain, answered the unsavory prayers of the misbegotten twin and the Jotnar were divided.\nSome Jotnar stand with the ancient ways and worship the primordial forces of nature: Earth, Water, Air and Fire. But others have been seduced by the power of Aezogoth. His will offers other means to power: Destruction, Darkness, Death and Chaos. All eight of these powers can empower Jotnar who already have the form of a Werevym, a likeness of their totem animal, to create mighty champions of the elements or darkness \u2014 a Jorundimar.\nWhen you play Darkling Plain you command one of these two armies: the Elementals or the Dark. Jotnar warriors rally to both causes. Each warrior is sworn to an animal spirit revealed to him during his vision quest and when a shaman taps the ley lines that crisscross the lands (and the battlefield where the game is played) the shaman can transform the warrior into an incarnation of his totem animal: ape, bird, cat, fish, serpent and wolf. The warrior gains tremendous powers in any of these forms collectively known as Werevym.\nThe most powerful shaman, known as Braka, can in turn empower a Werevym. Awesome beasts called Jorundimar are the result. Jorundimar are the titans of legend: dragons, manticores, hellhounds and more. Where once there were twelve Jorundimar fashioned from traditional combinations of the elements and animals sacred to the Jotnar, there are now twenty-four. Aezogoth\u2019s foul might has created new beasts from the sacred animals. More may become known as the battle continues.\nThree pieces are required to play Darkling Plain. You\u2019ll need our full-color game board, cards that represent characters and environmental features, and a smart device. However, to simply have a bit of fun with our gorgeous models and enjoy their animations and sound effects, all you need is your smart device and a card. The cards can be placed anywhere (a hand, a shoulder, standing guard beside your favorite dice) and viewed in AR.\nThe cards are available as pledge rewards in various character combinations and formats (high-quality printed or quick-delivery PDF). The game board is available starting at the $50 Dark Lord or Nature God pledge levels. The smart device you have to provide for yourself!\nWhat smart devices can you use?\nAlmost any device with a built-in camera will work. Android, Windows and Apple devices will all be supported. Computers with external cameras will also work. Through combination of moving your physical pieces on the game board and making selections in the AR environment, you position your forces to lead your army to victory.\nYour device will operate one of two different apps. One app \u2014 an AR Reader \u2014 is for supporters who wish to simply enjoy our models in augmented reality. The other app is for supporters at the $50 level and above. It\u2019s the complete game. Both apps will be available through Google Play, the Windows Store and the Apple Store.\nWhy do we need the Kickstarter community\u2019s help to create Darkling Plain? We\u2019ve already made a substantial investment of time and resources in the creation of the many assets you see here. Our core team is in place. We have office space. We have most of the equipment. Still, to complete the game, we need more time and more programmers. If Darkling Plain is funded with your help on Kickstarter, then we\u2019ll have the funds to concentrate on making the game we envision.\nPlease note that none of the assets you see here are final versions. Everything is a work in progress. The characters, landscapes, maps, interfaces... everything is still evolving. We hope that what we are showing you gives you a strong indication of the direction we're heading. With your support, we'll create a truly gorgeous and elegant game.\nThere are a host of rewards available to those who back our project. We\u2019ve conceived Darkling Plain as a grand game with lots of moving parts and exciting depth of play, but the various animated models can be enjoyed in their own right. You don\u2019t need to play the complete game to be entertained by fantasy warriors and monsters roaring and posing on your tabletop.\nAll the specifics of our pledge rewards are found to the right where you choose the level at which you\u2019d like to help support the creation of Darkling Plain, but a general overview follows.\nPledging at $1 gives us a little piece of your soul! Perhaps not, but it allows us to keep you informed of our progress through project updates.\nPledging at $5-$30 rewards you with the app that is an AR reader and some combination of cards to view in augmented reality. All of the characters have multiple animations, from attacks to movement to dramatic taunts and often one that\u2019s simply for fun (you\u2019ll find many amusing ways to use these animations...!).\nPledging at $50 and above is when the your rewards really start to accumulate. At this level you\u2019ll receive the full game app plus all of the Elemental characters or all the Dark characters. Or all of the characters in total! Some of the pledge levels also earn you exclusive characters and/or character customizations.\nFor those who want to create their own animations or even their own characters, we offer several rewards at even higher levels. We appreciate support and any level, but we look forward to working one-on-one with supporters who wish to take a more active role in Darkling Plain.\nKnowledge of some of the terminology of Darkling Plain will aid your understanding of the pledge rewards. Here are some keys terms:\nBraka: female offspring of Sigla, \u201cwoman who cannot bear child\u201d, they are born with the knowledge of their animal totem and so are shamans at birth. They develop even greater powers, including the ability to transform Kalder into Jorundimar.\nDraum: the serpent totem.\nGeig: the ape totem.\nHahnt: the fish totem.\nJorundimar: the most powerful incarnation of a Jotnar hero when imbued by a shaman with energy from a ligara. \nJotnar: name the northern people give to themselves. \nKalder: male offspring of Sigla, imbued at birth with a heightened affinity for one of the Orta.\nLigara: the \u201cley lines\u201d of energy that Jotnar shamans tap to empower their magic.\nNarava: vision quest where a Jotnar discovers his Orta.\nOrta: the six animal totems of the Jotnar; ape, bird, cat, fish, serpent and wolf.\nRagur: the cat totem.\nShaman: Jotnar women who serve as links between the people and the animals and elements the people hold sacred.\nSigla: a shaman who gives up her status because she\u2019s found a husband and has been accepted back among the people.\nSkaren: the bird totem.\nVargal: the wolf totem.\nWerevym: the were-form incarnation a Jotnar warrior achieves after being imbued with energy from a ligara.\nOur initial goal is to raise $120k to produce a full version of Darkling Plain. The game will allow players to clash with complete armies of Dark or Elemental forces that consist of Jotnar warriors (as archers, spearman or swordsman), heroic Jotnar called Kalder (also as archers, spearman or swordsman), shaman and Braka, two of the Werevym (crosses between man and animal, here cat and serpent), and one Jorundimar (the mightiest titan-like beasts of myth and legend) for each army. The manticore represents the Elemental army and the void dragon is the Dark Jorundimar.\nShould our project receive enough support, we will be very happy to offer stretch goals. The core of these goals will be to offer additional Jorundimar. As some of the Jorundimar are empowered versions of animal totems other than the Draum or Ragur, additional Orta will automatically be a part of the stretch goals that create such a Jorundimar.\nSimilarly, some of the reward levels include characters that are not a part of the base full game set, such as the Vargal, or wolf totem. However, if any backer selects a pledge level that involves one of these characters (e.g. Ode to White Wolf, which offers a white-furred Vargal!), then the character in question will be created and it will be added to all pledge levels starting at 'Augmented Advocate'. Similarly, even a single backer selecting \u2018Deep Liege\u2019 will unlock the Hahnt character.\nOur main goal will always be to create a game that merges the best of traditional board games and video games, but there are a host of other great creations that we will reveal if Darkling Plain receives substantial support. We hope you will help make our project and these exciting stretch goals a reality!\nWe\u2019re only revealing a first stretch goal because we\u2019re primarily focusing on the initial game, but once we enough support to ensure the essential game is covered, then we\u2019d love to share some expansions ideas with you.\n$150k = Two new Jorundimar will be added to the full game reward levels of Dark Lord and Nature God. Elemental players will receive the fiery Salamander (Draum + Fire) and Dark players will receive the stealthy Twilight Stalker (Ragur + Darkness). Augmented Apostles receive both!\nWe did our best to structure reward levels to maximize your options while ensuring that the great rewards of the lower levels were also available in higher pledge levels. It becomes muddled at some point, though, so we decided it was easier to offer some options as Add-Ons. You may select any of these Add-Ons in addition to the rewards included in the pledge level you choose.\nFor instance, if you want the Phoenix that\u2019s offered as part of the 'Explosive Elements' pledge level, but also want all the appearance customizations offered in the \u201cWolf Prince\u201d pledge, then you may choose 'Explosive Elements' but instead of indicating a $250 donation, indicate a pledge amount of $280. The additional $30 is for the Add-On of \u201cWolf Prince\u201d. Be sure to include a note so we know what reward you would like added to your base pledge. If you forget, then don't worry. We'll check with you after the funding period.\nHere is the menu of available Add-Ons. We may well expand this list based on feedback we receive from you, so please share your ideas and make requests.\n$10 = Vargal + white fur customization (from \u2018Ode to White Wolf\u2019)\n$30 = Cat Lord\n$30 = Deep Liege\n$30 = Monkey King\n$30 = Raven God\n$30 = Serpent Master\n$30 = Wolf Prince\n$180 = Basilisk Jorundimar\n$180 = Phoenix Jorundimar", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the outset of this project, we decided to produce a game that was an artful combination of technology and traditional board games. There are a lot of \u201clow-hanging branches\u201d for which we could use AR, such as virtual pets, but we do not want the AR component of Darkling Plain to be a gimmick or simply eye-candy. It must be integral to the game-play.\n\nIt\u2019s a great theory, but difficult in practice. We\u2019re pleased that we have already overcome a number of technological hurdles, such as designing patterns that AR readers can quickly and continuously recognize in order to generate an AR image. We're also using motion capture technology to produce more realistic character animations more quickly, but other prickly problems remain. We are confident that we will solve these issues or find elegant workarounds with the proceeds of this project to boost us, but there are a few tough nuts to crack. For instance, the size of the cards needed for an AR reader are currently larger than we\u2019d like. We\u2019d love to get the image size down to coin-sized, but that might be too small to work well. In this case, we\u2019ll simply scale the board game aspect of Darkling Plain to compensate!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Stewart Wieck\n16 created \u00b7 258 backed\nI'm a game designer and author of short stories, novels and screenplays.

You control a team of four agents, each with distinct and unique abilities, collectively battling for control of a fully simulated, living cyberpunk city.\nThe game world is designed to facilitate emergent gameplay, giving you the tools and freedom to play how you want to play, so you can create strategies and scenarios that not even we had anticipated!\nCustomise your team with the strength to destroy your enemies head-on, or hack into their facilities to manipulate their infrastructure without them ever knowing you were even there.\nWill you take down your enemies with brute-force? Covert espionage and infiltration? Or will you use propaganda to influence the citizens of the city and overthrow the controlling powers?\nSatellite Reign will be released on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.\nThe world's governments are controlled by mega-corporations, democracy to the highest bidder. Society is structured for the benefit of those in power. The poor exist in the dark squalid underbelly of the city, while the wealthy swim in opulence and luxury on the upper tiers, and the vast middle-class are too comfortable with their lives of convenience to see the world for what it really is. Corporate police patrol the streets, brutally maintaining the status quo, all under the guise of keeping the people safe.\nThe time for change is now, as a mysterious organisation rises from the slums of the city. They'll have to bribe, steal, hack and augment their way through the barriers between them and their ultimate goal...but what are they trying to achieve?  To free the masses from the corporate stranglehold, or to take control for themselves?  That, is up to you.\nThis is one big, open, living metropolis. The city isn't just a cool location (although it is pretty cool), it actually functions like a city; the streets are bustling with people by day, and controlled by criminal organisations by night. Power grids actually power the city, information and finances flow from one district to another, and you can use all of these things to your advantage.\nThe entire game-world is designed around emergent gameplay. Civilians, police and corporate soldiers will all react uniquely to your actions. Power conduits, communication networks and security systems are there for you to hijack, modify or destroy. Learn how the city and its inhabitants operate, then exploit them all to advance your agenda.\nThe city is huge and you can move around and tackle objectives however you want to. You won't be spoon-fed one mission after another, you'll be able to use whatever means you can to get to your final goal. Bribe scientists to advance your technologies, and kidnap doctors to augment your agents. Steal money from the banks to fund your war against the corporations, and exploit neural implants to bend the will of others. Or, try to take your objectives through good old-fashioned brute-force.\nDistinct character classes give you total control over how you approach a situation. Different classes with different combinations of augmentations, gear and weapons gives you the ability to customise your team and your experience.\nNot every problem is easily solved by shoving a gun in its face. Sometimes the situation requires a bit more subtlety, a bit more finesse. Try siphoning cash out of the corporate account, bribing a bank manager to \u201cmisplace\u201d his security pass, or steal the identity of a corporate soldier to pass through security checkpoints unseen.\nFrom our previous experience with the Unity Engine, we could look no further. Its flexibility, ease of use, and quick turnaround on development means less barriers between the creators and the creation.\nIts robust scripting system and one click approach to deployment allows us to simultaneously develop releases for Windows, Linux and Mac.\nFrom Left to Right: Dean Ferguson, Chris Conte, Mitchell Clifford, Brent Waller and Mike Diskett.\n5 Lives Studios is an independent developer. Our core team consists of five dedicated industry professionals with many years of experience. Not only are we all industry veterans, but we also have a long history of working together, allowing us to make games like a well-oiled machine. Some of us have worked together for nearly a decade! Collectively, we have worked on a wide range of genres and notable titles including the Syndicate series, GTA IV, Darksiders II, Star Wars, L.A. Noire, and many more.\nKickstarter is continually proving itself to be a utopia for creativity. It gives developers like us the chance to get back to our roots, so we can make the games we want to play. We\u2019re free to explore and implement ideas without publishers demanding that we reshape our vision for broad, generic appeal.\nAnd most importantly, it gives you the opportunity to have your say. You get the chance to bring back the types of games you loved. Not only that, but you're also in the unique position to give input on the actual development. This new age of developers and gamers being able to work together paints an exciting, bright future for the industry we all love. \nWe will be thrilled to meet our initial funding goal. Doing so will allow us to achieve our core vision for Satellite Reign, but should we be fortunate enough to exceed our target, every bit extra will go into expanding the experience even further. We've got loads of great ideas on how we can expand Satellite Reign, which we'll reveal as the campaign continues. \nOur first stretch goal will allow us to bring on Russell Shaw, the composer from the original Syndicate series. He'll bring a truly authentic soundscape to the world of Satellite Reign.\nNote: Currency Conversion Rates are an estimate based on exchange rates in June 2013. Final conversion rate may vary.\nBackers who pledge for the \"Transistor\" tier or higher will receive an exclusive Kickstarter-only Satellite Reign t-shirt!\nT-Shirt designs are not yet final, so feel free to tell us what you think!\n\"Bob\" Miniature Figurine available in the \"Bobbylicious\" tier and above.\n\"CTO\" backers who claim the right to design and name a weapon in the game will work closely with 5 Lives Studios to ensure proper balancing of the weapon within the overall structure of the game.

Our initial goal will allow us to produce a game which retains the core gameplay and design concepts without sacrificing the depth of the simulated city.\n\nThe structure of the simulation systems and design means minimal bespoke code and scripting of events. The simulation systems are fully modular and independently operating, while at the same time interlinking to build a complex and believable world. This allows us to build new systems and simulations which can easily slot into the core systems at any time without breaking the overall structure of the game and code.\n\nWe carry the same modularity across to our art pipeline. The environments are built with modular building blocks, which gives us the flexibility to iterate quickly, and allows for a large range of variety in the game world.\n\nTogether, based on our experience as individuals and as a team, we're confident that we will achieve our goals for Satellite Reign. Our initial funding goal will allow us to deliver a rewarding and engrossing gameplay experience which can be expanded in both depth and size if we are fortunate enough to exceed our immediate funding goal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #76", "update_userinfo": "Unity Awards and Mod Support!", "update_content": "Greetings Agents!

With your help I'd like to finish my wilderness survival game for Windows and Mac PCs, where you must unfurl a mysterious tale and escape a magical realm before the unending winter consumes you.\nThe story revolves around an unnamed protagonist (visually customisable) who must discover why he awakens in this magical realm and how to escape it. A spirit guide helps him to learn the skills of survival, the obstacles he must vanquish and the final path he must seek.\nThe gameplay focuses on exploration for new areas, gathering food and resources to make tools and gear to ease your survival needs, and gain access to strange regions learning new skills and uncovering more of the story. Many elements are selectively randomised, such as weather and ailments, what areas you discover and the resources within them, as well as the skills you learn, ensuring a fresh challenge each play. You'll also have to deal with the changing seasons, narrative tasks and various creepy shenanigans.\nAdditionally there will be an Endless game mode, which strips all of the narrative and adds extra challenge and mechanics. The purpose of Endless is to simply survive for as long you can eke out with the yearly winter being your greatest nemesis.\nI've been working on the game in my free time and have laid much of the groundwork in terms of the engine and content, but would like to commit to developing the game full-time allowing me to finish it in short order.

With these influences in mind we\u2019re creating an epic, replayable turn-based tactics game where you train generations of heroes to repel a demonic invasion.\nAnd with Kickstarter, we can do it. We have a great concept and team ready to go, and we want to work closely with our community to control the future of MASSIVE CHALICE free from outside interference.\nMASSIVE CHALICE is a single player turn-based tactics game within a multi-generational strategy campaign built for replayability.\nAs an immortal King or Queen, you must unite your kingdom under a powerful dynasty, eliminate the demonic threat, and reforge the MASSIVE CHALICE!\nThe game is structured into two main layers: strategy and tactics. In the strategy layer, you oversee your kingdom, arrange royal marriages, conduct research, and make the far-reaching decisions that will determine the fate of your legacy.\nIn the tactics layer, you fight brutal turn-based battles to defend your kingdom using small squads of customizable heroes.\nForest environment (early concept) - click for Hi-Res version\nPermadeath is inevitable: your heroes will grow, age, and eventually die. You'll have to choose between keeping your favorite heroes on the battlefield or retiring them from combat to foster a new generation of warriors.\nA Hero (early concept)\nDrawing from roguelikes we love, content is modular and randomized. Each playthrough begins with a random assortment of male and female heroes from various bloodlines, guaranteeing that each game is unique. Your knowledge and skill will increase over multiple playthroughs, but the details of every game will change based on your decisions and the whims of fate.\nStrategic map (early concept)\nCore Game Features\nYour story emerges as you defend against attacks, complete quests, and respond to randomized events in your attempt to preserve the kingdom.\nLine of sight and fog of war mechanics come into play as your squad explores beautiful dynamic 3D battlefields where danger may lurk behind any corner.\nDistinct, customizable heroes learn new melee, ranged, and arcane abilities as they age and gain combat experience.\nArrange marriage alliances to ensure your heroic bloodlines can handle any future combat situation.\nBattle alongside your ancestors by equipping your heroes with uniquely powerful Bloodline Relics.\nInvest your resources in forging new weapons and armor\u2014and gamble on polluting a bloodline by researching dangerous demonic artifacts.\n\nAnother Double Fine Kickstarter?\nLast year, you Kickstarted Double Fine Adventure, shattering records and bringing video games to the Kickstarter spotlight! Now known as Broken Age, that game is in full production and is already a beautiful and unique experience\u2014but the Broken Age team only represents a third of our multi-game studio.\nDouble Fine\u2019s goal is for all our teams to remain independent and responsible directly to their players. Kickstarting MASSIVE CHALICE allows us to maintain a pure creative vision, put out updates on our own schedule, respond to feedback without roadblocks, and release it all DRM-free.\nWhere are your stretch goals?\nThis Kickstarter is clean and simple. We\u2019re asking for the minimum amount to make an awesome game, and the game\u2019s scope will grow based on the amount of total backing we receive. There will be ongoing conversations with the community as new features are considered, so stay tuned and let us know what you'd like to see in the game!\nFor MASSIVE CHALICE we\u2019re getting back to basics and focusing on the project itself. We\u2019re a team passionate about turn-based strategy, and we want to craft a new Double Fine world by partnering with you!\nLimited edition poster designed by Cory Schmitz\nLimited edition t-shirt designed by Cory Schmitz\n2 Player Productions is well known to Double Fine fans as the awesome team of filmmakers behind the Double Fine Adventure and Amnesia Fortnight documentary series.\nIt turns out they aren't sick of us yet!

Brad is a turn-based strategy and roguelike fanatic, and is the friendliest guy you'll ever meet! :D!\nDouble Fine Productions is an award-winning, independent game development studio founded in 2000 by games industry veteran Tim Schafer. Located in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market district, Double Fine is committed to making high-quality games with an emphasis on originality, story, characters, and fun.\nThe MASSIVE CHALICE team comprises artists, designers, and engineers who recently worked on Double Fine projects like The Cave, Br\u00fctal Legend PC, Dropchord, Middle Manager of Justice, and various prototypes. The crew is ready to work on something big. Something MASSIVE.\nThe Buddha Engine\nMASSIVE CHALICE is being developed with Buddha, our versatile in-house 3D engine first created for Br\u00fctal Legend.

We believe we can find a substantial audience for this unique combination of strategy, squad tactics, and multi-generational gameplay.\n\nMASSIVE CHALICE is still in its earliest stages, so its backers will join us for every phase of development. We're tackling a new genre for Double Fine, but building on our years of experience making games of all types with our own technology.\n\nGames are complicated and expensive projects, but MASSIVE CHALICE has been scoped appropriately for our fundraising goal.

How do you play?\nCustomize: Each player begins the game by choosing and customizing a Tier 1 starship. Invest all your money in engines and be a rapid, yet fragile, explorer. Put all your credits into an uber missile and watch other players flee in terror. Get a small engine and save space and credits to invest in buying and selling cargo. Or create a well rounded ship, ready for anything. In Xia, the choice is always yours.\nCustomize your ship!\nAdapt: The goal of Xia is to become the most famous captain. Completing missions, besting ships in combat, purchasing higher tier ships, selling Cargo Cubes and claiming Titles are all ways that players can earn Fame Points. The best pilots will adapt to their surroundings, making snap judgments and changing plans on-the-fly. If you can think on your feet, you'll do well in Xia!\nSandbox: The real fun of Xia is that each game will be different. There is no set direction of play, players may choose to be peaceful traders, fierce pirates, workers, miners, opportunists, etc. The game board is randomly laid out and explored each time you play. Players might choose not to explore at all, creating a tiny arena for swift and deadly combat, or explore all 19 sectors and have a large play-scape to exploit. It's up to you!\nDon't take our word for it!\nUndead Viking posts a 50 minute epic preview:\nDice Tower's Tom Vasel has posted an awesome overview of Xia:\nTom Vasel also mentions us in his May 20 news post!\nCheck out James Floyd Kelly's in-depth preview!\nPreview by James Floyd Kelly\nWhat makes Xia awesome?\n\u2022 Stacking ship powers: Each ship has a unique special ability. When you purchase a new ship, you get to keep your previous ability, allowing you to stack up to three abilities for powerful combinations!\nClick to enlarge\n\u2022 Pre-painted ship miniatures: 15 gorgeous and inspired miniatures (12 player ships & 3 NPC ships).\n3D printed prototypes, not final versions.\n\u2022 Legal / Illegal Missions: Legal missions are a great source of income and fame for upstanding citizens. However, a captain can make more money outside of the law, but at greater risk.\nClick to enlarge\n\u2022 Bounty system: You can choose the quick an easy path...but it will cost you. Illegal acts will make you a wanted fugitive, operating on the fringes.\n\u2022 NPCs: 3 NPCs each with their own agenda that fly and interact with players and each other. A villainous Scoundrel, the unyielding Enforcer, and the wealthy Merchant.\nClick to enlarge\n\u2022 Exploration: Exploration is engaging, dangerous, and fun! You start each game with only a small portion of the system revealed. There are two ways to explore: You can stop your ship, spend valuable energy, and scan a nearby sector. Or you can blind jump into the unknown, maintaining velocity, but possibly flying into danger! You decide: Gamble? Or play it safe?\nClick to enlarge\n\u2022 Variable game length: Choose how many points to play to at the start of the game. Feel like a quick rush for points? Or an epic adventure? It's up to you!\n\u2022 Titles: Think of Titles as \"achievements\" that randomly come up as you play.When you stride into the spaceport bar others will whisper of your exploits... become the \"Dare Devil\" by flying through a dangerous asteroid field or the \"Velocity Warden\" by racing across the system.\nClick to enlarge\n\u2022 Trade system: You can buy cargo to fill your hold and sell it at a profit, but you can also mine, salvage, or harvest goods, though those options are not without their own risks. If your ship is full of cargo, other players may target you to try and take the goods for their own!\n\u2022 Energy system: Will you be able to make it two more sectors to deliver your cargo? Or should you take the safe route and go out of your way to refuel? Managing your ship's energy is an important part of Xia.\n\u2022 Damage system: When you take damage you have to decide where your ship is hit. Will you take damage on your engine, crippling your ship? Or will you sacrifice your valuable cargo, watching it spiral out to space as you flee for your life? \n\u2022 Delicious flavor text: Each Mission has a story to draw you deeper into the universe. Every ship has a \"Back Story\" detailing how you came by her, as well as a \"Victory Story\" which you get to read aloud to your friends when you win!\n\u2022 Multiple paths to victory: Every path has its strengths and weaknesses. Combat is totally optional (but totally awesome). There isn't one \"best\" strategy. A good player will adapt, plan ahead, and stack the odds to win!\nClick to enlarge\n\nWhat about 3D printing and modding?\nIf this project is funded, we will fully support 3D printing and modding! The goal is for players to be able to create their very own starships, complete with Ship Cards, Special Ability Cards, and Miniatures!\nThat sounds great, but let's get specific:\n1. We'll release Ship Card, and Special Ability Card templates. These will be Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop files. With these templates you'll be able to make your own custom ship cards for your creations using the same art we're using to print Xia!\n2. 3D Printing - We will release a mini-expansion of at least 3 NEW official ships that you'll be able to print out using a 3D printer. These ships will have Ship Cards and Special Ability Cards that will only be available to print yourself!\n3. We'll release \"How to's\" and tutorials on how to create your very own starships! Not a 3D modeler?  No problem, we'll show you where you can hire an artist! Don't have a 3D printer? No worries! You can use www.shapeways.com to print out our 3D files. Or make your own and have them printed there!\n4. If the community is excited, we'll try and be a hub where players can share their creations and find new ships to print*!\n(Note: To create 3D models you'll need a modeling program, like Blender)\n*Obviously we can't host anything that's copyrighted!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nMy name is Cody Miller. Xia: Legends of a Drift System is my passion project, it's my dream.\nIt's just me. There's no big company, no media machine, no team of artists. I've poured the last 7 years of my free-time into this game. The only help I've had has been from Steve \"Coolhand\" Tyler (http://coolhand.cgsociety.org) who created the awesome 3D models and 2D renders of the starships. Everything else I've done myself (with the love and support of my gorgeous wife and amazing sons!).\nIf this was a video game I'd upload it to Steam and see how things went, but a board game takes quite a bit of money to get started. Especially if you want pre-painted miniatures!\nI work full time, I'm a full time student, I have a wife and two boys, my paychecks are instantly transmuted into diapers and electric bills...\nI realize that the goal is very high, I didn't want to compromise on cheap cardboard components, or generic plastic pawns, I wanted painted miniatures, and something I would feel had a great value.\nI began looking at Kickstarter last year, and it seemed the perfect solution, so that's why I'm here.\nThank you for your support, I am very excited for you to play Xia!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks come in mostly logistical forms. Production delays are the primary risk.

The game uses a new OpenCL system based on the Unity 3D engine to allow players to change the terrain in anyway, create new objects in any form, and do it anywhere.\nIn Planet Explorers, it is the year 2287, one of the first colony ships sent out by Earth arrives at the planet Maria, in the Epsilon Indi Star System. During its landing sequence, something appears in front of the massive ship that causes it to lose control and crash into the planet. Some of the colonists survive in lifeboats, but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must explore, gather, build, create, fight, and ultimately, establish a lasting new home.\nThe gameplay will be in 3rd and 1st person perspectives. Players will be able to customize their character, combine and create weapons, vehicles, and buildings. At the same time, players will have to defeat multitudes of enemies of varying intelligence and defend the remnants of the colonists. This is an RPG, so it will feature a full story arc complete with missions and side quests. The game will feature a single player story line as well as random single and multiplayer adventure maps. Multiplayer, both through LAN and online, will be featured prominently in Planet Explorers, including but not limited to build mode, adventure mode, cooperation mode, and versus mode.\nPlanet Explorers will be for PC and MAC for sure. Linux will be very likely (we're using the Unity engine, so it's a given, but we're testing this next week to be sure). No mobile versions are planned at this time. \nSingle Player\nStory Mode \u2013 Story mode is the main meat and bones of the game. It is the action-adventure-RPG-somewhat-4X segment, offering NPCs, missions, town building, farming, diplomacy, and of course, a storyline that you can follow or ignore. This story features a 17X8km world map with many unique characters, landscapes, biomes, locations, and over 100 types of potential enemies. In the final game, the map will be completely open from the start, and there will be landmarks to remember, scenic sites to see, extensive cave systems to explore. Even though we\u2019ve made it seem like a very action oriented game in the trailers, in reality, players can choose not to fight so much or at all, and instead just to plant a farm, make some food, keep the colonists alive, negotiate with the sentient aliens, and defend the perimeter from the local life forms. That can still eventually arrive at the ending. And yes, there is an ending.\nAdventure Mode \u2013 This mode is based on a procedural map generated from a seed. Currently, it comes in 256X256m and 512X512m sizes, and the plan is to make it infinite. Players will be able to complete random missions in the mode and eventually be able to setup conditions that they want to play (such as tower defense or attack an alien camp). This will eventually become the de facto survival mode as well, where the player can still perform the functions of the story mode (such as town building and NPC gathering) without the story.\nBuild Mode \u2013 In this mode, there are no enemies but an infinite amount of building materials. It also currently comes in 256X256m and 512X512m sizes with a plan of infinite terrain later. Players will be able to build whatever they want in this mode, including everything in the Creations Editor. Think of this as the perfect testing ground to test everything you build. Or\u2026it\u2019s your place to build your garden without ever worrying about the pesky aliens.\nMultiplayer\nMultiplayer will allow Local Area Network, Player Hosted Server, and Online. It will feature several modes but some are still on the drawing board or going through technical trials so the final result is still in flux. Players playing multiplayer should be able to bring in at least one of their created objects, be it a sword, gun, or vehicle, and the plan is, of course, to allow more.\nCoop \u2013 Coop will come in many selections, such as adventure mode, tower defense mode, build mode, etc. The first one to be available will be build mode, since it\u2019s the easiest for us to do.\nVersus \u2013 This mode will allow a team of up to 4 players to battle against 4 players from another team. We plan to allow for full terrain manipulation in this mode, but it\u2019s not a given. We are going to have base defense, capture the flag, and something similar to DOTA.\nSmooth Voxel Terrain - Want a different look for once from the blocky usual? Planet Explorers uses the Marching Cubes algorithm to calculate a smooth and diverse terrain.\nLong View Distances - Players can enjoy vistas of up to 1km from where he or she is standing through LOD, not too many voxel games can pull this off.\nLarge Overworld \u2013 The main story world is actually NOT procedural. We went out of our way to make a unique 17X8km sized continent. There are also some large islands. The world will contain multiple biomes from grassland to rain forest to volcanic plains. The world is large, once you walk around it, you'll know the feeling.\nProcedural Worlds \u2013 We also made it available for players to play on procedurally generated worlds in both adventure and building modes.\nCreations System - A subsystem in the game that enables the player to construct weapons, vehicles, planes, boats, objects, and maybe even mechs. \nBuilding and Digging - Like pretty much all other voxel games, you'll be able to build and dig anywhere. Unlike a lot of other voxel games, we'll have a lot more types of resources (uranium, anyone?).\nReplication System - The player will be able to find templates within the game called Scripts. Once the player gets enough materials required by each script, he or she will be able to replicate the object into being through his or her pocket replicator. There will be many objects.\nA Science Fiction Colonization Story - We're being very careful in what we put in the game so that it stays true to the spirit of space exploration, and you are not likely to see completely impossible things (mostly). It's not hardcore scifi though, as we don't want to scare people off. This game at its heart, is for those of us who want to be a stranger in a strange land for a few hours (or maybe a few days or weeks).\nMultiplayer - We want to have the voxel gathering and building and mix in a little MMO style action for our multiplayer experience. Plus something like DOTA. We want players to be able to enjoy multiplayer long after they've played the single player. We want people to make vehicles and battle it out Twisted Metal style. We want a lot of things.\nBeautiful Set Pieces - We have spent a lot of time designing everything on Planet Maria. Every tree and animal you see in the game is part of that ecosystem, and they will look the part. We want to take players on a grand adventure in a very alien setting.\nEnemies - There are a lot of enemies (eventually over 100 types) for the players to encounter, some will be out to get you and some will run from you. They are on the land, in the air, underwater, and even underground. Some are dumb as rocks and some are as smart as you.\nBuild Your Own Settlement - The player will have the option of building a settlement in the game and recruit some NPCs to come and live in it. The town building will feature upgradable buildings and structures that are required to get better equipment or some other functions.\nFarming and Growing - Everyone in the player built settlements must have food to survive, so it's the player's responsibility to figure out ways to feed the population, from farming to herding to fishing. That won't be easy, from predators and alien raid parties.\nDiplomacy or War? - There are sentient alien species on Maria, they are a mystery. There will be a lot of run ins with them. The player will need to decide to fight them or leave them alone or build a diplomatic relationship with them. You are the intruder after all, so while you might fear them, they also fear you and this will be reflected in their actions accordingly.\nYou might say, \u201cOh great, another voxel game!\u201d Understandable sentiment, but we\u2019re trying to do something different. We\u2019re not just going for the open world sandbox gameplay that everyone else\u2019s doing. We\u2019re actually adding in a fairly comprehensive storyline that gives purpose to the player\u2019s actions. We\u2019re aiming to make a RPG that uses gathering resources as a part of the gameplay and building as an aid to combat. At the same time, we\u2019re retaining the procedural aspects of the genre to allow players to enjoy that part as well.\nWhen we first started working on Planet Explorers, we believed in 2 things. First, space exploration is awesome. And second, the future of gaming will in large part be driven by user generated content. The idea of gathering resources and building what you need was there from the start, but using voxels to do it wasn't. When we eventually did turn to voxels, the project was already pretty sizable in scope.\nWe've been working on this game for over a year now and it's finally starting to turn into what we'd aimed for. At where we stand, we have enough budget to finish a bare minimum game, but not enough to add in every feature, storyline, and technology that we want. That's where Kickstarter comes in. We hope that what we've managed to put together so far is enough to convince you that it's something you want to play when it's completed, enough so that you will support us on our way there.\nYou might also ask: \"Well, that's a lot of content you want to put in, how can I be sure that you'll actually get this done?\" The answer is we have a team of about 15 hard working people right now, that's pretty big for an indie game, so we currently already have the actual capacity to see everything to the end! We're not making empty or far fetched promises. You can see the difference from our announce trailer back in March 2012 to this current trailer for yourself. \nWhat we need the cash for:\nFinishing up the Game - We have a very tight budget right now, and we need help to sustain the team until the game is finished. We've got a great team working on this game, as you can see from the videos, screenshots and from playing the Alphas, so you can rest assured that we\u2019re not messing around. We want to finish this more than anyone else and make it as good as we possibly can.\nMusic and Effects - Getting great music and FX costs a lot of money, we want to be able to hire a great composer and effects artist for this game. \nSoftware and Hardware - Both are very expensive, but we are constantly in need of new software and hardware, especially Unity engine related things (such as 4.0).\nMore and Tighter Contents - We want a few more programmers to shore up the AI and more artists to add in more contents. We also want the multiplayer to not just be an afterthought but an integral part of the game. Oh yeah, and more things to replicate!\nCharacter Customization \u2013 We want a fully customizable character editor as well as multitudes of hairstyles, face styles, facial hair styles and so on to pick from.\nExtra Contents - We have many story branch and game play ideas that we want to implement, a little extra cash will give us the budget to do it. We want to take players to underwater ruins and the surfaces of the moons!\nServer Cost - We would like to be able to host some of the games on our servers, and the servers cost a ton.\nBetter Graphics - We want to spend more time on getting more effects, shaders, and better lighting into the game.\nModding - We want to make it available for people to mod the game, for that we also need to write a lot more code for an editor and such (since Unity isn't very mod friendly by itself).\nMultiple Language Support - We would like to translate this game to as many languages as possible.\nWorld Editor \u2013 We want to let players make their own custom maps for single and multiplayer.\nQA - This costs a lot more than people think. We need to get many different graphics cards just to test out all the problems. We also need to hire QA testers in studio as the storyline gets bigger and bigger. \nPlease note:  we put the estimated delivery time of the rewards as Feb 2014 because that's when the game comes out. We should be able to deliver on the alpha/beta testing with build a0.6 starting in May. We'll try to get the other deliverables out to backers when they're all ready so we can pack them together. For the designer perks, we'll start to work together shortly after the Kickstarter ends.

Plus everything from the previous tier.\nThe backer will collaborate with the Pathea team and design a reasonable (must fit the game world) sidequest that will be in the final game (1 business week of 1 programmer, 1 artist, and 1 animator's time, prep time doesn't count), and the backer will also be named an honorary designer in the credits.

Plus everything from the previous tier.\nPathea Games is an indie game studio based in Memphis, USA, and Chongqing, China, made up of a small team of individuals who want to make some fun games.

More than anyone else, we want to finish this project the best we can. This is our baby. It will make or break the studio, so we're putting our all into it. \n\nWe've been very open with the game's development on our own boards at pathea.net as well as the TIGsource borads, and we take comments and concerns from our players very seriously. In fact, a lot of the new changes in game came from player suggestions. We will continue to do so long after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\n\nWe are trying to make this game compatible with as many computers as possible. Due to the use of newer tech, some computers will not be able to play the game. Please try the alpha to see if your computer has problems running the game.\n\nWe've had fairly regular build updates, usually with an interval of a month or 2, and the progress can be seen by all. When we say we will try to include something, we really will find a way to try it. We can't promise the end game will be to all of your liking, but you can be sure that we will try our hardest to make it a game that players will enjoy and will remember.\n\nHowever, we do need to remind everyone that making games isn't always a smooth sailing and there are a lot of uncertainties (especially the programming part). We aim to have this game out by the end of 2013, but we put Feb 2014 instead to give ourselves a little breathing room. If it comes out early, it'll be a pleasant surprise.

Something bad. The chickens normally have such a happy life scratching around for corn and laying the occasional egg. Now they\u2019ve noticed that their numbers seem to be thinning out. Most nights, a chicken disappears without warning and no-one knows where they go. Well, no-one apart from the foxes who live in the woods just beyond the henhouse\u2026\nFULLY FUNDED AND ALL STRETCH GOALS UNLOCKED!\nSo we funded in 22 hours and 51 minutes. That was pretty quick! Like, unexpectedly quick! We had no idea that our little project would turn out to be so popular and we've now maxed out our Stretch Goals. Here's what you'll be getting with Fox & Chicken...\nWant more? Check our ROOSTER PACKS\nThese are entirely optional card sets that will enhance your Fox & Chicken experience! We're sure you're going to love them... We currently have three available - Barn Wars, The Geek Pack and AWESOMEIFICATION. If you'd like them, add \u00a33 to your pledge for each set!\nHow do you play Fox & Chicken?\nFox & Chicken is a (slightly) more family friendly take on the classic party game Werewolf. You may also know it as Mafia but, however you play, the idea is the same. Players are handed a card at the start of a game that gives them a secret role, splitting them into two teams \u2013 in the case of our game, you\u2019re either on the side of the nasty Foxes or the innocent but tasty Chickens. You win or lose as a team \u2013 it\u2019ll either end up with Vulpine Victory or Cheering Chickens! Before play starts, everyone must close their eyes tight, then one player \u2013 the Storyteller, who is in control of the game \u2013 asks the Foxes to reveal themselves as secretly as possible. Now it\u2019s time for the fun to start!  \nTurns take place over two phases: Day and Night. During the Day, everyone gets to discuss who they think the Foxes are. Of course, you shouldn\u2019t admit to it if you are \u2013 you\u2019re ACTIVELY encouraged to lie about it! After a certain amount of time, decided by the Storyteller, all players must choose a single player to be eliminated. This is followed by a vote where, assuming there is a majority, the player reveals what their secret role actually was. If all the Foxes are revealed over the course of the game, the Chickens are victorious! \nNo matter if someone is eliminated or not, Night must always follow Day. This is where the Foxes get to be mean and nasty. Everyone must close their eyes and go to sleep, but the Storyteller will then ask the Foxes to quietly wake up. Between them they must decide on a poor unfortunate Chicken to eat by using a combination of pointing, staring and sign language. When they\u2019ve decided, they close their eyes again; Day breaks, the Storyteller reveals which Chicken has disappeared and the next round begins. If all the Chicken players are eliminated (well, eaten), the Fox team wins. \nFull rules are available by clicking this link!\nAnd that is it! Fox & Chicken is a game that encourages discussion, duplicity and deviousness. Anyone can play as long as they\u2019re able to keep a straight face and speak the occasional bare-faced lie; we\u2019ve had great success with everyone from geeky grown-ups to kids as young as six or seven. We suggest that you choose someone who can spin a tale well to act as The Storyteller for each game but, aside from that, absolutely anyone can get involved! \nWith simple rules and gloriously cute artwork, Fox & Chicken is the perfect party game for any group who enjoy a bit of silly interaction and light confrontation. It can be taken and played anywhere \u2013 each copy comes in its own drawstring bag, meaning that you carry it with you wherever you go. Camping? Perfect! Lunchbreak at the office? Ideal! You have everything you need to play with up to TWENTY-SIX people! Include the Rooster Packs and that number increases to THIRTY-SIX!

All sketches are approximately A5 size and will come on high quality bristol board, sent directly to you in super secure packaging. Stick it in a frame and put it on your wall! \nMarvellous minigames!\nWe also plan to reveal some extra secrets during the campaign - entirely new minigames you can play with your Fox & Chicken deck! While Michael has already come up with a few, we'll be looking for your help with this as well, rewarding those whose ideas we really love with free copies of the game and credits in the rules - at the moment we have three that are tested and officially declared fun:\n- CAPTURE!

With Torment, we're striving to create a rich role-playing experience that explores similar deep, personal themes. Here's the scoop:\nTorment is a single-player, isometric role-playing game.\nYou will play a single, specific character, though you will encounter optional NPC companions you may choose to include in your party.\nThe story-driven game will have a rich dialogue system.\nThe game will be developed in the Unity engine for PC (Windows), Mac, and Linux platforms.\nThe game will be available in English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, Spanish.\nThe game will be distributed DRM-free.

Mostly because awesome.\"\n- Markus \"Notch\" Persson, creator of Minecraft and owner of Mojang, on his pledge to Torment: Tides of Numenera\nTorment's Four Pillars\nFour pillars undergird the Torment name and, despite all the shake we'll do of RPG conventions, we'll stay true to these throughout the development of Torment: Tides of Numenera.\nA Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary weapons.\nA World Unlike Any Other. The game has a fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals, imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic. In Numenera, however, \u201cmagic\u201d is actually something surprisingly different.\nA Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is thoughtful and character-driven\u2014epic in feel but a deeply personal narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.\nReactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won\u2019t tell you how to play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from your actions throughout the game.\nClick this header to learn more about our story at our tumblr site\nThe original Torment was a novel experience, a genre-defying game that helped redefine what was possible in RPG storytelling. We mentioned our Four Pillars above, and describe them in greater detail at our tumblr site.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of our story:\n\nYou are the Last Castoff, the final link in the chain of the lives of the being they call the Changing God. He once was a man who discovered a way to use the relics of the ancients to cheat death and skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he never knew that his bodies lived on as his consciousness fled, a new consciousness arising in each. Now he has awakened an age-old enemy, the Angel of Entropy, and his days of change are gone as the Angel hunts him and all his works. That includes... you.\n\nWith the ever-present threat of oblivion looming over you, you must find your sire before he\u2014and you\u2014are eradicated by the avenging Angel. You will find allies and enemies among the other castoffs. You might inhabit their minds for a time through the devices called \u201cthe Meres,\u201d turning their lives to your advantage. You will travel across the face of the Ninth World, and above and below it, with your companions at your side\u2014or alone, if you wish. Your quest will take you to alternate dimensions and distant worlds under strange suns; particular Meres might afford you even more bizarre experiences, such as folding time itself. And you will build your legacy as you find your answer to the question:\n\nWhat does one life matter?\nSojourner of Worlds (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about gameplay at our tumblr site\nTorment will have a strong emphasis on story and character development, which will permeate other facets of gameplay, such as combat and exploration. The Ninth World is a place of great mystery and wonder, all waiting to be discovered. To read more details of our gameplay plans, including information on Combat, Dialogue, and Companions, please visit our tumblr site.\nYou'll play the role of a specific individual. At the game\u2019s start, however, you are a blank slate and have control over the path you take through the story, and you will also make choices to customize your abilities and skills. We\u2019re taking the approach of having you role-play a specific individual so that we can focus on telling a very personal tale \u2013 yours.\nDust and Water (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nWhat Are the Tides?\nThere are unseen forces in the Ninth World, forces that have profound and lasting effects for those attuned to their motions. Like gravity or magnetism, the Tides are invisible, powerful, and with the right tools, perhaps controllable.\nThe Tides represent complicated concepts that aren't entirely definable by language. Those who acknowledge the Tides have given them symbolic colors based on how they appear to correspond with emotional and psychological reactions. For example:\nThe Tides reflect your choices, the subtle currents of motivation that ripple through your life.\nThe colors are important, because a word like \"justice\" (for example) is too simplistic. The Indigo Tide represents not only justice and fairness; it might also mean a desire for the greater good or an \"end justifies the means\" mentality. The Gold Tide can represent false philanthropy as well as martyrdom\u2014it's the actions that matter, not the motivations. In the game, the Tides serve as a kind of alignment system\u2014but a more nuanced one, and one that does not judge actions based on whether they are good or evil. You'll learn more about the Tides as you explore Torment. And the Tides will gradually change based on your actions and decisions, ultimately determining your Legacy.\nWhat Do You Mean by My Legacy?\nThere's your legacy, the stories others tell about you and the inspirations they find in your life, and your Legacy, which we're systematizing here. Your Legacy is determined by which Tides you manipulate the most. Do you use your wisdom to help others? Do you seek power for the greater good? Maybe you're an avenger, taking whatever action is necessary to aid those around you. Perhaps you're just in it for the prestige. (Or money. People are always in it for the money.) As your choices move the Tides, your Legacy will be revealed.\nYour Legacy also influences the world around you. Weapons and relics may have different bonuses for characters with certain Legacies. Some of them might respond positively if you've revealed yourself to be a thinker or an artist, while others might help you only if you're moved by passion and power.\nYour Legacy opens new potential abilities. Some Legacies can change the very structure of your body, giving you superhuman powers: the ability to read the past in the minds of the dead, for instance, or a nearly supernatural affinity with weapons.\nSagus Cliffs at Dawn (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about our team at our tumblr site\nTorment is being developed by inXile entertainment, a mid-sized independent game developer located in Newport Beach, CA. inXile was founded by Brian Fargo in 2002 and is best known for its action-RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale. The Android version of that game was released in fall 2012, topping the charts and winning several awards. \nWith inXile, Brian has embraced the crowdfunding approach. He is a vocal advocate of circumventing the traditional publisher-developer business model, with developers instead communicating and working directly with the players.\nOur experience with crowd funding has been wonderfully positive for us at inXile and has opened our eyes to the power of a direct relationship with the gamers. We want to create RPGs in a fashion and style that helped to make the true classics. And along these lines we've abandoned the typical developer/publisher model and placed our future in the hands of RPG gamers. We've embraced the crowd in every aspect. YOU are our publisher...and you are the best publisher we've ever worked with!\nThis process allows us to create the games exactly the way you want to see them. There is a purity of development when we can spend 100% of our efforts making the game with an open dialogue throughout the process. We'll start with a strong vision document that details our sensibilities, and from there we'll stay in sync with you, from concept through the execution of the ideas.\nWe've discovered that the best way to create a deep and rich RPG is to begin the pre-production process long before the production team have finished their current project. If we waited to begin the design work for a large scale RPG until after the programming team has completed their work, our budget would increase by 50% or more.  This would result in the hiring and firing process that happens all too often in our industry. We want to break that model and keep our great team together. This is why it makes sense for us to begin work on Torment now rather than later. The process has served us well in the past and allows us to bring you the best RPGs. If you have any concerns about our ability to deliver a great one, we encourage you to review our first look video of Wasteland 2 that was released just a few weeks ago.\nWe're grateful for all the support and look forward to bringing you the kind of role-playing games that we all love to play.\nWith Torment, Brian pledged to personally add $100k to the project if we reached the $900,000 goal but fell short of a million. And if funding beat $1 million, he pledged to instead contribute 10 cents from every $1 pledged from the $1 million to $2 million mark. Brian is thus kicking in $100K of his own (this is not reflected in the Kickstarter total and all will be applied directly to the development budget). Torment superfan Steve Dengler (@Dracogen) picked up the torch when we reached $2M, matching 10% of every donation from $2 to $3 million, and thus also putting in $100K of his own. These matches will be added post-Kickstarter to help offset failed pledges, and do not count towards stretch goals.\nThis product is participating in Brian Fargo\u2019s Kicking It Forward initiative, promising to pledge 5% of its post-release profit to other Kickstarter projects. We are proud to join the over 200 successfully funded Kickstarter projects whose founders share Brian\u2019s vision of supporting the independent efforts of others.\nThe Ascension of Kex-Lianish (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nBy pledging at an amount above the Tier you have selected, you can include Add-Ons.

Fortunately, we collectively have more than 80 years of experience in managing them. Given our great progress in developing Wasteland 2, our experience with the technology, and our approach to Torment\u2019s design and production, we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a quality game deserving of the Torment name.\n\nTorment\u2019s schedule has been designed to maximize both planning (preproduction) and polishing. This extended preproduction period controls costs and increases quality because we\u2019ll have a very well-defined product before production begins. Our target release date of December 2014 allows us 14 months for production and finalization. (In comparison, Wasteland 2 had 12 months, and Mask of the Betrayer had nine.) Furthermore, various systems and tools developed for Wasteland 2 will be used or adapted for Torment, saving development time and budget.\n\nWith a longer schedule, you might wonder how we\u2019ll be able to create Torment if it receives less funding than Wasteland 2 did. First, Torment's story is being designed to be highly modular and scalable. This approach not only lets us increase game reactivity and replayability, but it also let us keep the game's scope flexible. At our target funding, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a complete and satisfying game and as funding increases above the target, Torment will continue to grow in depth and size. But, as resources allow \u2013 if Wasteland 2 is a commercial success, for example \u2013 we are ready to expand the modular story. \n\nAlso, inXile has established secondary revenue streams that will bolster Torment\u2019s development budget. For example, last September, The Bard\u2019s Tale was released on Android, winning many awards and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in just a few months. While this doesn\u2019t provide enough money to create a game like Torment, it lets us invest in Wasteland 2 and Torment to improve their quality. Although Torment would not be possible without your support, we are self-funding a portion of the game as well.

This is actively being worked on while this Kickstarter project is live.\nFor more information about how heroes work, see UPDATE #5 - Heroes Explained.\nNecromancer hero artwork.\nDeveloping Dungeon Roll has been a joy. It has grown to become one of the most exciting games for TMG to ever release. It feels magical, mystical, even mythic. Throughout development, the game got awesomer and more components were added. \nThe creative work and manufacturing cost for at least 10,000 copies of Dungeon Roll will require about $36,500. I have already committed TMG to spend about $8,300 on artwork, molds for custom dice, and other setup costs.  That still leaves TMG to pay for more artwork (additional heroes), manufacturing, ocean freight, and delivery to Kickstarter backers. These are HUGE items, especially the delivery to backers which will cost about $6.25 per copy in the USA. This Kickstarter project will determine just how awesome Dungeon Roll will be.\nFor more details on the finances behind this project, see UPDATE #7 - Behind The Curtain: Finances of Dungeon Roll\nTo overstuff the treasure chest box with everything we want and keep a price of $15 requires printing tens of thousands of copies! To fully fund the cost of a printing of 10,000 copies would require a funding level of $75,000.  This would allow us to keep the $15 price point for the non-Kickstarter retail world.\nWith that said, we are comfortable making and delivering Dungeon Roll if we only raise $15,000. It just won't be at the grand scale that we are currently imagining!\nThis is why we are on Kickstarter.\nCommander hero artwork.\nBelow are some important updates to the project which you might be interested in if you are seeing this for the first time:\nUpdate #23 - More preliminary artwork & decisions...\nUpdate #22 - Mimic Box Art Unleashed\nUpdate #20 - FREE BONUS - Treasures Explained (& Artwork) - Respect The Streak\nUpdate #19 - Mimic Unlocked - Stretch Goal Finances - 23 hour referrer analytics\nUpdate #14 - BACKERS ONLY - Print and play files available, if you want to get these, you can pledge for as little as $1.\nUpdate #7 - Behind The Curtain: Finances Of Dungeon Roll\nUpdate #5 - Heroes Explained...\nUpdate #4 - BACKERS ONLY - Supporter Avatars - Use these for your Kickstarter, social media, or forum avatars to show you are a backer!\nEnchantress Hero Artwork\n\nThanks to your support, I can live my dream of publishing wonderful games, connecting people, and strengthening families.

We have published over a dozen games, including 2 previous dice games, and are familiar with the process.\n\nA delay in delivering Dungeon Roll is likely to come from one of 3 main sources, artwork, manufacturing quality control, and freight logistics. We have taken steps to ensure that delivery will be on time, but that cannot always happen on time.\n\nWe see a wider release at GenCon as critical to the short-term and long-term sales success of Dungeon Roll. We will not sell Dungeon Roll at GenCon if Kickstarter backers have not been shipped their copies.

Well now you can!\n3Doodler is the world\u2019s first and only 3D Printing Pen. Using ABS plastic (the material used by many 3D printers), 3Doodler draws in the air or on surfaces. It\u2019s compact and easy to use, and requires no software or computers. You just plug it into a power socket and can start drawing anything within minutes.\nThe latest model 3Doodler\nOh, and it\u2019s also the most affordable way to 3D print\u2026 by a looong way! With 3Doodler we\u2019re making fun 3D creation accessible to everyone.\nHow does it work?\nIf you can scribble, trace or wave a finger in the air you can use a 3Doodler.\n3Doodler in action\nAs 3Doodler draws, it extrudes heated plastic, which quickly cools and solidifies into a strong stable structure. This allows you to build an infinite variety of shapes and items with ease! Most people will instantly be able to trace objects on paper, and after only a few hours of practice you will be able to make far more intricate objects.\n3Doodler is a brand new way of creating objects and artistic works. Whether you are an artist, hobbyist or 3D printing fanatic, we can\u2019t wait to see what you 3Doodle!\nSix little men and the other one said... 3Doodler! 3Doodler!\nWhat can I make with 3Doodler? \nThere are many ways 3Doodler can be used. 3Doodles can be created as flat forms and peeled off a piece of paper, as freestyle 3D objects, or in separate parts, ready to be joined together using the 3Doodler. The creative opportunities are endless, including:\nBasic 3D shapes and 3D models\nJewellery, pendants and hanging ornaments\nDecorative art and fridge magnets\nPersonalization of everyday objects (iPhone cases, laptops, pens, etc.)\nA mini Eiffel Tower or a soccer pitch for your Lego men\nAnd much much more\u2026\n3Doodler works on almost any surface, including plastic, allowing users to personalize items such as iPhone cases, or anything else they feel like 3Doodling on. 3Doodler can even be used for minor repair work.\n3Doodler \"stencils\"\nWe\u2019re particularly excited about 3Doodler \"stencils\" - sophisticated print-out stencil kits to help you create awesome objects (like our Eiffel Tower). We'll be making these available online for everyone. Simply print it out, 3Doodle each part according to the stencil and then join them with your 3Doodler. As time goes by we, and the 3Doodler community, will be able to create hundreds (maybe thousands) of stencil kits that can easily be emailed and shared with friends. We\u2019ll be hosting these on our website, the3Doodler.com, for anyone to download and use for free.\n2 ft Eiffel Tower Stencil\nWe\u2019re looking forward to seeing what people create and supporting 3Doodler communities everywhere.\nThe Sellers of Etsy Special\nWe're collaborating with some fantastic sellers on Etsy, all wire artists, to showcase how 3Doodler can be used to create beautiful objects and pieces of art. We're thrilled to be working with Bud Bullivant, Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight), Nakisha and Ele McKay to bring our vision to life. \nWire Art by Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight) - sparkflight.etsy.com\nWire Art by Bud Bullivant (wiredbybud.etsy.com)\nBud and Ruth will be creating a limited edition run of the first professional 3Doodles (see the Seller on Etsy Special Reward above). The ideas are already flowing, and we'll be working together to bring you a truly unique 3Doodle creation from these top artists. The expected size of the 3Doodle is approximately 4 x 2 inches. It will be beautifully boxed and shipped by August.\n\nNakisha will be producing an exclusive template for anyone ordering a 3Doodler. Created especially for you, the template will showcase 3Doodler's capabilities and allow you to make your very own artist-designed 3Doodles. And we'll be announcing a special collaboration with Ele shortly.\nWire Art by Ele McKay (elemckay.etsy.com)\nWire Art by Nakisha (wireanimals.etsy.com)\nMore to come on all of this in an Update! Bud, Ruth, Nakisha, Ele, we're truly grateful for your support!\n3Doodler Components & Accessories:\nThe pen: The 3Doodler pen is 180mm by 24mm. The pen weighs less than 200 grams or 7 ounces (the weight of a typical apple), although the exact weight will depend on the final shell specifications once in production. And we are using a universal power supply, so provided you have the correct adapter for your country, 3Doodler will work just fine on 110v or 240v.\nThe evolution of 3Doodler\n3Doodler is not a toy for children (it's recommended for ages 12+). While the plastic extruded from 3Doodler is safe to touch once it has left the pen, the pen itself has a metal tip that can get as hot as 270C. There is no reason for any user to touch the tip while in use, but safety comes first, and we are creating a video series that will explain how to use the 3Doodler, covering off the different techniques and safety precautions necessary.\nThe Ink (i.e. ABS/PLA plastic): The 3Doodler uses 3mm ABS or PLA plastic as its \"ink\" - just like a 3D printer. Each 3Doodler backed on Kickstarter comes with at least one bag of plastic; each bag will contain ten 1ft strands of plastic; and each 1 ft strand produces approximately 11 ft of 3Doodling fun... yes, you read that right, a foot of plastic goes a very long way in the 3Doodler.\nSome suitably attractive photos of ABS plastic\nABS is one of the most common plastics around. It's used in most of the plastic stuff around you. PLA is what we call a \"bioplastic\". It's made from corn, is biodegradable and has a lower melting temperature than ABS. We are offering both choices as each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nWe plan to offer plastic sold in strands (making it easy to switch colours and create different styles), but 3Doodler-compatible plastic is also available in 1kg spools from between $30 to $55 from a variety of sources... such as here, here, here, here, and here. And for some stunning PLA have a look here. This is no ink cartridge model!\nFun Fact: The average 1kg spool of 3mm ABS contains approximately 360-370 feet of plastic. That's approximately 3,960-4,070 feet of 3Doodling, or 3 Empire State Buildings with enough to spare for several more weeks of doodling.\nThe Future of 3Doodling: We have a ton of ideas for add-ons and accessories that will make 3Doodler even cooler, more useful, fun, and generally awesomer (is that a word?). We hope that the 3Doodler will be a big success so that we can share all our ideas and offer you even more 3Doodling fun...\nPete & Max, Inventors of 3Doodler\nWe have a lot we want to tell you about 3Doodler, so we\u2019ve created an extensive FAQ to answer all of your questions. And we\u2019re on standby to respond to any other queries you may have!\n*The 3Doodler was created at the Artisans Asylum in Boston. The whole team would like to thank the Artisans Asylum for their help and support. Without hacker-spaces like this, projects such as 3Doodler could not happen.

We held back so that we could ensure the prototype worked perfectly (check out the video, it does!) and so that we could speak to more factories (and make related visits to Hong Kong and China). Comfortable that we can deliver this, we\u2019re now launching 3Doodler! \n\nBelow are a couple of the main challenges we will tackle:\n\nChoice of Factory: As with any physical item there are a number of challenges to getting it right. We have been part of numerous projects that have made it through development, into the factory production phase, and then into consumer hands. While our experiences have helped prepare us to avoid major pitfalls, we have been very selective in our choice of factory, choosing a partner that we know we can work with and that is perfect for our needs. They are large enough to scale 3Doodler, but without being so big that we'll be lost amidst the shop floor, and they have a great development team. We also intend to spend a large amount of time in person at the factory.\n \nQuality Control: Good QC is a major focus of ours. The quantity of orders on Kickstarter will help determine how we handle this. If we receive orders for under 1000 units, we will hand test each and every 3Doodler ourselves at 3Doodler HQ in Boston. If we received over 1000 orders we will carry out all QC in situ at the factory, with the assistance of dedicated QC personnel, and with relayed video footage of each 3Doodler going through testing.\n\nThis is about getting the best possible 3Doodler into your hands ASAP.

It\u2019s quite scary too. No, we\u2019re not making this up: some people were terrified just by reading the script alone, and we\u2019re striving to top it with the most immersive, oppressive, depressive, (and many other words ending with 'ive') atmosphere ever seen in an adventure. Don\u2019t be fooled by our excitement or apparent silliness; we\u2019re very serious about making Asylum a disturbing and horrifying game that you won\u2019t easily forget.\nCheck out breathtaking in-game screenshots!\nWe\u2019re deliberately keeping details of the story under wraps. We firmly believe that the less you know about the game, the more it will surprise you. There are plenty of inside looks available though: screenshots, promotional videos, trailer, the Interactive Teaser (or really short demo), and more. When it comes to the story, everybody wants to know what Asylum is about, but we\u2019re only willing to reveal what we said in the pitch video and hinted on the trailer...\nYou\u2019ll have to take our word for it: the plot is very twisty and satisfying. The deeper you go and the more attention you pay to your surroundings, the more Hanwell Mental Institute will reveal about its true nature. Every room is bursting with detail, mood, and backstory. There is a lot to investigate and discover and, quite literally, an entire asylum available to explore. Close to 100 rooms, in fact. You might think we\u2019re a bunch of slightly deranged people to have created a game of this scope on our own and with close to no budget\u2026 and you may actually be right.\nHere's a short but polished glimpse into what Asylum has to offer. Yes: playable stuff readily available! You may download for Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. To play, unzip and launch Dagon. Please note that the teaser has mostly been tested on Ubuntu for Linux platforms. For more information and system requirements, visit our website.\nYou can also watch the following videos featuring Bertrand (aka \"Subject E14\") in a most uncomfortable situation. These were released anonymously and went viral before the game was announced: Session One, Session Two, Session Three, and Last Session.\nSenscape is a young company based in Argentina but we have decades of combined experience. Agust\u00edn Cordes has been addicted to the adventure genre ever since he dwelt in the kingdom of Daventry at the tender age of 7. Over the years he has become an active member in the adventure gaming community, has written many reviews, and went on to design and develop Scratches, widely regarded as one of the best horror adventures ever made (he disagrees, but still...). Scratches became a cult sleeper hit and sold over 250,000 copies. Its soundtrack and chilling atmosphere were highly praised at the time but, most importantly, the game is still being actively discussed for its mysterious and gothic plot, equally influenced by H. P. Lovecraft and Hammer Horror films. Asylum aims to build upon that, with an even more immersive atmosphere and story that will haunt you for years to come.\nDownload the Backer Pack to help promote Asylum!\nAgust\u00edn, together with the rest of the Senscape team, also took part in one of the biggest game projects in Argentina, the educational adventure Risk Profile. While this humorous title was never translated to other languages, it was extremely well received in the country, with thousands of kids still clamouring for a sequel.\nYeah... another one. We develop games for art\u2019s sake but we still need funding to make it happen. For starters, we need to pay our rent and buy food, clothes, and loads of coffee. Perhaps in a different timeline our civilization has sorted out the problem of money \u2014 for example, with players allowing us to eat them after they have played our games, but alas, that\u2019s not how it works in our world.\nIt\u2019s true that Asylum is in advanced stages of production. The Hanwell Institute is virtually complete and fully explorable. The script and design have been ready for a long time, most characters have already been modeled, the Dagon engine is mature enough, and the programming is well under way\u2026 In a nutshell: Asylum will happen. But we need your help to make it happen sooner.\nMerely one floor of the Hanwell Mental Institute.\nYour contribution, even if it\u2019s one dollar, will help us tackle this final lap of development with a proper schedule and resources. Right now this is still a \"garage game\" with most team members dedicating time to the project as they can from their homes. If we reach the goal, we will lock ourselves inside an office for the remainder of the year until Asylum is complete. Being able to work together every day in the same room makes a huge difference, especially for such a large project. If you can\u2019t contribute by actually pledging money, spreading the word is more than enough: tweeting, liking on Facebook, just talking about it will also help.\nOh, stretch goals you say? Yes, we have them. We certainly do. And depending on the success of the campaign, we will start revealing them as soon as we approach our initial goal...\nNo publisher today would dare to produce an edition like this. But, we are not publishers, we are huge fans of adventures just like you (hopefully!), and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this delightful edition reminiscent of Infocom games, including the iconic flip cover and booklet attached to the box. In this case, the booklet will be our fancy Record Book of the Insane. This is a fictional look into the Hanwell Mental Institute, its past and present, including character profiles, newspaper cuts, testimonies, and the Register of Patients which can include your name if you pledge for one of our select rewards \u2014 all in glorious quality.\nDoes this bring back any memories? The cover artwork is subject to change, though. We haven't decided yet, but chances are we'll stick to a lovely hand-drawn painting...\nAlso, the box will include feelies. Yes, feelies! In the good old days, veterans used the word 'feelies' to describe quirky extras that were included inside game boxes. We\u2019re committed to producing a few of them, but we won\u2019t spoil the surprises. Just rest assured that you\u2019ll be getting more than just a box and DVD.\nThe Record Book will include all sorts of background information on the Hanwell Mental Institute and its patients, visitors, staff, etc.\nWe have no intention to deliver a big, bulky box whose sole purpose would be to occupy shelf space, but instead we're aiming for a neat, tidy and quality package (slightly nostalgic too!) that we\u2019re positive you\u2019re going to love.\nStretch goals have been announced! For more information about these, check out the updates The Dream-Quest of Stretch Goals and A haunting revelation of our final stretch goal...\nHere\u2019s some of the things you can get from us exclusively on this Kickstarter campaign. Boy, oh boy! Gorgeous T-shirts, beta access, signed boxes, the chance to become immortalized inside Hanwell from just your name to your very own cold and gritty cell, and so much more. A few pointers though, since we want to make things really simple: you buy the game, you get access to all versions. That\u2019s PC, Mac, and Linux, including the Steam key. Tiers with physical stuff include the worldwide shipping price. Any physical item will include its digital counterpart in all corresponding tiers (except the T-shirt, that is, because\u2026 really, what\u2019s the point).\nThe biggest entertainment ever to hit the LCD screen!

Show to the world what a sane person you are!\nYour name can be added to the Register of Patients. This list corresponds with the actual cells available in the asylum, so you get a true \"virtual\" space that will exist forever!\nBecause we live in a visual era, we have prepared this lovely aid of what\u2019s included on each tier:\nWe offer you several options to stay in touch. Remember to also visit our forums and participate in a friendly and ever growing community of adventure game fans!\nWe would like to thank the invaluable assistance of Phoenix Online Studios in the creation of this Kickstarter campaign, especially Weldon Hathaway who is coordinating administrative tasks in the United States. These charming folks happen to be the developers of Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller, and they could use some love on Steam Greenlight. You may also buy the first acclaimed episode of the series from their online store.\nThe H. P. Lovecraft painting used in the video was done by Dave Carson.

Years of war and the unrestricted use of chemical and biological weapons has resulted in the landscape being turned into a blighted ruin - but still the armies fight amidst the ruins and posioned air, each deploying more troops and secret weapons in a bid to win the strategically important planet.\nYou can download the first draft of the rulebook here. This rulebook will always be free as a downloadable PDF, and will be constantly updated with the latest rules and models throughout the Kickstarter process and beyond.\nSo, why do we need your help?\nWell, we have two entire armies to fund! As well as the basic infantry squads, there are a wide variety of special units, armoured vehicles and 'secret assets' available to both the Southers and the Norts. Being an 'epic' war, we would very much like to present as many different options to players as soon as possible, so you can dive right in and have huge clashes featuring Kashan Sky Legions, Blackmare Main Battle Tanks, Chem-Strikes, Lazooka teams and all the rest of the weird and devastating weaponry that is available on Nu-Earth!\nAll the models in this range are metal and/or resin, and are supplied unpainted and unassembled.\nOur Goal\nWe wanted to start fairly modestly with this Kickstarter, and our Goal will fund two 8-man infantry squads (one for Southers, one for Norts), and three variations of Rogue Trooper himself - one of which will see Rogue armed with a heavy Lazooka!\nThis will be enough to start building a platoon or two and start fighting for your corner of Nu-Earth - but we very much hope you will stick with us and start unlocking some of the more exotic units!\nWe will also produce a hardback rulebook. This will appear later this year when the rules have all been written, and you have all had a chance to make comments and suggestions on them!\nPledging for Rogue Trooper\nIn an effort to keep everything as simple as possible while allowing you to construct the armies you wish, most of the pledge levels are based around a number of 'sets.' Typically, a set will include a single squad of around 8 models, depending on their size and complexity. However, some of the really big and complex models, such as the large armoured vehicles, will count as two or more sets - this will be stated clearly for each set if they are unlocked by stretch goals and we will summarise all the sets available as they become unlocked, giving you a One-Stop Guide to the (hopefully) growing Rogue Trooper range.\nEveryone pledging will get a mention in the final rulebook, no matter what pledge level they come in on.\nMany thanks for your support! You will be registered in the Rogue Trooper rulebook as a civilian contractor!\nWe will send you a 28mm scale miniature of the Rogue Trooper himself, in a random pose.\nWe will send you three miniatures of the Rogue Trooper, in three different poses.\nOne set of your choice from the Rogue Trooper miniatures game range.\nTwo sets of your choice from the Rogue Trooper miniatures game range. STRETCH GOAL ADDITIONS: Sister Sledge\nThree sets of your choice from the Rogue Trooper miniatures game. STRETCH GOAL ADDITIONS: Sister Sledge\nFive sets of your choice from the Rogue Trooper miniatures game range, plus three different Rogue Trooper models. STRETCH GOAL ADDITIONS: Venus Bluegenes, One Free Lazooka Team, Sister Sledge\nTen sets of your choice from the Rogue Trooper miniatures game range, plus three different Rogue Trooper models. STRETCH GOAL ADDITIONS: Venus Bluegenes, Two Free Lazooka Teams, Sister Sledge\nStretch Goals\nIt would, of course, not be a Kickstarter for a miniatures game without some stretch goals, and we are hoping you will stick with us on this project to unlock some very tasty units for both the Southers and the Norts!\nIf we can count on your support to \u00a320,000, we will add two Nort Snipers and the dreaded Black Dome Sniper, the elite among sharpshooters! Though few in number, these snipers will stall an entire Souther platoon, picking off officers, sergeants and heavy weapons soldiers at range.\nSix Snipers and a Black Dome Sniper will count as a set, but we will also add two Snipers for FREE to every pledge of Kapitan and above, and every Major pledge will also receive a Black Dome Sniper for FREE!\nThe Hammerfire Pillboxes used by the Norts are a superb weapon with which to spring a surpirse on the enemy! With a choice of Firebeams, Rotary Cannon, Missile Launchers and Barrage Mortars, these robotic defences can be dropped by hopper or from orbit to form an instant battleline that will resist even a platoon-strength assault!\nIf we can count on your support to \u00a322,000, we will add hammerfire Pillboxes to the game, as a set of 8 Hammerfire Pillboxes, including weapon options. In addition, we will add a FREE Hammerfire Pillbox to every pledge of Leutnant or higher!\nIf we reach \u00a324,000, we will add not only the Souther Staff Car, but its Scout Car variant too.\nThe Staff Car is the perfect transport for your officers as they zip about the battlefield in safety. However, the Staff Car offers far more than just protection, as it is equipped with an advanced communications suite that makes even complicated deployments easy to achieve.\nThe Scout Car, on the other hand can not only keep an eye on enemy movements, but can direct artillery strikes (and Chemstrikes!) on its own authority, making it a useful component in a force whose commander is busy or dead! The Staff and Scout Cars count as 2 sets each.\nIn addition to the Scout Car, we will also add a model of the Traitor General, which will be added freely to all Kapitan and Major pledges!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have worked very hard to minimise the risks to any backers on this project, and have used a great deal of what we have learned on the (successful) Judge Dredd miniatures game Kickstarter project last year.\n\nTo this end, we have already lined up the sculptors needed for this project, and we have already committed to a large amount of the 3D design required for the vehicles in the stretch goals. This will ensure we get a good head start.\n\nWe have also somewhat increased the length of time we believe it will take us to finish all the models in this range. We are stating that we will deliver in September this year, though we are expecting to complete sending everyone's models out before then. However, this will allow for anything to go wrong - perhaps a sculpt needs re-doing, or a master mould cracks. These problems can (and do!) arise, but after having produced miniatures for many years now, we can anticipate where a lot of issues may lie and take steps to avoid them.\n\nFinally, by allowing backers to select what sets they are after, in the quantity they want, right from the start, we have eliminated a huge amount of the admin issues that impacted the Judge Dredd project. This means we will be able to send out models as soon as they leave our forge, meaning you get models in your hands far quicker!\n\nThis also means you will not have to wait until everything is completed before you see any models. Instead, models will be sent out in 'waves' as soon as they are ready. So, when the Skorpion Battlewagon rolls off the production line, everyone who has selected one or more of these tanks will be sent them, all at the same time. Then, when the next model is ready, everyone who selected that will be sent it.

In return for the trust and generosity of the pledgers I will write and produce an original and professional roleplaying game that will be easy and fun to play for gamers of all levels of experiences, and make that game available in a large-format book with the support of Frontier Developments. I will also produce the reward products I have offered to the best quality I can provide.\nStretch goals are targets that can be set if the funding goes above its original target. I've broken down the original stretch goals and introduced intermediate goals. Production costs include proofreading, editing, enhanced POD services like colour printing and other physical delivery options that have not been taken into account in the initial costings of the project. Note that a portion of the production costs will be self-funded and not passed onto the pledgers.\nFurther stretch goals will be added if the funding looks like it will go past \u00a310,000.\nRoleplaying games,commonly known as RPGs, are games where a group of people get together and create a story through their own choices and preferences. One player acts as the story's narrator, guiding the other players in their roles as the story's characters, whose skills and abilities are recorded on a character sheet. The players can act out the events their characters participate in, using dice rolls to determine the success or failure of actions that can't be acted (such as combat or piloting, for example).\nRoleplaying is a social event. Players travel to each other's houses, bringing their character sheets, dice and stationery as well as snacks and drinks, and spend a fun filled couple of hours talking, laughing and having fun. Although modern multiplayer computer or console games go a long way towards emulating this interaction, it's good to be able to hand over a quickly scribbled note in secret to a colleague in your adventuring party and watch everyone else's eyes narrow in suspicion...\nRPGs and computer games have always had a close relationship. Many computer games have been based on RPGs, such as the successful Neverwinter Nights and Eye of the Beholder series that were based on Dungeons and Dragons - one of the very first RPGs to become hit the big time. Legends say that elements of Elite itself can be traced back to the science fiction RPG Traveller, which gave rise to its own series of adventure games in the Megatraveller franchise.\nElite Encounters plans to turn that trend the other way: an RPG based on a computer game franchise!\nEvery pledge of \u00a310 or more (\u00a315 if the early-bird specials have ran out) will get a copy of the RPG in the eBook format of their choice. If you pledge a little bit more then you get three separate formats of the eBook suitable for all sorts of mobile devices or computer. \nEach eBook contains the full set of rules for character generation and for general play of the game. It will also contain player character templates, space ship statistics, rules for a miniature-based combat simulator game and some sample adventures to help you get used to the rules and the universe. It will also contain some short stories and background information on the fictional setting of Elite: Dangerous to give you a taste of what life in a Dangerous universe can be like.\nThe next level of pledges will get you some printable goodies, some of which you get to customise yourself. For example you can have a customised card model kit of the player ship from original Elite or you get the chance to have one of the game's miniatures designed to YOUR specification.\nHigher level pledges will get you intimately involved in the game's design through the Game Developer or Playtester forums or let you have YOUR work published in the RPG through the Artists and Story packs.\nThe highest level pledges will let you name a space station, planet or even a STAR SYSTEM that will feature in both the RPG's sample adventures and in the Elite: Dangerous computer game itself! They are expensive but well worth it, as your vision will be immortalised in an online game that will be played by thousands of people across the globe.\nThe chart below shows what rewards are included in each pledge level. It's quite large so if you find the image below difficult to read please click here for a larger, scalable version.\nNOTE: The 500 word pledge pack has now been INCREASED to a 750 word pack, allowing for more depth to your story. The pledge price is still the same, and now includes membership of the Frontier Developments private writer's forum, where you can submit your story to the Elite Dangerous dev team directly. The 1000 word pledge pack also now includes writer's forum membership.\nNone of these pledges pay for my own work in designing and writing this book - that I give you for free. Your pledges will only go towards things that will improve the final product and ensure that it's a worthy addition to your book collection.\nReward Options\nIf you increase your pledge but don't increase your reward, you can use that increased pledge to claim reward options. For example if you pledge \u00a335 but only claim the \u00a330 reward then you can use that extra \u00a35 to buy Options.\nThe options on offer are:\n+ \u00a31 : You receive a limited edition 6-sided die as described in the dice pledges\n+ \u00a32 : You receive a laminated copy of the quick reference sheet from the rulebook\n+ \u00a33 : You receive a signed, personalised copy of the rulebook. This is intended for the Loose Leaf and POD versions, but if you really want me to digitally sign and personalise your eBook copy I will do that for you too! I will scribble my X and add your choice of personal message on one of the front pages of the book.\n+ \u00a35 : additional DRM-free eBook copy of the rulebook, either supplied as a complete eBook or split into multiple files for ease of use on older or smaller electronic devices (remember to specify the format you want when contacted by me after the Kickstarter).\n+ \u00a35 : You receive a limited edition card model miniature of yourself or your RPG \"character\" designed to your specification\n+ \u00a35 : You receive a limited edition Coriolis space station card model designed to your specification.\n+ \u00a35 : You receive a gatefold GM screen with quick reference data and as much useful info as will fit inside as well as a black and white concept art piece on the back to give the players something interesting to look at... You will also receive an electronic copy of the screen.\n+ \u00a35 : I'll draw you a comic caricature in my own unique style based on either your own image or your character (or whatever, as long as it doesn't breach someone's copyright) in the environment of your choice (see update 16) and send it to you electronically.\n+ \u00a310 : You receive a gatefold GM screen with quick reference data and as much useful info as will fit inside as well as a full-colour concept art piece on the back to give the players something even more interesting to look at!  You will also receive an electronic copy of the screen.\n+ \u00a310 : I'll draw you a comic caricature in my own unique style based on either your own image or your character (or whatever, as long as it doesn't breach someone's copyright) in the environment of your choice (see update 16) and send you a printed copy of it on either A5 or A4 glossy paper! The \u00a35 comic option is included in this price. Oh, and you get the electronic file as well!\n+ \u00a312 : You receive 12 6-sided dice and get a FREE clear plastic display box to keep 'em in!!\nNote that you can claim more than one option. For example if you've pledged \u00a37 over your chosen reward price, you can claim a Coriolis model and two dice, or you can have seven dice! Hopefully more options will be added later.\nElite Encounters will offer players the chance to take on a specific role in the Elite: Dangerous universe. Rules will be written to create a character with specific attributes and skills and to allow that character to interact with the universe around him or her. The game will build on the richly textured background already in existence for Elite and its sequels, and the even more detailed background being prepared for Elite: Dangerous.  For the first time ever, pen-and-paper roleplaying will be an offical part of the Elite universe.\nElite Encounters will also feature simple miniatures rules allowing the players to simulate spaceship combat, with a system fully integrated into the roleplaying game mechanics. The pledge rewards include a chance to design your own ship miniature and have it included in the game.\nThe handbook will contain pre-defined templates for the major character archetypes found in Elite: Dangerous - trader, courier, bounty hunter, pirate and assassin - as well as some new concepts developed specially for the RPG. If you ever wanted to be a space station administrator or a law enforcement officer here's your chance. Alternatively you can make up your own career choices using fully featured character generation rules. The intent is to create a character generation system that is quick and easy and doesn't get in the way of the game itself. I remember far too many games where two or more game sessions were spent just generating the character. That's not the intention for Encounters.\nOne thing I'm aiming for with the game mechanics is to be able to place games in any era of the Elite universe: players will be able to take on roles in original Elite era (latter half of the 32nd century), Frontier and First Encounters eras (33rd century) or the new era of Elite: Dangerous.\nThe book will also contain background and historical information about the setting for the games in a similar manner to Frontier and First Encounters' Gazetteers. This will, hopefully, be authorised and approved by Frontier Development before release to ensure that the products are aligned completely before release.\nAll in all it will be a sizeable book. Presented in a format around the same dimensions as either A4 or US Letter size pages (the same as the majority of RPG sourcebooks), it should weigh in at between 200 and 300 pages, maybe more depending on how much depth is provided in backgrounds and character templates. The hope is that the book will contain artwork and short stories, either from the author of the book or from those who pledge for the right to include their work in the book.\nThe intent is to produce the book electronically, with options to send as PDF, ePub or mobi files. The reward books will be DRM-free, but the books made available to the public may include DRM. The choice to go initially with electronic formats is based on two things - firstly, the electronic format will make it easier to transport (via computer, smartphone, tablet or e-reader) and thus easier to search and check information on and secondly, production costs on a physical copy of a large-format book will push production costs to a high level. If this Kickstarter raises a total substantially higher than the \u00a35,250 required to cover the license costs, then the possibility of physical copies will be looked into, including print-on-demand and limited print runs. In the eventuality of physical printing the likelihood is that a softcover book would be the result.\nThe miniatures will be produced as PDF files for printing onto card and assembling. Again, if funds raised are high enough to make it possible investigations will be started to look into having the miniatures professionally produced and posted.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis Kickstarter campaign is my first, and hopefully I will learn more about it as I go along. I will make mistakes, and I apologise, but I hope you will be patient with me. My untested video making skills and lack of experience in front of a camera will hopefully not be too offensive and that you'll laugh with me as I mess it up.\n\nI intend for the updates to be frequent as the campaign progresses and I hope that I can put together content and information that you will find interesting and that will tempt you to pledge.\n\nOn completion of the campaign, the real work starts. Inventing a gaming system involves a lot of different elements, and the challenge is making sure that those elements fit together logically and provide a consistent gaming experience.\n\nAnd, of course, fulfilling the pledge promises!\n\nThe initial concept for the website is live now but is starved for content at the moment: this will change during this campaign, hopefully. The forums that are mentioned in the pledges should be up and running by June, but hopefully will be much earlier.\n\nThank you for reading and if you've decided to pledge, I thank you. If you haven't, then please consider just pledging a single pound or a couple of dollars.

Elite Encounters is proving to be a reasonably popular item, and I've already had some positive reviews from both the Kickstarter community and the general populace.\nSo what movement has there been?\nWell, the EPUB and Kindle versions have been getting some attention. There was a setback with the EPUB version, in that I couldn't confirm that all the changes for RC2 and 3 had been rolled into the in-progress version. That version had been extracted from the text of RC1, and although I was pretty sure I had rolled up the RC2 and 3 changes, a read through of the text whilst doing the RC4 modifications revealled some missing changes. So, rather than have to go through the changelists again, I made the decision to re-extract the text from the finished version and start over. In some ways this might make things easier, as I can make some overall changes to the format and do the extract in a more productive way.

I love all kinds of games, whether it be Poker, Fiasco, Twighlight Struggle or Spelunky. And over a lifetime of playing geeky games, I've accumulated a big geeky bag of dice.\nThree and a bit years ago I had the idea to create a deck of cards with a full set of polyhedral dice on them. As these ideas go, it soon snowballed. Gaming buddies got involved, and the cards went from 6 dice to more than 30 randomizers, including a bunch of stuff designed just for the cards, to spark creative play. I worked for about six months on the cards until the start of 2010.\nA couple of personal tragedies put plans on hold for a while. So, even though everybody who's seen the cards loved them (and demanded their own deck), I'm only now ready to do a full production run.\nWhich is where you come in! You have in your bank account the means to turn images into physical objects: to help me get a full production run of cards out of the computer and into the hands of gamers everywhere.\nThe Cards\nThe cards feature more than thirty different elements, from regular dice, through gambling games, polyhedral dice, wargaming dice, a full set of roles for Werewolf, dominos, runes, coins, letter tiles, ESP cards, poker chips, short straws, and lots more. Oh, and they are playing cards too!\nThe website at dicecards.com has a complete list, along with instructions for how to use some of the more exotic elements, and complete rules for a whole bunch of games you can play right from a single deck.\nUsing the cards in place of a die-roll is simple. You shuffle the cards and draw one (or just cut them, if they're reasonably shuffled already). Then read the value off the die you need. So if you picked the ace of spades, above, and you wanted a d20, then your roll would be 13.\nThe cards are carefully designed so the probability of rolling any value is the same on the card as it would be with the real die. To make this happen, some cards don't have some dice on them. So if you wanted a d12 roll, and you chose the card above, it doesn't have a d12 on it, so you simply draw (or cut) again. You won't have to wait long. Many dice are on every card, or almost every card. (The d12, for example, is only missing from 6).\nOther elements might work in slightly different ways. If you have to decide who gets the next round of drinks, everyone takes a card, and the person with the shortest straw buys.\nThe cards are an awesome addition to your gaming bag, a self-contained dice-kit for a flight or road trip, and a practical replacement for dice when you're out LARPing. There's also enough on them to be fun solo.\nThe sheer range of things you can do with these cards is amazing.\nThe Backs\nThe four back designs\nThe red back is the basic version. If we pass \u00a312,500, I'll have sets of cards printed in red and blue backs for folks with more than one deck in their reward. So each person having DOUBLED UP will get a set of each, and I'll add an extra blue deck to each of the EXOTIC DOUBLE tiers and above. If we don't get that far, all regular decks will have the red back.\nRare Decks\nThe EXOTIC DOUBLE and the BESPOKE reward tiers feature decks of cards that will be printed in smaller runs than the main cards (the red and blue backs). Because of this, they'll be printed using a slightly different method and will vary slightly in color and finish from the main decks.\nThe Final Version\nThe cards you see here are the latest version (those in the video are a few versions back now). I'll continue to tweak them in minor ways up until the print deadline, but all elements are in place now, and no more will be added, unless the top tier is purchased in the last few hours of the project.\nSo the cards you will receive will look the same as these, have the same elements on them, and generally be laid out in the same way, but will not be identical - the particular rolls on particular cards will be different, because they are different each time I tweak something. See the 'How Dicecards are Made' section for details!\nPDF Reward Usage\nIn the rewards section, I mention legal restrictions on the PDF that backers will receive. This isn't onerous, but is just designed to respect my ability to sell the cards. The license that will come with the PDF allows you to print copies of the cards for your own personal use only. You can't print them to sell them, or to give them away at events, conferences, or in your store. If you want to do a promo with the cards, let me know: this is a passion project for me, so I won't try and throttle cash out of you, I can just help out.\nStretch Goals!\nWe've hit our target, thanks so much everyone.

The current vote tallies are listed above.\nHow Dicecards are Made\n(Feel free to skip this if you don't like to know how sausages are made.)\nEach element was modelled and textured in 3D, and sits in one big 3D environment. Some of the materials are pretty complex. For example, on the dice, you can see the number that is face up is brighter than the others, so it is easier to see at a glance.\nWith the 3D elements in place, a bunch of software works its magic.\nThe first distributes all the elements among the cards, so roughly the same number (and size) of elements are on each card, and so the probabilities are correct for each randomizer. \nThis distribution plan is then passed to a custom packing system, that virtually throws the dice for each card onto the table (it already knows what value should come up, so this is a position-only thing). Some elements can go anywhere, other elements are more restricted (the poker chip goes at the top, for example, so you can stack your cards and see what you have). Other elements have to clear some airspace above them so they aren't blocked. After this process, we know what is on each card, and where.\nA result from the packing system (note everything is packed as assemblies of circles - it used to be more complex, but this turned out way faster in practice).\nThe renderer then loads the 3D elements, and the packing plan, and sets up all the lighting and camera to draw the card. \nThe card layout, ready for rendering.\nThis typically takes about 5 minutes at high quality and about 25 at ultra-high resolution (which is used for the prints, but not needed for the cards). I come back a few hours later, and the cards are all rendered.\nA raw render from the 3D software.\nThen a final piece of software loads these raw renders, adds the card borders to them, and outputs them in regular image format for viewing on screen, and does a color-correction conversion into CMYK format for print. \nIt takes about half a day to generate and render a new set of cards. The BESPOKE SERVICE reward tier will get a custom layout and render on their extra deck of cards, produced in this way. If you're extra geeky, I'll send you the packing layouts and other intermediate data too.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have card art, box art, and instructions done.

The project will thrive on working with no constrictions of budgets and pushing the creative boundaries within those limitations.\nProject Needs\nInterested parties of local artists and locales: We've already generated a number of interested people (detailed below) who have committed to the project and have in fact began work on it. Local businesses and institutes will allow more exposure for the project and allow for/and to locate shooting space, rehearsal space and meeting space along with other necessities. \nLocal Press generating interest.\nEquipment: It is necessary for the project to attract and engage with individuals willing to source Equipment for the filming of the project, including lightning and sound along with talent who can utilize the equipment as well as take the volunteers under their wing and allow them to grow and learn the trade.\nWe have secured an Executive producer, Jade Anderson who has offered to purchase and provide the film with a DSLR camera.\nJade Anderson (center) during Dundee Rep's production of She Town.\nThe Production\nWith the kickstarter coming to a close, we have managed to secure a location to build the shuttle and have begun the process of construction planning. Saturday 26th January saw the first day of moving lots of flats, doors and rubbish out of the space to chalk the shuttle and discuss practicalities. \nThe film, upon completion is hoped to be entered into a number of festivals and competitions and is therefore adhering to a strict quality policy, whilst maintaining its grass roots sentimentality and approach.\nMore important than competitions is the satisfaction that the finished product will bring to each and every artist involved in the production.\nProject Participants\nWhilst only in the pre-production phase the project has already generated a great deal of interest from local press, interested parties and locations around Dundee. These volunteers are at the heart of the production and our values of getting young, inexperienced individuals involved and training them in aspects of film making and allowing hands on experience. \nAdditionally, these include;\nActors: \nTony Osoba, known for his iconic role in Porridge, Doctor Who, Dinotopia and much more has come on board Planetfall and we are extremely excited to welcome him. About Joining Planetfall, Tony had this to say;\n\"The Arts\" - in all it's forms - has routinely striven against heavy odds to achieve or make it's voice heard. Film making, because of the various technical elements required, is an expensive and relatively complex procedure, and Chris, Gav, Jade, Lillias, India, et al, are to be applauded for their determination to succeed in making this film despite all the attendant difficulties. With their eyes wide open and a passion and belief for the project, they demonstrate a commitment that certainly drew me to want to be part of it. The script is novel, powerful, tense and poignant - always attractive to actors. The readily accepted challenge to raise the funding by Chris and his team is admirable and is deserving of every support - testimony to their strong belief and a clear example of what can be achieved with imagination, determination and not a little courage.\nThe project creates genuine opportunities for the experienced and the less experienced - and all such opportunities are to be welcomed and nurtured. The positives are many - as well as creating a riveting and engaging film allowing seasoned pros to practise their skills, perhaps more importantly, it introduces new talent to a fascinating and creative industry that will only ever be enriched by their participation. The opportunities - there's that word again - it gives, are precious, as these are usually few and far between, particularly for those looking for a way in. The ethos of giving chances to some inexperienced but dedicated people is wonderful and to be encouraged - working on a project like this has the potential to change lives. On a very short acquaintance I already feel that the production team when faced with inevitable problems will regard them as things to be tackled and solved rather than things to deflate and depress. Among the excitement and occasional rose tinted view that creative work brings, positive energy and objectivity are also necessary and this team certainly has the right qualities. Serious work is being done in a professional but friendly and convivial atmosphere. This small company are focussed and positive...the saying are acorns and mighty oaks comes to mind...who wouldn't want to be part of that?\nIan Cullen - Actor Ian Cullen, another alumni of Doctor Who and also a veteran actor of film and TV including the popular Z Cars will also lend his talents to Planetfall. Both these actors have shown their enthusiasm and commitment to not only the project but promoting the project - including at Doctor Who conventions. Whilst this is fantastic news for the project it is also a reminder of the quality expectations of the entire team. \nIan in Doctor Who\nPhotographer: Martin Boath: Former Head boy of Baldragon Academy saw one of the articles in the paper regarding the project and is extremely interested in documenting the process through photography to coincide with his upcoming college course.

Ewan is another photographer looking to develop his portfolio during the project.\nConcept Artist Tim Anderson: Tim has very graciously created the concept art of the ship interior based on his interest in the project and the potential he sees in it. His fantastic work can be seen at http://timothyandersonart.com/\nMusic: Local band Brave Men Run have also expressed interest in writing the music for the film and have began sampling tunes using the script as the starting off point.\nThe Little Theatre, Dundee: The Little Theatre had expressed interest in providing a location to build. The lot we will use is an abandoned, desolate floor of Theatre which consists of a large open area with plenty of space and potential The partnership is beneficial for the Little Theatre in an attempt to receive more active members in their own establishment.\nDesign \nEarly concept art for the shuttle.\n\nThe project calls for an ambitious shuttle that hosts the entire film. To maintain the integrity of the project and the quality of the experience we want to build it for real and that is the approach we have took currently working with a concept artist and local designer to design a viable set with no Green Screen. We have reached out to students and graduates of Duncan of Jordonstone who are interested in the project and have experience building installations.\nThere are three distinct stages to the building of the Planetfall set. 1. Creating the shell. 2. Dressing the shell, creating the look of a space shuttle. 3. Lighting the shuttle to create the required atmosphere. We have already began scouting possible source materials to build the exterior along with looking for the affordable place to construct the set and shoot the film. \nWe have also reached out to www.3la.com who also build film sets around the UK for advice and information on their services.\nA 3la film set rendered in our potential lighting state. The design is very similar to our ideal set.\nWe're extremely excited and motivated about the project and feel the time is right not only to fund-raise but to step onto the platform and display our creativity and willingness to learn and improve every single day.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSecuring a location which can house the shuttle and be a controlled environment for shooting will be a challenge. To overcome this we have approached The Little Theatre in Dundee to provide us with an ideal, unused space. While discussions are still ongoing, proving the validity of the project and the benefit of aiding such a project will prove pivotal in securing its use. To ensure a relationship with the Theatre is maintained, I have established an interest with a member of their council and she has been pivotal in securing our talks.\n\nBuilding the ship to a high standard is a huge undertaking and one that hasn't been taken on lightly. Exceptional artistic talent has been brought on board to maintain the quality.\n\nCreating a balance of inexperienced volunteers and more experienced individuals will be difficult and finding artists willing to work, and share with younger people will be more difficult and can potentially slow production down to accommodate them.

Throughout that time I have come up with many iterations that ranged from a large single board with indentations for the pieces to various versions of interlocking pieces and ultimately to the final design in its simplest form.  What I like to call, a Hexel.\nA Hexel is a single hexagonal piece to reflect the hexagons of the board which they were designed for that magnetically connects to each of its neighbors by allowing each magnet to freely orient itself in whatever direction creates the strongest bond.  The result is a board that stays together when playing, allows complete modularity, can be used as a storage device, and it all fits into the original box your game of settlers came in.  \nCreating something that mostly worked would to be okay if it were only for myself, but since this was for you it had to be amazing!   Here is the process that brought this humble idea to be something deserving of your attention.\nThe Evolution of The Hexel:\nThe very first design. Play the original Settlers and be able to easily pop out the pieces when you are done with little finger-holes\nA whole board in one piece was too large to store conveniently, so it was broken up into three interlocking pieces\nThe three interlocking pieces placed near each other to show how it would create the board\nThe previous designs forced the board to be limited to a single layout. By splitting up the board into groups of three pieces it allowed for more modularity and could more easily fit in the original box\nGroups of three placed next to each other to show how they would create an entire board. The board no longer had anything to hold it together well and couldn't quite make the original layout without lots of extra pieces\nA single piece was designed to hold each hexagonal tile. This allowed a reduction in plastic of 35% compared to old models while also introducing the chambers for the self-orienting magnets\nHide the magnet chambers and increase the number of magnets to create a stronger hold (top view)\n(bottom view of the four magnet chambers)\nThe previous versions still weren't good enough, so we upped our game.

I'll include an option in the survey after the Kickstarter ends, and you can choose 3.5/4E/Pathfinder.  Don't worry - I got you covered; no edition warring here!  Just be aware that the 4E version isn't a single compiled edition, and it's the Pathfinder edition which will have the new art and stuff].\nCLICK HERE TO READ ABOUT OUR FINAL STRETCH GOAL!\nThe final, \u00a345,000 stretch goal!\nThis page is divided into four sections - FEATURES, BONUS REWARDS, STRETCH GOALS, and BOLT-ONS.  (Also note that a good way to keep up with minute-to-minute updates is to follow me on Twitter where I haven't stopped talking about this for days...)\nAs you may know, EN World was hacked in December 2012. The entire site was destroyed, and I'm building it again from scratch. While the basic functionality is there (news and forums), much of the functionality built up over a decade was lost. I need to hire developers to recode all that cool stuff, but that takes time and - more importantly - money. While EN World ain't going anywhere, I'm turning to the community with whose help we can restore much of what was lost within a few months.\nMonte Cook said \"EN World is a good cause\"; Green Ronin's Chris Pramas said \"EN World has been a great center of gaming community many years. I had to back Rebuilding EN World on Kickstarter\"; Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens said \"Glad to help EN World get back up on its feet!\"; and Ryan Dancey said \"The ENWorld community is an asset to the whole hobby. Helping them get back up on their feet is just the Right Thing To Do. Back this Kickstarter.\"\nOur goal, put simply:\nEN World will be FAST, it will be RELIABLE, and it will have AWESOME FEATURES. It will also, most importantly, STILL BE AROUND FOR YEARS TO COME! And we all want that, right? Right?\nKickstarter staff very kindly said to me: \"Normally, we don't accept website projects, but we talked about what you're doing and we think rebuilding a community website through Kickstarter is a great use of our platform.\"\nI'm calling the hacking \"The Great Breach of 2012\" and the Kickstarter backers \"The Defenders of the Wall\". Gear up, and take your place on the wall now!\n[Lots of people have been asking about backup strategies -- I've added that info to the \"Risks & Challenges\" section below].\nAs a community website, I feel it appropriate that this Kickstarter use the Kicking It Forward system.  This means that 5% of the profits will be spent supporting other RPG-related Kickstarters as a way not only to give a little back but also to foster more cool RPG stuff!\nHere are some of the things that need writing, and the funding targets for each.\nOur goals are quite modest.  We're not asking for the millions or hundreds of thousands that some other RPG Kickstarters have raised.  For example, the first thing - the server optimization and security overhaul - is only \u00a3300 (or about $480).  I've put both UK and US currencies in the descriptions below.\nPre-Funding: New Server\nI've already purchased a brand new, powerful, server, which will be going online this week (being the week this project launches, 13-19 Jan). That bit I've funded myself in advance, and we should be seeing the benefits of it before this Kickstarter ends.\nSite Optimization and Security (\u00a3300/$480)\nFirst and foremost, the immediate plan includes hiring a professional to optimize the entire site, database, and server.  I hired someone to do that late last year, and it worked swimmingly well, but all that work was lost shortly afterwards.  This is actually the most important thing, and so is first on the list.\nCampaign Manager (\u00a3500/$800)\nThe Campaign Manager is a collection of tightly integrated campaign-management tools including a campaign wiki, journal, links and files, picture albums, calendar system, and more. Together, they make a functional and convenient campaign website. Various tools for the GM include permission and privacy settings, the ability to contact players via PM or email, inviting and booting players from the campaign, and more.\nWe have 285 campaigns being run in the campaign manager!  That's 285 active campaigns and GMs who badly need the features returned!\nYou don't actually play your campaign in the campaign manager (well, you could if you wanted, I suppose) - its purpose is to organize your campaign, schedule events, store and distribute information, discuss topics outside the actual game itself, and so on. It's designed for both tabletop and online play. It doesn't matter where or how your campaign takes place.\nDice Roller (\u00a31000/$1600)\nOur dice roller is not only attractive, it is also secure; there is no way for players to cheat it while using it in an online PbP game.  It's one of EN World's most popular features - our play-by-post (PbP) players make hundreds of dice rolls every month.\nOGRE  (Online Generator Randomizer Engine) (\u00a31500/$2400)\nEN World's Online Generic Randomizer Engine (OGRE) is a powerful, flexible framework to create your own random generators and share them with other EN World members. You can create anything from the very simple (a random color generator which rolls a d6 to choose a color) to something very complex (such as an entire, detailed populated village with homes and businesses).\nWe built this in 2012, and there was a whole pile of random generators created by a variety of talented people.  I created some planet generators for space RPGs, someone made a pirate generator, and there were town generators, room generators, NPC generators, and more which all referenced each other.  It was horrible losing all that, because they were such fun to make and use!\nThis is accomplished by the creation of two types of object: tables and generators.\nOnce someone creates a table or a generator, it is available for use by anyone else creating their own tables and generators. In this way, generators can reference and include other generators as part of their own output. So if Bob has created a table which picks a random color such as green, blue, or red, and Alice has created a table which picks a random object, such as box, table, or book, Eric can create a generator which references both of those pre-existing tables to generate an object of a random color, such as a blue box or a green table.\n\nIn this way you can create random generators for your tabletop gaming needs. From random elf names to potion descriptions, to entire treasure hoards and NPCs. \nGamers Seeking Gamers (\u00a32000/$3200)\nOur extensive Gamers Seeking Gamers system has map and distance searches, and with which many gamers met up and formed groups and games.  All the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of members who added themselves to the GsG system are still sitting safely in the database, which means we can be up and running with thousands upon thousands of gamers upon launch! \nIt really is the most comprehensive, fully populated system of its type on the entire internet, with tens of thousands of gamers already in the system, just waiting for the code to be rewritten! \nWhat's this - more stuff? The \u00a325 PDF Reward Level Keeps Growing!\nBONUS ITEM - Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns for the PATHFINDER RPG\nWe've produced an updated, revised version of our best ever selling book, Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns.  Originally for D&D 3.5, this exclusive Pathfinder edition is not available for sale anywhere else.We're adding this to the \u00a325 pledge.\nThe reviews for the D&D 3.5 version of this book were universally glowing!  Folks have been begging for a Pathfinder version for years, and now here it is.\n\"One of the best sourcebooks I ever laid my hands on - you can use it in any Fantasy/DarkAge Setting.\" [from RPGNow]\n\n\"This is one of the most universally useful books I have ever seen. It is also a fun read.\" [read at RPGNow]\n\"Tournaments, Fairs & Taverns is one of those extremely usable books. It\u2019s the type of supplement that\u2019ll see use in more than one campaign, more than one gaming world. It\u2019s the type of supplement that can be grabbed and used by a GM working on a scene on the fly and can be used by a GM in the planning stages. Fortunately, T, F & T is good enough that you\u2019ll want to use it in all these occasions.\" [read at Geek Native]\n\"I loved the electronic version so much I had to order the print version for quicker reference.\" [read at Amazon]\n\"I still have fond memories of this 74-page book. I have tried to find a way to use it in every one of my campaigns.\" [read at RPG Centric]\nThere are many more, but we don't want to bore you!\nWild Spellcraft was our first ever real product.  It was released in RPGNow's first days, and shocked RPGNow owner James Mathe by selling hundreds of copies within hours.  Originally for D&D 3E, we are now updating it for Pathfinder and including it in the \u00a325 EXCLUSIVE PDF reward tier. You should expect this within 3 months of the project's end.\nCONFUSED about what's included at the \u00a325 (and above) PDF level?   At present it's well over \u00a3200 worth of stuff; that's an awesome deal.\nTOURNAMENTS, FAIRS, & TAVERNS for the Pathfinder RPG\nAdmiral o' The High Seas for Pathfinder and D&D 4th Edition\nWar of the Burning Sky 700-page compiled for D&D 3.5\nFive ZEITGEIST adventure path adventures for Pathfinder or 4E (your choice)\nWhat's the Pirate Ship Like, Anyway?  from Raging Swan Press\nVillainous Pirates from Raging Swan Press\nWild Spellcraft for the Pathfinder RPG\nThe Town of Kalas and the Castles & Crusades Quickstart Rules from Troll Lord Games [also please see Troll Lord's own Kickstarter, which is awesome, too!]\nNEW! Plus the Borderland Keep Deluxe 3D paper terrain models from Fat Dragon Games and A0: Crows Nest Island from Adventureaweek.com (both pictured above, added after the big image below was made).\nNEW! Plus the Darklight 4E Bundle pictured below - adventures, amps,a and a sourccebook!\nNEW! Plus the Savage Mojo bundle pictures below - an adventure, and the largest PDF set of map tiles ever in the form of The Leviathan!\nPLUS -- the O.G.R.E. mobile app, which EVERY backer will get!\nPlease note that stretch goals will take longer to provide than the core rewards. I have given rough estimates below.\nGoodness me!  We hit those goals quicker than I dared hope!  I guess it's time for a stretch goal.  This one's for the PATHFINDER fans amongst you, especially those fond of chaos and wild magic...\nUpdate - we made the \u00a33000 stretch goal, which means that everybody who pledged \u00a325 or more will get the Wild Spellcraft PDF.  Thank you - that's astonishing! \nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a36000: MORE OGRE POWER! -- ACHIEVED!\nThanks to you, we achived this stretch goal, and O.G.R.E. will have the additional scripts and functionality to make it truly awesome!\nThe O.G.R.E. system  is something you need to see to appreciate. Its usefulness can't be exaggerated; it's a crowd-sourced, ever-growing library of interrelated random generators. It's a \"generator generator\". Creating and sharing random tables and generators of ever-increasing complexity is easy! Honestly, you could create a generator to detail an entire town, and it could call upon already existing tables and generators that others had made before you - descriptions, names, stats, anything you can think of. The utility of this system is really hard to convey, but once you see it you get it!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a39000: Server Upgrade (and you get THE PERTURBED DRAGON Season 2!) - ACHIEVED!\nSo we have another stretch goal to announce!  This one's a little different to the usual RPG PDF type goal/rewards.  In 2012 we produced a cartoon series.  It was six episodes long, and featured an adventuring group hanging out at their local tavern, playing an RPG called \"REAL LIFE\".  It's called THE PERTURBED DRAGON, and we are very proud of it.\nTo raise some more money for a new server upgrade (we have a new one on its way, but we can add stuff to it to make it faster!), we will make a second season, taking everything we learned making the first, if we reach \u00a39000.  This means shorter, snappier, tighter episodes; more animation frames; and guest stars!  We even have a guest star lined up - you probably already know who Monte Cook is, but if you don't, he helped design D&D 3rd Edition, Planescape, just finished a half-million dollar Kickstarter for his own RPG called Numenera, and a whole bunch of other things in a long, long list of achievements.  Well, Monte has agreed to appear in an episode of The Perturbed Dragon (we're toying with the idea of having him play an artist called Monet Cooke; but he might play himself).  Also appearing will be the winner of our BATTLE OF THE BARDS competition, the wonderful singer Mary Crowell who won with the incredibly catchy song \"I Put My Low Stat\", to sing in it.\nSo, the new stretch goal is \u00a39000 for a server upgrade; if we make that goal we'll make a cartoon.  That's some more money we can spend upgrading the server already en route to us (making the site even faster than it was going to be!) and also helps us arrange a server maintenance contract for a year.  Please help us!\nKickstarter backers will get this before everyone else!\nNew Stretch Goal: \u00a311000 for a server maintenance contract (and you get a 4E PDF megabundle!) - ACHIEVED!\nI've set a new goal which should appeal to the D&D 4E fans among you. We've got some solid Pathfinder material already in the stuff you're getting (and even some Castles & Crusades stuff), and there will be more if we manage to keep this Kickstarter trucking, but for the moment this one's for the 4E fans. Darklight Interactive has donated what can only be described as a pile of stuff. I've made another of my awesome (read; not awesome at all) infographics below to show you what's in it; but here's the list:\nAdventures:\nA Hero's Journey (level 0, D&D 4E)\nDeath's Edge (level 0, D&D 4E)\nThe Dragon's Master (level 5, D&D 4E and Pathfinder)\nThe Endless Winter (level 12, D&D 4E)\nThe Heart of Fire (level 12, D&D 4E, \"megacampaign\" of 135 pages; we reviewed this on EN World last year -- \"I was very impressed with The Heart of Fire, and I think a lot of gaming groups can enjoy an adventure of this quality. While there are some familiar tropes in this fantasy adventure, they are put to good use making a plot which is fun and exciting, as opposed to being too obvious. The adventure blends a \u201cnew school\u201d sand-boxy encounter series with an \u201cold school\u201d mysterious dungeon delve quite seamlessly, and there is a lot of play sessions packed into one dynamic mini-campaign.\")\nMap Packs:\nM1: The Wayside Inn\nM2: The Ring of Stones\nM3: Crypt Entrance\nOther:\nItems of Legend (D&D 4E supplemental)\nYou don't have to do anything to get all this.  If you pledged \u00a325 or more for the PDF bundle, it will be automatically added as soon as we hit \u00a311,000.  We have 26 days, so there's a good chance we'll do it!  \nThank you all again for this wonderful response.  It's both humbling and gratifying at the same time!\nCourtesy of Darklight Interactive, all this gets automatically added to the \u00a325 PDF bundle if we hit the target of \u00a311000!\nNew Stretch Goal: \u00a315000 for the O.G.R.E. mobile app! - ACHIEVED!\nThe OGRE mobile app will be free to EVERY Kickstarter backer!\nYou will have read about OGRE above - now imagine you're running your game and you need a random elf name.  You grab your phone, hit a button, and you've got one.  Or ten.  It was there along with the potion description generator, the random weather generator, the planet generator, and the hundreds of other generators all created on EN World by users of both the website and the app! \nOGRE stands for ONLINE GENERIC RANDOMIZER ENGINE.  There's info about it above, and documentation for the web version here.\nIf we hit \u00a315000, I'll have mobile version for iOS and Android made.  If you're a backer (at any level), you'll get it free.  It'll also be on sale in the appropriate app stores.\nThe potential for this application is amazing!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a321,000 to unlock the exclusive EN World dice bolt-on! - ACHIEVED!\nThis stretch goal works slightly differently.  I'm lucky enough to be able to offer exclusive EN World dice (pictured below) as a separate bolt-on alongside the t-shirts, as well as an automatic bonus reward for some higher pledge levels (\u00a3100+).  But I can ONLY do that if I make a certain minimum order.  The stretch goal, therefore, allows me to make that minimum order without being worried about not selling enough of them.\nSo it works like this -- if we hit the \u00a321,000 goal, I'll bulk order the dice, and then begin offering them as a separate bolt-on.  I know it sounds a bit odd doing it that way round, but that insulation ensures the Kickstarter doesn't *lose* money, which would defeat the purpose!\nThe good bit for backers of \u00a3100 or more is that you will get a black EN World d20 automatically included in your reward package as a bonus if we make that target!\nNew Stretch Goals - \u00a327,000 and \u00a329,000 to unlock print versions of WILD SPELLCRAFT and Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns! Plus \u00a330,000 for new art! - ACHIEVED!\nThis stretch goal took a bit of juggling of schedules and resources, but it's a very cool one!\nThe two new Pathfinder PDFs, detailed above, are incredibly useful.  But I would like to make them into gorgeous, colour softbacks!  So the deal is this:\nIf we manage to hit \u00a327,000 I will produce a full-colour softcover version of Wild Spellcraft!\nIf we manage to hit \u00a329,000 I will produce a full-colour softcover version of Tournaments, Fairs, & Taverns\nIf we manage to hit the lofty heights of \u00a330,000, I will commission a bunch of new colour art for both!\nAs you know, if you've pledged the \u00a325 PDF deal or higher, you're already getting the PDFs - guaranteed.  You will still benefit from this, though - because your PDF will benefit from the new art and layout being commissioned for the print version!  So the PDF you're already getting will look better!\nAnd if you've pledged \u00a3100 or more, guess what?  I will send you one of those softcovers (your choice) for FREE as a bonus item.  Yup, all you have to do is let me know at the end of the Kickstarter which you want. (Hey, and you're already getting an exclusive black EN World d20!)\nBoth softcovers will also be available for purchase separately at your online vendor of choice (RPGNow, Amazon, DTRPG, etc.) at a later date.\nAll that IF we hit the goals of \u00a327,000, \u00a329,000 and \u00a330,000 respectively.  That's quite the challenge - but these books are awesome and useful enough that they deserve to be on your bookshelf!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a336000 for FAFNIR's TREASURE! - ACHIEVED, BABY!\nThis latest reward/stretch goal is courtesy of the fine folks over at Fate of the Norns.  Please pay them a visit!\nNew Stretch Goal - \u00a339,000 for an OSR Gem - the 1977 4th Edition Tunnels & Trolls PDF!\nVery kindly donated by the fine folks at Flying Buffalo!\nBolt-Ons are optional bonus items that you can add on to your existing pledge.   Simply add the appropriate amount to your pledge.  So, if you have the \u00a375 pledge and you would like a t-shirt, you'd alter your pledge and increase it to \u00a395.  If you want two black d20s, you'd add \u00a310.  Note that backers who have pledged \u00a3100+ automatically get one free black d20.\nFor t-shirts, please add \u00a35 if you're not in the USA (sorry - that's where they'll be shipped from!)\nFor dice, shipping is free in the USA and the UK. For up to 10 dice total, please add \u00a35 for Canada and Europe, \u00a310 for the rest of the world excluding Australia and New Zealand, and \u00a320 for Australia and New Zealand (sorry!) Add the same again foe each additional 10 dice or multiple thereof!\nAt the end of the Kickstarter, you'll need to let me know which bolt-ons you chose.  Don't worry  - I'll be sending out a survey, and you'll be able to note that you selected a bolt-on!\nDice - set of d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 (blue/green dice assorted randomly): \u00a320\nDice - single black d20: \u00a35\nT-shirt: \u00a320\nMen and womens' t-shirts, exclusive to this Kickstarter!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be EN World's third Kickstarter, after we successfully raised funds for Admiral o' the High Seas (a naval sourcebook for Pathfinder and 4E) and To Slay a Dragon (an adventure). For this particular Kickstarter, I'll be hiring coders to specifically rewrite certain features to specification; the most challenging part of that is locating reliable coders within the budget, something I've had a great deal of practice at over the last decade. To that end, I have already sourced these coders in order to ensure that, should the funding be raised, progress is quick.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I've discovered working on Kickstarters is the management of stretch goals -- in the unlikely event that we manage to exceed our target, it's important not to set stretch goals which drastically inflate the time period required to provide rewards (which goals like \"OK, instead of a 32 page book, it will now be a 500 page book!\" tend to do). The current stretch goals are all rooted in that core functionality we lost; any later stretch goals, should there be any, will not affect the time required to provide existing rewards.\n\nThe final - and most difficult challenge - will be that of reaching out to the community, to gamers, to publishers and garnering the support I need to make this happen. I do know that the EN World community has proved itself to be incredibly generous in past years, and that many of my publishing friends and fellow website owners have been very supportive. I hope they will be again!\n\nREGARDING BACKUP STRATEGIES -- a number of people have asked \"why didn't you have backups?\"\n\nWe did. The database was entirely backed up (if you go to EN World right now, you can see that every post, thread, and user is still present and correct - no data was lost).\n\nThe code, on the other hand, consisted of a heavily modified vBulletin 3.x codebase. It was a decade old, and subject to exploits over the years. In short, a decade after it was installed, it was no longer secure or reliable -- that's why the hackers were able to get in. In short, it was vulnerable, and the backups of the code were therefore also vulnerable. I made the decision, therefore, to upgrade to the modern, supported, and far more secure vBulletin 4.2. The effect of this was that our code was all rendered obsolete/incompatible. I couldn't just use it again; it was for a different version of the core codebase. \n\nHopefully that explains why I couldn't just use the backups. I could have, but if the site had been restored to exactly how it was before the hack, the hackers would have immediately jumped in again the next week using the exact same method.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Latest Silver Lifetime Subscriber Rewards", "update_content": "Hi everyone!

YOU ARE THE HERO will tell the story of that phenomenon.\nMy name is Jonathan Green and I am a freelance writer with more than 40 books to my name. Among them are seven Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, including the critically acclaimed Howl of the Werewolf and Night of the Necromancer.\nHowl of the Werewolf and Night of the Necromancer, by Jonathan Green\nI remember picking up one of the very first copies of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain when it was published in 1982. Here was a book in which YOU, the reader, were the hero. You chose the course of the adventure, deciding which paths to take, which traps to risk, and which monsters to fight. I had never read anything like it before, and so began a life-long love affair with Fighting Fantasy gamebooks.\nEarlier this year I wrote a piece about the history of Fighting Fantasy for SFX magazine. But the more I researched the story behind the creation of the world\u2019s premier gamebook series, the more story I realised there was still to tell. To do the subject justice I needed to write a book \u2013 and so the idea that was to become YOU ARE THE HERO was born.\nThe Legacy of Firetop Mountain, in the SFX Fantasy Special\nYOU ARE THE HERO will tell the story of Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, from the early days of Games Workshop right up to the present day, and beyond. I have already interviewed the creators of the Fighting Fantasy series \u2013 Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone \u2013 who are both keen to have their story told. In fact, Steve Jackson once said to me, \"You are the perfect person to write this book.\"\nI would like to point out at this point that this is MY project and Steve and Ian are NOT sharing in any of the profits from YOU ARE THE HERO. They are merely co-operating - and their co-operation is greatly appreciated.\nSteve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, creators of the Fighting Fantasy phenomenon\nI have also interviewed many other people who\u2019ve been involved with Fighting Fantasy over the years. These include authors and editors \u2013 such as Dave Morris, Robin Waterfield and Marc Gascoigne \u2013 the artists \u2013 people like Russ Nicholson, Martin McKenna, John Sibbick and Leo Hartas \u2013 and fans of the series, such as New York Times bestselling author Graham McNeill, founder of Tin Man Games Neil Rennison, and author, actor and comedian Charlie Higson.\nCharlie Higson and Ian Livingstone\nI want YOU ARE THE HERO to be something special, a book worthy of commemorating such an extraordinary achievement and the impact Fighting Fantasy gamebooks have had on the world. I want it to look like the kind of artefact you might hope to find in the Warlock\u2019s own treasure hoard.\nAs a result the first print run of YOU ARE THE HERO will be a limited edition. The book will feature brand new, specially-commissioned cover art by Martin McKenna, as well as original artwork from the series, and a foreword written by Steve and Ian themselves.\nNot only will YOU ARE THE HERO tell the amazing story of how Fighting Fantasy gamebooks changed the world, it will also cover everything from spin-off novels and puzzle books, to foreign editions, board games and video games. It will even delve into such areas as the gamebooks that never were, the myths and legends surrounding the series, and how Ian Livingstone\u2019s newest gamebook \u2013 Blood of the Zombies \u2013 almost never happened.\nBlood of the Zombies, by Ian Livingstone\nThanks to Kickstarter we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to create a book about the history of Fighting Fantasy. But now it\u2019s up to YOU!\nThe more you pledge, the more impressive this book will be \u2013 with more artwork, higher spec production values and more content. I would love this first limited edition to be a hardback, and with your help it could be. But without your support YOU ARE THE HERO can never happen.\nIf you have any interest whatsoever in the British games industry, adventure gamebooks or fantasy fiction, then this book is for you.\nCheck out the rewards in the sidebar and pledge your support today!

At the moment we do not have details nor a physical Ouya, so while we intend to support it we do not know when we will be able to provide this support.\nSummary\nScroll Ninja is a side scrolling action game based in a world inside a traditional Japanese art scroll. The game is open source (GPL with licensing options available) but the assets are not (but can be licensed). Scroll Ninja will be available for Windows, OSX, Linux and Android. Initially there will only be a single player mode but we intend to add a multi-player mode after initial release. The Android version will include a unique control set for touch screens because we hate those stupid fake on-screen plus pads or the circle virtual analog sticks. There will be gamepad profiles for Android, and hopefully a full control scheme for the Ouya.\nBase [Initial] Storyline\nFire Ninja Onimaru returns to his village after a day of training in the forest, only to find it has been ransacked and razed. Onimaru sets off on a quest for vengeance; picking up allies and encountering phantoms of his past along the way. In his path are enemy ninja, youkai daemons and the manipulated - warriors controlled through cursed charms. Guide Onimaru and crew through 4.1 chapters of revenge, shinobi style.\nFire Ninja - Old Master\nGame Features\nDifferent Ninja Styles [\u5fcd\u8853]\n3 different types of Ninja (*initially, see our reach goals) each with their own unique controls, abilities and tools all based on actual ninja clans and ninjyutsu styles. For initial release you can switch between fire [\u706b\u9041], water [\u6c34\u9041] and wind [\u98a8\u9041] ninja to make your way through the game.\nWire Action [\u9375\u7e04]\nOne of the basic tools available to you is the \"Kaginawa\", a ninja grappling line. You can ascend, swing, or grapple to terrain and pull yourself towards it or pull enemies and objects towards you. Physics is done with a dedicated physics engine so swinging and falling will have a somewhat natural feel to it. Objects significantly heavier than you will not be pull-able, but may be shifted or get dislodged. You'll be able to pull in enemies weaker than you but enemies stronger than you could actually pull you in with your own line.\nFree Running [\u75be\u98a8\u306e\u8853]\nUsing the skills of Shippu [Hayate] you'll run freely through the world. Running up walls, seamlessly sticking to the ground over rough terrain and large rocks, and hanging upside down from ledges and branches.\nWeapons [\u6b66\u5668]\nNinja Swords [\u5fcd\u5200], throwing stars [\u624b\u88cf\u5263], Kunai Ninja Utility Knife [\u82e6\u7121], Weighted Chains [\u4e07\u529b\u9396], Kama Sickle [\u938c] and Weighted Chain Kama Sickle [\u9396\u938c], Kagidzume Claws [\u9264\u722a], Kanshakudama Grenades [\u7647\u766a\u7389], Kemuridama Smoke Bombs [\u7159\u7389], Senkoudama Flash Bang Grenades [\u9583\u5149\u7389], Teppou Gun [\u9244\u7832], Makibishi Caltrops (spikes) [\u6492\u83f1], Fukiya Blow Darts [\u5439\u304d\u77e2] and as many authentic Ninja weapons as we can get into the game. Depending on how much funding we get we may only implement the most basic weapons for initial release.\nTools [\u5fcd\u5177]\nAside from the Kaginawa Grappling Line you'll have tools like the Mizugumo Ninja Raft [\u6c34\u8718\u86db], Tako Glider Kite [\u51e7], Rope and Bamboo Ladders and temporary Bridges and for night missions the Gantou Lamp [\u9f95\u706f] which can use to direct light like a flash light or can hide to blend in to the night.\nSkills [\u5fcd\u8853]\nBunshin Shadow Clones [\u5206\u8eab\u306e\u8853], Migawari Substitues (switch them with yourself to take a fatal blow) [\u8eab\u4ee3\u308f\u308a\u306e\u8853] and many more like Kuchiyose Summoning [\u53e3\u5bc4\u305b\u306e\u8853] if we have the resources. You can upgrade your ninjas by learning skills from Ninja Masters.\nNinja Dojo Master\nArt-form Skills [\u5fcd\u8853]\nFire Ninja \"Onimaru\"\nFire: Blow fireballs, leave a trail of embers in your path, create a wall of flame and use a flaming sword to set your enemies alight.\nWater Ninja \"Suigetsu\"\nWater: Run across water, walk freely underwater, blow darts from under the waters surface, blow out flames and lamps with blasts of water and call upon Tsunami Waves [\u6d25\u6ce2] to wash away your enemies. \nWind Ninja \"Fuuko\"\nWind: Create solid Kintoun Clouds [\u91d1\u6597\u96f2] to stand on in the air, summon Tatsumaki Tornadoes [\u7adc\u5dfb] to scatter enemies, push enemies and items around and deflect projectiles with bursts of air.\nBig Bosses\nFight 5+ bosses* each with multiple phases in their own huge environments. We want boss battles to be epic, memorable, fun and challenging and are aiming at more than 5 minutes of battle time for each. Take for instance Boss #1, Nyuudougumo [\u5165\u9053\u96f2]: a manipulated massive hammer wielding brute who you'll fight in a multi story pagoda.\nNyuudougumo concept art\n*We want to include many more bosses and mini-bosses but will limit the number to 5 bosses matched up to the story line.\nHow We'll Use The Funds\nThe first $30,000 will simply pay enough to keep us alive and with running water and electricity while we make the core game. We'll include as many features listed above as possible, and even if we don't include them all in initial release we intend to include them in updates. The core game will be single player and include story mode, challenge mode and speed run mode.\nReach Goals\n*All reach goals will be created AFTER initial release, but will be included if we amass enough funds.\nDark Rival \"Kagemaru\"\n$50,000: An extended story with 5+ new chapters and new Ninja Art Forms and characters including Soil [\u571f\u9041], Wood [\u6728\u9041], Thunder [\u96f7\u9041].\n$80,000: Multi-player mode! Play Death Match, Capture the Flag, Assassin and other modes on huge hand painted maps.\n$100,000: Co-op mode and a special side story built specifically for co-op.\n$120,000: Map creator and editor for multi-player and challenge maps.\n$130,000: Story creator and editor to create your own single player and co-op levels.\n$150,000: A full side story featuring Fire Ninja Onimaru's rival Kagemaru [\u5f71\u4e38]  as the main character, who is a member of the Darkness Arts [\u95c7\u9041] and uses gravity based attacks like Attraction [\u5f15\u529b\u306e\u8853], Repulsion [\u65a5\u529b\u306e\u8853] and Moon Walk [\u6708\u8d70\u308a] for gravity defying mid air dashes.\n$170,000: Kuchiyose Summoning [\u53e3\u5bc4\u305b] of massive mystical beasts including a spear weilding Oogama Oil Frog [\u5927\u8766\u87c7] for Fire, a Suiryuu Dragon born of a Koi [\u6c34\u9f8d] for Water, Ootaka Great Hawk [\u5927\u9df9] for Wind, Oniguma Deamon Bear [\u9b3c\u718a] for Wood, Orochi Massive Snake [\u5927\u86c7] for Soil and Byakko Divine White Tiger [\u767d\u864e] for Lightning.\n$180,000: The Metal/Mechanical arts [\u91d1\u9041] and accompanying character and a whole set of Karakuri Mechanical [\u7d61\u7e70\u308a] gadgets and weapons, including pilot-able vehicles.\n$200,000: You may note your character collects Chakra points. There's a reason for this which we'll reveal if we get close to the $200k mark.\n$500,000: Radical! We'll add every Ninja weapon and skill we can find or think of, including completely original and occasionally ridiculous ninja art forms and characters like Radioactivity [\u539f\u9041], Eroticism [\u6deb\u9041], Steam [\u9727\u9041], Smoke [\u7159\u9041], Light [\u5149\u9041] and more (leave your ideas in the comments!). Each will be usable in multi-player and have a unique side quest as a downloadable addition.\nRewards\nMost of the rewards include a copy of the game for Desktop (Windows, OSX, Linux), Android, or both. Most reward packs include exclusive content which will only be provided to Kickstarter backers. If our campaign does succeed and we complete the initial game we will create extended contents sets, new modes, etc. and \"premium\" backers will receive access to all of these extensions for free.\nThe sound track will be release in portions (as the tracks are completed), and will include tracks from several Japanese independent artists including se.noize (our resident sound artist), indi singer/songwriter Tatsuki and many more. The general soundtrack will be appropriately themed with authentic Japanese sound, and will include electronic tracks, instrumental tracks and regular song (with sung lyrics) tracks.\nAs for physical rewards we've got three types lined up:\nUSB Kunai\nThe USB Kunai is simply an 8GB USB stick (maybe bigger if we get enough orders) with the Scroll Ninja logo printed on it and filled with all the digital goodies we can think to put on it.\nScroll Ninja logo Fude pen\nA Fude is a traditional Japanese brush. The Scroll Ninja art style is made to mimic art made with this kind of brush (and some of it is actually drawn with a Fude pen and scanned). The Fude pen has a tip which mimics this brush and has an ink reservoir built into it. Our Kickstarter exclusive Fude pen comes in a box and will include the Scroll Ninja [\u7d75\u5dfb\u5fcd\u8005] logo in Japanese on both the pen and the box. We're also including a pack of Japanese paper [\u548c\u7d19] similar to that used as the graphical base in the game.\n\"Kakejiku\" Art Scroll\nAlso available will be authentic art, hand drawn with fude brushes in full color by Jun Tohyama on Japanese paper, then cut and set on an actual Kakejiku [\u639b\u3051\u8ef8] hangable wall scroll. The image above is just a sample of the materials used - actual completed illustrations will be properly sized and adhered.\nThe grand reward is a full closed-source OK license to the source, graphical and sound assets. If you are a developer and you want to make a similar game or want to make a game based off of Scroll Ninja directly this is a wide-open and fairly limit-free opportunity at a fixed and, in the scope of things, very cheap price. After release we likely offer licenses like this on a per-asset or profit sharing model. Aside from funding what we'd really like to get out of this is more content from the Scroll Ninja universe. We believe that the more creators and makers who put out Scroll Ninja related material the bigger it will become - and we don't want to limit that by being jerks with copyright and closed source. Anyone who buys into this reward will be a big initial partner of ours.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur only major challenge is running out of money (like we did the last time). Each time we run low on funds we have to take on outside projects that take up time and don't always provide us with enough money to continue. Only after taking two big projects were we able to regroup and start again - but this time we've taken a much safer and easier to develop path and chose a different base system so we can assure full multi-platform compatibility and added Android to our list of supported platforms. If kickstarter does succeed we don't expect any real difficulties - as long as there is enough money to pay Naoki Iwakawa and Jun Tohyama they'll be on the project full time. It should be noted they both have experience as game developers/creators. In addition, other than mulitplayer and some refactoring most of the difficult work has already been done, so if funded we believe our release schedule is realistic.\n\nIf kickstarter does not succeed we will likely continue development, but it won't be at any real reasonable pace. We have other projects (some of which you may see on kickstarter soon!) which the majority of our developers/creators/artists/designers are working on already and are always in need of extra hands. What you see here so far is essentially just the creation of two of the Genshin members; Mr. Tohyama and Mr. Iwakawa. It should be noted one of our creators, Ms. Yoshida, was the one who re-kindled the project when she started playing with libGDX.

Tohyama took a particular liking to the lit shop at the end - that will undoubtedly appear in the game in one of the night mode stages."}, {"status": [{"Project ends": "JANUARY 19, 2013"}]}], "comment_no": 21, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kagetsuki/scroll-ninja-revised", "project_name": "Scroll Ninja [Revised]"}}, {"backer": "Chris Brind", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Thanks to everyone for backing Galcon 2!!\nIt's been really amazing seeing the support of Galcon 2!

Watch part 1 here! And part 2 here! \nFor the last six hours of the Kickstarter, we're going to be holding the one and only GALCONATHON! It's going to be a live stream available on YouTube.  I'll add the link here.  Here's the schedule.\nUpdate: Get a Galcon Power Necklace for that Special Someone!\nNan created a few more variations of the Power Necklace!  She thinks it's exactly what your Valentine is going to want this year.  Check out the closeups!\nUpdate: It's All About the Box Set!\nIn addition to the amazing fridge magnet set and the super cool poster, you get a whole box full of Galcon-related goodies. Here are the details.\nUpdate: Fireside Chat with Phil\nHere's a video of me talking about what I'm excited about in Galcon 2! I explain in more detail my vision for some of the features.\nUpdate: Galaxy Map Concept Art by Matt Kohr\nMatt watched my design journal on the Galaxy Map, and fleshed it out into this sweet set of concept art pieces.\nUpdate: Community Manager Nan on Galcon 2\nNan has been the Galcon community manager for over five years now!  She's really excited about Galcon 2, and made a video for us about why.\nSee Galcon Gameplay\nThis is the trailer for Galcon Fusion (2010).  The gameplay in Galcon 2 is going to be similar.\nTry Galcon Now!\nIf you've never played Galcon before, we've got you covered! Galcon is a multiplayer real-time strategy (RTS) game. Try Galcon (for iPhone / Android) here. Or try Galcon Fusion (for iPad / desktops) here.\nThe Galcon Story\nI created the first version of Galcon in 1995 when I was 15 years old. The first version I made was pretty similar to other turn-based conquest games of the past.\nOver the years, I re-made the game a few times with similar gameplay.\nHowever, in 2006 I created a real-time version of Galcon that involved sending swarms of ships from planet to planet. It was the FIRST game of this kind. (There have been DOZENS of swarmy RTS games made since that were inspired by Galcon's gameplay.)\nIn 2008, I brought Galcon to the iPhone. The touch interface was a perfect match for the game! Galcon was the first real-time multiplayer game to be released for the iPhone.\nGalcon for iPhone went on to win the 2009 IGF Innovation in Mobile Game Design award!\nThen in 2010, I ported it back to the desktop, and then to the iPad as Galcon Fusion. Galcon Fusion introduced some new game modes and was the first multiplayer game on the iPad to offer cross-platform gameplay between iPad and desktop players.\nNow, heading into 2013, the 5 year anniversary of the launch of iGalcon, I want to give the game an overhaul and make this the BEST GALCON EVER!\nGalcon 2 Game Design\nI've put together a series of mockups to show some of the design ideas I have. All of this is pre-development, so things may very well change, but I hope it gives you an idea of some of the cool things I want to add.\nI'm eager to create a better menu setup that gets you right into the game. Below, on the \"PLAY!\" screen, the \"AUTO-MATCH\" button will put you right into a new game. No more clicking into each server to find one that's ready to play!\nI also want to bring the stats and ranks to a whole new level. By improving how the rankings work, it will be possible to rank up in all game modes, no matter how popular. I'm also going to add a trophy system as rewards for the in-game tournament system I want to add.\nTo further build community and help you hang out with your friends, I want to add clan support to Galcon 2. This will bring another layer of fun to the game.\nI am designing Galcon 2 as a Free-to-Play game. This means I'm going to have a store for buying cosmetic upgrades and other game features. I'll be working hard with the community to ensure that play balance isn't upset by these upgrades.\nI'm very excited about building this game! I hope these mockups give you a glimpse of what I'm envisioning.\nCommunity Involvement\nI've already started discussing the game design with the Galcon community. We're working towards a design that improves the existing core game while adding new features to ensure that the next generation of Galcon is the best!\nThe Beta Experience\nI'm really looking forward to this part of the project. In the past I've always spent 6-12 months developing a game, put it into a brief beta with a select group of people (maybe 20 or so), and then released the game. After that I'd follow the forums for a month or two to get bug fixes into the game, but after the release it gets really hard to make any dramatic changes.\nThis time the beta will be from the very beginning, which means I'll be able to make changes to the game early on to help it realize its greatest potential. I'm excited to have a larger group of beta testers working with me from the start.\nAs a backer, you'll get to see how a game gets developed from scratch. Of course, I will probably be borrowing bits from previous Galcon games, but largely it's going to be a complete re-write to ensure that the game is going to be designed for expansion in the future.\nWhy Free-To-Play\nThere are two main reasons for going Free-to-Play:\nFirst, free means more users playing the game. Instead of 100 people online at any given time, I'd like to see 1000 people online! This will make a larger variety of skills and game types available all the time.\nSecond, by having the game include in-app-purchases, I can design the game so that players can continue to support the on-going development and get updates more often.\nThe Awesome Rewards\nI'm really excited about these rewards. Some of these items are things I've wanted to do for a game for years, so this is a really fun opportunity.\nThe fridge magnet set\nThe fridge magnet set will make you the envy of all other fridge owners in the world. Below is a mockup of it on a really expensive fridge. (Exact set may change by final production.)\nThe Poster\nThe gorgeous Galcon 2 poster designed by Matt Kohr will be 18\"x24\" and printed on high quality acid-free paper, suitable for framing!\nThe box set\nThe box will include a CD of Galcon related goodies, a bag of Galcon playing marbles, two Galcon pins, and a manual! Below is mock-up of the box. (Final box may be slightly different.)\nThe Power Necklace\nNan, our community manager, who was previously a professional jeweler, has designed this amazing Galcon power necklace. This necklace will give you the psychological edge in battles. (Final necklace may differ depending on availability of beads.)\nThe Case\nCases are available for iPhone, iPad, and a number of other devices. Also available are skins for some laptops.\nThe Marble\nYou will get a custom 1.5\" art-glass marble themed with planets, stars, and some Galcon ships! Created by the amazing Shannon Norris of Fireworx Glass Studio, these are going to be super special! Each marble is a unique work of art and will vary.\nThe Galconicorn's Horn\nThere is only one Galconicorn and he generously donated his horn to help raise support for Galcon 2. You will be the envy of all the Galcon players in the universe as the owner of the one true Galconicorn horn. (Galconicorn and rainbow not included.)\nOS / Device Support\nGalcon 2 is going to be developed for Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu Linux computers.\nOnce the game has reached the point of release, I'll be porting it to the iOS platform. Galcon 2 will work on all iOS devices supporting iOS 6.0+ except for the iPhone 3GS. Galcon 2 will also be ported to high-end Android devices.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn the past ten years I've produced the games Galcon, Galcon for InstantAction, iGalcon, Galcon Labs, and Galcon Fusion. I'm confident that I can produce another one. Doing a beta from day one is a unique experience for me and will require a lot of community involvement. To ensure adequate development time, Nan Hassey, who has been the community manager for the last 5 years, will act as liaison.\n\nTo ensure smooth delivery of the physical items, I've lined up manufacturers who can create all the items for me. I've been careful to price things out so that I'm still left with the money I need to create Galcon 2. My wife, Nan, is going to manage all the fulfillment, so I will be able to focus my attention on developing the game. I chose to limit the number of higher tier awards to ensure manageable quantities.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #80", "update_userinfo": "Galaxy Map - The Six Factions Update", "update_content": "The past 18 months have shown many heated battles and glorious victories on the Galaxy Map.

I wish the team the best of British in bringing their creation to life.\u201d \u2013 David Amor, Chief Creative Officer at Relentless, ex-Bullfrog Productions\n\"I am quivering with demonic anticipation at the thought of helping to bring War For The Overworld to fetid fruition, taking over where Dungeon Keeper left off - this will be the last word in evil. Mwuahahaha!\" - Rich Ridings\n\"It's scandalous that nobody has yet managed to create a game that captures the spirit of the original Dungeon Keeper. Scandalous! I have high hopes that War for the Overworld will correct this, and give fans something that will make them happy. Can I have my free copy now?\" \u2013 Simon Carter, project lead on Dungeon Keeper and freebie whore \n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see some fresh blood taking up the wicked mantle and spreading such evil fun once more. Very best of luck chaps!\u201d \u2013 Mike Man, Creative Director at Vostopia, ex-Bullfrog Productions Lead Artist\n\"I'm incredibly excited about War for the Overworld!

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s almost emotional for you as you realise you can finally massacre those self righteous goody-two-shoe heroes once more.\" \u2013 Thomas Mattingly, Indie Statik, November 29th\n\"Subterranean Games clearly know their stuff \u2013 and War for the Overworld sounds like a Dungeon Keeper game made by Dungeon Keeper fans.\" \u2013 Jamie Donnelly, BeefJack, November 14th\nIn War for the Overworld you have the power to create vast dungeons filled with hordes of evil minions who share a common goal: to crush the bones of the goodly heroes that dare to enter your unhallowed halls. You will command mighty armies, create vicious traps and cast dastardly spells to overcome the pitifully gallant armies that defend foolish principles such as \"honour\" and \"righteousness\" \u2014 it's going to be more fun than taking candy from a baby... \nWhile defeating these dungeon crawlers will be remarkable fun, it will provide only fleeting satisfaction. Fortunately, there is a much larger enemy that stands between you and dominance of the Overworld.\nThere is no correct way to build a dungeon; however you will quickly learn what suits your unique style in War for the Overworld. Each level opens up as a blank slate and it is up to you and your scaled hand to carve out the world as you best see fit. Because there is no set \u201clevel\u201d upon which you play you will have to choose where to dig, fortify, and build the whatever your depraved mind can imagine \u2014 whether it is a vast dungeon filled with cavernous rooms or a series of winding hallways that stretch off far into the unknown depths is up to you.\nDo you prefer to crash through your enemy's front door with a swarming army, or is subterfuge your game? All game decisions happen in real time whether you're building your dungeon, training your army, issuing orders to your minions or tapping into more primal powers to cast spells upon your foes.\nAs an Underlord you have the power to call down terrifying spells to wreak havoc and misery upon your foes. Of course there are spells that augment your already formidable creatures in battle. In addition to spells, some of your minions have begun to dabble in the occult and have found many sinful rituals that will influence the entire battlefield. These rituals require many ingredients, and no doubt sacrifice will be involved to make the nastier ones possible.\nEntice wicked and devious creatures to your dungeon through Gateways. Keep them in your service by fulfilling their basest desires and they shall eagerly fight for you. Your minions will autonomously work in the rooms of your dungeon that are best suited to their skills \u2014 for a price. Some minions require little more than food, but those intelligent enough to perform skilled labour in your dungeon will require pay \u2014 make sure to keep your coffers full and you'll have an army in no time!\nWith dozens of unique rooms to choose from you can create an underground metropolis for your fearful denizens. Each room has a distinct purpose that will draw new minions to your dungeon and provide you with additional utilities.\nFortify your domain by placing various doors throughout the dank halls of your dungeon to control enemy movement, or catch unsuspecting trespassers with your murderously designed traps. If you're the kind of player who likes to hide behind static defenses then this vein of evil is right up your well-defended alley.\nWithin the depths of this realm exist ancient shrines of immense power that are but a murmur of the ancient forces that used to walk this realm. These powerful bastions of magic will grant boons to your creatures and spells, or weaken those of your enemies. Make sure to keep these shrines defended for their arcane powers only remain yours as long as you control them.\nResearch and unlock spells, rooms, and traps in each level in a way that best complements your play style. In the Archives your minions will research the three veins of evil (Sloth, Greed, and Wrath) to grant you the rooms, traps, and spells that you want to play with.\nThe initial campaign will include the first chapter of the single-player experience where you face off against the righteous Emperor Stockington and the vast armies of his Sterling Empire. His mighty generals have been called to a war council in the capital of Socksford in preparation for war... how delightfully charming. Further chapters of the campaign and plans for additional story features will be revealed soon!\nIn Multiplayer you will finally prove once and for all who is the best of the worst amongst you. With dozens of customizable settings, you and as many of your friends as you want can battle in unranked free-for-all battle and team matches.\nWith the power of the developers in your hands you have the potential to realize your fiendish desires. In this mode almost anything is possible. Whether you want to craft labyrinths with increasingly difficult hazards for sport (bookie not included), or build a massive dungeon for your creatures to roam is up to you as you command the very rocks of the Underworld in Sandbox mode.\nWhat you see on our Kickstarter page was created by us over the past few months. Every member of our team has dedicated their free time to work on this project while also holding down full-time jobs. By helping us reach our initial goal you will allow us to work on this project full time long enough to complete the game (in addition to helping us pay for expensive software licenses (Unity, Maya, etc), hire voice actors, pay server costs and other small expenses that crop up during development [coffee]).\nOn behalf of every member of the team \u2014 thank you for your support!\nSpending breakdown:\nCommunication is vitally important to us, and we suspect you feel the same way. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible on our end. So far we\u2019ve done our best to update our page with additional information that was either unlisted or hard to find. We are almost certain that by going through this page and our website your questions have will be answered. If you still have questions please get in touch with us  \u2014 we will resolve any questions you might have within 24 hours.\nBuilding off of our dedication to open communication we have set firm release dates for our Bedrock Beta (March 30, 2013) and base game (August 30, 2013).\nWe\u2019ve done this to ensure that YOU know exactly what to expect from our campaign and when to expect the game \u2014 instead of a broad \u201cin X year\u201d or the dreaded \u201cwhen it\u2019s ready\u201d  \u2014 we don\u2019t want you to guess when you\u2019ll get the game.\nOur Kickstarter video was narrated by the phenomenally talented actor Richard Ridings. We believe there is no one better to voice your actions in War for the Overworld. If you help us reach \u00a3225,000 we will be able to hire him on as the narrator for the entire game and pay for studio costs associated with his recording. After we reach this goal, we will move on to our Flex Goal system.\nWe sat down and discussed the best way to allow our crowdfunded project to best reflect the desires of the people who were backing it. Since the idea of predetermined additional features did not sit well with us we took the existing paradigm of Stretch Goals and improved upon it. We settled on the idea of Flex Goals \u2014 which allow you to choose which additional features you want added to the game.\nFor every \u00a375,000, there will be a Flex Goal unlock.  After our campaign ends, all supporters will be able to vote on which features they want added to the game through our backer-exclusive website. These features are extensions and will be developed after the base game has been completed.  We anticipate each will take no longer than four months to implement (with some features being far easier to implement). We will continue to add Flex Goals to the game until we run out of funding. In-depth explanations of Flex Goals are coming soon!\nMatchmaking & Ranking: We will implement more advanced skirmish matchmaking, ranked ladders, and player statistics for a fully featured and competitive multiplayer experience.\n2 Lords 1 Dungeon: Two Underlords will be able to cooperate in the same Dungeon.\nController Interface: We will develop a controller friendly interface which will allow us to support Ouya & Steam Big Picture, and possibly the Xbox Live Arcade & PlayStation Network.\nHero Mode: Control an advanced hero (additional spells and leveling system) in a dynamically changing dungeon crawler.\nExtended Underlord Campaign: We will add additional chapters to the Underlord campaign.\nEmpire Campaign: Play as the Empire and battle a series of Underlords in a full-length campaign.\nCo-op Campaign: Team up and take on the Empire with your friends in a specially designed campaign chapter.\nCompetitive Campaign: Assume the role of an Underlord or the Empire and fight one another in a full-length versus campaign chapter.\nArcade Campaign: The moderately insane Underlord Eccentrious has given you some...interesting tasks in order to gain his favour including Golf, Dodgeball, Whack-A-Dwarf, Tag & more.\nThe Adventures of Stumpy the Imp: Take control of Stumpy the Imp as he ventures through a full-length first person campaign throughout the Underworld.\nSurvival Mode: A co-op survival mode where you and your friends must build an impenetrable fortress to fend off ever increasingly difficult waves of enemies - who can survive the longest against this onslaught?\nUnderworld MOBA: A MOBA multiplayer map with advanced versions of our units enhanced for an action packed experience.\nClick here to view our NEXUS page!\nAlmost everyone on the team has modded a game at one time or another and we want to give you the power to easily mod War for the Overworld. \nBecause of this we've created an editing tool that we call Dungeoneer. This tool will allow you to create your own maps and campaigns in addition to implementing custom assets and creating new game modes.\nIf you're wondering how powerful it is \u2014 we are using Dungeoneer to build the actual game. By working with you we can ensure that Dungeoneer becomes the best tool it can be and will be providing access to it as part of the Bedrock Beta to improve it based on your feedback.\nWe wouldn't be here without the support of the wonderful community, but we can only reach our base and Flex Goals with YOUR help!  Help us by spreading the word.\nHave you already pledged?  We have this wonderful backer image that you can use anywhere you are looking to spread the word.\nHave any other ideas for helping our campaign?  Leave a comment on our Kickstarter page or send us a direct message. \nAlternatively, you can get in touch with us at the following locations:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe all love making games, the past couple of months that we spent on actual development have been amazing, but of course it's not all sunshine and roses -- game development is never an easy task. Some of the problems we have encountered already are the difficulties in working across 8 or so different time zones. This problem created bottlenecks in development. We solved this by creating an Assembla workspace for our project, which has tickets, reports for activity and roadblocks, and all sorts of neat features that keep us all on the exact same page... literally. \n\nWe haven't released a game before, it's true, but the quality of what we're doing speaks for itself -- if you have spent a few minutes in the Playable Showcase then you've probably realized that we are committed to a beautiful looking game that plays just like a big-budget title would from an established developer. \n\nMoney. We're asking for what we believe is reasonable, budgeted out for at least 8 months of *full time* development, which will easily be enough time to create this game. Considering all progress so far has been done in our spare time, at 40+ hours a week the game will be out faster than you can say Whack-a-Dwarf.\n\nThere are two main reasons why we are able to do all of this on what seems like a relatively small budget:\n\nFirst, the entire game is being built with modability and versatility in mind (it's almost entirely data driven), and as such, piecing the game together once we have conquered a few initial hurdles (many of which we have already achieved or are well on the way to doing so) will be a relatively quick and painless process.\n\nSecond, we have all taken a very careful look at what we actually need to keep ourselves going until the release of the game, as that is our goal here: making a game.

Having populated the Milky Way Galaxy, the Great Houses turn their eyes towards a neighboring galaxy, endeavoring to venture across the inter-galactic void to stake claim among uncharted stars. Each Great House seeks dominance, for in the race to achieve hegemony only one will be victorious.\nIn Hegemonic, each player assumes the leadership of a Great House. Players will explore sectors of the galaxy; build up their empire\u2019s industrial, political, and martial capacity; employ far-reaching technologies to outmaneuver and out fight competing empires; and perform calculated actions to plot their way to hegemony.\nHegemonic is distinct among empire-building games because the industrial, political, and martial systems of your empire each expand your overall economy, can be used to initiate direct conflicts across lines, and contribute power towards victory. Players earn points at the end of every turn based on the relative power they have in each galaxy region. Players able to strategically hold and maintain a majority stake in the regions through industrial expansion, political leverage, and military force, will be poised for victory. But never underestimate a well-timed and daring move from your opponent \u2013 they may snatch victory from your grip!\nHegemonic is a game of galactic exploration, empire building, conflict, and cunning that's playable in 30-45 minutes per player. Each player assumes the role of a Great House Leader, exploring sectors of the new galaxy; building industrial, political, and martial systems; employing far-reaching technologies; and performing calculated actions to leverage their power. The game scales from 2-6 players and uses a modular board system to create a balanced and highly replayable experience.\nPlayers exercise their power through industrial expansion, political leverage, and military force using a simultaneous action selection mechanism. The game proceeds over a number of turns until the galaxy is fully explored. Each turn consists of an exploration phase followed by three action phases and an arbitration phase. All players move through each phase collectively, resulting in a fast-paced and engaging gameplay experience.\nDuring the exploration phase, all players simultaneously collect income, then explore sectors of the galaxy by drafting sector tiles from a pool and adding them to the galaxy boards. Last, players discover new technologies by managing a hand of Resolution/Technology cards. Players must carefully guide the exploration of the galaxy to their own advantage while minimizing the benefits to their opponents.\nDuring each of the three action phases per turn, players secretly select one of seven action cards allowing them to expand their industrial, political, and martial capabilities; sabotaging, subverting, and blocking their opponent\u2019s efforts through conflict; or conducting further discoveries. All players reveal their action cards simultaneously, which are then resolved in a particular order, determined by the action card number and player order. Players must carefully sequence their own actions while anticipating their opponent's moves to fully execute their plans.\nIn the arbitration phase, players position themselves to become the Arbiter for the next turn, allowing them to manipulate player order and the action sequence to their advantage. Additionally, excess wealth and income is absorbed by their empire, with larger empires consuming more resources, forcing players to balance the growth and power of their empire with a sustainable resource flow.\nEach player balances his hand of dual-purpose Resolution/Technology cards, which are used to influence success in conflict or can be played as a permanent technology benefit for his empire.  Players must decide carefully how and when to use these cards as there is a tradeoff between saving high power cards for their resolution power and using them for their technological advantages. These dual-purpose cards ensure that each one can serve a strategic purpose in expanding a player's reign while greatly mitigating the luck of the draw.\nPlayers accumulate VPs at the end of each turn based on the relative control they have over each galaxy region. The game ends when the galaxy is fully explored by having a sector tile placed on every galaxy board location, typically 5 to 6 turns. Final bonus scoring includes points for total power and technology advancement. This scoring mechanism forces critical decisions throughout the game as you must continually balance the amount of power your bases provide and its location relative to other players. The player able to extend their power and influence the most strategically across the galaxy will establish the new dominant hegemony and win the game!\nTake a look at the: Game Rules\nGame Play Instruction videos:\n(Available in HD 720 if watched on YouTube directly)\nPART 1: Intro & Components\nPART 2: Setup, Turn Order, & Action Cards\nPART 3: Range & Power\nPART 4: Conflict, & Scoring\nGame Review videos:\nUndeadVIking's video review: \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU3eOlfi03A\n\nHegemonic 3-player game in progress.

It takes biodegradable PLA plastic filament, melts it into thin layers onto a surface, moves up and prints another layer. After layer upon layer, you are left with a physical object. You can use 3D modeling software such as Solidworks, the free google sketch up program, or go to thingiverse.com, download free things that people have already created, and print them out in your own home or office or classroom.\nWhat is RoBo 3D? \nRoBo 3D is the ultimate 3D printer everyone has been waiting for. We combined the best minds from the open source community, the best hardware we believe can give the best prints, and our own ideas based on our experience working with 3D printers. The open-source design is made so people like us can go online and find all the documents that show the ins and outs of how to make a RoBo 3D. In true rep-rap fashion, RoBo 3D has been made so that it can print out its own parts. Once in your hands, print out another for a friend! Come experience it and together, lets create something great.\nWho is RoBo 3D for?\nArchitects- print out model homes and buildings for clients. Change and print out again without hassle.\nDesigners- Have an idea that you want to bring to life? Print out your designs and see if they were everything you imagined. If not, change it and print out the next idea.\nHobbyists/DIY- Easily create your projects in the comfort of your own home. \nSmall Business owners- Manufacture your own products at the office!\nStudents- Senior engineering project coming up? Use RoBo 3D to proint the parts you need to get the job done done.\nHome owners- Replace broken household items for next to nothing!\nWhat can you create with RoBo 3D?\nThe amount of things you can print out with our 3D printer are only limited by your imagination. The list goes on and on but some examples are iphone cases, prototypes, household items, replacement/spare parts, and more! There are plenty of free 3D modeling software out there such as; google sketchup, tinkercad.com. \n3D Printer Beginners: Go to thingiverse.com, check out all the different designs people have created. When you see something you like, It's as easy as plugging RoBo 3D into the wall, plugging it into your computer via usb, downloading that design, and then let the printer do the work! \nWhy RoBo 3D is Great!\n**Open Source 3D Printer that anyone can use\nRoBo 3D was created for ease of use. Buying the fully assembled printer will allow you to plug it in, download an open source software like Google Sketchup, and start printing within minutes. You do not have to create anything yourself before you begin prints. Like we said, you can go to thingiverse.com, find something cool that has already been designed by other 3D printer artists, download it into Sketchup, and press print! Simple as that. \n**Low Cost Without Sacrificing Quality\nWe wanted to create RoBo 3D to not break the bank in the Consumer 3D Printing Industry. For just around $520, we are not only one of the cheapest, but one of the most precise printers out there...Which brings us to our next topic:\n*Precise and high detail printing\nWe had to make sure that our printer was extremely precise and as detailed as possible when printing. Still in the works, but these are some of the prints we have currently done! We will upload more as the crowd-funding continues.\nSummary of Rewards\nAll RoBo3D assembled and disassembled kits will include plastic filament so you can get started from the minute you plug it in.

PLA only\nRoBo 3D printer with installed heat bed for ABS\nManufacturing Pipeline: From Start to Finish\nProduct Development:\nAfter tinkering with other DIY 3D printers,such as Printrbot and Prusa, we decided to take our favorite components of each, and combine them into one awesome, easy to use 3d printer. Starting from scratch, we made 3D renders to see how our product would look on our desk. After agreeing on the right printer design, we set out to create it. Using mainly wood and our existing knowledge of key components, we made a mockup of our finished product. Our satisfaction of this mockup led us to further seek a manufacturing partnership. Using outsourcing websites and communicating with dozens of plastics manufacturers, we found a company to produce our 3D CAD engineered prototype.  We based our encasing around the idea and concept that people can build into it.  The holes are pre-cut, and pre-sized to fit the different screws, rods, etc in. The encasing will allow even the most beginner builder to make a RoBo 3D Printer.  While working on manufacturing the right encasing, we simultaneously sought out manufacturers for different components such as motors, rods, bearings, wires, hot end, build platforms, and the open source community for different parts. We found the best tactics, what not to do, and how to build an effective and efficient 3D printer inside our encasing.  \nProduction and fulfillment plans:\nWe will use a large part of the money to work together with our plastics manufacturer to create a mold for mass manufacturing so we can lower the cost per encasing in order to reduce our retail 3D printer price. This manufacturer has already successfully built us a prototype, has the 3D CAD engineered files and is ready to go once funds are provided.  \nWhile we are getting the mold manufactured, we will be simultaneously obtaining the other key components like motors, pulleys, etc which we already have developed the relationship with manufacturers for.  We have gotten this to a point where we just need the funds to fulfill the orders for parts.  For parts we can print, we will be running a RoBo 3D Farm that will allow us to print multiple parts at once that we can use to build Backer models.  All this will be done in a timely fashion and we will make sure we are as efficient as possible when it comes to compiling and fulfilling rewards. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSome of the risks and challenges throughout the production of RoBo 3D are:\n\n1) Overcoming great leaps when determining print quality- Everything in a 3D printer has to be tuned very fine in order for everything to work perfect. We know it will be a challenge and we challenge ourselves to create this product so that when it is fully assembled, it can be calibrated and in perfect working order very easily and efficiently. We know that that is the basis of a successful printer and we will strive throughout the funding stages to make sure that is our main focus. \n\n2) Manufacturing the printer encasing- A large portion of the investment will go to creating a mold for mass manufacturing allowing us to produce the encasing for a much cheaper price in the future. Essentially, we will then be able to lower our printer retail price. \n\n3) Delivering products in a timely manner according to our strict quality guidelines we impose on ourselves- we are almost fully done working on fine tuning the development of the encasing and all the components successfully working within the encasing so people can build RoBo 3D in their own homes if they wish to purchase the disassembled version. As the funding progresses and at this moment, that is something we are tackling and working directly with our manufacturer and CAD engineer on. It will be perfected and tuned properly and successfully. We also understand that in order to complete all the orders in a timely manner, we will need a way to build pieces quicker and consistently. Our solution to this problem is to build a RoBo 3D Farm with multiple printers all printing parts simultaneously. \n\n4) The founders all have their own individual work schedules outside of RoBo3D therefore matching time and time committing has made the process getting here take a little longer. We have all spoken in regards to this and have all agreed that we are getting closer to a stage where we want to be doing this full time because we enjoy it so much. We just need that push to the next stage. Taking it one step at a time and trying to put out the best product possible to you all is our first concern. \n\nAnother topic we want to address here is that we will assure questions and concerns by backers will be responded to promptly and taken very serious. We want to succeed and we have been following many different past projects on kickstarter and we know that the only way to build success from this point is to make sure that the backers are our #1 priority during this campaign outside of perfecting our actual product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "BATCH OF PRINTERS ARRIVED!

On top of this, we are just about to begin assembling another 1000 units overseas by our manufacturer there so those together will allow us to ship a large number of printers quicker. 2 of us are actually going to fly there and send out printers remote from the assembly house."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 1299, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1682938109/robo-3d-printer", "project_name": "RoBo 3D Printer"}}, {"backer": "Chris Brind", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome to my tavern, traveler.\nYou look like a...\n(brave warrior/ skilled fighter/ merciless rogue/ crazed monkey-mancer).\nSomeone of your talents deserves to be equipped with only the best. I have heard legend of certain extraordinary rings\u2026\nWhat is a Spinner Ring? \nA spinner ring is designed in a way that an outer smaller ring spins in a grooved inner ring that slips onto your finger. \nFeatures of Dice Rings\nPortable - You can take dice rings anywhere. No worries about rolling them into a heater duct or losing them to a hungry pet. They will stay firmly attached to your hand. Unless you\u2019re a zombie\u2026 then no guarantees. \n  Made from stainless steel - Our rings are made from the highest quality 316L stainless steel, a very strong and durable alloy that resists scratches, dents, and unorthodox abuse (troll punching). Like most other jewelry (even gold), it is an alloy. This type of steel contains 10-14% Nickel. For anyone who does not have a sensitivity to Nickel, these rings will be perfect for you. Unfortunately, we just could not get a hold of any adamantium or vibranium. \n  Produces fair rolls - The numbers are well distributed across the outer spinning band. There are no concentrations of high/low numbers, so they cannot be purposely aimed for or avoided. No cheese rolls.\n  Occupies idle hands - It is an awesome accessory to occupy idle hands and calm your mind. Spinner rings (also called worry rings) are frequently used as a stress relief tool, and are beloved by people with ADD everywhere.\n   Stylish - With these you are looking nerd chic!\nCurrent Available Styles\n(27 Dice Rings, 1 Life Counter Ring)\nr4\nr6\nr6pips - dots instead of numbers\nr8\nr10\nr12\nr20\nr24\nr100\n2r6\n2r6pips - dots instead of numbers\nrCards - draw a random card, including chance of a Joker (the star)\nrFudge - gives the sum result of a 4rFudge roll\nrYN - \"Yes, No\"\nrRPS - \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" in symbols\nrRPSLS - \"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock\" in symbols\nrElements - \"Fire, Water, Air, Earth\"\nrDirections - \"N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW\"\nrAlignment - Left Band: \"Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic\" | Right Band: \"Good, Neutral, Evil\"\nrAttititude - \"Hostile, Unfriendly, N (for Neutral), Friendly, Helpful\"\nrHitLoc - \"Head, Chest, L Arm, R Arm, L Hand, R Hand, L Leg, R Leg, L Foot, R Foot\"\n3r6\nrHeadsTails\nrElderFuthark\nrTarot\n3r6pips\n3r6sums\nrEnglishAlphabet\nUpcoming Stretch Goals\n$345K - rMoonPhases - 8 phases, using symbols\n$360K - rChineseZodiac\n$375K - rFudgeScale - \"Terrible, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great, Superb, Legendary\"\n$390K - 2r6sums - Actually a single spinner, showing sum results of a 2r6 roll\n$405K - rEmoticon\n$420K - rWesternZodiac\nRenderings for the new rings will be made after the project closes, so you can see what they'll look like before you have to choose your styles on the end-of-project survey.\nNOTE: Any rings that have 2 bands actually have a physical divider between them, creating 2 distinct grooves for each band. This prevents the bands from affecting each others outcomes.\nRPSLS symbols by Alexander Gwynne\nThe number in green is the goal we need to reach to unlock that style.\nThese are prototype rings. The number patterns will be different, and reflect the rendering and pattern images posted above.\nTake a closer look at some of our patterns here:\nNumbered rings & rCards: http://flic.kr/p/dA4HCk\nrFudge: http://flic.kr/p/dwVY1Q\nThe rTarot (a 3 band ring)\nIf the left band lands on \"Major\", you would look at the right band to see which of the Major Arcana cards you pulled. If the \"Major\" had a white background, the card was drawn right-side up, and if it had a black background, the card was drawn up-side down.\nIf the left band lands on one of the Tarot card suites (Wands, Cups, Swords, Pentacles), you would look at the middle band to see which Minor Arcana card was pulled. This same background rule applies to see if the Minor Arcana card was pulled right-side up or up-side down. \nA = Ace, P = Page, Kn = Knight, Q = Queen, K = King\nWhat's so great about the r24?\nHere is some information put together by one of our backers, Greg Rebholz. The r24 could be used as any die from 2 sided to 24 sided, and more!\nhttp://pastebin.com/PgPHAu22\nFinal Available Colors\nBlack with Steel engraving\nBlue with Steel engraving\nGold with Steel engraving\nRose-Gold with Steel engraving\nAny of our styles can be made in these colors:\nFinal Available Sizes (in US sizes)\n5, 5 1/2,\n6, 6 1/2,\n7, 7 1/2,\n8, 8 1/2,\n9, 9 1/2,\n10, 10 1/2,\n11, 11 1/2,\n12, 12 1/2,\n13, 13 1/2,\n14, 14 1/2,\n15, 15 1/2,\n16\nIntroducing the Life Counter Ring!\n(PATENT PENDING)\nThe Life Counter Ring is now available in the project! This is an animation to show how it works. The purple part in the middle represents a steel wave spring. We used red and purple to distinguish between parts, but the Life Counter is only available in all the same colors and sizes that the Dice Rings come in. Red and Purple are not available as color options.\nThe life counter ring is NOT a normal Dice Ring. It will be more expensive to manufacture because of the wave spring and notches. We also need more time to polish the design before sending it into production, which may take a couple of extra months. If you add an LCR to your order, it may delay shipping (see shipping info below).\nFor this project, you can replace a Dice Ring with a Life Counter Ring by adding $5 for each one. This conversion does not work with rings from the GAMBLER, CLASSIC PLAYER, MONOCHROMINATOR, or DICE RINGS FANATIC rewards, because those are sets of specific rings.\nPrintable Holiday & Christmas cards\nLet that special someone know an awesome gift has been ordered for them and will be with them soon.\n\"Holiday\" printable pdf\n\"Christmas\" printable pdf\nINSTRUCTIONS\nSTEP ONE: Print the file you like best. Make sure you select \"Fit to Page\" in your printer's dialogue box.\nSTEP TWO: Fold your card along the grey, dashed line down the center of the page.\nSTEP THREE: Trim off the excess paper. (Usually about 1/4 inch)\nSTEP FOUR: Write a message inside to personalize the card if you wish!\n(cards made by http://menthadesigns.com/)\nHow do I secretly find out a loved one's ring size? (referred to as \"her\" for simplicity)\nScenario 1 - scatter a large selection of cheaper rings across her front steps in each different size. She will come out, stunned by the strange surprise, but delighted. Wait for her to find a ring that she likes. She will jump up and down with joy and go inside to see herself in the mirror. Quickly gather up all of the rejected rings and run back home. Whichever size ring size is missing must be her ring size. Process of elimination.\nScenario 2 - Similar to Scenario 1, but using bowling balls with different size holes. She will invariably select the ball with the most comfortable sized finger holes. Also, you get 3 ring sizes in one shot! 2 fingers and a thumb!\nScenario 3 - Encourage her to poke a hole in play-dough, perhaps with a disarming inquiry. \"Hey, do you feel a weird rock or pebble in the center of this not-strange giant lump of play-dough?\" Freeze it immediately and use the hole to determine her finger size.\nScenario 4 - Challenge her to a sticky-hands pickpocketing contest, and wrap her hands in inside-out tape! Once the contest is over, preserve her gloves for sizing.\nScenario 5 - Take her to a jeweler and say you are getting her a custom set of brass knuckles. You'd be able to get her ring sizes, it's definitely not romantic, and she would have no idea what's coming. Downside - she'll be disappointed if she really wanted those brass knuckles.\nScenario 6 (Best scenario) - see if you can acquire/borrow on of her favorite rings and take that to a jeweler to see what size it is.\nWhere we\u2019re at \nWe have a manufacturer that produces very high quality spinner rings. We need feedback to see which of our designs we should be producing, and at what quantities. You will help shape the very first sets of rings we bring to market! \n*Design Copyright and patents pending\nWhere your gold will go \nOur manufacturer requires large minimum orders for each ring. Also, if we can order above that minimum, we can potentially drive down costs. Our initial goal will allow us to make and ship our first styles of rings in sizes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 (if smaller or larger have a high enough demand, we can add them).\nShipping for this project will be handled by hand, so we will be procuring the means to get your rings on your fingers ASAP. \nA masterful website will be built with the quotes graciously provided by you, our supporters. \nStretch goals history\nRINGS:\n$34K - rYN - \"Yes, No\"\n$45K - rRPS - \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\"\n$70K - 2nd Color option\n$108K - 3rd Color option\nBonus! - Added ring sizes 15 & 16\n$140K - 4th Color option\nBonus! - Life Counter Ring add-on\n$200K - Half sizes\nBonus! - rRPSLS\n$210K - rElements\n$220K - rDirections\n$230K - rAlignment\nBonus! - r24\n$240K - rAttitude\n$250K - rHitLoc\n$260K - 3r6\n$270K - rHeadsTails\n$280K - rElderFuthark\n$290K - rTarot\n$300K - 3r6pips\n$315K - 3r6sums\n$330K - rEnglishAlphabet\nCurrent demand for new styles\nVoted on by our Backers!\nCAN'T DO\nMagic 8 Ball - 20 options, some with multiple words, won't fit on a ring\nPrice is Right wheel - too many colors, we can only do a single color with steel engraving\nRoulette wheel - 3 different colors, can't do\nREWARDS summary\n$5          Immortal Word-Smith - Personal quote added to our website\n$15        Lone Adventurer - One ring + quote\n$40        The Gambler - rCards, 2r6, r100 + quote\n$42        Gamer Lite - 3 rings + quote\n$70        Multiclasser - 5 rings + quote\n$90        Classic Player - r4, r6, r8, r10, r12, r20, r100 + quote\n$130      Game Master - 10 rings + quote\n$200      Monochrominator - Currently 28 Dice Rings + 1 Life Counter Ring, all in a single color, + quote\n$340      Monochrominator 2\n$800      Dice Rings Fanatic - Currently 112 Dice Rings + 4 Life Counter Rings, one of each style in each color, + quote\nCombining multiple rewards\nIf you want to combine multiple rewards, or you want multiples of the same reward, or any combination in between, just increase your pledge to be able to cover the extra rewards. Do NOT add extra shipping for each extra reward. That only needs to be done once for your whole order (if you are an international backer). Look further down at the \"How much do I pledge?\" table. In most cases, it will be cheaper for you to do it that way instead.\nYou CANNOT stack the MONOCHROMINATOR or DICE RINGS FANATIC pledges. The only way to get one of those is by pledging for it. If they are sold out, then they are sold out.\nAdding additional rings\nIf you have pledged for at least 1 ring <LONE ADVENTURER>\nadd an extra Dice Ring for $15.\nadd an extra Life Counter Ring for $20.\nIf you have pledged for at least 3 rings <GAMER LITE>\nadd extra Dice Rings for $14 each.\nadd extra Life Counter Rings for $19 each.\nIf you have pledged for at least 10 rings <GAME MASTER>\nadd extra Dice Rings for $13 each.\nadd extra Life Counter Rings for $18 each.\nAdditional rings can always be any style, size, or color.\nSubstituting Life Counter Rings\nYou can replace a Dice Ring with a Life Counter Ring by adding $5 for each one.\nHow much do I pledge? This is madness!\nFind the row that matches how many Dice Rings you want. In that row, find the column that matches how many Life Counter Rings you want. Pledge that amount, plus shipping! Choose the reward that matches the color code.\nIf you are in the green area, but pledging more than what is on the chart, use this formula:\nPledge = 13 * (# of Dice Rings) + 18 * (# of Life Counter Rings) + Shipping\nShipping\nIncluding Life Counter Rings in your reward may delay your order by a couple months. If you want the rings as soon as possible, you can split your order. The Dice Rings would be sent out immediately, and the Life Counter Rings would be sent as soon as they are ready.\nTo ship your order as a SINGLE shipment:\nUS & Canada - Free (just pledge as if \"In the US\")\nInternational - Add $10\nTo ship your order as a SPLIT shipment:\n(1st shipment for Dice Rings, 2nd shipment for Life Counter Rings)\nUS & Canada - Add $5 (instead of free, still pledge as if \"In the US\")\nInternational - Add $20 (instead of $10)\nOther interesting tidbits", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt was initially difficult to get the rings to spin smoothly and to land on truly random numbers. Waiting to get prototypes from the manufacturer to see if design changes are effective takes time, especially with the high standards we place on our products. \n\nWith our current manufacturing method, the colors that are possible to produce on steel are black, blue, gold, rose-gold, and coffee. These will become available as the project goes on. Enamel scratches off over time, so we went with a process that changes the surface of the steel instead of just \"painting\" it (called PVD coating). \n\nWe do not know the quantities our project will reach, so we had to push our projected fulfillment date to February to be safe. Our manufacturer has no problem fulfilling any quantity, but higher quantities will delay shipment.\n\nWe also did not know how big the demand for these may be, so we are taking a risk starting with a higher goal amount, but with a huge selection of different styles.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "A Few Exciting Items!", "update_content": "We created a super awesome marketing video that we'd love for y'all to pass 'round!

But not here.  Here, in the many universes of Limit Theory, space is luminous, vibrant, and rich with opportunity.  Step into an open-world, sandbox universe in which you can explore, trade, pirate, mine, escort, hunt, defend, build, and more.\nIn brief, Limit Theory is:\nAn open-world space simulator / RPG\nA sandbox game : No story, no restrictions.\nCompletely procedural : A completely new universe is only a button-click away.\nInfinite : The game universe has no boundary.\nThird-Person or First-Person : Command your ship from within or without.\nDeep and intelligent : Engage in far more than just combat or trading.\nTwitch-Based : Aim and fire weaponry directly, as you would in a shooter.\nApproachable : Intuitive controls and slick interfaces ensure that playing will never feel like a job.\nStrategic : Command an entire fleet when you amass enough cash to purchase more ships.\nExtensively-Customizable : Outfit your ship, fleet, and space stations with whatever equipment you choose.\nSingle Player : A universe built just for you, that no one else will ever get to see (unless you choose to share it with them!)\nBeautiful and Atmospheric : Gaze in awe at a universe as diverse, vibrant, and uniquely-atmospheric as your dreams.\nSound like something you might want to play?  Then read on.\nEnjoy your Freedom Among the Stars\nLike any good space sim, Limit Theory offers you the chance to explore a vast universe, prospect and mine minerals in asteroid fields, take jobs as a patrolman, escort, bounty hunter, courier, etc, or become a pirate and hijack convoys.\nCommand a Fleet ... Or Many.\nWhen you've acquired enough wealth, hire other pilots and purchase more ships. Customize and outfit your fleet with whatever weaponry and equipment you desire, then fly alongside your armada in combat, or send them off to explore, trade, or conquer while you attend to other affairs. No restrictions are placed on the number of ships that you can own. A wealthy player can play the game much like an RTS, achieving victory from afar.\nBuild Your Empire.\nBuy or construct buildings on planet surfaces as well as stations in space. Acquire mines, factories, trading outposts, and more. Set up production chains to build guns, munitions, or even new ships. When hauling goods for a profit gets old, why not try manufacturing the goods instead?\nInteract with a Living Universe.\nExperience a rich variety of interactions with an artificial intelligence that actively explores, trades, works, and lives just as you do. Just because the game is single player doesn't mean you'll be alone. Take jobs, strike deals, and become friends with the inhabitants of the universe. Need an escort to get you through a particularly dangerous stretch of space? Call up the mercenary that you met last week on a station a few systems away. Need just a tad more ore to get the furnaces of your new factory cranking? Call up your old pals from your days as a miner, and offer them a nice price for finding what you need.\nA rich social interaction system is key to making Limit Theory more than the average single player experience. With the ability to keep track of and build relationships with the non-player characters that you meet in the universe, a whole new world of gameplay opens up, allowing for a wealth of creative ways to achieve success without ever having to arm your missile bays! (Although, to be realistic, you'll still probably end up doing so a few times...)\nIn a universe of such freedom, how will you spend your time?  Here are just a few of the possibilities:\nYou are a Merchant.  You have explored the farthest reaches of the universe, and know exactly where and for what price anything can be bought. For the right price, you can move anything. You supply what is demanded, and demand what you deserve - which is substantial...because you do so much more than move goods. You supply the universe.\nYou are an Admiral.  You command a ship that dwarfs everything in sight. Frigates and cruisers hover about you, pretending to offer protection, but you don't need it. At the first sight of an enemy, hundreds of bolts carrying terrawatts of energy pour out of your ship, vaporizing the unwanted presence in seconds. Slowly and steadily, you drift from system to system, steamrolling those who oppose your authority. You conquer the universe.\nYou are an Explorer.  You move quickly between systems in a nimble ship. With a keen eye and even keener sensing technology, you pick up all the details that everyone else misses. Selling ore locations to miners, enemy ship locations to warring factions, and uncharted system locations to aspiring empire-builders, you broker your knowledge to those that are ignorant of the beautiful and bountiful universe around them. You uncover the universe.\nYou are a Pirate.  That's what they call you, but you prefer to think of yourself as an \"opportunist,\" because, when the opportunity arises, you can and will take what you want, unlike those bound by the chains of law. Your home station resides in dense, unscannable clouds of dust. In this dark blanket of matter, you are untouchable by the arrogant hands of the law. You exploit the universe.\nYou are a Wingman.  You fly alongside hulking ships that make your fighter look trivial. But you aren't. You are critical. You know where and when the ambush will come - you've seen it a thousand times before. You know that they'll go for the engines first, and that, while they're doing so, you'll acquire a perfect lock on their fuel tanks. The pirates think it will all be over in a few minutes. They're wrong. It'll be over in seconds, but not how they anticipate.  You protect the universe.\nYou are a Miner.  You can spot the shimmering reflection off of asteroids a lightyear away. You know the color and composition of each and every raw ore that the generous galaxy provides. In the deepest, darkest corners of space, you harvest that which will become warheads, turrets, and even ships. You are the very heart that pumps blood through the arteries of the universe. You create the universe.\nYou are Everything.  Life is not black-and-white, and neither is your career. You can't devote your life to one profession. And that's fine, because Limit Theory won't make you. All of the above are options - but you won't find a checkbox for selecting which life to lead. The universe is yours for the taking, and your time therein will be whatever you choose to make of it.\nIt's Infinite.\nNo matter how far out into the universe you delve, you will never find an edge. The algorithms behind the universe have been designed very carefully, such that they are mathematically-guaranteed to generate universes of infinite size, each and every time. What's more, each universe has a unique number associated with it - a \"seed\" - that defines it entirely. By sharing that seed number with someone else, you can both explore and experience the exact same universe!\nIt's Totally Procedural.\nWell, almost...the music and sound effects will be hand-made. But everything you see will be procedural. Planets, nebulae, stars, asteroids, ships, stations, textures, and so on. Thanks to cutting-edge procedural generation technology, Limit Theory will have the ability to keep providing you with new experiences. No matter how long you play, there will always be more to explore, see, learn, and conquer!\nEvery mission, every event, and every asset that you encounter in game will be unique - and it won't be the same next time you play. You'll never \"beat\" the game, nor will you ever know it like the back of your hand. When you feel that it has become too familiar, all you must do is click \"New Game,\" and you will once again be completely lost.\nIt's All About the Interaction.\nLT will focus heavily on bringing the universe to life with a deep and powerful AI engine that includes advanced, high-level planning. You aren't the only one trying to make your way in the universe, and your path will regularly cross with others that are trying to do the same - for better or for worse.\nIt's All About You.\nLimit Theory will not offer a story, a campaign, or a guiding direction of any sort. You are unique, so isn't it best that you craft your own unique story, rather than live out a pre-fabricated one?\nHere are some screenshots from the current prototype. They're straight out of the game, except for the small border and logo text at the bottom.\n.\nLimit Theory is far from a wide-eyed dream! After only three months of full-time work, I've brought LT from a mere idea to the well-underway game that you see here. Furthermore, much of the three months was spent developing core engine technology, since the engine is being built from scratch.\nAt this stage, much of the graphics technology has been completed, most of the core engine is in place, and many of the procedural algorithms are well underway. Gameplay is the largest part of what remains, and I fully intend to make gameplay my burning focus for the rest of the development process. Gameplay is king, I recognize that! Limit Theory will not be about graphics (although they will be good!). It will be about gameplay. Deep, rich, engaging gameplay, just like the space sim genre deserves.\nThe planned release date is Early 2014. That may seem like quite a while, but I'm not interested in making unrealistic promises, and, to be realistic, LT is going to take a lot of work. But if my work so far represents only three months, can you imagine what another year-and-some will do, especially given that much of the engine heavy-lifting is finished?\nI hope you'll help me find out where the project will be in a year!\nHi! I'm Josh Parnell, the one-man team that's going to bring you Limit Theory! I'm a passionate game programmer with a particular love for graphics, space, procedural content, and open worlds. I guess you can see why I'm excited about this project :)\nI currently study computer graphics at Stanford, but that doesn't stop me from working 40 hours a week on LT. I absolutely love working on the game - expanding the features, making it more beautiful, and discovering new algorithms for creating bigger and better content to fill the universe.\nI grew up playing games like the Elder Scrolls series (Morrowind will always have my heart!!), the Egosoft X series, Freelancer, and various Star Wars titles. All of them inspired and left me with a burning desire to someday build my own world - free, open, procedural, and infinite. So I devoted myself to studying graphics and procedural generation technology. And here I am, years later, finally ready. I'm ready to realize my dream. I'm ready to bring you a space sim that will inspire and excite you - and allow you to live out all those grand sci-fi adventures!\nI definitely feel most at home when I'm engulfed in my code.  I've been coding since I was 10 (that was 10 years ago, for those who are wondering..), and since then, c++ has become just about as much of a first language to me as English!  Going for a week without coding makes me uneasy.  Good thing I've always got LT to work on these days :)\nI love taking on projects that seem insurmountable. Perhaps the most exciting thing in the world for me is taking on something that seems impossible, hammering away at it for hundreds of hours, and ending up with a beautiful result. As an example, I did this last year when I won the grand prize at the 2012 Stanford Rendering competition by writing a GPU-accelerated renderer (using MC path tracing) from scratch. Here's the award-winning image produced by said renderer:\nStanford Rendering Competition 2012 ~ Grand Prize Image\nThat's exactly what I intend to do with Limit Theory. I have pitched you something that probably sounds impossible, or too hard for one young developer. And it seemed like that to me too, when I first started. But now, I can see that Limit Theory is just like any of my other projects: it will require extreme devotion, untold hours, and endless perseverance, but it is very much possible.\n\"Judge me by my size, do you?  And well you should not.  For my ally is the force, and a powerful ally it is.\" ~ Yoda\nI may not have the name, but I promise you, I have the passion!  Please, I urge you, don't judge me by my lack of reputation. Judge me by what you see here. Judge me by the quality of this content. Keep in mind that I have far fewer distractions than high-profile game designers. That being said, I also have far fewer resources...which is why I need your help!\nGive me a chance, and I will give you a universe :]  (Well, actually, infinitely many universes...!)\n[ $20 + ] The Game.\nGood choice. Get a downloadable, DRM-free copy of the game so that you can hop into your ship and start exploring the endless universe(s) the day it comes out.\n[ $30 + ] The Soundtrack, The Book.\nDownload the maximum-quality version of the Limit Theory Original Soundtrack (composed by yours truly), as well as a digital copy of \"Architecture of a Universe,\" the making-of book with development shots, commentary, and details concerning the technical magic that makes Limit Theory possible.\n[ $40 + ] The Hitchhiker's Maps\nThe universes of Limit Theory are big. Infinitely so. If you're going to make your way around, it sure would be nice to have a map. We've got you covered. The Hitchhiker's Map will give you information concerning the starting regions of a handful of different universes. You'll see planets, space stations, asteroid fields, jump gates and jump holes, and more.\nWith these digital maps in hand, you'll start with a leg up on finding your fortune in the stars!\n[ $50 + ] The Hitchhiker's Guides\nMaps are good, but insider information is even better. Many Bothans died to bring you this detailed information. The Hitchhiker's Guide, much like the Hitchhiker's Map, will give you a wealth of information concerning a handful of universes. Unlike the maps, however, these guides will include detailed  planetary economic data, planetary point-of-interest data (including goods bought/sold, ships manufactured, etc), locations of rich ore fields, optimal trade routes, faction dispositions, and more.\n[ $60 + ] The BETA.\nBe the first to explore the infinite expanse of the Limit Theory universe(s). You'll get access to a closed BETA well before the game's official release. Voice your opinion, and you may just have a significant impact on the game!\n[ $75 + ] The Prototype(s).\nIf you can't wait long enough for the BETA, that's okay...because at this tier, you'll receive exclusive access to a PRE-ALPHA combat prototype/playable demo, coming in early 2013. You'll be among the first players in the world to experience the epic fleet combat of Limit Theory! You'll also get the chance to provide me with feedback, so if you don't like something, you'll be in a good position to get it changed long before release.\nWhile I'm only officially promising one prototype, there's a lot of cool technology in Limit Theory that I want to show off and have tested by real players. I anticipate releasing more than one prototype, because there's a lot more than just combat that needs early testing! At this level, you get access to any and all prototypes that I decide to release.\n[ $100 + ] The Discs.\nGet your hands on a shiny new copy of both the game and the soundtrack on custom CDs. At this tier, you will get the custom discs in sleeves. These are only available through this Kickstarter offer, so your CDs will be truly limited-edition!\n[ $150 + ] The Box, The Credits.\nNot only will you get a physical copy of the game and soundtrack, but also a custom physical game box, adorned with beautiful Limit Theory artwork. But that's not all. Open up that box, shove that CD in the drive, run the game and click \"credits\"...and what do you know? There you are. Your name, immortalized in Limit Theory history under \"supporters.\"\n[ $200 + ] The Map, The Signatures.\nIncluded in your physical Limit Theory box, you will find a physical map of Universe 3827, the default starting universe for new players (of course, since the universe is infinite, the map cannot be complete!) Never take a road trip to a foreign system without a map in hand! While other players wander around in the (metaphorical) dark, you'll be whipping across systems, doing business as you please without ever having to wonder where you are. Note that this map will show at least twice as much as the Hitchhiker's Map version (and of course, it's physical)!\nMoreover, you will also find that both the map and box have been signed by your dev team (me)!\n[ $250 + ] The T-Shirt.\nCDs and boxes and maps are all good and well...but when you want to show off your support in a flashier, more stylish way, you're going to need a shirt. Not just any shirt, though. You're going to need something that says \"hey, I'm all about unbounded space exploration, and that's why you should come over here and talk to me.\" How better to do so than by having a little slice of an infinite universe slathered across your chest?\nMock-Up of Limit Theory T-Shirt\nIn all likelihood, there will be multiple awesome designs to choose from by the time I'm ready to ship the shirts, so it's entirely likely that you'll end up looking even cooler than you're imagining right now as you picture yourself in this extravagant cosmic drapery.\n[ $300 + ] The Poster, The Signature.\nOkay, so your chest is covered, your disc drive is full, your box shelf is boxed, and your map shelf is mapped. But what about your wall? It's probably feeling a little left out in the cold. But you can fix that. How about adorning it with a large, signed, numbered Limit Theory poster, printed on high-quality, glossy poster paper?\n[ $400 + ] ??? TOP-SECRET SCHEMATICS ???\nGet your hands on an ORIGINAL, ONE-OF-A-KIND \"idea sheet\" from the development process, signed and dated by me. I write down all of my best ideas regarding technical features as soon as they come to me. You will receive a laminated, one-of-a-kind element from this set of notes! Unfortunately, I only have a limited number of grand ideas...lucky for you, that means you'll own a truly-unique piece of LT history (and possibly have the blueprints of a technological aspect of the game that has not been publicly disclosed)! I'll also include a historical explanation of whatever is on the tech report, and summarize how and why it was such an important achievement.  Unlock secrets ranging from the algorithm for constructing a universe of guaranteed-infinite size, to the mechanisms that allow AI players to formulate and pursue high-level goals and aspirations!\nNote that higher-level tiers include one schematic each.\n[ $500 + ] The Physical Book\nGet a printed, hardcover, limited edition copy of \"Architecture of a Universe,\" signed and numbered by me, including a personal message of thanks.The book will be of the utmost quality, printed on high-grade, premium paper with a hardcover. It will also include extra content not found in the downloadable version, most likely in the form of extra details concerning the magical secrets behind Limit Theory technology!\n[ $1,000 Exclusive ] The Custom Edition.\nI will write a CUSTOM VERSION of Limit Theory JUST FOR YOU!  In it, I will include a small-to-medium feature of your request that did not appear in the publicly-released version. I will be willing to extend the code by a few thousand lines for your personal edition, which will result in a cool new feature for you and only you to play with! Of course, you could also just request a bunch of minor cosmetic changes (like having your name appear on menus, changing the appearance of lasers, nebulae, or planets, or perhaps making the NPCs have Star Wars names...), since those take very little time.\n[ $1,000 + ] The Elder Council.\nI've given you all that I have to offer in the way of physical goods. But it's not the end. At this level, you gain membership to the Limit Theory Elder Council, a VIP group of high-tier backers that will be given special privileges, including regular interaction and meetings with me, as well as exclusive content updates that will not be released to the general public. Such updates will include videos of new features, work-in-progress screenshots, and perhaps even playable demos!\nAs a member of the council, your word will be taken very seriously, and I will make suggestions made by council members a top priority. Your words will carry significantly more weight than the average forum-goer's, and, as such, you'll be given a special rank on the Limit Theory forums to identify you as a member of the council.\nIn addition to being able to voice your opinion individually, the council will also get chances to vote as a collective on features that should be prioritized, major game design decisions, and general matters of high importance.\nFinally, your status in the Limit Theory credits will be upgraded from \"supporter\" to \"Elder Council.\" Your name will, of course, be more prominent than those of the non-council supporters.\n\nCan I Pledge Without Kickstarter?\nYes, I've set up a PayPal page for doing so here. Unfortunately, due to limitations with PayPal, I can only offer one tier, so you will only be able to select the $20 tier. Please note that you WILL be refunded if you pledge via PayPal and we do not meet our Kickstarter goal!\nWill it be on Mac/Linux?\nIf we hit the stretch goal, then yes, definitely!  Otherwise, I will make porting an immediate priority after release, but cannot guarantee a Mac/Linux port.  However, the codebase is completely portable, so I wouldn't anticipate any problems doing so.\nCan you Land on Planets?\nVery much so.  In fact, much of the deep gameplay will involve planet activity.  More information to come in future Kickstarter updates!\nWhat About Space Stations?\nYes, of course there will be landable space stations that will, like planets, be the core of much deep gameplay.  Conceptually, they aren't much different from planets, except that they have a different aesthetic and can be destroyed.\nAre Planet Landings Seamless?\nYou decide!  Right now, the plan is to have a transition between space and planetary surfaces.  But if you'd like to be able to fly straight from space to the planet surface, without ever having to see a loading screen or fade-out, then help me hit that stretch goal!  The goal will be announced when we get closer to the appropriate level.\nCan You Get Out of Your Ship and Walk Around?\nNo, not this time around.  Someday, whether in an expansion, LT II, or whatever.  This is one of my most revered dream features, but I have been realistic in choosing what I can and can't implement within a reasonable time frame, and I don't feel comfortable that I could do justice to this feature in a reasonable amount of time.\nWhat Engine Does the Game Use?\nI have written the engine from scratch using C++ and OpenGL.  I felt that it was the right choice for several reasons.  First, it allows me to develop my own unique style - something that games using prefab engines often fail to create.  Second, and most importantly, the engine is designed completely around procedural paradigms, and this influences the architecture of the engine in many ways.  Every file is written with \"everything procedural\" in mind.\nWhat Does the Name Mean?\nThe founders of the Ancient Colony were idealists.  They conjectured - long before the advent of space travel, long even before the rise of technology - that all limitations are merely illusions.  Physical, mental, emotional...every limit is simply a misunderstanding.  A failure of the mind.  Anything and everything can be overcome with the right thought, the right idea, the right insight.  This philosophy became known as Limit Theory, and it prevailed throughout the ages.  It was idealistic and unrealistic, but it drove them forward.  It pushed them to distant lands, to the corners of the Ancient Planet, into space, and, ultimately, to the furthest reaches of the universe.  Limit Theory is the theory that limits do not exist.  It is not only the philosophy of the Ancient Colonists, but also of your developer.  The game is the ultimate embodiment of the Limit Theory ideal - that one can be, and should be, free of all limitation.\nHow Will you Distribute?\nThe usual: Steam, Desura, proprietary online download system (if necessary).\nWhy Isn't There an Option to Have In-Game Planets/Stations/Systems/... Named After Backers?\nI thought long and hard about this one.  It seems to be the norm for Kickstarter projects these days, to have backers included in the game in some way more than just the credits.  While I am eternally grateful to my backers, I feel that I must place the utmost importance on creating an immersive experience.  Backer names will no doubt seem out-of-place, perhaps even jarring, to players in the game world.  In addition, the naming systems in the game use a system that is far more complex than a simple random list, so that names have certain characteristics based on faction and region.  There's simply no way to integrate backer names into the game without breaking the immersive, procedural experience that I want Limit Theory to be!  But you can certainly get a shout-out in the credits!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLimit Theory is a large undertaking..I won't deny it! I certainly wouldn't blame you for questioning whether a single young programmer could fulfill what may seem like a AAA-grade promise. But the key difference here is in assets. Limit Theory has no assets - they are procedurally generated - which means all I really have to worry about is algorithms and gameplay.\n\nSince Limit Theory is totally procedural, I don't have to spend day after day modeling new ships or painting new background textures. When I spend a day working on a procedural algorithm, not only does it enhance the quality of one asset, it enhances the quality of EVERY asset of that kind in the game. This is really an incredibly efficient development process. The problem of building an entire game of assets becomes the problem of building an algorithm to construct a single type of asset. It's this sweeping simplification of game development that allows me to work quickly enough to build Limit Theory as a one man team.\n\nNow, you might be skeptical. You might think that everything will look the same after a while, perhaps because you've seen poorly-done procedural content before. But that's not the way it has to be. That's not a fundamental property of PCG. Procedural algorithms can be as complex, diverse, and varied as the author allows them to be. Since they are at the heart of Limit Theory, you can rest assured that I will be spending countless hours advancing and tuning the algorithms to make sure that they produce high-quality yet diverse content.\n\nSo there you have it. At the risk of sounding ludicrous, my claim to you is that building Limit Theory is easy. I build an algorithm for planets, ships, background nebulae, asteroids, stations, etc...and then I build the gameplay. I recognize that the latter, in particular, is quite a complex task, which is why I have allotted over a year for it.\n\nWith procedural algorithms and an endless supply of coffee by my side, I will face the challenge of building Limit Theory, and I can't wait to show you the result :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #53", "update_userinfo": "The End", "update_content": "It is with a heart of lead that I write this announcement.

Rest assured that there are no hard feelings nor burnt bridges; she left of her own volition due to changes in her work availability. During her time here, Lindsey built up an impressive procedural geometry library that I'll be able to leverage in finishing up the remaining algorithms.

Professional, amateur and first-time filmmakers will be brought together as a community of people making and sharing films in this unique way.\nSince 1999, the international short film competition, straight 8, has challenged people everywhere to make a film on a single cartridge of super 8mm cine film, editing only in camera and allowing no post-production.  This means only one take of each shot and all shots must be taken in chronological order.  There's no cheating as straight 8 gets your cartridge processed at the lab for you. \nSuccessful films have been shown at straight 8's annual premiere at Cannes Film Festival for 10 years and also showcased online and on TV.  Super 8 is a film medium created in the 1960's.  Each cartridge lasts 3 minutes 20 seconds and the processed spools would be played back on a projector... often aimed at a sheet on the wall, with the lights out, usually with your Dad swearing a lot.\nNow Widebeam Digital are working with straight 8 to produce an app based on the ETHOS of straight 8, rather than the super 8 element of straight 8.\nUsing the 'everyman' cameras of today - the iPhone/iPad/iPod - the straight 8 app enables the discipline of starting and finishing a short film without the opportunity for editing or post-production!\nThe whole film, up to 3 minutes in length, will be created, finished and ready to be shared - all within the device. With a myriad of camera control features, built-in looks and music to choose from, the app offers a huge array of exciting possibilities for iOS device-wielding cineastes. Yet at the same time, it is simple enough to appeal to anyone wanting to fire up the app and document anything - be it a party, weekend trip with friends or whatever!!\nSD and HD versions of your film will be created and ready to share into the app's own community and the world at large.\nA competition feature for the app is planned eventually, to emulate the original super 8 competition of straight 8.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nAs you can see from our video and screenshots we have managed to create a decent working prototype.  We needed to check it was possible and the best way to start planning it was to start to build it.\nWe need your help to enable us to finish the app to the high standard we'd all expect and want.  There is no short cut to this, it requires significant numbers of hours by a number of great coders, designers, testers etc. to make it unbreakable and brilliant.\nWe need to make it more user friendly than it currently is and more backwards compatible with older (and slower) iPhones and iPods, so more users can benefit from the app.\nThe funding will work two fold, as well as helping us financially, the extra pool of hungry Beta testers will help us enormously with building on what we have started.  We want to listen and respond to suggestions for camera techniques, functionality, video looks and combinations.   \nOverall we want the app to be the most exciting, inspiring and creative film-making app there is - think Instagram but where they deal in single JPEGs, we are dealing with 3 minute HD and SD movie files!\nAll of this requires investment, and with some funding to help us, we can achieve everything we set out to do - plus make new friends along the way...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEveryone involved in creating this app is a filmmaker and we want the film-making community out there to be excited about it. Creating an stand-out app of a standard we all feel excited about is our goal and this is quite a task in the amazing app marketplace.\n\nWe're putting some very ambitious features into the app and with the file sizes of modern Apple iPhone and iPad video footage, this is no mean feat. We want the app to be intuitive and fun for experienced and novice filmmakers alike and it has to be 'unbreakable'.\n \nWidebeam Digital has a reputation to uphold, having created highly successful apps for and with Aardman Animation and Hat Trick Productions and more. Hence we all have a reputations at stake, as this could determine the future survival of the company - you're only as good as your last job! And projects like this that are created from inside a company for the love of the idea, and not commissioned, must be stand-out ideas and demonstrate the strengths of our relatively small company.\n\nLikewise straight 8 has earned cult status in the indie film-making community with its super 8 challenge which started in 1999 and has just celebrated 10 consecutive years at Cannes. There are many hardcore straight 8 filmmakers that may see this as sacrilege to the spirit of the movement and so its a risk to 'go digital', when the original was so analogue. It needs to be the perfect complement to the successful analogue competition and equally beguiling. \n\nTogether we need to ensure that this is a world class app that is instantly loveable and infinitely useable. An app that people will want to download, will enjoy using from the get-go, will be thrilled to explore further, will talk about and will share a myriad of amazing original material within.\n\nThere are no short cuts to this. It's hours and hours and hours of coding and testing and writing, designing, re-writing, re-designing. As the expression goes... it takes years to become an overnight success!\n\nSince we all started working together on this app it has grown disproportionately in scale, complexity and ambition. All three of us, Ed, Joe and Paul come from the film and television industry and have worked in demanding conditions all over the world, filming diverse subjects and dealing with everything imaginable.

The MagPi is the world's only magazine for users of the $35 Raspberry Pi computer.\nThe Mag Pi - Volume 1 (Issues 1 to 8)\n\nThe MagPi magazine has been published online each month since May 2012. Each 32 page magazine is created entirely by enthusiasts using the Raspberry Pi. It can be read online or downloaded for free from our website, www.TheMagPi.com, which receives 100,000 hits every month.\n\nWe have always wanted to make the magazine available in printed form, so we did a test print run of issue 6. The result was a large number of requests for all back issues to be printed. However there are significant upfront costs associated with professionally printing a magazine and a significant volume of magazines must be printed to get the price point to where we want it to be.\n\nThis is where this project comes in.\n\nIssue 6 Printed Copy\n\nYour pledges will bring The MagPi from virtual to reality. If there is sufficient interest then this will give us confidence to continue to make printed copies of The MagPi available when we start Volume 2 next year.\n\nRather than make individual back issues available, we decided it would be better and more cost effective to make Volume 1 of The MagPi available as one \"bumper pack\". Volume 1 will comprise of all 8 issues published in 2012, including the upcoming December issue. Additionally you get an exclusive binder to hold all the individual magazines with artwork which will be designed especially for this Kickstarter project.\nWith 32 pages per magazine, that represents 256 full colour pages of pure content. Each issue contains a diverse selection of topics, all focused on the Raspberry Pi. There are regular articles on programming in Python, Scratch and C++ plus numerous hardware projects using the GPIO interface. Other articles include an exclusive interview with Eben & Liz Upton, playing computer music, 150+ games for your Raspberry Pi, how to turn your Raspberry Pi into a media centre, building \"Skutter\" - a Raspberry Pi controlled robot, and many, many more articles.\n\nIssue 7 Scratch Patch Article\nThe funding goal is not the real target. We need a minimum of 250 pledges for the magazine before we can create a suitable printing run to make it worthwhile for us, and a great price for you. (Thanks to everyone's support this target has now been hit!!)\n\nIf you don't want the printed magazines, but you would just like to show us your appreciation for making The MagPi available to view online for free, please choose either the \"Fuzzy Glow\" or \"Sticker Madness\" pledges.\nWhere does the money go?  \nHere at The MagPi we are all volunteers - we are certainly not in this for the money. We take inspiration from the Raspberry Pi Foundation and use our talents, enthusiasm plus an extensive amount of personal time to give back to the global community and help further the education of anyone using the Raspberry Pi computer.\nHowever, there are certain administrative costs that go towards producing a high quality magazine. Printing magazines is certainly not free plus there are costs related to website hosting and bandwidth usage. While the vast majority of the pledge amount will be used to print the magazines and provide the rewards, there will be a small surplus from each pledge. This will be used to fund the ongoing costs of producing The MagPi plus it will allow us to explore other ways of expanding the availability of the magazine, introduce other types of content plus translations to other languages. We'd love to read your ideas in the comments section about what you would like to see in future issues of the magazine.\nYou can help\nWith every pledge you help us continue to produce The MagPi. However, you can also help by volunteering - time is also one of our limiting factors. If you have an article you would like to submit, or want to help with the magazine layout and general production, please send an email to editor@themagpi.com.\nIssue 7 Printed Copy", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCHALLENGES\n\nThere are many potential challenges and we have tried to mitigate most of them. However our collective experience in industry, project management and numerous professional fields plus a global perspective will enable us to tackle any unexpected challenge.\n\nPrinting: We have already chosen a printer who can print the magazines and binders to our budget and required quantities. They have provided us with test copies and we are very pleased with the quality. When the magazines are printed we will be examining random samples frequently to ensure the high quality of the test copy is maintained.\n\nDistribution: Our partners that will be packaging and shipping all the rewards have extensive experience in global logistics and have been able to secure such a good rate that UK shipping is free for all rewards. We originally wanted to offer the rewards for Christmas delivery but instead elected to ship in January 2013. This gives us and our partners time to prepare appropriately for the quantity of pledges received and we can also mitigate any delays due to the holiday season.\n\nRISKS\n\nBeing a magazine which already exists in a virtual form, our risks are low in terms of creative content. Issue 8, the last issue in Volume 1 is in an advanced state of completion and is expected to be available online on 1 December at http://www.themagpi.com. We have mitigated risks by getting print samples and by using partners experienced in volume, global distribution.\n\nOur single biggest risk is that we do not receive the minimum quantity of 250 pledges for the MagPi Bumper Pack. This could happen because we have no advertising budget so bringing awareness of the project will be done using social media, appropriate forums and websites and word-of-mouth. But this can take time and the Kickstarter project will only run for around 4 weeks.\n\nHowever we are confident that we can easily hit this target based on the readership levels of the online magazine, and the large online and offline communities that surround the Raspberry Pi and our close relationship with, and involvement in, those communities.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Volume 3 Kickstarter", "update_content": "Dear backers,\nThanks for your support on the original MagPi Kickstarter.
