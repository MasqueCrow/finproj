[{"backer": "Brain Vessel Creative", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Many thanks to all 3800+ backers for making this project successful!  Delivery of Wave 1 is coming in August 2020 and Wave 2 is scheduled for November 2020!  We are so thankful!  For any issues please email to support@maydaygames.com!\nDid you miss the project?  You can late pledge for a few days after the campaign is over HERE.  Once our late-pledge option closes you can still order from us directly HERE.\nIf you are a backer and haven't filled out your survey, the survey retrieval link is HERE. Note this link will only work starting 2 weeks after the campaign closes and while the survey is open.  \nNot sure about Crokinole?  Watch Shup Up & Sit Down's review of the game!  (Note their review is of a different board, we have tried to get them one of ours but no luck yet!).  \n Introduction\nMayday is the authority on Crokinole in the U.S. In fact this will be our 7th Crokinole version since we started making Crokinole boards over 8 years ago. We have sold thousands of boards across the world! We are the only company in the USA offering Crokinole boards at affordable prices. The production runs of these boards are crazy and who knows what tariffs charges and COVID-19 issues will do to future production runs. Shipping costs are very expensive this year so we are limiting the delivery of this game to just a few countries.\nNot sure how to play?  Take 5 minutes and watch this video.  This is one of the easiest games to learn and great for people just getting into board games.\n You can check out our last three Crokinole board offerings from 2019 (HERE), 2018 (HERE ), 2016 (HERE), and 2013 (HERE) on Kickstarter. So why are we back again? In a word: Quality. How good is it? Listen to the last 90 seconds of this review OF 2016 THE ACTUAL FINISHED PRODUCT from our 2016 offering!\nWhy is this review relevant? Because after using several different factories, we found one that produces our product up to our strictest specifications. While every printing has gone well, most have not been good enough to merit going back, we always thought we could improve. Finally, the factory really came through for us in 2016 and 2019 and we are using them again! We are the ONLY quality choice for Crokinole boards in the U.S.\n\"I love my Mayday board. It\u2019s my first. Got it on kickstarter. It\u2019s still in great shape and I love introducing new people to the game. It\u2019s often asked for on game night. I keep it in the travel case I bought for it under my guest room bed to keep it safe and flat. I\u2019m also grateful to Mayday for letting me into this game at a price point I could handle. \" - Mark Halsey, Toledo Ohio (BGG User Quoted HERE)\nWhy Back Now?\n Best Pricing!  If you haven't heard, the US dollar is super strong. (OK, I'm a finance geek who likes board games.) Our Crokinole boards have retailed for under $200 for years and due to the strong US dollar we are able to maintain our low price for another round. Who knows where things will go in the future?! For now, we can guarantee that regardless of the markets, the price will not increase for you backers! \nWhy so cheap? We bring them in by the shipping container.\n Very Limited Quantity! We had just 1,250 boards available and we just can't promise when we will make another batch. It may be another 6 months or 3 years and the price may certainly go up! These will NOT be available in stores!  We can fit 850 in a container so that is all we can commit to, plus the ones we are shipping internationally.  Note: On Day 3 of this campaign we opened up WAVE 2 and put in a larger order with the factory so you can still get in on this project!\n Direct delivery to your door! Yes, direct shipping to many countries that previously could only dream of Crokinole! Yes shipping will be expensive, but for the first time ever, almost anyone can back!\n Exclusive features! With four pads on the bottom of the board, recessed screws to protect your table and inset eyelets for easy hanging, plus a scoring track built right into the disc storage box, this is one well thought-out board! Your board will be 30.25 inches in diameter by 3\" thick and comes in a double-boxed box that is 34.5 X 34.5 X 4 Inches and weighs in at 17.4 pounds! Yes this is a very solid board!\n New Innovations!  We are bringing back our hinge-less scoring box with scoring track printed right on the board, first introduced in late 2019! This means you can store your discs right in the scoring box that is newly designed with the players in mind, no more worrying about weak or broken hinges, and scoring is easier than ever!\n Huge Savings! Most high-quality boards will set you back $300 or more, but our goal is to offer a high-quality board to you at 1/3 the price! This board will retail for $180 or more but you are getting it for just $99! Go search for a high-quality board, they can cost $300 or more! You are getting some amazing features in a very well thought out board at a fraction of the cost! This may well be the last time we offer a crokinole board for this price.\n Acrylic 20s Holder X 2 included! Yes, for the FIRST TIME EVER we are including these brilliant acrylic 20s holders that you can put right on the edge of your board to keep track of your 20 point shots!  These retail for $20 per set of two but you are getting them FREE in your shipment!\nNote these acrylic 20-holders are great for any tournament sized crokinole board including other brands.  They latch right onto the board and are a great addition to any game!\n\n\n\" I have to say they did a wonderful thing creating a decent board for under 100 bucks. ...I have enjoyed my Mayday board since 2012. I thought I'd have a \"real\" board by now, but it's hard to justify the cost when my Mayday board is so much fun. \" - Greg Clensy, Glenbrook Nevada (BGG User Quoted HERE)\n High Quality! We have searched high and low and finally found the right factory for the job! Anywhere else just doesn't support the quality we expect in our products.\nWhat is Crokinole?\nThis game is like shuffleboard in the round. If you are into board games perhaps you've heard of this elusive game, it is ranked #68 out of more than 60,000 ranked board games on BoardGameGeek and #5 in Family Games! Yes it is that good. We won't bore you with the endless reviews, just check them out for yourself at BoardGameGeek, this is one game that lives up to the hype! How to Play and Review of our very first board by Tom Vasel:\n Download the rules HERE .\n\"Well, if one isn't sure that a Crokinole board is part of one's future, it does make sense to spend a bit less, just to test the waters. And that's what I did by getting the 2018 version of the Mayday board. It's about $150 worth of quality for a $99 board. As someone who's not sure if this will be a \"lifelong\" game, then paying $99 for a $150 board just to \"test the waters\" is one hell of a deal. \" Barry Miller, St Charles, MO, USA (BGG User Quoted HERE)\nWhy Our Board?\nSure you can buy a $200-$300 board out there, but maybe your significant other would kill you. Don't buy a board just to have to buy a casket that costs even more. Save yourself all that trouble and get a practical board.\n\"High-quality boards at 1/3 the price!\"\nAfter more than three years of searching we finally found a factory we can trust to deliver the best generation of Crokinole boards yet, and at an unbelievable cost! Our 2020 edition promises to be our best ever! Bower's Game Corner did an unboxing video of our 2016 board, check it out at the top of this KS page.\nTechnical Specifications:\nFull specs HERE.\nBoards:\nThe boards consist of a 26\" diameter playing surface + 2 inch ditch + 1/4 inch rim = 30.50 inches in total diameter and 3 inches thick. The game will come double boxed in a box with dimensions of 34.5 X 34.5 X 4.5 Inches and weights in at a massive 17.4 pounds (7.9 KG). Yes these are HUGE! Our boards meet the The World Crokinole Championship\u2122 specifications which are:\n26\" diameter playing surface (66cm)\ndistance from 'dead' center of the '20' hole to the pin/post circle is 4\" (102mm)\ndistance from pin/post circle to 10/5 circle is 4\" (102mm)\ndistance from 10/5 circle to 5/start circle is 4\" (102mm)\ndistance from 5/start circle to the edge of the playing surface is 1\" (25.5mm)\nThese equidistant factors contribute to the 'science,' design, and original intent of the game. \"20\" hole diameter is generally 1-3/8\" (35mm) with a depth of \u00bc\" (6mm) width of dividing circle lines is recommended as 1/16\" (1.5mm) but no more than1/8\" (3mm) width of ditch/gutter (from side rail/rim to edge of playing surface) is a minimum 2\" (51mm).   This standard is neither new nor something defined solely for the WCC event. Rather, this is the paradigm viewed from dimensions established more than 120 years ago.\nOur boards are made of MDF base with a real hardwood veneer on the top.  Yes it is real hardwood and not some cheap synthetic veneer (sticker).   Note we did have a problem with our 2011 boards coming as a synthetic veneer when they were advertised as hardwood veneer, but that was many generations back and this will be our 4th and 5th production run with this factory, so you can buy with confidence!\nNot sold on MDF?  Have a look at a $300 Tracey's board HERE.  Looks amazing right?  Zoom in and look at the board, it is also MDF.  There is nothing wrong with MDF and plenty of  \"high end\" boards are also made of MDF.  No one makes boards out of solid hardwood, it is all either MDF or plywood.\nTracey Board -Extreme Close Up! Yep, $300 Boards are also made with MDF.\nDiscs:\nInternational standard disc size has been set at 32mm diameter x 10mm thick \u00b1 .5 mm. There is no standard on discs being flat or convex/concave.  Our discs will all be flat/standard version.  In fact, the 3-time Crokinole World Champion said this about discs:\n\"...The bottom line is that the WCC Committee has never set a standard for flat vs C/C discs. We just get the best quality we can and no one up til now has requested one or the other. Personally, I've won the WCC adult singles 3 times and it's not something I ever concern myself with, i.e. whether I'm shooting with flat, convex or concave side down. I just make sure the disc is smooth in surface, especially for open 20 shots.\" -Brian Cook as quoted HERE. \nNote:  Per the main video (at 0:28 seconds) convex/concave discs are mentioned.  International standard disc size has been set at 32mm diameter x 10mm thick \u00b1 .5 mm. There is no standard on discs being flat or convex/concave.  Our discs will all be flat/standard version.  We are sorry for the confusion but we cannot edit the video once it is up without cancelling the whole project.  See more information in the technical specifications below.  These are exactly the same as our last 3 production runs from 2018 and 2019.\nMore Reviews\n\"I am happy with it. My kids bring friends over to play. They are less than nice to our board. It is now my beater to have kicking around or camping. ...Thanks Mayday for introducing me and my family to an awesome game. \" -BGG User DB (quoted HERE)\n\"I'm a crokinole addict and have a great board, but that Mayday plays fine to me, for a general audience. Have a lot of fun with it, and if in the future you want to enjoy the hobby more you can savor shopping around for a great board.  The Mayday board.... does the job fine. \" -Jay M, Greenville SC (BGG User Quoted HERE)\n\"Mine arrived this morning (USA East) and overall is in excellent condition. Outer ring is secure, board is nice and flat, surface is nice and smooth, and all but one peg fits snugly. \" -Remo Williams, Vermont, USA (BGG User Quoted HERE)\n\"I love love love my Mayday board and I play it at least once a week since I bought it nearly a year ago. Shuffle board wax is like a fine sand. It\u2019s fast and awesome. Enjoy!!\"  -Mark Hasley, Toledo, OH, USA (BGG User Quoted HERE)\n\"My Mayday board is currently permanently set up at work and gets at least 10 games a day, it's a huge hit in the office. Planning to get a Willard Pro when I can afford it to replace the Mayday. Edit: we've figured out we've played over 5000 games of this at work, and I've personally played over 2000 games. The game also has incredible depth, and that depth reveals itself as you get better at it. \"  -Beefstack, Canberra, Australia (Quoted HERE)\n \"I am completely pleased with my Mayday board from the Summer 2019 Kickstarter.  That does not mean it is perfect but it is well worth the money I paid and the enjoyment I get from it.  My board is at my office where we have either one on one or team games every day at lunch, and occasionally after work is done.  I then put it in the very nice carrying bag I bought from Mayday to bring it home for games over the weekend.  It gets used CONSTANTLY and everybody enjoys it.\"  -Kenneth Harkin (see review in comments HERE)\n\"This is a very beautiful board from MayDay Games.I don't get to play it much due to it is considered a \"fun or filler game\" now by most of my group. With it being such a table hog and a whole process of getting it out and putting it away.\" -Greenosaur, BGG HERE\n\"Just got my Mayday board in and love it!\" February 2020, -MrMatthew, BGG HERE\nFor a great candid discussion of these boards from this factory check this BGG thread with lots of actual customers HERE.\nAdd-Ons\nAll add-ons will be handled post-campaign, don't add anything to your pledges for now, but know that we will be offering several amazing add-ons including our very-popular carrying cases and discs in 9 colors.\nThese retail for $50 each, we will offer them as an add-on post-campaign. Many colors will be available to USA/Canadian backers only.\n14 disc packs retail for $7.95, we will offer them to backers post-campaign in various colors. Note the game comes with 14 discs each of Black and Natural already. Many colors will be available for USA/Canadian backers only!\nShipping & Fulfillment:\nThe board will come double boxed in a 34.5 X 34.5 X 4 inch box weighing 17 pounds. There is now a $12 surcharge on all packages of this size due to Fedex/UPS dimensional pricing that has recently been being charged w/in the lower 48 USA states so shipping is just $28 + the $12 surcharge = $40. We are subsidizing the actual shipping cost for this campaign.\nSorry, these boards are TOO BIG for USPS to accept so we cannot ship to APO/AE at all. We can only ship UPS in fact so if you live outside the \"lower 48\" then we cannot ship you a board unless you are willing to pay the EXTRA shipping over the $40 we are charging.  We can ship to you in Hawaii sure, but you will probably need to pay around $75 shipping, or whatever UPS quotes us.  Buyers in Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands and elsewhere not LOWER 48, you have been warned!\nFor Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada and the EU (including the UK), we are finally offering to ship from within your own region for duty-free delivery right to your door. Note the shipping for any of these regions is $60 and will also be collected post-campaign during our Crowdox survey. (New Zealand will have an extra $10 surcharge for a total of $70.) Note, anyone from these regions (except Canada) will NOT be able to add on additional accessories post-campaign as the logistics of adding on carrying cases and more is just too complicated at this point.  \nAll other countries, if you really want a board then you need to find a freight forwarding service to ship it from a USA address to you in your country.  You will pay the usual $40 to ship it to any address in the USA and you will have to pick up the costs from there to your home.  There are many such services such as ShipItTo.com or Viabox or others HERE.\nFor just acrylic 20s holder backers, you are getting 2 of the holders and shipping is $4 w/in the USA or China/HK and $8 worldwide.  You will pay for shipping during the post-campaign survey on CrowdOx.\nMore Resources:\nAnd here are some more photos of the actual boards, note they are the 2019 boards so don't feature the acrylic 20s holders or the printed on disc boxes: \nCheck Kicktraq for our project progress!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project doesn't have any risks to speak of if we meet our goal.

You are racing down the streets, desperate to escape into the safety of the countryside. If your cart is the first out of town you and your cart-mates win! Or do you? Some villagers on your cart may secretly already have the plague. If you leave town with a plagued villager on your cart, you will catch the plague and lose! What will you do to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen? And who will you trust (or betray) along the way? \nBristol 1350 is a social deduction and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes.\n Thank you to all of our backers for an incredible campaign!\nIf you missed the campaign you can make a late pledge here until fall 2020.\nBackers can view project updates for information about delivery and add-ons.\nPlease visit our website or Facebook for the latest information on Bristol 1350.\nWe are excited to offer a Deluxe edition of the game! Depending on later demand, this Deluxe edition may be exclusive to Kickstarter, and at most it will be in rare distribution or only available at conventions. Beyond the core Standard edition of the game (+9 extra Kickstarter characters + stretch goals) the Deluxe edition includes: \nThe 6 Deluxe coins to scale.\nEvery Kickstarter backer of Bristol 1350 (Standard or Deluxe) will receive 9 extra character cards in a special foil pack to add to their core copy of the game (for 18 total characters!) These characters will not be available after Kickstarter and are our way of saying thank you. We will reveal a new character every few days in the section below!    \n\n\nWe have upgraded every single component in the game with the space available in the box. Each upgrade represents our dedication to making high-quality and high-performing games at an affordable price. While we hope to include most of the upgrades listed above in future editions, they are only guaranteed for this first Kickstarter Standard and Deluxe printing of the game.   \nThe level of textural detail on the book, front and back, is kind of mouthwatering.\nBristol 1350 is a social deduction (lying & backstabbing) and light strategy game for 1-9 players. Learn in 10 minutes and play in 20-40 minutes. The game is enjoyable at all player counts, with lower counts leaning towards strategy and higher counts leaning towards social deduction, lying, and trust.\nIn the game each player begins in one of the three carts behind the starting line. Your goal is to be on the first cart to escape from the town. However, if anyone on your cart has the plague when you finish, everyone on that cart dies of the plague! Play continues until an all-healthy cart crosses or until everyone has the plague.   \nYou can view the full rules and print and play at this link. Note that the rulebook design is still underway, and if you want to play the print and play you'll need to construct your own dice and carts.\nYou can play for free online with Tabletop Simulator or with Tabletopia. \nAs they become available, translations of the rulebook will be available on our website. We currently have translations available in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Greek. \nSome of the intriguing mechanics are discussed by The Board Game Critic in this video. \nA full playthrough of a 5-player game can be seen at this link. \nA full playthrough of a 1-player game can be seen at this link. \nBristol 1350 is Volume 4 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. Each game accommodates at least 2-9 players. \nGames in the Dark Cities Series have already sold over 150,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 5, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! Each of these games is available in certain reward levels and as add-ons.\nYou can add an unlimited number of copies of any games in the Dark Cities Series to your pledge! Just add the amounts listed above and after the campaign you'll select which extra games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section, post a comment, or shoot us a message. \nYour shipping cost does not increase for add-ons regardless of your location or the amount of extra games you order. You will receive all add-on games at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery April 2021).  \nThe 18 original character paintings by Sarah Keele are available to purchase! The paintings are 8 x 10 inches and made with mixed media acrylic on masonite board. You can see some of the intricate details below. Email sarahmkeele@gmail.com for more details or to check availability of a specific character.    \nThough this is not an add-on you can get through the campaign, the people at Next Level Board Gaming are selling 3D-printer files so that you can create an EPIC 3D version of the Bristol 1350 board that you can use with your copy of the game. You can see more details by clicking the picture below.\nRegardless of order size or add-ons, shipping costs are $6 USA, $8 UK/EU, $10 Australia/Canada, $12 for the rest of the world. We work hard to find the best shipping rates out there, and we subsidize some of the shipping costs so that you don't have to pay as much. \nTo avoid extra VAT or customs fees, games will ship to depots around the world (USA, UK, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong) before being shipped to you. For non-depot countries, in most cases there will not be extra VAT costs because the price of our games is low enough to avoid the duties threshold.\nIf your order is lost or returned due to unforeseen circumstances, we will attempt to reship your game one time, free of charge. If you provided incorrect shipping information, you will be responsible for the reshipment fee. Due to unreliable mail systems, we will not perform reshipments destined for Brazil, Ukraine, Russia, or South Africa. \nThese days there are many projects that wait to charge shipping until AFTER the campaign ends in order to shift the risk from the creators to the backers. We have \"done our homework\" in regards to shipping costs and are prepared to take on unexpected risk. What you pay now for shipping is ALL that you will pay for this reward.\nDISCOUNTED PRICE | Normal MSRP of the Standard Edition will be $25. If we release the Deluxe Edition to the public it will be at least $45. We also offer the best shipping prices we can during the Kickstarter campaign.\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE CARDS | The 9 Kickstarter Exclusive character cards (for a total of 18 characters in your game) will never be available again and will be unavailable to the public. Additionally, campaign stretch goals, as well as the Deluxe version, are only guaranteed through Kickstarter.\nEARLY ACCESS | Receive and play the game before anyone else in the world. \nJOIN OUR TEAM | Get first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We will take your feedback into account before launching production.\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem, back in 2015. Those backers are the ones that allowed us to quit our day jobs and make games full time. We've had more great experiences with the launch of Tortuga 1667 and Deadwood 1876. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community is incredible. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.\nOur thoughts are with those around the world suffering from Covid-19. We have been planning and preparing for this launch for over two years, but it has coincidentally lined up with the pandemic that our world now faces. We considered delaying the project but after a lot of thought and encouragement from our community we ultimately decided to launch. As with all our games, part of this game's purpose is to educate about the history of the world. Bristol 1350 explores the history of the worst pandemic our world has ever faced: the Black Death. The people of 1350 faced huge challenges, and today those challenges are perhaps more relatable than ever. We will be donating $3,000 from our own pockets to Action Against Hunger to assist in getting food and medicine for those most in need. (Per Kickstarter regulations, funds raised within Kickstarter will not be directly donated and have no effect on the donation amount).\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th project, and our first 3 have been delivered on time and as promised. Our factory is at full capacity and our shipping partners are optimistic that by next year when this is delivered there will be no insurmountable issues in regards to Covid-19. However, these are unique times and we will keep our backers updated on any unforeseen issues that may arise. As you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced by our manufacturers and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go! \n\nSalem 1692: \"I have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier.\" -Snuffles00\n\nTortuga 1667: \"I backed this and another project that ended a day prior. The way things have gone with the other project have given me an even greater appreciation for not only the great game you made, but the well executed Kickstarter. Thank you again!\" -Bored Gamer\n\nDeadwood 1876: \"Thank you again for such a wonderful campaign and game! All your games are creative, refreshing, and each have unique mechanics that keep the fun going for hours. The historical component too makes for an added boon. Thank you also for a unique genuineness you bring to your customer experience. It is a prize how you answer each customer individually and how you care about the quality of your interactions as much as you care about the quality of your product and gameplay. I\u2019m excited for the fourth city and experience!\" -Steph Troyer\n\nAfter the campaign we will use a pledge manager system called CrowdOx to send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account.

It is designed for 2-6 players and can be played by both young and old. Players score points by creating stacks of 5 or more chips by either moving chips on the board or rolling the dice to place new chips. 5 Stack is a relatively fast-paced game and rounds can be as fast as 3-4 minutes for the speed demons and 20 or more minutes for those that like to chat and \"cut up\" while playing board games.\n5 Stack is a captivatingly simple to play board game. When we developed the concept for 5 Stack, I wanted to create a board game that was simple enough for our daughters to play and understand but also interesting enough that I could invite adult board game veterans over and still have a blast. 5 Stack achieves both perfectly.\nAt 5 Stack's core, lies a straightforward but interesting game mechanic that contains the perfect balance of strategy and chance. The strategy element creates a meaningful game-play for those that like to dive deep into a game and try to outsmart their opponents. There is also enough chance to make the game exciting and surprising, allowing for some unexpected twists and turns. This combination means winning can be up for grabs for even the \"I never play board games\" person.\nWhether you are young or old, new to board games or a seasoned vet, you will have a blast playing 5 Stack.\n5 Stack LITE Edition $25\n1 5 Stack Board\n1 Set of Instructions\n2 Easy to read dice\n4 Sets of 25 colored wooden chips\n4 Cloth Chip Bags\n5 Stack STANDARD Edition $35\n1 5 Stack Board  \n1 Set of Instructions  \n2 Easy to read dice  \n6 Sets of 25 colored wooden chips  \n6 Cloth Chip Bags\n5 Stack DELUX Edition $45\n1 5 Stack Board  \n1 Set of Instructions  \n2 Easy to read dice  \n6 Sets of 25 colored wooden chips  \n6 Cloth Chip Bags\nKickstarter Exclusive Limited Edition 5 Stack Playing Card Deck\n5 Stack GOLD Edition $75\n1 5 Stack Board  \n1 Set of Instructions  \n2 Easy to read dice  \n6 Sets of 25 colored wooden chips  \n6 Cloth Chip Bags  \nKickstarter Exclusive Limited Edition 5 Stack Playing Card Deck\n6 Gold Collectors Chips for gameplay\nIf you like to add additional items to your pledge simply add the appropriate amount (see below) to your existing pledge, for the item(s) you would like to add. If you have any questions please feel free to message us. You must be pledging for an existing tier to add on additional items.\n*Plus Shipping\nCalculating shipping is hard to during a project as we do not have your specific shipping info until the project has been successfully funded and ended. Additional shipping for any add-ons will be calculated after the project has been funded using a post Kickstarter pledge management system called Backerkit. At that time any additional shipping will be calculated based on your specific shipping address. It is hard to create a \"one size fits all\" shipping cost that fits everyone appropriately.

Six Foot Five has created numerous Kickstarter videos for me in the past and does a stellar job every time!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any Kickstarter project, there are always risks and challenges, especially because the final product has not been produced yet. This will be my 25th Kickstarter project, and I will do my best to be completely transparent about any aspect of the project. I have done my very best to represent the final product as accurately as possible but there is always a chance that the final product might vary slightly or substantially based on unforeseen production issues. While we do not foresee this happening, it is important to know this going into this project.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14-day close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nWe will be using a post Kickstarter pledge management service called Backerkit. If you do not log in to Backerkit and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8-week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics and lead to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

The number one request, by far, was Fireball Island. After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter.

You\u2019re staying at one of the three major establishments in Deadwood where you and your associates are working together to steal some of the gold-filled safes floating around town. But you suspect that the \u201cfriends\u201d you\u2019re working with are secretly plotting to keep all the gold for themselves. Will you be ready to turn on them before they shoot you in the back?\nDeadwood 1876 is a social deduction game where you'll work with teammates to find and collect gold. But in the end, the team with the most gold will have to fight each other to the death to determine the winner! Will you spend your turns helping your team find gold, or preparing to defeat your own teammates in the Final Showdown?\n2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes. Ages 13+.\n1 Magnetic book box\n1 Faux leather pouch\n1 Rulebook (includes character biographies and Deadwood history)\n3 Wood carved platforms\n9 Wood star pawns\n10 Wood engraved dice\n79 cards (9 Characters, 20 Safes, 50 Deadwood)\nThe game comes in a magnetically-closing faux book. Extra room is provided in the center section should you desire to sleeve the cards.\nThe wood establishment platforms conjure the look of an old western storefront. Since each platform is stained and laser cut, the wood grain and color will be slightly unique in each copy of the game. The platforms are laser cut in the negative space, so each letter and design comes outwards.\nThe ten wooden dice each use custom designs instead of standard dots. Each colored dice corresponds to a gun in the game and has different values depending on the gun. Each die is colored and engraved.\n Nine wooden stars act as the pawns in the game.\n The dice and stars come in a faux leather bag.\nThe 9 characters are based on people who actually lived in or visited Deadwood in 1876. Character biographies are included in the rule book. Each character card is colored on the front, and black and white on the back.\nThe 20 Safe cards are designed to look like genuine safes from the 1870's.\nEach of the 50 Deadwood cards contains a gun on top and a special item on the bottom.\nIn Deadwood 1876 you\u2019ll use cards from your hand to try to win Safes from other players. Safes contain Badges, Gold, or Showdown Guns. Near the end of the game, players with Badges get extra turns. After the final turn, the team with the most Gold will advance to the Final Showdown. There, teammates will have to fight each other to the death using Showdown Guns. The last person alive is the winner!\nNote: The video above gives a brief overview of rules. Strategy tips, rule clarifications, advanced optional rules, card descriptions, and character biographies are all included in the game rule book. We currently have rules available to view in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch on our website. You can also view the contents of this page in Chinese.\nValuable items are hidden behind each Safe. You won't know which Safes have been shuffled in, so every round will play out differently.\nEach player always has 4 Deadwood cards in their hand. You'll get to play one card from your hand each turn, and then it will be replaced from the deck.\nEach card can either be used as the gun listed on top, or the special item listed on the bottom. The Holster lets you help out teammates, the Stetson lets you view hidden Safes, the Horse lets you abandon your team for a different one, and the Duster lets you improve your hand of cards.\nThe more powerful guns, such as the Messenger, have higher values on its dice, whereas worse guns, such as the Pepperbox, have lower values and zeros on its dice.  For shootouts you'll need to manage your hand and decide when to use a powerful gun and when to gamble with your weaker guns.\nEach player takes on the identity of one of nine people who actually roamed the streets of Deadwood.\nA game in progress.\nThis game requires teamwork, but also actively punishes you if you play too nice. That balance makes every round insane. - Sam J.\nMix strategy with the best and the worst of the Wild West, and you get Deadwood. - Charlotte C.\nThe strategy never gets old and I consistently find myself playing with new options every single game. -Spencer H.\nBackstabbing has never been so much fun. This game keeps you on your toes. It is not one you can play half-heartedly. -Abigail S.\nThe more I play Deadwood, the less likely I am to trust other players. When I trust them too much, they take my gold and shoot me with a gun they stole from me. I always regret it. -Patti S.\nIntrigues of Deadwood 1876 video from Beasts of War.\nA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.\nMechanics\nDeadwood is a balance between teamwork and selfishness. If a player uses all of their best Deadwood cards and Badges to hunt down Gold for their team, they\u2019ll be defenseless to fight against their teammates in the Final Showdown. But if a player only goes after Showdown Guns and saves all of their best cards, their team might not have enough Gold to actually reach the Final Showdown. If someone on your team doesn\u2019t seem to be pulling their weight, they\u2019re probably plotting to use your Gold to reach the Final Showdown and then destroy you! There may come a point when you need to attack, mislead, frame, abandon, or banish your own teammates.\nTheme\nWhen we were searching for the city for the 3rd Volume in the Dark Cities Series, we fell in love with Deadwood almost immediately upon learning about it. Large deposits of gold were discovered in the Black Hills of South Dakota in late 1875. Word quickly spread about the gold and the town of Deadwood was born almost overnight in early 1876. It soon reached a population of 5,000 miners, gamblers, prostitutes, outlaws, and businessmen. Lawlessness was prevalent as people flocked to the town to find (or steal) their share of the gold. Deadwood quickly became an infamous western town where old west legends lived and died.\nThe book has a raised UV effect so that all designs and logos pop out from the cover and spine.\nDesign\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players into the world of the wild wild west! We used wood and leather textures with our components, old west Victorian charm with our book and character cards, and cards that look like antiqued metal Safes built by the \"Facade Safe & Lock Co\" similar to Safes from the time period. The goal of our design is to take you and your friends deep into the raucous, chaotic, exciting world of Deadwood, South Dakota in its prime. You can view time-lapse videos of Sarah illustrating Molly Johnson, Solomon Star, Seth Bullock, Kitty Leroy, and the Holster.\nWe've already made many \"premium\" choices for the game (wooden platforms instead of cardboard, faux leather bag instead of plastic, wooden star tokens instead of standard pawns, faux book instead of standard box, etc.), because we believe in publishing awesome games regardless of funding amounts. But if we reach the following milestones, we'll be able to make Deadwood 1876 even better!\nNote: Some of these upgrades will be exclusive to the 1st Edition of Deadwood 1876. Backing on Kickstarter is the only way to guarantee that all upgrades listed above will be included in your copy of the game.\nWe've been working hard on logistics all year and for this campaign we're very pleased to offer free US shipping at all reward levels, and low international shipping rates. We are also using fulfillment companies around the world so that you won't be charged extra customs fees. If you are mistakenly charged customs fees when the games arrive, just let us know and we'll pay you back. (For EU backers, we will be shipping games from Germany so you won't have extra customs fees)\nBecause of cheaper shipping, we\u2019re happy to be selling Deadwood 1876 at prices that are even cheaper than the early bird levels of our previous two Kickstarter projects!\nDeadwood 1876 is Volume 3 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. \nVolume 1: Tortuga 1667 (Published 2017 thanks to Kickstarter!). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website. Tortuga was recently nominated as the best party game of 2017 by Board Game Geek!\nVolume 2: Salem 1692 (Published as \"Salem\" in 2015 thanks to Kickstarter!

Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website.\nBoth of our released games have sold over 20,000 copies and are now played around the world!

See Add-Ons section below for details.\nIf your pledge includes at least one copy of Deadwood 1876 then you can add an unlimited amount of Tortuga 1667, Salem 1692, or extra copies of Deadwood 1876 to your pledge! Just add the indicated amounts below to your pledge amount without changing your reward level.

Intaglio printing for playing card art has not been used for centuries. Why has this art style been lost? For this art and printing style to come to life, several factors must exist and come together at the same time. One factor is the skill of the artist. Intaglio engraving takes years of patience and practice to become proficient in. Another factor is that the equipment is not readily available. And lastly, finding someone with the equipment plus the ability to print them at a high archival quality is near impossible. One can see why attempting a project like is a monumental task.\nFor me as an artist, the Intaglio project is a realization of a long dream of mine to create a deck of cards by hand engraving the artwork. Over the years I have designed things by hand drawing or digitally mimicking engraving, but this project is the next step for me as an artist. The reason for me embarking on this project are two-fold. One reason is that I have a passion for this beautiful art style. The other reason is that as an artist I love the challenge that this offer me to try to accomplish a project such as this.\nAn inspiration for this deck is one of the first decks that made me originally fall in love with playing card design. Titled the \"New Era No. 46\" and name such to symbolize a new era of beautiful playing card design heading into the 20th century. I have long wanted to use the New Era court set as inspiration and create my own \"engraving\" style versions of them, and I felt this was the project to do it. The interesting thing about the New Era No 46 deck is that it was published around the same time that the actual printing presses that will be used for the Intaglio project were created. For me, this project, in a way, is a new era. I am finally getting to pursue the art style of engraving to its physical form.\nThank you for visiting my project, and thank you for helping it become a reality and becoming a backer.\n Pledge Tiers\n                                                            This project is a collaboration between Kings Wild Project and Thornwillow Press.\n Thornwillow's Story\nThe Kickstarter video was created by Six Foot Five Productions.\nImportant Notice: All Images are conceptual renderings and representations of what the intended final product is supposed to look like.

See 'Add-ons' below.\n Select 24K Gold Plated coins now available! See 'Add-ons' below.\nWhat are Hobo Coins?\nThroughout time, people have modified coins by hand-carving or engraving their own designs into existing coins. But this form of folk art really took off during the Great Depression. Those that were out of work or down on their luck took to modifying coins by engraving their own designs into them. They would use pocket knives or even filed down nails to carve beautiful designs that were as varied as the artists themselves. Often, these coins would portray skeletons or skulls, incorporating elements from the coins as part of their final works of art. They would almost always keep the lettering on the coins.\nThe Hobo Coins project brings back this largely forgotten piece of American history. These coins are being minted by the oldest continuously operated private mint in the U.S. and are SOLID. They each weigh about the same as 5 US. quarters, and are a little larger than the size of a US Dollar coins (these coins are 39 mm). Die-struck with over 100 tons of pressure in solid metal alloys and featuring antique finishes. Please note that Hobo Coins are not actual US currency or modified US currency coins, they are die-struck new coins at different sizes, weights, and (clearly), different art than actual US coins.\nHelp revive a piece of history you can carry!\nThe Designs\nEach coin was crafted and designed by me using some of the most iconic coins as their base:\nThe \u2018R.I.P.\u2019 - 1922 Peace Dollar\nArguably the most beautiful coin ever produced, the U.S. Peace Dollar was originally produced to commemorate the peace that followed World War One. My rendition features a skull portrait (keeping the radiant crown) on the front (obverse), and two skeletal hands breaking a rifle on the back (reverse). Interesting to note that the \u2018broken rifle\u2019 was abstracted into the Peace Symbol we know today. Rest in Peace! Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. Also, this coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original Peace Dollar.\nThe 'R.I.P. Dollar - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Bad Mojo\u2019 - 1936 Buffalo Nickel\nMy take on the classic Buffalo Nickel hobo coin (popular because it was a \u2018soft\u2019 coin to carve), features a skeleton Chief with a no-nonsense attitude on the front, and an intricately carved buffalo skeleton on the back. Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'flat' edge like the original Buffalo Nickel.\nThe 'Bad Mojo' - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Walking Reaper\u2019 - 1936 Walking Liberty Half Dollar\nScares the sh*t outta me\u2014and that\u2019s a good thing! Based on what is considered one the most beautiful coins of all time, the Walking Liberty Half Dollar. Front side (obverse) features a grim reaper you never want to meet, and the back of the coin shows a Poe-esque scene with a raven. Nevermore! Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original Walking Liberty Half Dollar.\nThe 'Walking Reaper' - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Old Hobo\u2019 - 1891 Morgan Dollar\nEven hobos like a drink! The front face (obverse) of the coin features a hobo skeleton enjoying a pint. The back side (reverse) shows a skeleton hobo chilling in a box car with his loyal dog companion. Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original Morgan Dollar.\nThe 'Old Hobo' - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Hobo Coin / Hobo Signs\u2019 Limited Edition Print\nTo compliment the coins, I\u2019ve designed this print which features a hobo walking through a shanty town along railroad tracks carrying a gunny sack, and is emblazoned with 'Liberty' at the top. Each print is 18\u201d x 24\u201d, signed, and numbered.\n'Liberty' - inspired by coin typography and hobo coin art, each 18\" x 24\" print will be signed and numbered.\nAdd-ons\nAdditional coins or posters can be added to any base pledge as needed.

A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you\u2019ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven\u2019t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they\u2019ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you\u2019ve seen your friends\u2019 loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.\nFor 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes.

The box has 3 magnets to keep it closed when you're moving it to and from game night.\n  The game fits nicely inside the faux book box. The box is big enough for cards to be sleeved, if desired.\n  The game board is a rubber playmat. The board rolls up like a map.\n  The 8 wooden treasure pieces come in a burlap bag.\n  Each of the 9 wooden pawns matches with 1 of the 9 pirates you can be in the game. Each pirate is based on a real pirate who roamed Tortuga and the Caribbean seas in the year 1667.\n     Each player has a secret loyalty: British, Dutch, or French. But be careful who you trust; someone claiming to share your loyalty may stab you in the back and steal your hard-earned treasure.\n  Use Event cards during the game to help your team get treasure, or to maroon members of the opposite team to the island of Tortuga.\n  Use Vote cards during the game to secretly impact Attacks against the Spanish, Mutinies against your Captain, and Brawls against your fellow pirates.\nREWARDS\nWe're not big into confusing reward levels or expensive add-ons. We want each of our backers to get the best reward we can offer: this beautiful game!

But I love this game. -Tessa\nTortuga is a game full of surprises! Each round brings with it new and intriguing events that ultimately make you the master of the sea or scum of Tortuga. It all depends on how proficient you are at finding your team and making that knowledge count. -Alex R.\nI have played this game basically every week for the last couple of months. I have loved it every single time and never been bored. It\u2019s a great game to play with friends and really makes you think. -Abigail S\nI love this game!!! No game is ever the same, and it's always exciting. You never know who is going to do what or if you are trusting the right person. Everyone I have introduced to this game has loved it too. -Alex W.\nTortuga is a great social deduction game and it looks great on your game shelf too! Love the game even though sometimes it makes me question my friends and family. -Brett A.\nA game where I can deceive and be called Captain is a very good game indeed.\" -Derek H.\nTortuga is unique in the fact that it allows the perfect amount of deception for those that enjoy tricking and deceiving others, but it also provides the opportunity to work off of pure logic and reason for the other players that do not particularly excel in manipulation. I have had the opportunity of playing this game numerous times with many different crowds, and every game is completely different because of the different strategies and techniques that people can utilize. -Levi H.\nPRESS\nDice Tower News: http://www.dicetowernews.com/facade-games-welcomes-you-to-tortuga-1667-on-kickstarter/35996\nGeek & Sundry: http://geekandsundry.com/tortuga-1667-kickstarter-brings-treacherous-pirates-to-tabletop-gaming/\nCwowd.com (French): http://www.cwowd.com/tortuga-cap-sur-bonne-esperance/\nBeasts of War: http://www.beastsofwar.com/tortuga-1667/command-ship-secure-treasure-tortuga-1667-ks/ \nViva Veltoro: http://www.vivaveltoro.com/2017/02/tortuga-1667-pirate-game.html\nTabletop Gaming: https://www.tabletopgaming.co.uk/board-games/news/tortuga-1667-is-a-gorgeous-social-deception-game-with-pirates \nDDO Players: http://ddoplayers.com/2017/01/22/tortuga-1667-a-pirate-game-on-kickstarter/\nClub Fantasci: http://www.clubfantasci.com/kickstarter-week-tortuga-1667/\nBoard Game Stories: http://boardgamestories.com/news/party/no-pirate-trusted-tortuga-1667/\nIf you have an article about Tortuga 1667 or this project, please message us so we can have it featured here.

If you'd like to look at the complete rules now please visit the links below: \nEnglish \nFrench\nGerman\nSpanish \nDutch\nItalian\nPortuguese\nHungarian\nTurkish\nPlay the game as 1 of these 9 actual pirates from history. Biographies of each pirate are in the back of the rulebook.\n  Each player has a secret loyalty card. This is your team. Part of the game is deciphering who is your teammate and who is your enemy.\n  The Tortuga playing board. Teams win if they have the most treasure in their team's treasure holds when the Spanish Armada card is revealed.\n  Players choose to perform one action on their turn. One potential action is to reveal one of five available Event cards.\n  Be careful about which Event cards you reveal! Some may maroon you or your teammates to Tortuga.\n  If you reveal one of the three treasure maps, you must give it to someone you trust. If you reveal the Spanish Armada, the game is over.\n  During the game, Captains can call for Attacks, First Mates can call for Mutinies, and the Governor of Tortuga can call for Brawls. When one of these votes is called for, use your Vote cards to secretly cast your vote!\n  Depending on the player count, you'll need to rely more heavily on certain skills to win the game. We love the flexibility and variability of Tortuga 1667 based on the player count!\nTORTUGA CREATION PROCESS\nA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.\n1. Mechanics\nTortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.\nSince nobody holds a \"hand\" of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.\nVote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.\nA game in progress.\n  2. Theme\nTortuga, a small island off of Haiti, was an important pirate settlement and hideout during the golden age of piracy. British, French, and Dutch pirates lived together on the island in a loose alliance and formed a pirate government known as \u201cThe Brethren of the Coast.\u201d Rich from its support of piracy and protected by the Brethren, Tortuga was full of taverns, gambling houses, and prostitutes.\nThe French and British governments, in an attempt to weaken the mighty Spanish, would often legalize piracy by giving pirates letters of marque. These gave pirates permission to unofficially plunder Spanish ships and towns. Many of the pirates on Tortuga chose the privateering life over full-blown piracy, which was illegal. Loyalty to country was fleeting, though, and pirates often walked the line between patriotism and rebellion.\nTortuga 1667 aims to capture the atmosphere of these loose alliances and shifting political loyalties.\nAll parts of the game were designed to bring the players into the canvas, wooden planks, and golden treasure world of the 1667 pirates!\n3. Design\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players deep into the world of privateers and pirate life. We used textures consistent to what pirates would see on an everyday basis: wooden planks and tables, canvas sails, and weather-torn maps.\nAll pieces of the game were carefully chosen for their color and aesthetic contributions to the theme. The burlap bag conjures images of a pirate's bag of possessions. Many of the cards use a canvas background like the sails on a ship. The playmat rolls out and looks just like an old treasure map. The faux book is worn and colored a piratey brown, dark maroon, and black.\nSome of Sarah's initial sketches and process for creating the beautiful illustrations in the game.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nBecause we've reached the following milestones, we will be adding 8 \"game-changer\" cards to every copy of the game! When setting up, players will add 3 of these game-changers into the Event deck. These cards have the potential to turn the tide in your team's favor! Cards will now also all be given a high-quality linen finish, 2 and 3-player setup rules will be added to the rulebook, a \"Captain's Helm\" illustration will be added to the blank Mutiny sections on the Vote cards, 2 \"double-vote\" Vote cards will be added to each copy of the game, a wooden explosion token will be added to each copy of the game, Brethren of the Coast cards will have player action lists on the back of them, the Treasure map will include a compass rose and map legend, and we're adding a Quick-Start/Certified First Edition card to every copy of the game!\n  WHY KICKSTARTER?\nIf we reach our goal, we will be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of the first edition of Tortuga 1667. We already have our manufacturers lined up and ready to go! As you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go!\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our last game, Salem. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community was incredible. We're proud to reward our Kickstarter backers with discounts on the game, first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors.\nTHE DARK CITIES SERIES\nTortuga 1667 is Volume 1 in Facade Games' Dark Cities Series! Each game in the series will:\nBe packaged in a faux book. \nFocus on a particular city and year. \nInclude a dark, mysterious, or deceptive element in its gameplay. \nAccommodate at least 4-9 players. \nWe know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with Dark Cities Volume 1: Tortuga 1667!\nPAST PROJECTS\nIn April 2015 we raised $103,000 on Kickstarter with our first game, Salem. This game takes players into the dark world of the Salem Witch Trials. Players must hunt down the witches before becoming one! The game has now sold over 10,000 copies and is played around the world. \n\nWe are extremely proud to have delivered Salem on time to our backers! Here's what one of our backers had to say: \n\nI have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier. -Snuffles00\n\nSalem's Kickstarter Page\nSalem's Store Page\nSalem's Amazon Page (check out the reviews!)\n\nWe've made Salem available as an \"Add-on\" reward for this Kickstarter campaign.

With the addition of these eight amazing new species we now carry more than 35 different animal skulls! You can see and purchase all of our previous collections here.\nMINIATURE SKULLS DIRECT FROM NATURE\nFire & Bone makes tiny, true-to-life, animal skull reproductions derived from high-resolution 3D scans of original specimens, carefully miniaturized in a digital process, then cast in metal using traditional techniques. Each skull can be worn or displayed on their optional wood collectors base.\nThis is our fourth Kickstarter collection and we\u2019re adding eight new species, including several of the animals that are most frequently requested by our backers. We\u2019re also introducing an amazing new way to collect and display our incredibly detailed skulls and we've got two great new non-skull (!) pendants.\nLike us, our incredible backers are passionate naturalists, miniature collectors, and animal lovers and we hope you get as big a kick at seeing and holding these tiny new skulls as we do.\nTHE NEW COLLECTION \nEIGHT NEW SPECIES!\nDEER ANTLER & COYOTE CLAW PENDANTS!\nThis collection contains some of the most frequently backer-requested animals and we\u2019re very excited to finally add them our collection: The White-Tailed Deer, with its awesome antlers, and the American Alligator, Wolverine, and Coyote, each with articulated jaws.\nAMERICAN ALLIGATOR with ARTICULATED JAW\nThe clever Raccoon, the stoic Musk Ox, the wily Goat, and the elegant Sacred Ibis round out the collection.\nDEER ANTLER & COYOTE CLAW PENDANTS!\nWe\u2019re expanding our product range with two new necklaces; a White-Tailed Deer ANTLER and a Coyote CLAW. Both were produced using the same high-resolution process as our skulls and they possess the same level of natural detail.\nNEW DESKTOP DISPLAY SKULLS!\nFor the first time ever, we\u2019re turning the WOLVERINE, the MERINO RAM, and the GRAY WOLF into larger 3D printed display skulls that will make an incredible addition to any home museum. They measure about THREE INCHES in length and are available in bleached bone WHITE or matte BLACK.\n3D SCANNING & MINIATURIZATION\nOur process begins by digitally scanning real animal skulls. We work with a company that uses a proprietary 3D scanning process to digitally capture animal skulls in very high detail. We are thrilled with the level of detail we get from this method, which isn't possible with consumer-level 3D scanners. \nWe scale the piece down to a size suitable for collection or jewelry. Because we do this digitally and not manually, we retain an unprecedented amount of detail from the original skull. \nTo make the final pieces, we reproduce the miniature model in wax with a professional level high-resolution 3D printer. With our wax model we make a master mold which allows us to cast the skulls in any metal using traditional lost-wax casting. We work with a family owned foundry in the U.S. with decades of experience producing large production runs of small delicate pieces.\nREWARDS\n***If you'd like to pledge for multiple reward tiers, simply add up the total amount to cover each reward that you would like (be sure to add the appropriate shipping amount if it is an international order). Then, pledge the total amount, select just one reward, and contact us to let us know which additional rewards you are pledging for. We\u2019ll keep track on our end and make sure you get everything you would like!***\nFIRE & BONE AND KICKSTARTER\nIn putting together this fourth collection, we recognized what an amazing community Kickstarter has been for us. We get to test demand for new skulls, and we have a great platform for communicating with fans. If this campaign is successful, we will be able to keep acquiring more hard-to-get skulls for our collection and building this project together with you.\nIf you missed our previous campaigns, those collections are now available on our site - www.fireandbone.com. We now have over 35 species, and we're excited to continue to add more!\nSkulls from previous campaigns available at www.fireandbone.com\n Even though we have made some great steps since we first launched \u2013 we now sell Fire & Bone through a couple world famous science museums, which is mind-blowingly cool \u2013 we are still primarily three guys who do this as a passion. Kickstarter lets us find people who share that passion.\nTESTIMONIALS\nHere are a few of the nice things people have said about our tiny animal skulls:\n\u2022 \"My bear skull with the cool articulated jaw just arrived!

As well as being refillable, each one of our Patent-Pending pens also contains two super strong Neodymium magnets. This means that they attract one another (or any metal surface), becoming the centre-piece of your desktop. Colouring is only the beginning!\n We noticed that when unused, most of our favourite colouring pens just added to our desk clutter. When finished, they become useless, resulting in a large amount of waste added to our garbage pile. \n So\u2026we set down at Typica and thought how we could do better. We ended up designing a beautiful and refillable set of pens that not only writes and colours beautifully, but also helps to reduce waste.\nBut we didn't stop there. By adding two super strong Neodymium magnets to each of our pens, we gave the pens a life of their own, making each set into an object in its own right, both useful and playful in countless ways, even beyond colouring, sketching, and writing.\nOver the past year we fine-tuned every aspect of the design. Quality, and Simplicity have been our top priorities. Right from the start, we aimed to make the best pens at the best price.\nMagnetips Are:\nRefillable: reusable pens with easy to replace quality fine-line refills.\nComfortable: wide ergonomic hex shape makes long hours of gripping easy on the hand. \nWater based : Water based ink is Healthier (and smells better too).\nAccurate: Metal encased fine-line quality 0.4 nib. \nMagnetic: life-long lasting rare-earth Neodymium magnets inside. \nSafe :Incorporated air-flow vents. These makes our pens safer and child-friendly. \nLong Lasting: Durable and strong Polypropylene body.\nThe principles behind the design of this set are innovative yet simple and reliable, allowing adults and children to enjoy writing and playing safely in countless new ways.\nWe would love MAGNETIPS to be the centre-piece of your desk. That\u2019s why we have designed two sets: \"Black Edition\" and \"Colour Edition\", both of which contain all of our 20 colour refills. \nBlack Edition\nColour Edition\nBlack Edition\nColour Edition\nThe sets are of equal quality and dimensions, so the pens from both will attract to one another. You can even play around and change caps between the two editions.\nWe have put a lot of thought into choosing our favourite tones, making sure they will all fit together beautifully and be worthy of our fine-line refills. We are quite proud of the result, and we are sure you will love them too.\nMAGNETIPS Colour Palette\nEach set of MAGNETIPS comes pre-loaded with a full set of 20 colour refills. Once these are finished, you don't have to throw your pens away, but simply reload them with a new refill set.\nQuality 0.4 Fine Line Fibre Tip\nUsed up your Gum-Pink in a week? No problem! You don\u2019t have to replace the entire set of pens or even the pen itself. Simply replace the refill in the pen that has run out.\nRefill replacement is a breeze. The parts open with a good snap. Just take out the empty refill, replace it with a new one, and snap it shut again. It's that simple!\nBesides keeping them in neat order on your desk, the strong magnets inside the pens open up endless possibilities for playfulness and creativity.\nHold Your Favourite Photos\nThe Strong Magnets Allow Drawing In New ways\nThey Will Strongly Attach To Most Metal Surfaces\nTake Them With You\nKeep then In/Out Of Your Pocket\nWhile playing with our creation, we soon discovered that adding metal balls opens up a whole new world of possibilities for structures and fun that will help de-stress even your roughest day at the office. It worked for us! This is why we decided to offer them along with our pens (check the Add-On menu below the rewards).\nTwist It\nStand It\nRoll It\nLove It\nThe balls will be made to our specifications. They are made of chrome-plated steel, and they will not rust or tarnish for a very long time. They are not magnetic on their own (which makes them much safer) but \u201cferromagnetic,\u201d which means they will strongly attract our pens and any other magnet.\nPrices shown in USD and EURO are approximate conversions from GBP. \nAll pledges are for either the \"Colour Edition\" or \"Black Edition\"or both- Once the project ends, we will send you a \"Backer Survey\" to verify exactly what you pledged for.\n          If you pledged over \u00a31 you can add any combination of Add-Ons to your pledge. Simply add the price of the Add-Ons you want to your final pledge amount. After the campaign ends, we will contact each backer to verify the items pledged for.\n                                    Let\u2019s take a closer look at the details of our pens:\nThe structure is divided into three main parts: pen barrel (body), barrel cap, and lid. The magnets are mechanically locked inside, so cannot come out accidentally.\nWe kept the number of parts to a minimum. Simple and reliable.\nGeneral Dimensions\nIn each pen, we will be using two super strong axially magnetised rare-Earth magnets.\nNeodymium magnets are the strongest and most permanent magnets known. Typically they will only lose less than 1% of their strength over 10 years: not enough for you to notice unless you have very sensitive measuring equipment. They won't even lose their strength if they are held in repelling or attracting positions with other magnets over long periods of time.\nThe magnet in the pen lid and the magnet in the pen body are fixed in opposite polarities. This ensures the lid will always be attracted to the pen body. .\nIn the GIF above we have played around with a magnetic field detecting sheet (yes, they exist!). It clearly shows the strong magnetic field when placed over the pens.\nEverything is almost ready, but we do need your help to make Magnetips available for everyone. We can only afford to offer our pens at low prices by placing a large initial production order. By making a pledge to our project, you will enable us to order the best tools and commit to the manufacturers minimum order quantities, for both the pens and the refills. We would love to be able to do this ourselves, but the upfront costs are unrealistic for our small team. Every little bit will go toward making this product a reality, something that everyone can enjoy.\nThank you for your support!\n                                                                            Interested in featuring our story? in this LINK you will find everything you need, including a press release and High Res. images.

Each \u201cmarble machine\u201d kit is an engaging lesson that is told through the eyes of a cast of characters (the \u201cTinkineers\u201d) in graphic novella format. The principles introduced in the comic are then reinforced through the construction of the kit and, finally, brought full circle with real-world examples and applications. The Marbleocity kits present and reinforce STEM learning concepts and encourage problem solving.\nOur first kit is the Dragon Coaster inspired by the real wooden roller coaster of the same name, located at Playland in Rye, NY.\nThe Dragon Coaster\nA wooden roller coaster was an obvious choice for our premier module - everyone loves roller coasters and well, of course, our material (Baltic Birch plywood) suited this perfectly.  But there was another reason for this choice.  From a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) learning perspective the roller coaster is a classic classroom tool used to communicate lessons about conservation of energy (more on our STEM learning vision below).\nThe Dragon Coaster is a rewarding project designed to be performed alone or with a parent (depending on age and ability) in a series of bite-sized sit-downs.  We wanted our kits to be substantial yet palatable for a beginner to intermediate maker.  Our hope is that you and your child will look forward to carving out an hour each night, after dinner, to share some maker time together!  Each day's \"build\" ends at a logical point in construction.  You can set things aside and easily pick up later or power through if you're just having too much fun!\nThe Dragon Coaster is the first of nine interconnecting kits planned for the Marbleocity line. Each assembled kit (or \u201cmodule\u201d) is designed either to stand alone or to be combined with the other modules in order to grow your marble empire. A special feature we\u2019ve designed into each module allows you to choose to recirculate marbles or, instead, to pass them along to an adjacent module.\nMarbles either recirculate or are passed along to the next module ...\nBeyond the Dragon Coaster we\u2019ve already designed three additional modules - Skate Park, Maltese Cross, and Amazing Race. These modules have been designed in the computer but have not yet been finalized for production (see Stretch Goals below).\nCoaster, Skate Park, Maltese Cross and Amazing Race Modules\nLike Coaster, each of these modules is themed and that theme is harnessed to communicate the STEM lesson associated with the kit. For example, among other things, Skate Park teaches the concept of Centripetal Force which is related to the motion of your marble traversing the rail slide feature.\nRail Slide on Skate Park Module\nThe modularity of the Marbleocity kits lends them uniquely to a classroom or extracurricular learning experience. Imagine a group of middle-schoolers working together to assemble their own individual modules, helping one another along the way. Once assembled the class interconnects their modules and operates them together for a climactic grand finale!\nThe Coaster for the beginner Maker!  The Mini Coaster harnesses the same STEM lesson as the full Dragon Coaster module in a shorter project.  The Mini Coaster is designed for the beginner Tinkineer and can be completed in around an hour.  It's a great way to meet our cast of Tinkineers and experience the satisfaction of working with our Baltic Birch material for those who are new to the Maker scene.\nThe \"Mini\" is ~4\" x 6\" ... Perfect for a desktop!\nThe Mini Coaster consists of over thirty laser cut wood parts and features some of our favorite aspects of the full Dragon Coaster but on a smaller scale.  The \"Mini\" is hand-cranked and does not require a battery to run.  Nor are tools required for assembly!  The only thing you need to get started on this fun maker experience is household white glue.\nThank you backers!  Due to the early success of our campaign we were able to proceed with the design and development of a second \"Mini\" in the series ... as the Kickstarter campaign was in progress!  Behold the Mini Skate Park!\nThe Mini Skate Park packs a lot of cool features into a smaller kit designed to be built in 60-90 minutes. See update #8 for more details!\nBy the last week of our campaign we had a functional prototype working:\nPLAY\n\nThis model will be refined for ease of assembly after the end of the campaign and prior to delivery!\nSTEM learning was baked into the Marbleocity product line from day 1. We wanted to take our line's association with STEM further than what we'd observed in the market.\nEach Marbleocity kit has what we call an \u201covert\u201d and a \u201ccovert\u201d lesson. The overt lesson is what is taught through the companion Tinkineer comic and then reinforced through the model features that exemplify that concept. As important, however, is the \u201ccovert\u201d lesson. The Marbleocity marble machines are complex-looking kinetic structures - that\u2019s what makes them interesting! However, we\u2019ve broken the construction down into bite-sized chunks designed to be performed in digestible, hour-long sit-downs. The construction of the kit emphasizes the fundamental engineering tenant that complex machines are necessarily comprised of many smaller, simple sub-structures. Prior to founding Tinkineer, Adam Hocherman, had an \u201cah-ha\u201d moment as a college freshman that you can read about below under \"Founder Story\". Once your son or daughter has completed the Dragon Coaster they will be feeling the pride associated with accomplishing a seemingly complex task that turned out to be easier than they thought!\nThe Tinkineers are an integrated part of our maker experience.  They're a group of friends hailing from an industrial town north of Boston.  Each character has their own unique personality, backstory, style and skill set.\nIggy, Joule, Kelvin, Newt and Mosfet (\"Mos\")\nFor example Iggy is a jokester and Mosfet is handy with circuits.  Joule and Kelvin are brother and sister and Newt has been Kelvin's best friend since before they can remember.  We use the characters to bring humor and adventure to the STEM lessons that are communicated through the graphic novella that accompanies each kit.\nIn the first installment which accompanies Dragon Coaster, Iggy finds himself whisked into a secret control room where he meets Marcus, the grandson of the man who designed the real Dragon Coaster on which the story is based ...\nThis setup gives us a great opportunity to teach the concept of Conservation of Energy all within the context of a group of friends visiting a theme park based on a real place!  The theme park in the story was inspired by \"Playland\" in Rye, NY.  Fun Fact: Scenes from the movie \"Big\" starring Tom Hanks, in one of his earliest roles, were filmed at this same location!\nEach Marbleocity kit comes with everything you need to construct the project except standard household Elmer's glue.  Wood parts are fully cut out and ready to go.  Use of a hobby knife is not necessary!\nThe Mini Coaster contains over 30 wooden parts plus hardware and marbles. The Dragon Coaster kit (not pictured) has over 80 wooden parts!\nAnd, of course, each kit comes with a beautifully printed and bound graphic novella / assembly manual:\nAn excerpt from the Dragon Coaster assembly manual.\nThank you for backing our project!  We've crafted a variety of rewards levels that we think you'll find compelling.\nIf we are able to raise $35,000 we'll proceed with the development of the Skate Park Marbleocity module!  This module can stand on its own or adjoin the Dragon Coaster module to allow circulation of marbles between the two.\nSkate park has an array of cool marble features including a geared lift, half-pipe, jump, stair descent, rail slide and more!\nUnlike the countless injection molded products widely used today, our laser cut wood kits don't require steel tooling which is both expensive and time-consuming to create.  We're expecting to deliver early bird Mini Coasters in time for the holidays with the remaining rewards ready early next year.\nHi!  My name is Adam and this is my story.  I arrived on the Cornell University campus as a freshman engineering student in the fall of 1993.  We were lucky to pay only 10 cents a minute to call home on our landlines, fully 2/3 of my possessions (by volume) were CDs and Pearl Jam's second record Vs. would hit shelves in a month's time.\nAdam and his mechanical engineering buddies Brian, Andy and Jesse in 1995.\nBewildered and nervous about the program I was walking through the quad one day during orientation when I came across two guys, a girl and an amazing open-wheeled racing car.  They explained to me that the car was the result of the efforts of about thirty students over the course of two semesters.  The program was called Formula SAE and it was (and is) an international competition between engineering schools who design, build and race a car capable of 60 MPH in under four seconds.\nI was dumbfounded.  \"You built this car?  From scratch?\"  Clearly something had gone awry in admissions.  These kids were only just starting their senior year.  Cornell was expecting me to be able to design and build an automobile starting a mere 24 months from today.\nFast forward to my junior year.  I was accepted to the team which became the cornerstone of my engineering education.  So what about that \"ah-ha\" moment?  I was assigned to the drivetrain and cooling teams which I went on to help design and build.  These sub-teams along with the teams responsible for the frame, brakes, suspension, steering, etc. came together to produce our car which took 4th place overall that year.  As a freshman I saw only an extremely complex looking vehicle.  As a junior I saw a series of simpler, isolated systems that were designed independently and later integrated into the finished car.  It was like hearing the notes after learning the piano, when before all you heard was music.\nAt Tinkineer we're seeking to simulate my \"ah-ha\" moment through a maker experience designed for pre-teens and teens.  That way, when they get to school they'll know what to look for when they see that car on the quad.  And they'll be prepared that much earlier for an exciting career in design engineering or what I like to call \"making for adults.\"\nThe Tinkineers behind the Tinkineers are a devoted team of entrepreneurs, product designers, artists and, of course, Tinkerers.  Our team has had a great time developing the Marbleocity concept and the Tinkineer experience.  We feel that getting young boys and girls excited about a profession in applied engineering is important and what we've built here is how we plan to do it!\nSpecial acknowledgements to Andy and Prescott Goddard, Sean and Charlotte Albert, Corey Smigelski, Sarah Rogge, Pritesh and Alisha Gandhi, Hannah Marklez, Lindsay and Clayton Lehman, Dave Laituri, Ryan Hamilton, Greg Watts, Jason Walsh and Jen Hocherman.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHigh volume mass production of any product is a challenging undertaking. The key to delivering many identical copies of a high-quality product is to define a repeatable process that embeds multiple quality control check points along the way. The great news is that Marbleocity is not the first product that this team has delivered in a mass production environment. Specifically, founder Adam Hocherman has over a dozen years of experience bringing mass produced consumer products to market. He, along with head operations Tinkineer Krista Jakes, have worked to meet the demanding standards of giant retailers such as Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, Bed, Bath & Beyond and Target. All of this knowledge and experience will be channeled to bring you a beautiful and high-quality product.\n\nSupply chain issues (e.g. the timely delivery of materials and sub-components such as wood, marbles and other hardware) may also be cause for delay. Fortunately, the Marbleocity BOM (Bill of Materials) is relatively simple. We've already aligned with vendors of our signature Baltic Birch, print materials and the other hardware we need to create these kits. We are not anticipating any issues here.\n\nUnforeseen circumstances do arise but our team is experienced in product manufacturing and fulfillment. In the event of problems, we are here in America (Marbleocity is made in New England!) to tackle them. We believe that clear and timely communications are absolutely critical and you can count on us to keep you apprised of how things are going throughout the post-Kickstarter manufacturing and delivery process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 312, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2103508677/marbleocity-marble-machine-kit-a-stem-maker-experi", "project_name": "Marbleocity Marble Machine Kit - A STEM Maker Experience"}}, {"backer": "Brain Vessel Creative", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "This is my 3rd restoration.

What does that 1.1 mean?\nQuite simply it means that this is Series 1/Deck 1. So, series 1 will always be the Mighty Super(b) Heroes. In the future, when we do a second deck of all new super(b) heroes, it would be Mighty Super(b) Heroes \u2013 Series 1.2 or Series 1/Deck 2. That way you always know what you have in your hands.\nWhat are Figures and Elements that you refer to on the cards?\nOn the 10\u2019s, Jacks, Queens, Kings, Aces, and Jokers\u2026 we have Figure art. These are super heroes that sort of have the look of mini detailed stick figures. Now on the 2-9 cards\u2026 we have Element art. These are cards that have various elements & attributes of a super hero or the overall feel and look of a super hero.\nWhen there is more than one deck in a series, can I mix the decks together?\nYes. The card backs in a particular series will always have the same back. So you could take Mighty Super(b) Heroes 1.1 and 1.2 and mix them all together. You could even build your own style deck of super(b) heroes that could \u201cAvenge\u201d the planet if needed\u2026 or have a \u201cLeague\u201d of super(b) heroes that deal out \u201cJustice\u201d.\nWhat does Limited Production Run mean?\nWe will only make Mighty Super(b) Heroes - Series 1.1 this one time. It will NEVER be re-printed. The final amount of decks we make will be determined by this campaign. Once they are gone, that is it. \nI see there is a $75.00 tier that has a \u201cLimited Edition\u201d Mighty Super(b) Heroes 1.1 LE deck. What is that?\nIt is truly a unique deck of cards. It uses MPC\u2019s new High Gloss technique for printing. So far there have been about 5 or so decks on the market that use it. But, when you see them, you will be blown away. I was stunned on how beautiful and different they are than anything else out there. Check out this video to see what we are talking about.\nPLAY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWlwOhTWQ9g\nThe art in the two decks (standard edition vs. limited edition) are the same, but in the limited edition version the High Gloss makes the deck totally different looking. The LE version almost looks like water pooled on the cards. Very cool, very different, very unique.\nWhy is Mighty Super(b) Heroes \u2013 Series 1.2 a whole new campaign and not just an add-on? \nThat is a great question and there are several reasons why we did it this way.\n1. Currently we only have roughly 70% of the art done for this next deck. The extra month or so will give us enough time to finish all the art without being rushed.\n2. If it were an add-on and we were going to ship both together, it would have pushed the delivery time to get it all to you. We felt everyone would like to get things as quickly as possible. You would get the first deck in November and the second in December.\n3. Since were running two separate campaigns, the production houses are giving us a slight discount for repeat business. We are able to pass along those savings to you.\n4. Since it is its own campaign, it gives us another 30 days for funding. The more funds we get, the more cool things we can offer for the cards and deck.\n5. Gives you something to look forward to in the future. When the 2nd deck does arrive in the mail\u2026 you will be like Gollum and the new deck is your Precious.\nHere is what 2GG has scheduled for the remainder of 2015.\n TwoGeeksGaming01@gmail.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe artwork, design, planning, and budgeting has already been completed.

We want to create a new brand of playing cards and at the same time breathe new life into the playing card community by ushering in realistic Kickstarter goals without sacrificing quality.\nAbout the brand\nOur brand will be known as the Black Diamond. Why? We decided on the Black Diamond as our brand to pay honor to the coal mining industry here in our home state of Pennsylvania. We also wanted to create a plot device that will be used within each deck to help create an overall framed story. A framed story, you might ask? Yes, a framed story is a literary device used to lead readers from one short story to another. As two examples, think about Cloud Atlas and the Red Violin. The Cloud Atlas is a novel which is a series of nested stories with each story being connected to the previous. The Red Violin is a movie that spans five centuries as it tells the story of a mysterious violin and its many owners. In our case, the Black Diamond isn\u2019t necessarily black or a diamond but it is a magical stone that will allow the bearer to do extraordinary things. In some of our future decks the bearer will have good intentions and do good by using the Black Diamond but in many cases the Black Diamond will be in the hands of evil doers. \nAbout the cards\nDesigned by Robert and Diane Tomlinson, Pompeii will be loosely based on the novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton called the Last Days of Pompeii which in turn was loosely based on a painting by Russian artist Karl Bryullov.\nThe story tells of a well respected Pompeiian named Glaucus who performs an act of kindness by buying Nidia, a blind slave being mistreated by her owner. Nidia falls in love with her new master, but he only has eyes for Ione. Ione in turn is lusted after by Arbace, sorcerer and high priest of the temple Isis. When Nidia beseeches Isis for help in capturing Glaucus' heart, Arbace gives her a \"love\" potion, which really will affect his mind and not his heart, thus opening the way to Ione for himself. When Arbace's disciple is murdered Glaucus finds himself in hot water being framed for the murder. In the end Arbace is still rejected by Ione and in a fit of rage uses the Black Diamond to cause Mt. Vesuvius to erupt.\nThe Back Design for Pompeii: City of Brimstone and Pompeii: City of Fire\n56 playing cards printed on black core German paper\n310 gsm linen stock\nBlack Diamond Finish\nProduced by the Tomlinson Playing Card Co.\nManufactured by Wangjing Printing\n About Us\nWe, the Tomlinson Playing Card Company, have produced seven decks over the course of the last year. Throughout that year we have seen the good, the bad and the ugly side of the playing card community. We\u2019ve used printers ranging from ones that offer top notch quality like USPCC and EPCC to printers that offer low minimum quantities like MPC and Quality Playing Cards. While there\u2019s pro and cons to both we decided that the best case scenario is to find a printer that offers high end quality at low minimum quantities. This best case scenario will allow us, as well as others, to produce work without setting nearly unattainable goals on Kickstarter and also without sacrificing quality.\nAbout our printer\nWhile searching for a printer that would give us the perfect scenario of being able to produce high quality cards at low quantities we came across Wangjing Printing in Shenzhen. Starting with our Gettysburg deck and continuing on with a local history deck we recently produced we have worked closely with Wangjing Printing to get the quality we feel is comparable to the competition. In addition to being able to produce high quality cards they can also produce cards very quickly.

With the exception of one we have met and exceeded our estimated delivery date every time.

The main symbol is the Uroboros, the immortal God-snake who eats its own tail, represents the beginning and the end of time.\nThere are three different Omnia decks, and every deck represents a dimensional plane in the Omnia Universe. Oscura is the dark side, Illumina the bright one and Suprema is the plane where the Gods live.  \nEvery court live a different reincarnation in each deck: in Oscura their soul is more dark, they are more malicious, angry or sad. In Illumina they are much more happy, brave and generous. In Suprema they are ascended to Divine, and show their power with elaborate armors, jewels and wings. Think every deck as a different mirror, who reflects every Omnia court with a different soul.\nSome symbology\nThe Ankh was the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic character that read \"life\". It represents the concept of eternal life, and the Egyptian Gods are often portrayed carrying it by its loop.\nThe Ibis was an object of religious veneration in ancient Egypt, particularly associated with the deity Thoth. He is responsible for writing, mathematics, measurement and time as well as the moon and magic.\nAnubis is the Greek name of a jackal-headed god associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.\nThe Philosopher's Stone is a legendary alchemical substance said to be capable of turning base metals such as lead into gold.\nOdin is the chief god of the Norse pantheon. He gave one of his eyes for the price of wisdom, and usually disguise himself as an old man. He uses a legendary spear, Gungnir.\nFreya is a goddess associated with love, sexuality, beauty, fertility, gold and death.

It was an easy fit from the beginning as I am a huge gamer and I have worked in the gaming industry for many years before I was able to quit my day job and devote my time to my playing card company.\nThis project is the continuation of the crowdfunding story that began with Capital C.

There are so many elements that have to work together in order for a playing card project to function smoothly and succeed with satisfied backers with decks of cards in their hands.\n\nThe Wasteland 2 Playing card deck will be my 12th playing card project and 13th project on Kickstarter. I have learned so much from my past Kickstarters. I have learned some valuable lessons of what TO do, and what NOT to do.\n\nBelow are the biggest three hurdles with any playing card project, and how I plan to overcome them:\n\n1. Keeping your rewards & add on system simple and easy to understand.\n\nAs I did with both my Federal 52 Part II, Sherlock Holmes, Independence, Scarlett Tally Ho & Army projects I have given the pledge tiers Alphanumeric labels to help you understand what you are pledging for. Beside every pledge tier there is a letter/number key that you can match up with a graphic that will give you a visual representation of what is included in that pledge tier.\n\n2. Keeping International Shipping transparent and easy to understand.\n\nI have received my share of bumps and bruises in the past trying to figure out the most transparent and understandable method of communicating to international backers how much to add for Int. shipping. Int. Shipping is expensive, there is no way around it. I ship all of my deck using the USPS. It is not my intention to try and profit form international shipping I'm only trying not to go broke from it. I am totally transparent with shipping costs and have included an average breakdown of how much international shipping costs both you and me, so that all the information is out on the table, so you can be a well informed backer.\n\n3. Fulfillment is by far is the most difficult process of any playing card project.\n\nWith my first Federal 52 Project I got my hands calloused by tackling the fulfillment of 3000 orders by myself. With my second project, Federal 52 Part II, I ventured out and gave a fulfillment company a shot at taking on the challenge. I have learned that playing cards and the shipping of them is an art in and of itself. Something that is VERY important to me is that the same amount of care and detail is given to the packing and shipping of my playing cards as is going into the design. Because of this fact I always ensure that care and time is taken that every package is packed securely and properly regardless of it being one deck or three bricks. This way, the handling, packing and fulfilling of your rewards is always met with a level of excellence that you expect from anything with the Kings Wild logo on it.\n\nAs of now Kings Wild Fulfillment has successfully fulfilled four playing card projects with over 10000 unique orders.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "New playing card Kickstarter, Invocation, now live!", "update_content": "Hey guys!

Check out our website: http://www.modcube.com\nA huge thanks to all our backers who made this project such an amazing success, we look forward to making you proud!\nWhat is a ModCube?\nThe ModCube is a gaming aid which enables you to keep 6 common gaming tokens on a single cube, and quickly rotate between these tokens. Watch a bit of the below video to see how easy it is to put in new tokens to a cube:\nToken designs for the ModCube are made to be compatible with the most popular sci-fi wargames on the market today! Below is pictured some ModCube sets you could make with a \"ModDeux\" pledge (our sweet spot!) to either be compatible with Star Wars: X-wing or Warhammer 40K.\nExample ModDeux Pledge: 2 Dogfight Sets\nExample ModDeux Pledge: SciFi Infantry and SciFi Vehicles\nWhy not just make custom dice???\nWhat sets the ModCube apart is the fact that it can be taken apart and reconfigured, whereas custom dice can never be changed! There are still many, many situations to use custom dice for, but there are also many where the ModCube is a better fit =)\nTo take full advantage of this modularity, we are including 80 tokens with each set of 8 cubes! The only exception is the Dogfight set, which includes a whopping 120 tokens! (This is due to all the half-size tokens in that set). How can we possibly afford to include so many tokens? Watch the below video to see just how efficient our laser cutting process is.\nPLAY\n\nWhat are the choices?\nHere are the ModCube sets that are unlocked:\nDogfight - compatible with Star Wars: X-wing\nFleet - compatible with Star Wars: Armada\nAssault - compatible with Star Wars: Imperial Assault\nSciFi Vehicles - compatible with Warhammer 40K\nSciFi Infantry - compatible with Warhammer 40K\nSciFi Mysterious Objective - compatible with Warhammer 40K\nSteampunk - compatible with Warmachine / Hordes\nInfinite - compatible with Corvus Belli's Infinity\nSciFi Crates - various tokens to use your ModCubes as crates!\nMal - compatible with Wyrd's Malifaux\nMal2 - a set of just Poison and Burning tokens, compatible with Wyrd's Malifaux\nTrek - compatible with Star Trek: Attack Wing\nDnD - compatible with D&D: Attack Wing\nStorm - compatible with Spartan's Firestorm Armada\nGame Creator - a set of numbers and symbols for game creators!\nNumbers Only - a set of numbers only tokens, 1 - 14\nBlank - add your own symbols or art, also available in translucent\nIf you don't see a game you play above just yet, don't despair! There may well be one added before the end of the campaign, as we are working on new sets all the time (our current project: a set compatible with Firestorm Armada!).\nWith each set you pledge for, you can choose from the following colors for the cubes, shown in the picture below. You can also choose token colors for all sets except Dogfight (whose token colors are fixed for gameplay reasons). We'll get all of your color selections in the survey as soon as the campaign ends!\nAll 12 Cube Color Options\nModCubes in action!\nHere's a few pics of each of the already finished sets in use!\nFleet ModCubes in action!\nDogfight ModCubes in action!\nSciFi Vehicles and SciFi Infantry ModCubes in action!\nMysterious Objective ModCubes in action!\nInfinite ModCubes in action!\nAssault ModCubes in action!\nDnD ModCubes in action!\nTrek ModCubes in action!\nDetailed Set Contents\nBelow is a picture of what is currently planned for each full set.

The answer is, you bet it can! Just watch this video of us tossing them around:\nAdd-Ons Enabled!\nDue to many requests, we've come up with a way to enable add-ons! Here is the current list of available Add-Ons:  \n8 cubes (no tokens) - $15\n80 tokens (no cubes!) - $15\nA full set of ModCubes (8 cubes, 80 tokens, plus the ModCube Tool and bonus cube in any color!) - $25\nThis lets people who have an early bird pledge add to it at the same rate as everyone else, and also allows those who just wanted more tokens or more cubes to add them on! Note that you must be in a tier that has a shipping cost associated with it to include add-ons (so all but the $1 pledge level).\nShipping\nEach pledge level will automatically add shipping costs for 3 zones - US, EU, and ROW. This project is EU friendly, and EU rewards will be shipping from the UK!\nStretch Goals\nNow that we have hit our funding goal, here are a few stretch goals to work towards! Future stretch goals will be determined by poll, to see what colors and game systems people would like to see offered =)\n$18,000 - Blue and Green cube colors will be offered - UNLOCKED!\n$21,000 - A token set compatible with Malifaux will be offered - UNLOCKED!\n$22,500 - Game Creator set, plus new red ModCubes - UNLOCKED!\n$24,000 - Token set compatible with SW: Armada, plus military green ModCubes - UNLOCKED!\n$25,500 - SciFi Mysterious Objective token set, plus grey ModCubes - UNLOCKED!\n$27,000 - Token set compatible with Warmachine / Hordes, plus yellow ModCubes - UNLOCKED!\n$28,500 - Token set compatible with SW: Imperial Assault, plus light green ModCubes - UNLOCKED!\n$30,000 - Free lanyard for the ModCube Tool - UNLOCKED!\n$31,500 - Free option to split any ModCube set into two cube colors - UNLOCKED!\n$33,000 - ModCube set compatible with Maelstrom's Edge - UNLOCKED!\n$34,500 - ModCube set compatible with Star Trek: Attack Wing - UNLOCKED!\n$36,000 - ModCube set compatible with D&D: Attack Wing - UNLOCKED!\n$37,500 - SciFi crates set! - UNLOCKED!\n$40,000 - ModCube set compatible with Firestorm Armada - UNLOCKED!\n$44,000 - ModCube set compatible with Mantic's Deadzone - UNLOCKED!\n$46,000 - ModCube set compatible with the new game Guildball! - UNLOCKED!\n$48,000 - Final Stretch Goal - Free Tokens - Unlocked for our amazing backers!\nIf you want to suggest another game or throw your support behind one of these, please post in the comments!

Secondly, I'd like to thank the many people who have helped us get this far in our dream of taking this product from a concept to a reality:\nLibet, my wife, has shown incredible patience as I bought all the various equipment needed to get this far: a 3d printer, a laser cutter, and now a shiny new injection mold!\nThe Dream Wizards \"DAWGs\" gaming group supplied many rounds of feedback on cube and token design, going back a year and a half to the first prototypes. Thank you, guys!!\nThe mod team and DCMs at DakkaDakka.com have been incredibly supportive, giving excellent feedback and several volunteering to help at convention booths. Special thanks to the Wardens of the Maelstrom!\nThe AdeptiCon staff for giving ModCube it's first big reveal to the world less than 2 months ago (after working for many months behind the scenes).\nThe Baltimore FabLab and Baffledazzle for giving excellent laser cutting tips and training before we took the plunge and got our own.\nThe many other Kickstarter creators who I have asked questions of and who have shared their collective wisdom. Hopefully we have learned from all you've passed on!\nPart of the ModCube team at AdeptiCon!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks have already been addressed - the purchasing and installation of the laser cutter, and the tooling of the injection mold. There are still some obstacles to overcome, but we have planned for them as thoroughly as possible.\n\nThe primary remaining risk was already addressed during the campaign - tweaking one of the key interior tolerances on the cubes to make sure they stay tightly closed. See the updates section for a great rolling video showing how tight they are now!\n\nThe production run itself is a risk, mostly one of delay - we will be aiming to ship in late August or early September, and so have left a slight buffer by listing delivery as in October.

I want to pay homage to that history and create a deck of playing cards with art inspired by the tarot. \nIn some countries, traditional tarot cards aren't used just for divination, they're actually used for games the way we commonly use regular playing cards. Likewise, today's standard playing cards are used by some for divination\u2014known as cartomancy. The two card systems started out as the same thing and are still inextricably linked. This deck is the first I'm aware of that takes that simple fact as the inspiration for its design.\nThe Art, Suits, Symbolism, and the Rider-Waite\nThe art for this deck is heavily influenced by the 1910 Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck\u2014its pretty much the standard for tarot cards used for divination. Though the style of my art is very different from Pamela Smith's art, the themes and intent will be very much in the spirit of her artwork with a healthy dose of my own intent and interpretation. \nArcana is first-and-foremost a playing card deck. Wherever possible I've pulled inspiration from the RWS Tarot, the Tarot of Marseilles, and the Sola Busca Tarot. That includes the royals, the suits, and the symbolism. That said, combining the two has meant a few tradeoffs.\nArcana isn't intended to be a full tarot deck. Playing cards printed through USPCC are 56 card decks (main cards plus 2 jokers, and 2 extra cards) while the tarot uses 78 cards. As a playing card deck, I'll be designing 56 cards, which means I have to limit the Major Arcana to 4 cards (replacing the two jokers and the 2 extra cards). The four cards I've chosen to include are The Tower, The Lovers, The Fool, and Death. I've consulted with a lot of tarot readers on this and they more or less agree that these cards are of importance to any reading and make sense to include. Additionally, these cards will not include the Page/Knave cards.\nCorrelating the suits was also a little dicey as there is at least a little healthy debate about which playing card suit goes with which tarot suit. I opted to go with what seemed like the most common concensus. Spades, Clubs, Hearts and Diamonds are paired up in this deck with Swords, Wands, Cups, and Pentacles respectively.\nAlso, just a note about my art. I take inspiration from all over\u2014art history, found images, my own sketches and photographs. I combine all of it to create something new. I create the final art by combining art from scratchboard and images I draw on my tablet. It's all hand drawn, and I'm meticulous about making sure the final imagery works at the relatively small scale of playing cards.\nThe Cards\nI hope you can tell from this artwork how much passion and dedication I have for the project. Each card takes many, many hours to draw, and I've been working on it for about a year. For me, the art is what custom playing cards are all about. If you backed one of my past projects, you know how detailed and unique my work is. It's a great pleasure to bring you these cards which I think takes my art to a whole new level. Please note that all images are just comps and subject to change.\nCard back light\nCard back dark\nJack of Clubs/Wands - light\nKing of Spades/Swords - light version\nJack of Spades/Swords light version\nAce of Hearts/Cups - dark version\nQueen of Hearts/Cups dark\n10 of Hearts/Cups dark\nAce of Spades/Swords light\nAce of Spades/Swords dark\n7 of Spades/Swords dark\nQueen of Diamonds/Pentacles\n5 of Clubs/Wands dark\nThe Tower - one of the 4 major arcana cards in this deck\nThe Lovers\nDeath\nJack of Hearts/Cups light\nKing of Hearts/Cups light\nKing of Diamonds/Pentacles - light\nMany of the other royals are in various stages of completion. My goal is to have all the artwork finalized by the end of the funding period. That's a tall order, so it's possible completing the art might stretch a bit past the funding period. I'll definitely be posting more card images as I create them, so be sure to check back and feel free to offer suggestions.\nThe Box\nAs you can tell, there will be 2 versions of Arcana, one light and the other dark. Here are some images of the box:\nText translates roughly to 'As above, so below'\nThe Prints\nNOTE: Prints can now be included as add-ons for $50/ ($58 Int.)\nAs with my past projects, I'm making prints available of of each royal design, the card back, box front, and the aces. My process is to create plates from the original card art. I ink the plates, then run them through my press on museum-grade artist paper:\nInking the printing plate\nLining it up on press\nThe finished hand-pulled print\nAn example of the detail in the prints\nThe finished print, signed and numbered. Please note that print rewards will not include the easel or board.\nI think there's something really rare and special about the artistry of hand-pulling editions. I'm thrilled to offer these gallery worthy prints for about the same as what others offer mass-produced silk screened prints or even less than Giclee prints (which are nice, but really they're just ink-jet prints with a fancy name). These hand-pulled prints are a unique chance to own a limited edition work of art.\nAll prints will be 12\" x 16\" on Stonehenge paper, with hand-torn deckled edges\u2014I personally tear down the paper myself to size. All prints will be 1 color, signed and numbered editions.\nPrints can be added on to your pledge for $50/($58 Int.)\nAdd Ons\nAdding any of the add on items below is pretty simple:\nFirst, choose a reward tier\nSecond, click on the \"Manage my pledge\" button, and add the amount of the add-on. \nThat's pretty much it. After the funding period, You'll be able to specify versions, sizes, etc.If you're an international backer, be sure to add the shipping amount if an add on has additional shipping costs (specified below).\nHardbound Illustrated Book - $28/$36 (Int.)SHIPS  DECEMBER 2015\nThis 6\" x 9\" black linen hardbound book with dust jacket will be illustrated with full page art for every major card (every card that has an illustration) and gives you a chance to learn more about what I wanted to accomplish with each illustration. It also will serve as a primer for those newer to tarot on how to read each card. It will contain approximately 150 \u2013 200 pages. \nPlease note that this is only a comp image and final art and layout is subject to change\nComp image of an interior layout. Minor cards (2s-10s) will likely be ganged 2-up on a page, all major illustrations will be full page art.\nMAJOR ARCANA Expansion Deck - $20/$25 (Int.)\nDeck with both light and dark versions of the Major Arcana tarot cards. This deck is for folks who want a complete tarot set and is in addition to the light and dark main cards. \nPLEASE NOTE THIS DECK WILL NOT SHIP UNTIL DECEMBER 2015\nMajor Arcana Expansion Deck\nTarot 2-piece Boxes - $5 each, int. shipping included\nShips December 2015\nDark version 2-part box (please note that no cards are included with the box and the design is subject to change\nLight version 2-part box (please note that no cards are included with the box and the design is subject to change\nAs promised, these premium finished boxes are being made available to you more-or-less at cost. These are 2mm thick cardboard boxes that will come in dark and light versions, will have metallic foil and spot UV varnish. These are 2-part boxes, meaning the top fits over the bottom and encloses the cards within. I did my best to mock these up, but please note the comps are for the general idea only and do not show the final design or premium finishes. These boxes are intended for folks who want to separate light and dark cards from the expansion deck and keep full tarot sets together.\nBlack Walnut and White Oak Inlay Wooden Tarot Box with Arcana Medallion - $45 / $55 Int.\nShips December 2015\nPlease note: The medallion in this image was comped, the box is a real prototype. Wooden box does not include cards.\nPlease note: Wooden box does not include cards.\nThis box is STUNNING in person, I hope the images do it justice! The white oak inlay really sets off the black walnut which has an at times reddish cast to it. This is sized to perfectly contain one full Tarot set (not included). This box can be used to protect and store complete tarot sets when used with the expansion deck. It features a swing hinge top piece that opens up to reveal the cards within. And, of course, it is topped off with an inset Arcana Silver-Finish Medallion.\n30\" x 30\" Black Silk Tarot Reading Cloth with Metallic Silver Imprint - $22 / $26 Int.\nSilk Tarot Reading Cloth. Please note design is subject to change slightly before being produced. Does not include wall or moulding, but shadows are included free of charge.\n I've found an amazing source for 100% silk tarot cloths. These beauties will be screen printed with metallic silver ink. They'll make an amazing setting for tarot readings!\nExtra decks - $11/$13(Int.)\nNo Extra deck limits, add on as many as you'd like.\nT-Shirts - $22/$32(Int.)\nPremium 4.2 oz. Available in S-XL (after the funding period you'll be able to select which version and size you'd like).\nArcana tree of life t-shirt\nArcana rota fortunae t-shirt\nArcana Uncut Sheets - $50/$75(Int.)\nUncut sheets are taken off the press as they're printed at the USPCC. They show every card in the deck, front and back. Each sheet will be signed and there is no limit to the number you may add-on. Each sheet is approximately 22\" x 26.5\"\nArcana Uncut sheets - dark and light versions\nAntique Silver Finish Coins\u2014$12, shipping included for domestic and international\nThese are the same heavy-duty, 10 gauge, half-dollar sized coins I had minted for my past projects, this time with an antique silver finish. They're a great weight (about the same as 5 quarters), super detailed and have a gorgeous finish. Other coins are molded, these are minted and that's a difference you can see and feel in the detail. Nothing beats a 100 tons of pressure making every detail pop. \nAntique finish coins - this is just a comp image and art is subject to change\nSolid Silver Proof Arcana Coin\u2014$55 (shipping included for domestic and international)\nOne troy ounce of .999 pure silver coin - note that this is just a mockup.\nOne of the advantages of having coins minted (as opposed to molded, don't get me started\u2026) is that I can mint them in solid precious metals. For the first time, I'm proud to offer a SOLID silver version of the Arcana coin. This coin isn't silver plated, it is one troy ounce of solid .999 pure silver. These are \"proof coins\" and will have with a mirror finish. Below is a comp (since they aren't minted yet), but should give you an idea of what it will look like and how it differs from the regular antique silver-finish coin (which is a great genuine metal minted coin, but is not solid silver, it's a brass alloy coin with a finish applied).\nPlease note that because of the nature of this reward, outside the US it is strictly \"buy at your own risk\". We will under no circumstances issue replacement coins if your postal carrier loses it, misplaces it, or you otherwise do not receive it. We lose tracking ability when most international shipments fly out through Chicago, but our responsibility for packages ends when ship to you in good faith. We've experienced some fraud in the past, and this type reward opens us up to a LOT of risk, so we are also limiting orders to 5 per backer. Also, within the US these coins will be sent separately from other rewards and the USPS will request your signature for you to receive the coins.\n It's hard to comp up the coins to show exactly what they look like, but here's a picture from a past project showing the detail when coins are minted:\nActual minted coins\n Stretch Goals\n50K - Iridescent pearl paper stock for tucks\u2014REACHED!\n55K - Designs/printing inside tucks\u2014REACHED!\n60K - Embossing + foil(s) on tucks\u2014REACHED!!\n65K - Major Arcana expansion deck\u2014REACHED!!!\n75K - Free print for EVERY PRINT BACKER\u2014REACHED!!!\n100K - Free gift for EVERY BACKER (over $11)\u2014REACHED!!! \n120K - The Illustrated Guide to Arcana hardbound book released. \u2014REACHED!!!\n150K stretch goal - LE deck sleeve for every every deck, Gilded Edition released\u2014REACHED!!! What? Yes!\nThis last stretch goal requires a little explanation. I want to do something very special that doesn\u2019t require backers to add anything on\u2014a true thank you from me to you for getting the project to this point. So if we reach this goal, I\u2019ll include a signed and numbered sleeve for every deck that won\u2019t interfere with you being able to open the cards up and use them. This will only be for backers\u2014only the KS decks will come with the LE sleeve. This will make every deck in the project extra valuable, since only KS backers will ever have them.\nThe Gilded Edition release will be a set of all three decks with a special leather bound book box I\u2019ll be hand binding myself (book binding is a one of my passions as you might have been able to tell from all the pictures with the cast-iron book press in this project). The decks will have edges gilded with palladium leaf. Palladium leaf is more expensive than silver leaf and has one major advantage. Palladium leaf does not tarnish, or oxidize, and maintains it\u2019s finish under the harshest of conditions. It\u2019s so stable in fact, that it\u2019s used for gilding in conditions where it will be exposed to outdoor elements. Personally I think it\u2019s more beautiful too, it has a slightly warmer tone than silver leaf. There will only be 25 (changed - now 45, also, will include everything at the $500 level too) of these very rare and special sets made available. Because these decks will be EXTREMELY labor intensive to produce, they will be a new reward tier and will cost $500. I know that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but others sell genuinely gilded decks (not fake gilding using cheap foils) for upwards of $125 a piece. Hand gilding decks is an EXTREMELY labor intensive process requiring sanding multiple times at progressively finer grits, buffing to a glass-like finish, sizing the edges to receive the metal leaf, and then carefully applying the leaf. Truly these will be the ultimate collector\u2019s item. If we reach the 150K mark, I\u2019ll release the timing details of the Gilded Edition tier in advance (see Update) so everyone has a fair shot if interested in them. They will be first-come, first-serve.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my third project so I feel like I've got a lot of experience.

(Available with some rewards and as add-ons)\nThe Different Deck is a standard deck of 54 playing cards with one major difference -  the cards are inverted so instead of a 3 of clubs, you have a club of 3s.\nInstead of a 4 of diamonds, it is a diamond made up of 4s and so on.\nEach card is a unique piece of art filled with symbolism and hidden elements. If you look closely at the queen of spades you will see \"queen\" not only written in several languages, but you will find a queen chess piece and even a Queen Elizabeth signature.\nA year ago I launched the Different Deck project - a special deck of cards that was nearly 8 years in the making.  We raised over $70,000 and had over 1500 backers.  Plus, unlike most card projects we did not offer any dice, coins, poker chips or T-shirts.\nNow, to celebrate the anniversary of the Different Deck, we are doing a limited Kickstarter exclusive Green Back edition of the Different Deck. \n\nThese decks will ONLY be for backers of this campaign.\n\nPlus, we are offering the much requested HOPE T-shirts, Different Dice, and a Lucky Coin among other collectibles.\n        About the Original Different Deck\nEach Different card is rich in meaning. Every dot, every swirl, every language, and every hidden item was placed where it was placed with thought and purpose.\nThe more you look at a card and the more you look for hidden elements, the more you will find - things like ambigrams and words sharing letters, like the \"T\" in one word making an \"X\" in another.\n\nThere are over 100 different languages and numeric systems represented in this deck, plus there is symbolism and imagery in each card as well (an ant on a queen, or a toy jack on a jack, or an 8 ball on an 8, and so on).  There are some really fun things in subjects ranging from science and math, to history and mythology.\n\n\n        About the Green Back Different Deck\nAs expected, the Green Back Deck has green backs, but it is so much more. This deck takes the hidden messages of the previous deck and adds LUCK to them.  Plus, this deck is 100% inspired by Kickstarter backers. In fact, the original idea was from backer Jonathan Gorman.  Jonathan is an accountant and shortly after the Different Deck project ended he asked if it would be possible to do the 4 aces with a financial / money theme.\nNike, the artist for the Different Deck agreed and the 4 aces for the Green Back Deck were brought to life.\n\nWe were also asked by many backers for Different Dice and for T-shirts with the HOPE pips on it. Others asked for coins or poker chips and so here it all is.\nAlong with the green back and special edition aces, the card design features the special paper style used for US currency.\n\nThis is a limited run printed by USPCC (Less than 1000 Bicycle branded Green Backs will be printed - making it the rarest Different Deck of the 4).  We will only print as many decks as we need to fulfill this project.\n\nAlong with the Green Back Decks this project has some other\namazing rewards as well.\nDifferent Dice\nI have teamed up with my new friends at Daft Concepts and designed dice worthy of the name \"Different\". These dice are laser engraved in high quality birch wood. Sure, that is cool but the really cool part is they come shipped to you flat, pre-cut on pieces of wood the exact same size as a playing card (side note - 5 dice cards fit in a card box perfectly).\n\nAll you have to do is pop out the 6 sides, snap them together, and then enjoy the original artwork featuring elements of playing cards drawn in the classic Different Style.\n     One: a crown that says one and is one solid piece\n     Two: a spade with two dots in it\n     Three: a heart made up of three pieces\n     Four: a club made up of four pieces\n     Five: a diamond made up of five pieces\n     Six: a joker made up of six pieces\nH.O.P.E. T-Shirt\nA high quality grey T-shirt with the original H.O.P.E. pips printed across the chest.\nLucky Coin\n  Make your own luck with a \"Heads I win - Tails you lose\" coin.\nThis is a coin for winners.This special 1.5\" black and gold coin is not only inspirational, it is also fun. If you look closely at the Indian head and the fox tail you will see lots of hidden things in them (the coin was again designed by Nike Meyer) including the famous gag \"Heads I win - Tails you lose\",\nOriginal Art\nI have a few pieces of original signed art left from the original project, including the back design and the new money aces (well, three of the new money aces - Jonathan obviously gets one).\nHere are the Different reward levels:\nNote: You may add more decks (including the original Different Deck and coins and dice) to any level you like.

That\u2019s where he noticed that deodorant application was one area of personal care that hadn't made significant (or any) advancements since the 50's. \u201cThere must be a better way than turning the archaic knob that always reminded me of dial phones and old car windows \u201c.\nWhen he met Carla, the idea of ClickStick started to come together as a product. She immediately identified with the need of ease of use products. Carla's father had suffered from ALS and had difficulty in simple everyday tasks, like applying deodorant.  She realized that there is reason why everyday task is not easy and fun.

Series 4\nRemember the fun of collectible mini figures like M.U.S.C.L.E. and Monster In My Pocket? So do we! That's why we are proud to present to you with five new awesome characters in our continuing line of OMFG - Outlandish Mini Figure Guys!\nOMFG Series 4 consists of five figures including:\n1. Fossil Freak designed by Michael Stearns from Washington and sculpted by George Gaspar from California\n2. Wooly Wisp designed and sculpted by Billy Parker from South Carolina\n3. Bullseye designed by (Raging Nerdgasm) Tom Khayos and Ana Bruja-Khayos from Florida sculpted by George Gaspar from California\n4. Tree Witched designed by MudMarox and sculpted by GormTransMonster from Italy\n5. The Siren designed by Corwin Webb from California and sculpted by George Gaspar from California\nThe OMFG project originated from the talented group of artists, designers, and toy enthusiasts on the October Toys/Toy Break forum (http://www.octobertoys.com/forum). After successful campaigns to produce the first three OMFG series (available now online and at many retail locations), hundreds of character ideas were submitted from all around the world and the forum voted for their favorite designs to be put in to production.\nAs you can see, bringing this project to life has truly been a community effort and now we invite you to be part of that community! The prototypes are finished and we are ready to move forward with overseas production. With the help of Kickstarter contributors like yourself, we look forward to continuing this fantastic line of community created figures.\nWe also invite you to come join us in the forum and submit your characters for future OMFG series at http://www.octobertoys.com/forum\nSpeaking of future series, we would like to note that voting for the next series of OMFG characters will be handled a little differently than previous series - only OMFG Series 4 Kickstarter backers will be able to vote on Series 5 designs. This includes all OMFG Series 4 Kickstarter backers who pledge $1 or more, regardless of reward level.\nMonsterforge Customs\nCharles Marsh (aka Monsterforge) is a designer and customizer who we are proud to have been working with since the very first series of OMFG.

We are planning on making Joe Whiteford's BrainWaves figure in the next batch of OTMFG figures we produce, so we thought it would be fun to give him away to backers of OMFG Series 4 on Kickstarter!\nJust like we did with the ZOMBIE Pheyden in OMFG S3 Kickstarter, the BrainWaves figure will be for all pledges $27 level and over. We will include a BrainWaves to match each set of OMFG in your pledge...for no extra charge! So if you pledge for one set of flesh OMFG and one set of black OMFG, you will also receive one flesh BrainWaves and one black Brainwaves. \nYou have to back at least the $27 level in order to qualify, but you may add on extra sets to your order, and that will also get you extra BrainWaves!\nBrainWaves is not part of the OMFG line, but presented as a bonus OTMFG (October Toys Mini Figure Guys) who will also play well with your other OMFG.\nHuge thanks to Joe Whiteford http://joewhiteford.blogspot.com/ for helping us make this bonus figure possible. \nWe can never thank everyone who has supported this project enough, but we hope you will enjoy BrainWaves as much as we do.\nPlease Note: BrainWaves will only be included free of charge with OMFG Series 4 sets pledged for on Kickstarter at the $27 level and above.

And I need to deal my dice. \nI make dice. Dice of awesome.  \nDice are the gateway for reality and our imagination. So isn't it high time that you own a set that inspires you? A set that you love to marvel at? A set that your friends would say, \"Holy sh&tballs, those dice are epic!\" The Wizard's Gambit dice set is just that set.  \nThe Wizard's Gambit is my interpretation and embodiment of the Wizard's tutelage and intelligence. It is the representation of a wizards spell working on dice for greater luck. A wizard's Arcana Fortuna if you will. And who knows, perhaps these dice are really magically enhanced to help you slay your foes, swindle the unsuspecting and perform feats of awesomeness.  \nMy goal is simple, to bring dice into the world that bridges the gap between your gameplay and the stories unfolding in your mind. That and to make your friends wickedly jealous of your sweet shwag. Just saying.\n The Dice \nCreating dice is a lot of fun. I start by drafting designs on my Nexus 7. Surprisingly the drafting process can be somewhat difficult. You have to create a design that can scale down to less than 15 mm while still looking good and having the numbers easily legible. Not an easy feat especially when you are trying to create ridonkulous designs.\nFrom there I import the designs into Photoshop (or Illustrator if I have a lot of touch ups) and size the designs to fit a die facet. The real fun begins here. Once the design is sized and set I take a blank die and place it in a laser engraver. Then I hit print in PS and watch the magic begin. In case you don't know, a laser engraver shoots a high wattage laser beam and burns images directly onto an object. It's literally like printing with ink except this printer can kill you. #Ilovetechnology. \nOnce the die is created it's back to the drawing board, er, drawing tablet. I examine what's flawed in the design and make tweaks. Then I burn several new sets and the dice and the final prototype is made.\nADD-ONS\n1) 6xD6 Add-on. If you wish to add 6xD6 just add an additional $12 to your pledge. Please message me letting me know that you increased your pledge for the 6xD6 add-on. \n2) 10xD10 Add-on.

With the success on our first campaign of our first ever branded playing cards earlier on the year, we are now introducing a whole new concept to a deck of playing cards which you can touch, feel and admire as well as play.\nStealth Edition\nClose-up on high gloss - Stealth Edition\nTable spread\nAce of spades\nIn addition to the traits of a traditional deck of cards, Impressions playing cards gives you the added sense of touch on the artwork, brought to you using the latest in printing and secondary process technology which we have recently invested heavily in. We are using premium quality 310gsm German casino grade card stock with a black core centre layer.\nThe Impressions Playing Cards range\nCreating Impressions playing cards was by no means straight forward as the whole normal printing and production process of a traditional deck of cards had to be altered. Adding the special raised embossed gloss effect to the cards essentially increased the height of the deck so the cutting process had to be reconfigured. Also, the fact that we have applied this special layer on the surface top of each card meant that the finishing had to be completely changed so as to not lose the shine effect but keeping them true to their original purpose which is the playability aspect. We have had countless trials using different methods, materials and finishing which alone have lasted 3 months. We are now extremely happy to say that we have got it right.\n\nThe 3 decks (now 4 decks - 29 Sept.)\nThere are 2 main decks in this Kickstarter project. These are the Impressions Stealth Edition and the original Impressions deck. We also have an enlarge court cards special deck called the Impressions Court Edition.On 29th September, we released a new white deck called the Phantom Edition. This is the 4th deck to join the Impressions by MPC range.\nStealth Edition\nStandard Edition\nCourt Edition\n And the all new Phantom Ed. deck\nPhantom Ed. tuck box\nAside from our in-house traditional offset printers, latest large-scale digital industrial printers, this year we at QP have also invested significantly on state of the art secondary process machines, one of which we are using on our Impressions playing cards. This new digital technology is able to apply embossed UV to images with pinpoint accuracy. Some of you may say this is traditional spot UV but they are distinctively different. First of all, no expensive setup is required i.e. there is no MOQ. Second of all, spot UV is almost flat whereas this is able to achieve up to 250 microns (braille effect) in polymer height which is 100 times higher than selective varnish. It can be looked as a mix between enhanced UV and digitized embossing. We can apply different densities ranging from 1-100% through the same pass which normal spot UV cannot achieve. In terms of the glossiness, it achieves 99GU which is the highest gloss possible for printed material. What does this mean? Well, it means that your selected areas of colors will stand out even more through this raised gloss effect and what's more, you can experience the touching of it. The results are astounding which you can see in the photos here.\nWe have applied this glossy raised effect onto the cards here in this project as well as onto the tuck boxes. What\u2019s more, we have found a way to make the cards playable even after apply this secondary process which is a major breakthrough.\nWe took the traditional design for playing cards which is in the public domain, redrew the card faces completely making the design unique to the MPC brand. For the back, we also come up with a symmetrical design using a tree as the focal point since playing cards are essentially paper which originates from trees, hence the inspiration for the design.\ncard back design\nThe MPC Impressions range\nAs mentioned above, there are 3 decks in this project. The original Impressions deck is the main deck with the glossy embossed effect applied to it. The Stealth Edition is a really special design using the color black and virko to create the stand out design. The Court Edition enlarges the artwork on the court cards which aside from the unique design, players can properly experience the look and the touch and feel of the polymer applied to the card faces. We love all three decks as these should be the first on the market using this kind of new technology.\nStealth Edition\nStandard\nCourt Edition\nThe tuck boxes for this Kickstarter project is unique and limited to our Kickstarter backers in this project only. How? Well, we have especially printed \"Kickstarter Edition\" on the top flap of the boxes as shown below. We have applied varying levels of virko densities to different areas of the box. Basically the more polymer we apply to a specific area, the more raised and glossier it becomes. On top of this, if we reach funding of more than $10k, we will be adding our special gold foil seals to the boxes as an added mark of authenticity of a limited edition deck. These KS edition boxes will never be produced and released again so once they're gone, they're gone.\nTuck boxes - different density levels to different areas\nTuck box close-up\n\nHow do they handle? Can they bend?\nSome people are curious as to how these cards handle and whether they can bend. Using my limited handling skills, I created 2 videos for you to analyze and to help answer your many questions. Enjoy!\n$10,000: If we reach this funding goal, we will upgrade our tuck box seals to digital gold stamped foil. Beautiful!\nGold foil seals\nUnveiling the Phantom Ed. deck\nWe have also added the all new Phantom Ed. deck which we released on the 20th day of our project. It's available as a add-on for $13.\nImpressions Phantom Ed.\nThe 1st ever MPC chips give away to pledges of $35+\nWith the addition of another newly sought digital UV printing machine, we created the first ever MPC chips which we are going to give away in this project. As we have limited stock availability and to control the costs, if your total pledge amount including your add-ons is over $35 at the end of the project, we will include one of these MPC chips into your package as shown below.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA playing card project is a big task. There are so many elements that have to work together in order for a playing card project to function smoothly and succeed with satisfied backers with decks of cards in their hands.\n\nThe ARMY Playing Card project will be my 6th playing card project and 9th project on Kickstarter, all of which have been successful in both raising the funds and also delivering backer's rewards. I have learned so much from my past Kickstarters. I have learned some valuable lessons of what TOO do, and what NOT too do.\n\nBelow are the biggest three hurdles with any playing card project, and how I plan to overcome them:\n\n1. Keeping your rewards & add on system simple and easy to understand.\n\nAs I did with both my Federal 52 Part II, Sherlock Holmes & Independence projects I have given the pledge tiers Alphanumeric labels to help you understand what you are pledging for. Beside every pledge tier there is a letter/number key that you can match up with a graphic that will give you a visual representation of what is included in that pledge tier.\n\n2. Keeping International Shipping transparent and easy to understand. \n\nI have received my share of bumps and bruises in the past trying to figure out the most transparent and understandable method of communicating to international backers how much to add for Int. shipping. Int. Shipping is expensive, there is no way around it. I ship all of my deck using the USPS. It is not my intention to try and profit form international shipping I'm only trying not to go broke from it. I am totally transparent with shipping costs and have included an average breakdown of how much international shipping costs both you and me, so that all the information is out on the table, so you can be a well informed backer.\n\n3. Fulfillment is by for the most difficult process of any playing card project.\n\nWith my first Federal 52 Project I got my hands calloused by tackling the fulfillment of 3000 orders by myself. With my second project, Federal 52 Part II, I ventured out and gave a fulfillment company a shot at taking on the challenge. I have learned that playing cards and the shipping of them is an art in and of itself. Something that is VERY important to me is that the same amount of care and detail is given to the packing and shipping of my playing cards as is going into the design. Because of this fact I have recently formed a company that specializes in nothing but shipping playing cards and add ons for Playing Card projects. My fulfillment company is called Kings Wild Fulfillment and it has a full time staff that is dedicated to handling, packing and fulfilling you rewards with a level of excellence that you expect from anything with the Kings Wild logo on it.\n\nAs of now Kings Wild Fulfillment has successfully fulfilled two playing card projects with over 5000 unique orders.\n\nALL rewards, whether you order 1 deck or 500 will arrive in a corrugated cardboard box. I will be using a variety of industructo brand boxes form ULINE.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jackson Robinson\n30 created \u00b7 176 backed\nBorn and raised in the Panhandle of Texas, I now live with my beautiful wife and three wonderful daughters outside of Austin Texas.

Because of its small size we have created a number of innovations never seen before in the color reproduction industry. We are also always looking for feedback and opinions from our supporters and want to create a community of supporters as part of this Kickstarter project. We created Scribble for YOU and want you to be a part of the process!\nPROTOTYPE DESIGNS\nFINAL DESIGNS\nWHAT ARE REWARDS?\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT\nThank you so much for taking the time to check out our Kickstarter Campaign and discover the Scribble.

At this stage, we have identified our primary real significant risk to be the injection moulding process. This process involves the largest outlay of capital expenditure. We want to get the best quality finish for the Scribble Pen and as such, our team has put a considerable amount of time into sourcing our injection moulded parts and working with the relevant suppliers.\n\nOur R&D team consists of many multi-talented individuals with vast experience in the fields of engineering, color science and industrial design. To get to where we are today, we have overcome many challenges and have made great progress in identifying and assessing the risks which are part of this highly complex project.\n\nThe greatest challenge we now face, is taking this project from a working prototype into mass production. Our design is highly complex and innovative and we require unique production technology.\n\nMany Kickstarter campaigns encounter difficulties at this crucial stage of taking the prototype into production. The challenge involves finding the correct suppliers and engineering products and ensuring that the production process will be smooth and risk free. We have been working for many months on this, negotiating with suppliers, testing component quality, and building up a strong team that will be able to deliver on our promises.\n\nFrom the start of our campaign through to the delivery, we intend to keep you fully updated on all the stages of our progress.

Although the attempts of decode RongoRongo are ongoing for over two hundred years, it continues to evade code breakers and most of it remains a mystery.\nThe demands this most advanced society placed on the environment reached the critical point during the race to erect huge MOAI statues; the process probably used the remaining supply of trees on the island.\nThe culture of Easter Island remains a striking example of what happens to advanced societies when they push the environment past the breaking point. This project pays homage to RongoRongo scribes who created those amazing glyphs.\nRongoRongo Gold back detail.\nAnimated RongoRongo Gold back (please wait for GIF to load).\nThe fan of RongoRongo Gold backs creates a large image inspired by a symbol of Sun God.\nRongoRongo Gold Ace. \nRongoRongo Gold Aces.\nRongoRongo Gold Face Card detail.\nThe face cards show the tribal masks based on Easter Island and Polynesian patterns. Kings feature RongoRongo glyphs of men, Queens feature RongoRongo glyphs of flowers and Jacks feature RongoRongo glyphs of canoes. Canoes are represented by many glyphs in RongoRongo language, suggesting a vibrant fishing industry on Easter Island. The loss of all trees marks the end of fishing and the beginning of the collapse of the entire civilization until there were only 111 Rapa Nui left. Today the island is home to a vibrant culture with more than 3,000 people who claim Rapa Nui heritage.\nRongoRongo Gold Spade Face Cards.\n RongoRongo Gold Hearts Face Cards.\nRongoRongo Gold Clubs Face Cards.\nRongoRongo Gold Diamonds Face Cards.\nRongoRongo Gold Jokers.\n RongoRongo Gold Queen of Hearts.\nRongoRongo Gold Jack of Clubs.\nRongoRongo Gold pip card design closeup.

The position comes with a royal treatment but without any gifts or a power to rule others (that would be against KS policy).\nThe Birdman cult and IronMan-like competitions followed the toppling of MOAIs on Eastern Island. The winner of the competition (actually, the sponsor of the winner) held the title of Birdman for one year. The title came with an absolute power to rule other clans and collect gifts and taxes.\nThe competition involved scaling sheer cliffs, swimming in shark infested waters to an adjacent island and returning with the first egg of the season to the starting line. It\u2019s safe to assume that the mortality rate among racers of the Birdman competition was quite high.\nKevin Costner co-produced a movie based on Birdman race on Easter Island:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapa-Nui_%28film%29\nCustom ceramic poker chips in 5 colors.

When people on Easter Island cut the last tree, they unleashed the domino effect which devastated their society. Without the trees, there was no more canoes or fishing. The birds, so plentiful on the island, lost their nesting grounds and left. Without the natural fertilizer from the birds the soil eroded, making it very difficult to grow food. So let's go solar...\nT-shirts will be available in S,M,L,XL,XXL and in GREY, BLACK and WHITE colors.\nAdd RongoRongo t-shirt to any reward for only $18\n($23 international orders).

We will use United States Post Office for all shipments; we were very successful in the past shipping similar projects.\n\nWe will be using corrugated boxes for shipping to avoid a potential damage when shipped in a padded envelope.

If you discover the Treasure Chest after the project ends, you can pre-order it and/or any of the add-ons (wooden stars and metal coins) through the Stonemaier Games website.\nThe creators of Viticulture, Euphoria, and Tuscany bring you the Stonemaier Games Treasure Chest, an assortment of premium-grade realistic resource gaming tokens (gold, wood, ore, stone, clay, and gems). All tokens come pre-painted.\nWe love how realistic resource tokens add to any tabletop game experience, and we want to share that with fellow gamers around the world. We've already created the sculpts for these tokens--now we just need your help to make them a reality!\nWe will add 1 resource token for every 100 backers (+1 gold after the first 100 backers, then +1 wood after the next 100 backers, and so on). We'll update the total each morning.\nDay 1: 120 total tokens (20 each of gold, wood, ore, stone, clay, and gems)\nDay 2: 131 total tokens (22 each of gold, wood, ore, stone, and clay; 21 gems)\nDay 3: 133 total tokens (23 gold, and 22 each of wood, ore, stone, clay, and gems)\nDay 4: 135 total tokens (23 each of gold, wood, and ore; 22 each of stone, clay, and gems)\nDay 5: 136 total tokens (23 each of gold, wood, ore, and stone; 22 each of clay and gems)\nDay 6-7: 137 total tokens (23 each of gold, wood, ore, stone, and clay; 22 gems)\nDay 8: 138 total tokens (23 each of gold, wood, ore, stone, clay, and gems)\nDay 9: 139 total tokens (24 gold; 23 each of wood, ore, stone, clay, and gems)\nDay 10: 140 total tokens (24 each of gold and wood; 23 each of ore, stone, clay, and gems)\nDay 11-12: 142 total tokens (24 each of gold, wood, ore, and stone; 23 each of clay and gems)\nDay 13: 143 total tokens (24 each of gold, wood, ore, stone, and clay; 23 gems)\nDay 14: 144 total tokens (24 each of gold, wood, ore, stone, clay, and gems)\nDay 15: 145 total tokens (25 gold; 24 each of wood, ore, stone, clay, and gems)\nDay 16: 147 total tokens (25 each of gold, wood, and ore; 24 each of stone, clay, and gems)\nDay 17: 149 total tokens (25 each of gold, wood, ore, stone, and clay; 24 gems)\nFINAL: 156 total tokens (26 each of gold, wood, ore, stone, clay, and gems)\nWe'll round up at the end of the project to make sure the tokens are evenly distributed.\nYou can see a growing list of games that use these resources on BGG here.\nThanks to the worldwide fulfillment system explained on our Kickstarter Lessons blog here and here, we have very cost-effective ways of shipping the Treasure Chest.\nOnly pay the shipping fee once per pledge (any # of units, reward level, or country code). After selecting your reward level, add the shipping cost to your pledge total.\nThe following may be added to the $33 pledge level and above. After selecting your reward level, add this cost to your pledge total:\nAny backer may pledge to the $290 level--you don't have to be a retailer.\nViticulture & Tuscany are available for pre-order through our website, as are the wooden stars and lira as stand-alone purchases. We also have a few copies of Euphoria.\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don't like the Treasure Chest within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it for a full pledge refund (see FAQ).\nHuge Discount: Based on the manufacturing cost, the Treasure Chest should have an MSRP of $60. We can keep the price much lower by only selling the first print run directly through Kickstarter, our website, and Amazon.\nMake It Better for Everyone: The more backers we get, the better the Treasure Chest will be (see stretch goals). The Kickstarter price will remain the same, but the post-Kickstarter price will increase as we add tokens.\nLocalized Shipping: Our shipping prices for pre-ordered games are so low because we send games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world. This is your chance to lock in the lowest possible shipping rate.\nWe Need You: We need your financial support to be able to manufacture and ship these Treasure Chests to gamers around the world.\nFree Euphoria Recruits: We're including 16 updated and revised Euphoria recruit cards in every Treasure Chest. They'll also be available from BGG for $5 in December.\nWe selected the resources for this first Treasure Chest with the help of thousands of voters on our website. Thus the resources in this Treasure Chest are set--we won't be adding any more or it would significantly impact the production schedule.\nHowever, we still want to hear your ideas for future Treasure Chests. We're particularly interested in resources that (a) can be represented in a \"realistic\" way, (b) aren't already produced by another company, and (c) apply to several popular games (not just one game).\nThe realistic resource tokens in the Treasure Chest are a great way to upgrade the retail version of Euphoria (shown here).\nWe anticipate that some backers may want a ton of a specific type of resource--for example, enough gold tokens to fill a swimming pool. There are companies that are really good at selling individual resource tokens...but we are not one of them.\nOur supply chain is based on creating one cohesive version of this premium product, making it affordable for you, and shipping it to you quickly and cost-effectively.\nphoto courtesy of Kim Euker at http://kiestone.smugmug.com/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Treasure Chest is a first for us in that it's not a game--rather, it's a box full of tokens used in a number of games. The challenge with these tokens is that they're all custom sculpts and moulds, which can be time-consuming and expensive to perfect. Fortunately we have lots of experience with wooden, resin, and metal pieces from Viticulture, Euphoria, and Tuscany.\n\nWith such precious components in every box, we're taking extra precautions to make sure the contents arrive safe and sound. Specifically, we will use a microfiber-lined box insert to protect the tokens from scratching, and there will be a layer of bubble wrap inside each box. The boxes will be made of very sturdy 2mm cardboard that can be stored vertically as well as horizontally without dumping the contents.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisors to point us in the right direction.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 100+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Token Trilogy and the Final Update", "update_content": "Hi!

This increases variety and value!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI grew up in Los Angeles and at a very young age, I was exposed to a lot of different cultures, especially that of the Mexican heritage. There are many aspects of the culture that I become accustomed to, but it wasn\u2019t until I started looking into my fear of death that I was introduced to the holiday known as Dia De Los Muertos. The imagery and symbolism of Dia De Los Muertos is incredibly beautiful and has a lot of whimsy and playfulness to it despite it involving the very somber topic of death.\nMy goal when creating the imagery for the Muertos deck is to honor the message that Dia De Los Muertos celebrates. From Aztec influences to Jos\u00e9 Posada\u2019s works and even the Mexican-American Wars, I aimed to capture the social classes and implications that are set within the history of the culture. By encompassing all of it and expressing it in my style and my background, I feel it\u2019s true to me and a product I am very proud of.\nIn the next couple of weeks, I hope to get work with you to release more awesome rewards and make Muertos come to life together!\nMuertos Night Deck back design\nMuertos Night Deck Aces\nMuertos Night Deck Spade Face Cards - (Left to Right) El Padre, La Hermana, El Soldado\nMuertos Night Deck Hearts Face Cards - (Left to Right) El Catrin, La Viuda, El Bandito\nMuertos Night Deck Clubs Face Cards - (Left to Right) El Caudillo, La Bailarina, El Campesino\nMuertos Night Deck Diamonds Face Cards - (Left to Right) El Azteca, La Catrina, El Caballero\nJoker cards feature the Calaveras (sugar skull) and the Muertos Insignia.\nThe pips on numbered cards has been updated to a design that reflects the symmetry of traditional decks but is new and refreshing. \nMuertos Queen of Clubs - La Bailarina\nMuertos King of Diamonds - El Azteca\nMuertos Tuck Box Layout and Layers\n\nThe Muertos Night Deck come packaged in a black and grey embossed box featuring gold foil accents, and a grey tax stamp seal.\nMuertos tuck box grey seal\nOnce $40,000 Stretch goal funding is reached, the limited Muertos: Mourning Gold Edition will be unlocked as an add-on.\n\nOnce $60,000 Stretch goal funding is reached 1 additional Mourning Gold Edition deck will be free for all backers with 3 Night Decks or More!

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOver the past year I have written over 84 kickstarter updates communicating with my backers letting them know step by step how my projects are proceeding. Dragon\u2019s Hoard my first project has been delivered to all 1740 backers. I\u2019m so grateful for all the support, which allowed me to manufacture and deliver a fantastic game. Dragon\u2019s Hoard has been doing amazing. Dragon\u2019s Hoard has been nominated for Best Toys For Kids. Further more, Tom Vasal said in his review that he\u2019d go as far as nominate it for best artwork of the year. Because of Kickstarter, and nearly 2000 amazing supportive backers, Dragon\u2019s Hoard is now available to everyone to enjoy. It has been such a hit that we have sold over 4000 copies so far. And even more exciting news, a major publisher will be publishing Dragon\u2019s Hoard next year. All of this is possible because of backers like you. \n\nI have learned a lot about manufacturing, and delivering a product to my backers. It is not always easy. But in the end, I make sure I\u2019m delivering the best product possible. The most common challenges are delays. With Dragon\u2019s Hoard, because of the huge success and the many stretch goals, it took an additional two months to illustrate all the new artwork. The new artwork, of course, made the game much more stunning. The second delay happened when I sent the files to the printers. After I sent all the files, they kept asking me to change something, and re-send them. This process took a month, which was three times longer than expected. It was frustrating that they didn\u2019t explain everything up front. However, now I have a keen knowledge of how printers want the files. Knowing this information has helped me deliver the files more smoothly to new manufactures. The third delay was a poorly executed proof. The printer wanted to have me sign off on a digital proof, but I refused, and said I need to see a physical proof. Once the physical proof arrived, I was glad I asked for it. It was unacceptably dark, way too dark. I took it into my own hands to print my own proof from a local printer. I then sent it over seas to my printer so they could use it to match the lightness. This worked perfectly. The next proofs they sent me were beautiful. Our fourth delay was because the printer held the game for two months after I signed off on the proofs before they even started printing it. This was by far the most frustrating challenge. The printer quoted a three-month turn around, but ended up taking more than twice as long to fulfill their promise. The last and final challenge was shipping out so many packages. I first was packing 50 packages a day and taking them down to my local post office, which only had one or two font desk workers. I would stand in line for half an hour before I\u2019d even get to the front desk. Then I\u2019d spend the next hour handing packages to the post officer. I did this for weeks. This was not working well. It was taking way to long. I started looking for other ways. I then found Endicia. It is a great online program where one can print your own shipping labels. This saved me so much time, and allowed me to deliver tracking numbers to my backers. In the end, I\u2019m grateful for the amazing support of my backers, and their understanding. I\u2019m confident that my projects in the future will be done more efficiently using the skills I\u2019ve learned over the past year. \n\nMy second project: Kingdoms of a New World raised over $40,000. The art has now been finished, and has been submitted to the printers for approval. Once approved, we will be moving forward with the print run.

There are so many elements that have to work together in order for a playing card project to function smoothly and result in decks of cards in the hands of satisfied backers.\n\nThis playing card project will be my 5th playing card project on Kickstarter. I have learned so much from my past Kickstarters, including some valuable lessons about what TO do, and what NOT to do.\n\nBelow are the three biggest hurdles with any playing card project, and how I plan to overcome them:\n\n1. Keep your rewards & add on system simple and easy to understand.\n\nAs I did with both my Federal 52 Part II & Sherlock Holmes projects I have given the pledge tiers Alphanumeric labels to help you understand what you are pledging for. Beside every pledge tier there is a letter/number key that you can match up with a graphic that will give you a visual representation of what is included in that pledge tier.\n\n2. Keep International Shipping transparent and easy to understand.\n\nI have received my share of bumps and bruises in the past trying to figure out the most transparent and understandable method of communicating to international backers how much to add for Int. shipping. Int. Shipping is expensive, there is no way around it. I ship all of my decks using the USPS. It is not my intention to try and profit from international shipping I'm only trying not to go broke from it. I am totally transparent with shipping costs and have included an average breakdown of how much international shipping costs both you and me. Since all the information is out on the table, you can be a well-informed backer.\n\n3. Fulfillment is by far the most difficult process of any playing card project.\n\nWith my first Federal 52 Project I got my hands calloused by tackling the fulfillment of 3000 orders by myself. With my second project, Federal 52 Part II, I ventured out and gave a fulfillment company a shot at taking on the challenge. I have learned that shipping playing cards is an art form in of itself. It is VERY important to me that that the same amount of care and detail is given to the packing and shipping of my playing cards as is going into the design. Because of this fact I have recently formed a company that specializes in nothing but shipping playing cards and add-ons for playing card projects. My fulfillment company is called Kings Wild Fulfillment. It has a full-time staff that is dedicated to handling, packing and shipping your rewards with a level of excellence that you expect from anything with the Kings Wild logo on it.\n\nAt this very moment Kings Wild Fulfillment is fulfilling 1500 orders for my previous card project, The Sherlock Holmes playing card project.\n\nYou may notice that my international shipping costs are a little higher than my previous projects. One thing that I am doing differently on this project is eliminating bubble wrapped envelopes for both domestic and international rewards. ALL rewards, whether you order 1 deck or 500 will arrive in a corrugated cardboard box. I will be using a variety of boxes from ULINE industructo boxes to USPS Priority flat rate boxes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "The Arthurian Project is Live!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "You're Invited!", "update_content": "Dear Kings Wild Backers and Supporters, \nThis spring Kings Wild turns 4 years old.

We will be doing a live version of the Hair Woven Rope and giving out exclusive art cards from our stories. Hope to see you there! Aren't in LA? You can always stream the event live at http://www.meltcomics.com/blog/meltdown-comics-live/ \nUPDATE (4/14):\nWe are proud to announce that Metalalia will now also be available at launch for Android devices! Android or iOS, you can enjoy our stories no matter your platform!\nWhat is Metalalia? \nA sneak preview of our launch story's first page\nAn ever evolving story telling project, Metalalia began as a way for writer Alex Nicholson and musician Pam Shaffer (that\u2019s us!) to feel closer to each other when they found themselves in a long distance relationship from LA to the UK. He would read his stories aloud to her while she played her songs for him, as they both loved each other\u2019s art. \nOne day, they decided to combine forces and have Pam score a story that Alex had written. They also thought it would be lovely to have one of their friends make visual art to go with the story, much like an illuminated manuscript, but for the iPad and other iOS devices. Suddenly, an idea was born and the project began! \nAlex and Pam quickly discovered that the current generation of e-readers were not capable of accommodating the wide variety of media they wanted the stories to include. They realized they would need to create a new platform to host the stories. They decided to call it  Metalalia.\nThe first page of The Hair Woven Rope in full color\nMetalalia features the talents of Alex and Pam in collaboration with a pool of brilliant musicians, designers and visual artists. It is a growing collection of re-imagined traditional fairytales alongside original stories all with their own original score, gorgeous narration, and stunning artwork. Fairytales and myths are such a vital part of our culture. We have made it our mission to craft stories that put a new spin on your old favorites and reflect the diversity of our 21st century world. Metalalia is proud to be a feminist, body-positive, LGBTQ-friendly content creator. The reading level and subject matter of our stories is suitable for readers aged 14 and up.\nCharacter design for The Wind-up Boy\nWe need your financial support to create this app! Other e-book formats cannot support all the fantastic audio and visual content we are creating for you. Our experienced app developer, Adam Schwem, is creating a platform that will give you the most bang for your buck, with a unique user interface designed by animator and designer Amy Faigin. You will be able to choose which elements of the story you want to enjoy: text, art, narration, music, or a combination. The app will launch with our first story, The Hair Woven Rope, included. Two more stories will be available for purchase at launch as well. Once the project is funded and Metalalia goes live, the sky's the limit and we can bring you all the stories we can dream up!\nWhich stories have we written so far? \nThe Hair Woven Rope - in which Rapunzel fashions her own escape from a floating fortress \nThe River Girl - an original fable about the ghosts of war \nThe Wind Up Boy - a steampunk retelling of Pinocchio in a Europe riven by conflict\nThese are the stories we are currently making available at launch, but we already have several more in the works!\nThe final version of the app will feature full color animated panels, scrolling text, fully mastered sound, and of course, our custom-built user interface.\nWho is the author Alex Nicholson? \nMeet Alex. He is a charming writer of the British persuasion. Do not be fooled by his modest and quiet nature. Beyond those still waters lie a vast imagination, a voluminous vocabulary and a remarkable facility with words. His accomplishments span from running a theatre company to penning screenplays to teaching English in every corner of the globe. When he is not scrawling stories on the page, Alex can be found engaging in a vast array of delightfully nerdy pastimes and traveling in search of new inspiration for his writing.\nWho is the musician Pam Shaffer?\nA pocket Beethoven, Pam is the fae-touched songstress-skald whose briny brain stands at the helm of Metalalia. Los Angeles native Pam comes to the project hot off the success of her 2013 album, It Is Happening Again, with her band The Witching Hour. Her music video Remember This and an action-packed UK tour round out her recent accomplishments. After managing two successful crowd-sourcing campaigns for her burgeoning music brand, Pam has shouldered the responsibility for this, the most ambitious project she has ever led.\nWho is the app developer Adam Schwem? \nA technology wizard of the highest order, Adam was crafting apps before apps were a thing. He currently helms Learnovate Labs in Austin, where he wrangles app developers and consumes breakfast tacos. Prior to his current adventures, Adam worked in San Francisco for years on a few little apps you might have heard of, including Shazam and Music ID, and crafted the first video streaming app store with nVidia and Verizon.\nOur talented artists\nAmy Faigin - UI design and The Hair Woven Rope - With brilliant character design and limitless talent, Amy was the natural choice to design our interface and provide art for our first story, The Hair Woven Rope. When she is not crafting art for Metalalia, she can be found masterminding her upcoming webcomic, Chronograph.\nMicah Nelson - The Wind Up Boy - It's hard to get more talented and humble than Micah. A visual artist who just so happens to be a rock star, Micah can be found crafting gorgeous images for all sorts of projects and leading his band Insects Vs. Robots through their madcap gnome rock adventures.\nMary Delioussina - The River Girl - A prominent artist on the independent scene in LA, Mary's fanciful yet precise style gives The River Girl its sense of eerie solemnity. She is a prolific artist with countless illustrations and zines to her credit.\nMishkin Fitzgerald - Co-composer on The Wind Up Boy - The charismatic lead singer and keyboard player of Brighton favorites Birdeatsbaby joins us in scoring the music for The Wind Up Boy. Her musical gifts include haunting melodies and epic rocking out.\nAs support for this project grows, we hope to be able to expand our creative team. We are already in negotiations with new artists, writers and musicians in order for them to contribute their talents to Metalalia. Every contributor will be recompensed for their work, so the more pledges we receive, the more stories we can bring to life!\nWhere's the money going?\nGood question! The $9000 we're asking for will cover our expenses and pay the people doing the up-front heavy lifting.\napp development - Adam, our developer, needs to be compensated for his time\nweb design - Matt, our web designer, also needs to be paid for the great job he did on the website\nsound mixing - our sound engineers require recompense for the time they spent mastering our music and narration\nweb hosting & server space - the stories will need to be hosted once we upload them\nApple app developer fee - Metalalia has to pay to register as an app developer before they will let us upload \nKickstarter/Amazon - both Kickstarter, hosting, and Amazon, handling payments, will take a small cut of the money pledged\nA cornerstone of Metalalia's ethos is that artists and musicians perform a highly skilled job that they deserve to be paid for. This is why, once the stories are ready for purchase, we will pay our artists and guest musicians for their contributions with the proceeds from each sale.\nThank you so much for being a part of Metalalia!

Swartz, a freelance artist and illustrator. My style of artwork is typified by dream-like, faintly creepy and macabre fantasy wildlife. I am a mostly self-taught artist, and I'm inspired by cartoons, video games, scientific illustration, and tattoo work. You can view more of my work at skullgarden.net.\nThe Wooden Tarot has completely consumed my life.  To this day, I still get emails, messages, and comments at shows about the deck and expanding it into a full, complete tarot deck. I flat out refused at first, since working on the major arcana was such a tremendous and exhausting experience. I originally created the deck to reinterpret the imagery to fit my aesthetic; I never intended for it to be used as a real deck would be. Over the past year, I've seen countless comments and posts from enthusiastic Kickstarter backers and buyers and their experiences with the deck and began to see it as not just an illustration project, but a real deck that definitely was incomplete. \nFor this project, I will be expanding The Wooden Tarot into a full 78 card deck. I will be adding the 56 Minor Arcana cards. I will again be borrowing from the imagery and mysticism of the most popular Rider-Waite-Smith deck, while injecting my own cast of weird creatures and props as the subjects of each card. I want the deck to have the same level of mysticism as traditional decks, but with a more natural feel that is distinctly different from every other tarot. The cards will again be illustrated on 6x8\" birch wood panels, in a mixed media of graphite, colored pencil, and acrylic paint.\ncard comparisons\nThis full 78 card deck will be printed at standard 2.75 x 4.75\" tarot card size, packaged in a custom playing card tuck box. The full deck will differ from the limited edition Major Arcana deck in that it will be smaller, with full bleed cards, and it will NOT be limited edition like the original deck. You can read more about the limited edition Major Arcana deck here.\nThe vast majority of the costs are for the printing of 1000 decks- the rest of the funds will be used for wooden panels for completing the remaining card illustrations, shipping supplies, and various other supplies.\nHow Kickstarter works\nKickstarter is an all or nothing funding platform for potential projects. Meaning, if I do not reach my $11,000 funding goal, then the project does not come to fruition and no money is lost from the backers. If I do reach my goal, then the project proceeds and is completed by me!\nTHE MAJOR ARCANA\n THE MINOR ARCANA\nPlumes (Swords/Air)\nPlumes Court\nBlooms (Cups/Water)\nBlooms Court\nBones (Pentacles/Earth)\nBones Court\nStones (Wands/Fire)\nStones Court\nTHE FOOL 2.75 x 4.75\" card mockup\n Stretch Goals are a fun way to keep the project fresh and exciting if The Wooden Tarot exceeds its initial goal before the funding period is over. If we reach $12,000 in funding before the Kickstarter campaign has ended, I will add a 4x6\" Happy Squirrel postcard to every reward that requires shipping! \nHappy Squirrel\n22x22\" screen printed tarot spread cloth to be added at $20,000\n Blog- Backers who pledge $1 will receive access to the password protected blog. I will be documenting my progress with text updates as well as photos on the password protected blog woodentarot.tumblr.com. All backers will receive the password for this blog! \nThree Card Draw- Backers who pledge $5 will receive three RANDOM cards from the Major Arcana. The cards are 4x6\" with rounded edges, and ship flat in a small rigid mailer.\n7x10\" Prints- Backers who pledge $15 will receive a 7x10\" print (on 8.5x11\" paper) of any card of your choice. You will be able to choose which card you would like as a print on your rewards survey. Prints will ship flat in a large rigid mailer.\n10x14\" Large Prints- Backers who pledge $20 will receive a 10.5x14\" large scale print (on 11x17\" paper) of any card of your choice. Prints will ship rolled in a cardboard tube\nTuck box mock-up\nThe Tarot Deck- Backers who pledge $30 will receive one copy of the full Wooden Tarot deck. The decks will be signed by me and shipped in a poly bubble mailer. You may also pledge $45 to receive TWO copies of The Wooden Tarot, or $70 for THREE copies.\nThe Limited Edition Deck + The Full Deck- Backers who pledge $40 will receive BOTH versions of The Wooden Tarot. The limited edition Major Arcana deck has 27 cards, is 4x6\" in size, limited to 1000, and signed and numbered by me. This deck is VERY limited and collectible now, so I will only have a few to offer for this Kickstarter campaign. Decks will be shipped in a corrugated cardboard box packed with recycled material.\nSketch- Backers who pledge $50 will receive an original sketch used in the making of the Minor Arcana portion of the deck, along with the full Wooden Tarot deck. This sketch will be the exact sketch that I use for transferring line art onto the wood panel for painting, and will be selected randomly. The sketch will be 6x8\" in size, on cream colored parchment paper, matted to 8x10\" with a foam board backing and clear plastic sleeve. The print and deck will ship in a corrugated cardboard box packed with recycled material.\nOriginal Card Art- Backers who pledge $100 will receive one of the original pieces of art used for the COURT CARDS (example: Ace of Bone, Knight of Plume, etc) in Minor Arcana portion of the deck (sorry, all of the major arcana art has already been sold), as well as the full Wooden Tarot deck. Artwork will be selected randomly. The original artwork will be on 6x8\" cradled wood panel, with each panel being 1\" deep. The art and deck will ship in a corrugated cardboard box packed with recycled material.\nBackers who pledge $80 will receive one of the original pieces of art used for the NUMBERED CARDS (example: Two of Bloom, Eight of Bone) in the Minor Arcana portion of the deck, as well as the full Wooden Tarot Deck. Artwork will be selected randomly.\nCUSTOM 6x8\" Tarot Inspired Art- Backers who pledge $200 will receive a 6x8\" custom, tarot imagery inspired mixed media painting from me, as well as one copy of the full Wooden Tarot deck. I will work from your ideas to first produce a few sketches for you to choose from (or change). Once a finalized sketch is approved, I will complete the piece, send more photos for your approval, then finally ship the piece to you. Custom artwork will be completed after the art for the deck is finished. The custom artwork and deck will ship in a corrugated cardboard box with recycled packing material.\nCUSTOM 36x48\" Tarot Inspired Art- The ultimate pledge. A special backer who pledges $5000 will receive a custom, 3x4 foot mixed media painting completed to their specifications. After your art is completed, I will travel to you and hand it to you in person. Continental US only.\nHaving run two successful Kickstarter campaigns in the past, I have run into a few snags that delayed the shipment of rewards to some backers. Here are some tips to help you receive your rewards in a smooth, timely manner.\nThe email you have listed on Kickstarter MUST be a valid email that you check frequently. The longer it takes you to respond to your survey once funding has ended, the longer it takes for you to receive your reward. Please respond as quickly as possible. This is particularly important for backers pledging for custom artwork. \nI will copy and paste your address exactly as you write it in your survey, so your address must be correctly spelled and laid out. If your rewards are returned to me due to a bad address, I will contact you and you must repay for shipping. If your address changes after you have filled out your survey but before your rewards have shipped, please send me a message and I will update your address.\n I cannot ship to international P.O. Boxes. Please provide a physical address or ask a friend or relative if they will allow you to have your rewards shipped to their home.\n Please make sure that your credit card information is up to date on Amazon.com. If it is not up to date, then your pledge will be declined once funding has ended and you will be dropped as a backer. (Though if this happens accidentally, you can contact me and I can provide alternate payment options)\nI am not responsible for customs fees for international orders. The shipping will be covered, but sometimes international orders require extras fees which must be paid by the backer, especially for items of higher value. Backers must pay any potential customs fees that may occur. \n Thank you for taking the time to review my project! I need your help more than ever to finally and officially complete The Wooden Tarot deck. Thank you all for your continued support and enthusiasm.

My goal is to have the decks in backers' hands by the winter holidays.... which means I am going to have to pull out all of the stops to make it happen. I feel confident in my ability, however, and consider this a challenge rather than something negative.

I decided to research Industrial Origami, and over the course of 50 hours I designed, cut, and built a wearable 15-ft long velociraptor out of cardboard. I took him to a costume ball, and when I tromped into the room, literally everyone stopped to stare. He was the star of the evening, and everyone wanted one. I knew I had to do something. To learn more, visit www.kit-rex.com.\nWhen I made my giant velociraptor, I had no idea that other people would want one too. But most people don't have room for a 15ft long monster clambering around in their kitchen (Jurassic Park, anyone?), so I thought I would try for something smaller.  Armed with that knowledge and my passion for folding paper, I began developing something I call the KitRex- the miniature version of the giant dinosaur.\nMegan, 9, one of the many 'testers'\nI have spent the past few months prototyping and testing the mini velociraptor kits with kids ranging from age 8 to 12 (including a whole girl scout troop). Many lessons have been learned and an equally large number of changes have been made. Here are what the kids who tried it out had to say:\n\"I love it, it really makes you think\"    -Lelani, age 11\n\"It's challenging, but I like it, it's like a puzzle\" - Megan, age 9\n\"It's really neat how things you don't expect to turn into body parts do\" - Stephen, age 10\n\"I like it because it's 3d, you play with it, make videos with it, and it's colorful\"   -Alascia, age 8\n\"It's a toy you need to think about\"     -Bridget, age 10\nLisa, at 5 years old, visiting the dinosaurs\nWhy Dinosaurs? Because everyone loves dinosaurs.

I'm the designer of the ORNATE Series of Playing Cards. I also designed the first HOPC Deck on Kickstarter - the IMPERIAL Deck.\nI've been an avid user of Kickstarter for over 2 years now. During that time I have Backed more than 60 different projects, as you can see in the Backer History from my personal Kickstarter account.\n The ORNATES are some of the most unique Decks in the world of modern Playing Cards. They are highlighted by beautiful fans, elaborate details throughout and detailed borders on the Back and Front of every Card. THIS PROJECT WILL BE THE FINALE FOR THE ORNATES.\nTHE OBSIDIANS ARE UNLOCKED!\n LIMITED BICYCLE SET:\nEach Deck in the Limited Bicycle Set shares a connective design that follows the curve of the Bicycle logo and forms a sine when all four are placed side-by-side. We have 1,000 Sets of Bicycle White ORNATES available within 675 different Pledge spots. Once these spots are filled, they are sold out. The Bicycle Sets are NOT available as an Add-On item and are only available as a complete set of four.\nUNBRANDED SET:\nThe Unbranded Set integrates the ORNATE Logos from the original Custom Brick Boxes to create a look that ties them to the originals, but gives them a unique vibe of their own. They each have a connective design that is colorful and tasteful. Any of the Unbranded Decks are available separately, in their matching pairs or in sets. They are also included in most of the Brick Box Pledge Tiers. Brick Box A (3 Unbranded Sets) is the only Brick Box that is available as an Add-On item.\nTHE FACE CARDS:\nThe White ORNATE Face Cards have had a facelift and a lot of subtle redesigns throughout. To keep them consistent with the originals, the Sapphire and Scarlet Decks share Face Card designs (Blue/Gold for the Clubs & Spades - Red/Silver for the Hearts & Diamonds). The Amethyst and Emerald Faces are Green/Gold for the Clubs & Spades and Purple/Silver for the Hearts & Diamonds. All of the Face Cards have new two-tone PIPS and utilize a new PIP layout in the Number Cards.\nCUSTOM BRICK BOX:\nThe unique Brick Box for the White ORNATES is setup to fit four Decks wide, opposed to the usual three. The retractable display header has a custom Diecut around the shape of the ORNATE Logo. Each Brick Box will be hand-signed by myself and contain three full sets of White ORNATES (12 Decks in total). We have many Pledge Rewards that contain various combinations of Unbranded and Limited Bicycle Sets.\n ORNATE 2\" COINS:\nThe ORNATE Coins will measure 2\" in Diameter and be manufactured by the same company that produced our Imperial Coin. The Antique Gold Finish Coin will have Blue Enamel on the Sapphire side and Green Enamel on the Emerald side. The Antique Silver Finish Coin will have Red Enamel with the Scarlet side and Purple Enamel with the Amethyst side. The Obsidian Coin will be made from a Black Nickel material and will have Dark Grey and Gold Enamel design elements. The above images are conceptual mockups. The finished Coins should look sweet! The Coins are only available as Add-Ons \u2014 $16 ($18 INT.) for a single Coin, or $30 ($34 INT.) for the any TWO, or $45 ($50 INT.) for all THREE.\n UNCUT SHEETS:\nAll four unique Cards are available in an Uncut Sheet. These are great for display purposes. The detailed color borders give the ORNATE Uncuts a truly unique look over most other Uncuts. The Uncut Sheets are only available as Add-Ons \u2014 $40 ($50 INT.) each, or $125 ($135 INT.) for a set of all four.

No bottleneck waiting for the designs to be completed!\n\nFor delivery, I have teamed up with House of Playing Cards, the producers and distributors of my original ORNATE and Imperial playing cards.

For more information about getting your card project or Kickstarter fulfilled by Kings Wild Fulfillment visit their website.\nwww.kingswildfulfilment.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA playing card project is a big task. There are so many elements that have to work together in order for a playing card project to function smoothly and result in decks of cards in the hands of satisfied backers.\n\n\"The Independence\" will be my 4th playing card project on Kickstarter. I have learned so much from my past Kickstarters, including some valuable lessons about what TO do, and what NOT to do.\n\nBelow are the three biggest hurdles with any playing card project, and how I plan to overcome them:\n\n1. Keep your rewards & add on system simple and easy to understand.\n\nAs I did with both my Federal 52 Part II & Sherlock Holmes projects I have given the pledge tiers Alphanumeric labels to help you understand what you are pledging for. Beside every pledge tier there is a letter/number key that you can match up with a graphic that will give you a visual representation of what is included in that pledge tier.\n\n2. Keep International Shipping transparent and easy to understand. \n\nI have received my share of bumps and bruises in the past trying to figure out the most transparent and understandable method of communicating to international backers how much to add for Int. shipping. Int. Shipping is expensive, there is no way around it. I ship all of my decks using the USPS. It is not my intention to try and profit from international shipping I'm only trying not to go broke from it. I am totally transparent with shipping costs and have included an average breakdown of how much international shipping costs both you and me. Since all the information is out on the table, you can be a well-informed backer.\n\n3. Fulfillment is by far the most difficult process of any playing card project.\n\nWith my first Federal 52 Project I got my hands calloused by tackling the fulfillment of 3000 orders by myself. With my second project, Federal 52 Part II, I ventured out and gave a fulfillment company a shot at taking on the challenge. I have learned that shipping playing cards is an art form in of itself. It is VERY important to me that that the same amount of care and detail is given to the packing and shipping of my playing cards as is going into the design. Because of this fact I have recently formed a company that specializes in nothing but shipping playing cards and add-ons for playing card projects. My fulfillment company is called Kings Wild Fulfillment. It has a full-time staff that is dedicated to handling, packing and shipping your rewards with a level of excellence that you expect from anything with the Kings Wild logo on it.\n\nAt this very moment Kings Wild Fulfillment is fulfilling 1500 orders for my previous card project, The Sherlock Holmes playing card project.\n\nYou may notice that my international shipping costs are a little higher than my previous projects. One thing that I am doing differently on this project is eliminating bubble wrapped envelopes for both domestic and international rewards. ALL rewards, whether you order 1 deck or 500 will arrive in a corrugated cardboard box. I will be using a variety of boxes from ULINE industructo boxes to USPS Priority flat rate boxes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "6 Days Left, Federal 52 2nd Edition", "update_content": "Hey, everybody!

Desire of keeping beautiful empty glass bottles to make a second use of them made us start working on this idea. To begin with, we did some research and found out that bottles can be cut. As this idea caught our eyes, we started to experiment with it. Lots of damaged bottles and different prototypes were made until we got to the point, where we had a useful bottle cutting tool. After showing it around and giving to some people handmade gifts, made from old bottles, we were ensured by others that this could be something more than just a home project for ourselves. We did some improvements on the technical and visual side and now the C&C Bottle Cutter is ready to meet the crowd. To make it as successful as possible,  we are asking your help and support to start manufacturing. We are really excited to share it with you here, on Kickstarter.\nC&C is a glass bottle cutter, which is designed to cut any diameter bottle super easy, fast and precisely at home.\nWith C&C you can create glasses, vases, candlesticks, lamp pendants, ashtrays and even aquariums.\nC&C is made from durable laser cut plywood. Precision of laser cutting guarantees the strength to all connections of plywood parts. After laser cutting, parts get hand sanded or stained brown. Both options provide a beautiful finish. Then assembled together with a custom made cutter and screws. \nOur first prototype was made only for one reason - to ensure that the glass bottles could be cut. Actually, it worked way better than it looks - even with non-adjustable cutter blade position, we were able to cut bottles. \nOf course, in the beginning there were many failures, so we decided to create another design - with adjustable cutter blade positions. Our second prototype already was drawn on SolidWorks and plywood parts were laser cut. It was way better in the sense of cutting, but still with some flaws. The design was not as good, as we expected it to be, so we set up a new goal - the bottle cutter not only should cut perfectly, but also should be a perfect bottle holder. We made completely new aesthetic design and improved technical performance. After some last corrections we are finally ready for production.\nThere have been bottle cutters out in the market before, so why should anyone need exactly C&C? This was the main question that we asked for ourselves, when creating our product. We did a research and found out that non of them is perfect. Our goal was to make it as handy and perfect as possible, so this is what we got:\nComparing with other bottle cutters, that can cut only standard diameter bottles, with C&C you can cut starting from very small diameter bottle necks up until  3L jars. In addition to that, you can adjust the cutter length and keep it for the next bottle, for example, to create sets of equal glasses.\nComparing with other bottle cutters with only one cutter blade, you won't need to worry about buying new ones for a long time.\nC&C does not only work perfectly, but it also looks great. Comparing with other bottle cutters, that can be used only for cutting, C&C works also as a beautiful wooden bottle stand. Different color variations are available.\nWith a single screw you can adjust the lenght of the cutter. You don\u2019t need to fit in the bottle somewhere, just put it on the C&C and it\u2019s ready to use. All step by step instructions how to use the C&C are added.\nWhat you should know is that the C&C does not actually cut the bottle. It creates a score line on the bottle at the exact place where you need it to be split. By adding boiling and ice cold water, a thermal shock is caused and the bottle is split.  \nIt takes only three steps to cut a bottle: \nTake a round bottle and simply put it on the C&C like it is shown on our campaign video and instruction. Adjust the cutter to the place where you want the bottle to be split. Make one full circle by slowly rotating the bottle and keeping it in place. Do not add too much force. You should hear the glass cutter scratching the line. The score line should be slightly seen and continuous.\n Slowly pour boiling water on the score line, then the ice cold water from the faucet. This action will cause the bottle to crack along the score line. Bottle may split at the first try, but it is possible that you might have to do it again, depending on the thickness of the glass. Better to add smaller amount of water many times than trying to do it with the first try and spoiling the glass. The water is supposed to get only on the score line and a bit around it. The rubber ring, included in the kit, helps to do that.\nAfter splitting the bottle there is a sharp edge on both halves. Finish the sharp glass edge by using sandpaper. There are three different grit size sandpapers included in the kit (60, 120, 180). You should start with 60 grit sandpaper, that will remove the sharp edge fast. For smoother result use 120 and 180 grit sandpaper. After using the 180 grit sandpaper the edge is perfectly smooth for simple use. If you still want it smoother, you can buy higher grit sandpaper in any local store.\nBy supporting us and using C&C, you are helping the environment. Extend the life of glass bottles by creating new accessories, lamps and many other things instead of throwing them out. Give a second chance to empty bottles and jars.\nIt all started just as an idea of making some random glasses from empty bottles. By experimenting with C&C our team created a lot more. Get inspired!\n\n \nAlso instructions and tips are included.\n\nYour pledge makes everything possible. 100% of the money raised will go towards the first production run of the C&C. Back our project and help us to meet minimum production requirements.\nYou can take a part in our project simply by sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest etc. It will mean a lot to us.

Each limited deck will be signed and numbered on the deck and on the back of the paper wrapper.\nA Brief History: Andrew Dougherty Playing Card Company 1848-1930.\nAndrew Dougherty was a hard working Irish immigrant that used his own savings to start a small printing house and playing card manufacturing company. Although his cards were rough at first, his persistence and hard work led to his company becoming one of the most influential manufacturers of his time. \n In 1872 he built a manufacturing plant located on Centre Street in New York, just a block away from the Brooklyn Bridge. With the new building Dougherty\u2019s innovation shined through as he changed the playing card industry. His playing cards from the Centre St. factory had double heads and featured rounded corners. Both of these breakthroughs were advertised on the back of his famous eagle wrappers. \n In 1876 Dougherty was awarded a U.S. Patent for his triplicate cards. The triplicate was a miniature card placed in the top left and bottom right corners. It was a revolution in the way cards could be held and viewed. The decorative ace of spades and the wrapper for the first No.18 Triplicate deck showed a fanned hand of cards with the triplicate miniature indices viewable on each card. The first deck of triplicate cards came with a best bower, which was later replaced by a joker. \nThe only competition that Dougherty faced with the triplicates was the Squeezers cards from the New York Consolidated Card Co. The patent that the NYCCC acquired for the Squeezers cards was for the modern indices that we see now on all playing cards. \nDougherty printed his triplicates until 1883 when he was issued another patent for his Indicator cards. Like the squeezers, the Indicators featured a number and letter indices printed outside the border. \nAndrew Dougherty passed away at the age of 78 in 1905. His sons ran his business for 2 years following his death and then sold the company to the United States Playing Card Company in 1907. The United States Playing Card Co. continued to run the A. Dougherty manufacturing company until 1930 when they merged it with the New York Consolidated Card Company, relabeling it the Consolidated-Dougherty Card Co. Inc. They ran Consolidated-Dougherty as a division of USPCC until 1962 when they retired the label, bringing all labels and decks under the USPCC umbrella. The most famous A. Dougherty deck Tally-Ho is still available today. \nFree to all backers over $20 when we reach 800 backers\n2\" Cover coin add on released at $16,000.00\n2nd Edition Box for the No.18 Triplicate Deck\nAVATARS:\nCopy and paste any of these avatars to show your Triplicate Pride!\nAvatar 1\nAvatar 2\nAvatar 3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a collaborative effort with the United States Playing Card Company so printing will obviously be done by USPCC.

I wanted something that felt simple yet lush, clean but purposeful. When I couldn't find it, I decided to create it. This is The Minimalist Deck.\nAs a designer, recreating something as classic and timeless as a deck of Bicycle playing cards is both an incredible challenge and extremely rewarding. I pondered multiple combinations of fonts and glyphs before ultimately deciding on this combination. Then I changed my mind. \nI went back and forth, switching between serif and sans-serif fonts, before finally giving in and designing not just this deck, but four decks of cards to make up The Minimalist Collection.

There are only 50 of these, and they'll be hand-signed and numbered. This is probably the one my mom will buy.\n$75 gets you six decks of cards. They make cool gifts for your friends.\n$100 gets the art print of the Minimalist Deck, seen below. This measures 40\" x 21\" and all cards are printed to scale. These will only be printed for this run on Kickstarter, and never again. These will be signed and numbered, and a limited run of 25. You'll also get one deck to accompany the print.\n$150 gets you a brick of cards (in layman's terms, this is 12 decks).\n$500 puts your name on one of the gaff cards. There is only room for five names. You'll also get 12 decks. \nWhere the Money Goes\nThe pledges from this project go towards printing and creating this one-of-a-kind deck of cards.

About 4 months ago, my wife and I, with our two kid moved in with my in-laws to start up my own Freelance Design company called Fluent, Inc. Since then, I've been looking for a great personal project.\nThe Hipster Playing Cards -Limited Edition\nWill only be printed for Kickstarter Backers and will come with Hipster Quotes.\nA mock up of the Tuck box\nNEW! The Hipster Bicycle Playing Cards-Bicycle Edition \nWill be printed unlimited and will not come with Hipster Quotes.\nA mock up of the Bicycle brand Tuck Box\nThe Inspiration\nWhere did the Hipster Deck come from?\nThe evolution of the Hipster deck was really a family process. As I mentioned in the video I was directed to Kickstarter I wanted to find a great project that would give me the chance to design something different than the usual products and logos I work on. My wife has a pretty good feel for things that are creative/new and came up with the idea to design a deck about hipsters. (My Three year old approved and showed her support by running around the house wearing plaid, and thick 3D glasses with the lenses knocked out.)\nMy Little Hipster-This is my daughter being herself\nAt first the deck was about the strong visuals that come to mind with hipsters; Buddy Holly rimmed glasses, epic mustaches, flannel shirts, bicycles\u2026 but the deck didn\u2019t really come together until I thought about adding quotes to each card. It was the quotes that solidify the project in my mind as they helped capture the spirit of irony, wit, and deep thinking that typify the hipster culture.\nAs I spent time researching the look and feel of hipsters on Tumblr and Pinterest I found that there are different segments within the hipster trend, some that are apathetic and a tad angsty, but there is a good chunk of hipsters that really want to engage our world and it\u2019s woes to make a mark. It\u2019s the latter group that I hope to immortalize in this deck. The can do-ers that have a healthy sense of who they are and the humor in their own contradictions. \nWhen it comes down to it this deck was just fun to put together. I spent a lot of time laughing and seeing the delightful, and sometimes not so subtle, influences that hipsters have on all areas of pop culture. I hope that this deck will bring people together to not only play all types of games, but will get them talking and enjoying a deeper level of being together. (And by the way, my wife asked to waive her royalties in exchange for a LARGE Starbucks gift card\u2026 yep, we\u2019re going to need a lot of backing to fund that one - so thanks in advance!)\nThe Hipster Playing Cards - Limited Edition Artwork\nA mock up of the Limited Edition Backs\nA mock up of the Spade suit-With Quotes\n The Hipster Playing Cards - Bicycle Edition Artwork\nA mock up of the Bicycle brand Card Backs\nA mock up of the King of Spades-Without quotes\nA mock up of the Ace of Spades-Without quotes\nA mock up of the 10 of Spades-Without Quotes\nThe Goal\nMy goal is to deliver the best possible deck of playing cards to my backers.

That's the question I began to explore in depth many months ago.  One that put me on a journey to research and design a deck of cards inspired by beautiful historic art.\nPlaying cards have evolved over many hundreds of years, with the echoes of the pattern we know today forming around the 15th century in Rouen, France.  A design emerged that was adopted and copied in England, and then spread across the globe.\nI've worked with card historians, museums and archives in my search for this original art.  My reference material includes pieces from the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, British Museum, Archives Department of Seine-Maritime, and Fitzwilliam Museum of Cambridge. \nI'm passionate about the quality of the Origins. The goal for this campaign, with your support: to produce one of the highest quality decks made by the USPCC.  The embossing, hot stamped gold foil, Bee cards, and tuck stock are expensive but I've worked to keep pledge costs down.  A special deck to own, play, or gift.\nIt would really be an honour to have your support in making the Origins a reality.\nYou can also read a little more about myself and the project at Kardify here. And at Max Playing Cards here.\nView an archive of the cards and their inspiration -here-\nBonus with every pledge!\nAs a sincere thank you, all pledges will receive a postcard displaying an historic original by Valery Faucil, late 15th century, on one side and the Origins compliment on the reverse.

From the colourful pictorial cards of the 18th Century and the cards carried across Europe by the travelling fortune tellers.  \nOur cards look colourful and intriguing. The design of the cards reflects the strange fortune telling cabinets that lurk in the shadows of old amusement arcades, the vivid picture cards we collected as kids and the graphic style of 'Silver Age Comics'. Our cards look vibrant and entertaining, but also hint at a deeper meaning beneath the surface.\nWho are these cards aimed at?  \nThe Card Collector. It is unlikely that you will have such a striking, original and unique deck of cards in your collection yet. Put the Kadar deck out on a table with a few other decks and see which one draws the eye.  \nThe Magician. As these are a full set of poker cards on the best Bicycle stock, you can use them to perform standard card magic. In addition, we show you how you can take your magic to the next level; investing a simple trick with meaning and a personal connection to your audience. \nThe Social Animal. Our cards are aimed at simply making you the most interesting person in any group with something that will draw the eye and everyone's attention. We guarantee it! Also if you put a dime in the cabinets, the cards do something strange and mysterious; something that will draw a crowd of interested onlookers. \nWe'd love it if you chose to back our Kickstarter project.

Assuming we're still here, though...\nNorse mythology has long had a place in Western popular culture. From comic books to major motion pictures featuring gods such as Thor, Odin, Frigga, Sif and of course Loki from this deck. A quick search for \"Norse mythology in popular culture\" gets you to the Wikipedia entry for a big list of Viking characters in movies, manga and literature.\nThe star of the deck, Odin, is the main god of the \u00c6sir, the pantheon of Norse gods. He exchanged an eye to be able to drink from the Well of Wisdom and was the god of battle, poetry, magic, and perhaps not surprisingly, wisdom. Two of his sons, Thor and Balder, are the King of Clubs and Hearts, respectively. The King of Diamonds is Njord, a member of the Vanir race, with whom the \u00c6sir were at war. When they were negotiating a peace treaty, Njord was selected to join the \u00c6sir in what amounted to a hostage exchange. The Queens of each suit are wives of that suit's King and all but one of the Jacks are sons of that suit's King. Since two of Odin's sons are Kings themselves, the Jack of Spades is represented by Odin's trusted ravens Hugin and Munin (Thought and Memory).\nDeciding which gods to include in the deck involved studying works on Viking mythology and giving concepts and original research to my design partner to use in producing what I hope are interesting and desirable cards for the Kickstarter and collector communities!\nThe Suits\nFor each suit I chose the following color combinations for the court cards costumes based on their meanings in Norse mythology:\nSpades- Black and Silver: Black is potential, the basis for all and the knowledge of hidden things. Silver expresses change and the quest for knowledge. The Spades court are powerful, wise and in pursuit of knowledge.\nHearts- Red and White: Red embodies magical and protective powers as well as vigor and aggression. A sign of death. White represents purity, perfection and nobility. The Hearts court are driven by justice, emotion and piety.\nDiamonds- Red and Yellow: In addition to Red, Yellow connotes earthly power, desire and lust. The Diamonds court are associated with their power over material wealth.\nClubs- Black and Green: In addition to Black, Green deals with Earth, nature and fertility. While the Queen was the protector of homes, her husband the King and their son the Jack are Gods of War.\nHere are the suit markers created for this deck:\nAfter the research, sketching and final coloring were complete, here are the court cards and a short description for each one...\nOdin, the King of Spades- Odin is the \u00c6sir's supreme deity, holding his spear Gungnir. For Odin, wine was both food and drink. This card was inspired by a work you can find at http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Odin,_der_G\u00f6ttervater.jpg\nFrigga, the Queen of Spades- Frigga, chief of the Norse goddesses. She was Odin's wife and mother of Balder, the King of Hearts. The inspiration for this work was found at http://emg-zine.com/item.php?id=787 I tested this link at about 9:30 EST January 14 and got an SQL error. I posted the image in Update #2.\nHugin and Munin, the Jack of Spades- Hugin and Munin (Thought and Memory) were Odin's Ravens, often shown perched on Odin's shoulder.They flew throughout the universe each day and told Odin what they had seen. The King of Spades' image has his crows around his throne, which prompted this image.\nBalder, the King of Hearts- Balder was the god of innocence and piety, pure to the point that light literally shined from him. His wife was Nanna, the Queen of Hearts. You can see the inspiration in the project video and at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Each_arrow_overshot_his_head_by_Elmer_Boyd_Smith.jpg\nNanna, the Queen of Hearts- Nanna was Balder's wife and the mother of Forseti, the Jack of Hearts. Nanna's heart was fatally broken when she saw Balder had died and was laid upon the funeral pyre beside her husband. A statue from 1857 that prompted this work may be found at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Nanna_%281857%29_by_H._W._Bissen.jpg\nForseti, the Jack of Hearts- The Norse god of justice and conciliation; he always found a resolution to disputes. The loose inspiration for this image is at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Forseti_zu_Gericht_sitzend.jpg\nNjord, the King of Diamonds- Njord commanded the winds, seas and fire, and gave supplicants wealth at sea and in \"the chase.\" He comes from http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Nj%C3%B6rd%27s_desire_of_the_Sea.jpg\nSkade, the Queen of Diamonds- A Giantess, she joined the \u00c6sir and chose Njord as her husband from among several men of whom she could only see their feet! She was given that opportunity as compensation for her father's murder. This card comes from the original which may be found at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Skade_by_Saltza.jpg\nFrey, the Jack of Diamonds- Stronger and more valorous than his father, Njord, Frey governed weather and agriculture and thus had prosperity, joy and peace under his control. Check out Frey's inspiration at http://emg-zine.com/item.php?id=787. As with Frigga, the Queen of Spades, I received an SQL error when I visited the site the morning of January 14. I posted the image in Update #2.\nThor, the King of Clubs- After Odin, Thor was the main \u00c6sir god.He guarded humans and their work from the Giants (forces of nature). He could make his hammer Mjollnir any size he wanted, throw it to strike his enemy, and have it return to his hand.The image consulted for this card may be found at http://emg-zine.com/item.php?id=787 I received the same SQL error as with the other emg-zine.com links and posted the image as part of Update #2.\nSif, the Queen of Clubs- Thor's wife, known for her beauty and golden hair created by Dwarves. Sif was seen as the protector of homes. This image comes from http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Sif_from_Swedish_Edda_translation.jpg\nModi, the Jack of Clubs- According to mythology.wikia.com/wiki/Modi, Modi was \"the god of battle wrath and served as the patrons for berserkers of Norse legends.The berserkers looked to him prior to battle so as to successfully go into the trance...during which they would kill all in their way, friend or foe.\" I didn't find any historic art for Modi, so I gave my design teammate an idea of him and he produced this very nice piece.\n\nLoki, the Joker- Known as \"The Trickster\" to many westerners, Loki was crafty and malicious and operated with two faces, ultimately the \u00c6sir's enemy. The \"two face\" concept is quite interesting and my brother Curt gave me a great idea I'm working through with my teammates. The loose inspiration for the mask comes from http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Processed_SAM_loki.jpg\nThe Card Back\nNorse and Norse-related art provided great inspiration for the card back. The circle in the centers of each half depicts Odin riding on his eight-legged horse Sleipnir, the fastest horse in the world. The design down the sides is a gravestone carving from Bibury, Gloucestershire, England found in Northvegr.org's posting of T.D. Kendrick's 1930 book A History of the Vikings.\nHere's a better look at the gravestone carving:\nIn keeping with the Viking theme, the red card back is the same shade of red as Denmark's national flag!\nThe Tuck Box\nThe man is Odin in his typical non-battle guise as an old man with a dusty blue cloak and spear. Odin's full image is available as an art card or print as an add-on. The original work on which Odin is based may be found at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Georg_von_Rosen_-_Oden_som_vandringsman%2C_1886_%28Odin%2C_the_Wanderer%29.jpg\n Numbered Cards\nHere are the Ace-Ten of each suit!\nStretch Goals\nWithdrawn!

Our goal, with the help of Kickstarter, is to get this classic playing card deck in art museum gift shops around the world! Printed by the USPPC, and branded by Bicycle on their classic air cushion finish, this beautifully designed playing card deck is bound to be a delight for art lovers everywhere.\nThis collection starts with the Mona Lisa tuck case in a deep sea green color theme. We are also offering 2500 limited edition numbered tuck cases. Plus stretch goals for up to 4 additional tuck case designs. limited to a print of only 1000 each.\nEach playing card deck will include all 54 ORIGINAL designs. The limited edition 2500 print deck will feature a red back card design.\nJohnny puts his own small spin on the artwork, sure to make the original artist smile. Look for the hidden pips in each of the court cards.\nIt has been a huge challenge for me to work on this project. I've always been greatly inspired by old paintings. The very base of development of my painting skills comes from painters that through centuries created such masterpieces I couldn't get enough looking at...and visually absorbing the themes, shapes, colors literally for hours. As a kid I used to open an art book and then I'd get stuck on just one page for a long time, watching the details, wondering if I'll ever be able to paint something like that.\nWell, long story short ;), playing cards design that you see here is truly an homage to all those creators that I sometimes envy for they've lived in a time without such many...technological distractions (internet, games, movies...) that sometimes make it hard(er) for a 21st century guy to focus on drawing and painting.\n It has been difficult to choose what paintings to re-create and take the person originally painted from the context of the author's theme and place him/her in another context, that of...playing cards. I didn't want to change much details and I needed the positions and expressions to fit the card placement and work as a mirrored picture, as a playing card should be...\n I also had to limit the painters to number 14 (12 courts + 2 jokers) so... I was very careful choosing the artists. Each of these presented in the deck is a very famous and significant artist, from different periods in time, a true master.\n\nAs you can see in the video, all work, all painting has been done digitally. The process is the same as traditional, the tool is brush,... color palette to choose from, blank canvas, on screen :)\n I'm very satisfied with the final result,...after countless hours of hard work but also a very enjoyable and exciting time spent in front of the screen I hope, with your help...we can all have this design, this...creative product, printed on paper and in our hands.. Thank you all for your support.. Johnny Whaam\n Johnny originally painted the Michelangelo David statue without the cloth, true to the original. Due to legal issues with USPPC they asked us to cover the privates.

The design has been color swapped, and modified to fit other themes, but overall the design has stayed the same. With keeping in the tradition of what makes the design great, we have worked with the USPCC to push what makes the rider back great and bring you a new design inspired by the original.

A pre-approval is ongoing already, but it\u00b4s a big company and they take their time.\nThey say 5-6 weeks for the production of the decks and the boxes, then the shipping to a US based distributor, then the job of the distributor to process the orders and finally the American Postal service will spread the decks all over the universe.\nThe t-shirts, the uncut sheets and the prints might arrive even before the estimated delivery date.

If you look closely at the queen of spades you will see \"queen\" not only written in several languages, but you will find a queen chess piece and even a Queen Elizabeth signature.\nI have been developing this deck for nearly 8 years.  I worked with several artists until about a year ago when I found Nike, an artist from Florida, who could finally bring what I have seen in my mind all these years to life.  For the last ten months we have worked closely together deciding what would go into each and every card.\nEvery dot, every swirl, every language, and every hidden item was placed where it was placed with thought and purpose.\n\nThe more you look at a card and the more you look for hidden elements, the more you will find - things like ambigrams and words sharing letters, like the \"T\" in one word making an \"X\" in another.\nThere are over 100 different languages and numeric systems represented in this deck, plus there is symbolism and imagery in each card as well (an ant on a queen, or a toy jack on a jack, or an 8 ball on an 8, and so on).  There are some really fun things in subjects ranging from science and math, to history and mythology.\nA Bit About Me\nI am a magician and the founder of www.TeachByMagic.com where we show educators how to use simple magic in the classroom to engage students and make learning more fun and more memorable.\n\nI have worked as a creative consultant for several companies and I love the creative process.  I even do workshops on creativity.\n\nI have been married for almost 12 years to my best friend in the world and although we have been trying for almost nine years, we have not yet had kids. \n\nSo with that extra time and money we have traveled the world.\n\nWe have been to Egypt, Italy, France, Denmark, England, Turkey, China, Brazil, Greece, Honduras, Scotland, Alaska, and Ireland. We have touched the pyramids, kissed the Blarney Stone, stood on the Great Wall, seen Stonehenge, and climbed Mayan ruins.\n\nI am fascinated with the mystique behind these landmarks and I have have been working on this Different Deck during it all - learning about cards and numbers in these different cultures. For example, while in China I noticed the elevators did not have 4th floors.  Sure enough, the number 4 is unlucky in Chinese so we never put Chinese characters on any of the 4s.  \nEnough About Me, Let's Talk About the Cards!\n\nThis project will create three decks of cards.  Two are Kickstarter exclusive Bicycle branded versions of the Different Deck (white and black) and they are both Kickstarter limited editions, only available to backers of this project Never to be reprinted.  I will not sell this version ever again or anywhere else but here, during THIS project.\nThe faces of the white cards will be exactly like the unlimited edition decks except they will be on white cards rather than the antique parchment style.  The back of the Bicycle Limited Edition Deck is a custom design done by the same artist, again chock-full of symbolism and hidden imagery.  (If you look closely you can see that the word \"bicycle\" is hidden in the deck several times - how many can you find?)\nThe faces of the black cards again are exactly like the unlimited edition decks except they will be charcoal colored rather than the antique parchment style.  The back is the same as the white Deck only black instead of red. \nThe unlimited edition of the Different Deck will have the classic old paper style to it and this is the deck I hope to get into a corner store.  This has always been a bucket list item for my life.  I have developed several products (and even have a patent on one!) that have been in magic shops and that has been fun to walk into a shop and see my product.  But I want to walk into a normal store and see something I made.  \n\nSo with your help, hopefully 2014 will be the year that dream comes true.  And I will keep you posted in the backer updates about my progress as I pitch the deck to all the different stores.  You will know when I make the trek to Bentonville to talk to the Wal-Mart buyers.  And the more backers this project has, the more likely I will have success on that journey.\n\nAlso, because this is the Different Deck there will be a few surprises along the way.  The biggest surprise will be the back design of the unlimited version.  That will be revealed when you crack open your reward for the first time. \n\nI have a non-Bicycle back design that I plan to use but, fully embracing the fact that this is the Different Deck and this is a community effort to bring it to life, I am opening up the back design to you.  If you have a design you would like to submit, please message me for details on that.\n\nIf we use your back design you will get a case (144) of decks so you can give one to all your friends after you take them to Walgreen's to show them you designed something they can buy at a store.\n\nHow cool is that?\n\nI will post updates here every few days but if you want to see a new card every day make sure to like my Something Facebook page:\nI promise this will make more sense when you see my next Kickstarter project!\nThe rewards are simple.  You can get the decks or, if you like, we also have a H.O.P.E. sticker, or decal.\nThe numbers on this die-cut sticker correspond to the letters on a telephone key pad for hope - 4673.

The Ocean Ambassadors seek to enhance ocean environmental education on a local and national scale by creating a documentary called \"Beneath the Sea - Explore to Restore\".  The documentary is intended to raise ocean awareness and create a stewardship that will help to restore the ocean for future generations.\nThe documentary will be distributed by Ocean Ambassadors to students in elementary schools along the coast of Maine in 2014.  While visiting the elementary schools to deliver the documentary the Ocean Ambassadors will explain the importance of collecting and recycling ocean debris.  They will work with the students to teach them how they can get involved and help restore the ocean.  As the students explore the ocean with us by watching the documentary they will learn how lost traps, when left to rot on the sea-floor pollute not only the ocean environment, but also the livelihoods of our fishing communities . \nWhen watching the documentary Elementary students will virtually dive with our Ocean Ambassador teams as they participate in near coastal open water dives accompanied by dive professionals, instructors and mentors who will locate and remove ghost gear (dead lobster traps and other ocean debris) in the shallow water.  In deeper waters the Ambassadors will use Remotely Operated Unmanned Submersibles to show the effect ghost gear has on the ocean environment and the benefits that come from removing this debris.\nEach year large numbers of traps are lost in the ocean.  As Ocean Ambassadors we feel our efforts and our documentary will support a healthy ocean environment and help restore resources that once thrived in the Gulf of Maine.

We will have to obtain permits and permission from state officials and fishermen who work in the zones we plan to explore. This process will be explained in the documentary in hopes to make future restoration projects more effective.\n\nIn preparation for the documentary we have already begun communicating with local fishermen to ask for their permission and help in removing the ghost gear from the water once it has been located and marked. By working together the fishermen have the opportunity to reclaim fishable gear that has been lost when it hung down beneath obstacles on the sea-floor or has cut off by unsuspecting boaters - and by removing trash traps they open up valuable fishing bottom for the future.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "OceansWide - Marine Explorers Club\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nOceansWide is a dedicated group of marine based students and professionals, remotely operated unmanned submersible pilots, fishermen...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project ends": "JANUARY 14, 2014"}, {"Project launches": "DECEMBER 13, 2013"}]}], "comment_no": 1, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/918175792/beneath-the-sea-explore-to-restore-documentary", "project_name": "\"Beneath the Sea - Explore to Restore\" Documentary"}}, {"backer": "Brain Vessel Creative", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The One Million Bicycle\u00ae is a deck like no other.

You'll find iconic images such as: la Marianne, le Coq, tricolor flags, wheat, and the national emblem of France held by statues of Hercules.\nIt also has a unique pair of the King / Queen of Diamonds portrayed by King Louis xvi and Queen Marie Antoinette without their crown and hair boat. It also contains two unique jokers: a sans-culotte holding a tricolor flag and a woman on her march to Versailles.\n-\nThe Reign Deck\nThe Reign deck is inspired by the events of the Reign of Terror (1793-1794). The guillotine is the main focus of the back design. Supporting elements include a woman drowning in water (representing the Drowning of Nantes) and a pair of hooded figures that can be found in 18th century tomb designs. All on a nice white background.\nThe most noticeable difference between this deck and the other two are all of the court cards. Every court card figure has been a victim of the guillotine and to reflect that, every court has had their heads cut off! Oh no! Also included in the white deck is a pair of unique jokers, which display the guillotine itself.\n-\nThe R\u00e9gime Deck\nThe R\u00e9gime deck's back design contains elements alluding to royalty and the Ancien R\u00e9gime. Royal ornaments and flourishes fill the borders, while symbols of Christianity and the Monarchy can be found throughout the rest of the design. If you look closely you can spot doves, fleur de lis, and the royal emblem held by a pair of angels.\nLike the R\u00e9volution deck, the R\u00e9gime deck contains two unique King / Queen of Diamonds cards. This time around they have their crown and hair boat on. Bling! Also, like the other two decks, there are two unique jokers. One of King Louis xvi looking regal with his fine self and a fumbling, stumbling, drunk! Someone should cut his head off...oh wait...\n-\nThe Aces\nEach of the Aces has their own enlarged pip.\nHearts - this pip is a graphic representation of the insignia of Vendean Royalists. History of the War of the Vend\u00e9e can be found here.\nDiamonds - a graphic version of the cross of the Order of the Holy Spirit.\nClubs - a really abstract and...you guessed it...graphic...version of the Tree of Liberty\nSpades - a spade created from the fleur de lis...with a little extra pizzazz!\n-\nThe Court\nThe King of Diamonds - Louis XVI of France\n-\nThe Queen of Diamonds - Marie Antoinette\n-\n The King of Clubs - Georges Danton\n-\n The Queen of Spades - Charlotte Corday\n-\nThe Queen of Hearts - A Martyr of Compi\u00e8gne\n-\n The Jack of Clubs - Maximilien de Robespierre\n-\nThe Jokers\nAdd On & Shipping Information\n-\n-\nSTRETCH GOALS\nComing Soon!\nI want to clear some things up with the USPCC before I list the stretch goals.

I made one prototype deck, started using it in my videos, and people couldn't stop asking to buy them! \nI made an indiegogo campaign for the Red Fontaines on Feb 15, 2013. Within 18 hours, we met our $10,000 goal. Before the end of the month, we made over $21k. The Red Fontaines sold out. I only have a few decks left for myself, and they are now selling for up to $60 EACH on eBay. Everyone, including myself, wanted more Fontaines.\nThe only place left to find Red Fontaines is on eBay - that's the price PER deck! Crazy!!\nBACK IN BLUE\nEver since the Red Fontaines were released, I've been asked CONSTANTLY by hundreds of people on the internet begging for a blue edition of Fontaines. The time has finally come. \nThe Blue Fontaines are available RIGHT NOW - with YOUR HELP! This time we are trying to printing 5,000 decks and we need $20,000 to do it up right.\nThe Deck\nFontaines started with just a back design. Now, every deck will come printed on classic bicycle stock with linen finish, perfect for cardists and magicians alike. \nThe Ace of Spaces is simple, streamlined and elegant, featuring the Fontaine box logo running through the center of the Spade. \nThe Jokers also sport the blue box logo with the fontaine F for pips. A Blank Faced card is included for magicians - to use in various effects. Seal? You mean the lint magnets and tuck box killers of the world? No seal, my friend. Not today. \nThe Box has a utility device for magicians built right into the design. My friend Michael Stern and I developed a concept called The Vintage Holdout that is a slight alteration you make to a card box that opens the doors to TONS of amazing tricks - the downside is it only works with these Vintage Series bicycle decks. Until now. I built the same method right into the box design. Learn it here.\nThe Perks!\nIn additional to decks on decks, we also have hoodies, shirts, bricks, uncut sheets and a personal favorite perk of mine, FONTAINE CARD CLIPS!! \nThe Brick\nTwelve Blue Fontaine Decks - sealed with a fontaine sticker.\nBlue Fontaine T-Shirt\nComes with one Blue Fontaine deck.\nEmbroidered Blue Fontaine Hoodie\nIt's a hoodie. It's got an embroidered Fontaine logo. Real comfy. Comes with one Blue Fontaine Deck.\nFontaine x Dan and Dave x Joe Porper Card Clip\nThese are beautiful, leather-wrapped Joe Porper Card Clips made by Dan and Dave Buck. It features the Fontaine logo engraved into the leather, and the Joe Porper and DnD logos on the inner spine. Comes with one Blue Fontaine Deck.\nUncut Sheet \n$19! DAT CRAZY PRICE THO! Add $25 for international shipping.\nImpossible Bottle - Made by Jamie D. Grant\nA sealed Blue Fontaine deck trapped inside an un-altered milk bottle. Handmade in Canada by Jamie D. Grant. Comes with one additional Blue Fontaine Deck.\nDeck Add-On Guide\nWant the Porper Card Clip but also more decks? Simply follow the add-on guide below - once you've added your total to your pledge, shoot me a message letting me know exactly what you want to add.\nExample: U.S. Backer wants to add 4 more Decks of Blue Fontaines to their current pledge. \n Current Pledge: $20 - 2 Decks of Blue Fontaines ADD: $39 (4 Decks) to current pledge for a total of $59.\nExample: International Backer wants to add 4 more Decks of Blue Fontaines to their current pledge. \n Current Pledge: $20 - 2 Decks of Blue Fontaines. ADD: $39 (4 Decks) + $18 (6 Decks Shipping total) to current pledge for a total of $77.\nThe Pricing\nEvery perk on the campaign includes free shipping within the USA, so if that $12 price tag on one deck scares you, realize that it's going to cost me anywhere from $3-5 to ship that one deck in an envelope to your doorstep. And also the price of the envelope. That's included if you live in the USA. \nIf you're thinking $12 bucks even with shipping is still a lot, I agree. The more decks you buy, the cheaper the price, so get your costco mentality and buy in bulk. Or don't. It's really up to you.\nThis is a fixed funding campaign, meaning if you purchase any of our perks and we don't reach our goal of $20,000 within 30 days - you will get your money back! :D\nInternational Shipping\nLast time I did a crowdfunding campaign, I charged $8 across all perks, and I lost about $3,000 in extra international shipping costs! It was a sad day. Some bricks cost me $75 to send!! So the international prices are averaged.

There has been so many great looking theme decks come to kickstarter in the past, many of them are like miniature art and will be highly sought after for there collectable value, and some are just a little to busy making playing somewhat difficult. My goal was to design a fresh and creative look at the standard deck of cards with the ease of a highly playable experience. At first glance they my appear to be just that \u201cstandard cards\u201d (other then the obvious, face's) but each court card has been changed in someway or another, some have major changes and others will be slightly harder to find the differences.\n All cards will have the Bicycle famous \u201cembossed finish\u201d for superior handling, on Bicycle grade paper.\n The Jokers I designed, I wanted them to fall in line with the court cards. Not to often will you find a female Joker in the deck, so I knew this would be a must for me to add one. Each of the Jokers are labeled with the star and circle for their identification.\n  The tucks, all are the same but different in someway or another, they are almost like a seek and find. I am still adding to the little details here and there, but the over all concept will remain the same. \n  Each of the tucks are labeled with one of the following Cambric, Linoid, Magic and Linen finish. Some my argue that they are still different but when I checked on the \u201clinoid finish\u201d in one of many emails, I was answered and I quote \u201cCorrect: linoid, cambric, linen, air-cushion, magic are all different ways to describe our embossed finish. Thanks! \u201c\nMany creators will design a limited tuck with the same cards and branding, I could have taken that route but wanted to take it one step beyond that. So for the first time ever on Kickstarter I am bringing the Tally-Ho and Bee brand into play. The two brands Tally-Ho and Bee will be released as a stretch goal. \nOnce the stretch goal for the Bee deck is reached, all cards in every brand will be upgraded to Bee stock paper. Just to clarify the difference in the paper I will quote from USPCC once again \u201cWe use the same paper stock for both our Bicycle and Bee Grade papers. Bee is just crushed to a very slightly thicker caliper.\u201d \nTally-Ho playing cards were first introduced in 1885 the same year as the Bicycle 808 \nThe first Bee playing cards were manufactured in 1892 and quickly become the top choice for casino use, and remain to be the favorite among all poker players\n During my last project I learned that some International Backers have to pay an import tax. To help out as much as I can, I will mark all custom forms as a gift and keep the total amount between $2 and $10 depending on the size of the package. \n I wanted to make the USPCC FACTS known, There is some misleading information out about the Paper and Finishes available. This information and more is given to creators when they contact USPCC about there project and can be found in \u201cCustom Order Form\u201d file. Along with the information from USPCC and endless emails I have spent time on the phone talking with there Business Development Manager going over different options about this project. Since this is the first project to offer cross branding by using the Bicycle, Tally-Ho and Bee brand I left no stones unturned when it came to questions.\nUSPCC is allowing me to split my minimum order between the unbranded and 3 branded decks, in return giving this project a realistic chance to succeed. As many of you know a minimum order from USPCC is 2500 decks, unless you use Bee grade paper. By using Bee paper the new minimum goes to 5000 decks.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter having one successful Kickstarter project, I have learned a great deal of some of the ins and outs, and have come aware of the fact that things don't always work out as planned.

Although there has been many variations of their back designs, one has remained the most influential, the \"rider back\". The design has been color swapped, and modified to fit other themes, but overall the design has stayed the same. With keeping in the tradition of what makes the design great, we have worked with the USPCC to push what makes the rider back great and bring you a new design inspired by the original. A design which keeps the integrity of what we are familiar with, yet something new to add to its LEGACY. BICYCLE LEGACY is a TRUE set of unique poker cards. This means both decks have identical faces with 2 back color variations. Hand drawn courts, aces, and joker cards add to the decks appeal while a simplistic layout keeps the deck familiar. This makes LEGACY a great deck for performers of magic and cardistry, while bringing something fresh to your weekend poker games.\n\u00ae2013 4PM DESIGNS\n\u00ae2013 4PM DESIGNS\nPrinted by the USPCC, with Bicycle\u00ae Branding \nConsisting of 56 cards, these decks are manufactured by the USPCC\u00ae with their world famous Bicycle\u00ae Brand and Stock.\nFEATURES:\n- BICYCLE Branding\n- Premium Bicycle Paper Stock\n- Magic Finish\n- Interior Tuck Box Coloring\n- 2 Gaff Cards\n- Custom Faces with Hand Drawn Courts, Aces and Jokers\n- QR Code Reveal\n- Barcode Reveal \n\u00ae2013 4PM DESIGNS\n\u00ae2013 4PM DESIGNS\n\u00ae2013 4PM DESIGNS\n\u00ae2013 4PM DESIGNS\n\u00ae2013 4PM DESIGNS\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny project on Kickstarter will bare the risks of the costs for the manufacturing of their products and shipping.

USPCC is saying up to 6 weeks after approval, so anticipating any delays, we're setting a deadline of 10 weeks after funding to get the cards out the door.\n\nShipping: We do not anticipate any issues since we'll be using the USPO unless the government shuts down again, in which case there might be slight delays, based on the last time this happened.\n\nArtwork & Design: As soon as we hit our minimum goal, we will finish all of the numbered cards and Aces. We will also ask anyone who earns the reward of having their likeness as a face card to submit pictures and consent to us with urgency. To anticipate any delays out of our control, we have a very strict 2-week window after the project closes for pledging, for anyone who wants their likeness to appear on a card to get us their pictures. Anyone who does not get us their pictures within that time-frame will forfeit their pledge and their chance to be featured on a card, and we will substitute another image in place of their likeness, to prevent delays.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Steampunk Cards in Aerospace Magazine, China", "update_content": "It's been a long time since this project ended, and it'll be a little while before we launch our next deck.
