Making waves and alerting the wrong people to their efforts nearly cost them their lives.\nThe case then took them to Austria to seek out the next piece to this chaotic puzzle of murder and mayhem they've found themselves wrapped up in.\nNOW...\nThe crime-solving couple is headed to Romania to discover what type of vile creature is murdering the townspeople.

He created their majordomo Pneuman.\nANNIE (Lady Anastasia Elizabeth Ravenscroft)\nAnnie is a forward thinker for her time. She's brazen and outspoken, yet classy and alluring.

It is 8-pages long, but that's just the comics part.  There's also a cover and a back cover and some other words my Dad told me to write on the inside so everyone knows I'm the one who made it.  \n5.5\" x 8.5\", 8-page, black and white, comic book +cover\nIn the story, there's this guy with a horn, his name is Honk, and he has some friends named Pig and G.  \"G\" stands for goat, but he doesn't exactly look like a goat.  And there's also a bully when they go to this school.  He's not very nice, but the story kind of shows what to do in a situation like that.\n\nI'm a 7-year-old boy and I'm good at Math and I like to draw.  It's nice to draw.  And also I'm a tall kid in my class.  My name is Owen.  \n\nWhy I'm sending this out is because it's not a good thing to be bullied.  You should stand up to that bully if they are bullying you or someone else.  If you see a bully bullying someone else, then you are a bystander and you should report the bullying, the same as if someone was bullying you.\n\n\nHonk and Freands - \"Jungle Gym\", full-color, limited-edition, 5.5\" x 8.5\", print.\nAuthor with Original Artwork (8.5\" x 11\", marker and crayon)\n\nMe and my dad are printing Honk comic books so we can send them out to people.  My dad has some experience making and giving comics to people.  He's a comic artist, he makes watches, and he even has some comics classes that he teaches.\n\nMy parents asked me how much money I would be happy with.  $20 sounds like a lot to me, so that's what my dad put as our goal.\n\nAfter we make the books, then we will send them out to people who would like the Honk comic.  My dad has this weigher thing just for mail, so we can weigh it and then we will know how much it costs to mail it.  Then we can just mail it to people who want it.  \n\nThis is the way we think our plan will happen:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHm...well, some risks and challenges that I might include are that the comic we send off to you in the mail might come a little bit late, because our mail service is a little behind these days because a lot of people don't want to go to the store. So, the mail people have a lot on their shoulders. Like me, I had to wait for a remote control stunt car that took 3 more days than what they told me. So when we mail the books it might take a little while. But to help that, me and my dad are saying, \"Maybe it'll take one or two weeks longer,\" just so we have enough time. He says this is a contingency. \n\nSomething else I wanted to say is that the entire comic book is already drawn, so you won't have to wait for me to finish that.\n\nAnother risk could be, you know, what if our printer doesn't have any printing-out stuff. But to make sure that doesn't happen, we have an extra load of that stuff that helps the printer print stuff out. \n\nMy dad is also helping me a lot by printing the comic and typing what I say here. My mom said she would help, too, but I don't know with what part. Maybe stapling the comics and packing them up. So, it's not just me working on this.

Read more about them here!\nKhajad  Laohua has no memory of her past, no explanation as to why she has magical powers or why she must hide her peculiar white demon wings from society. Her mother, Yunika, thinks it's best to avoid  answering any of Khajad's questions. For now, they must figure out a way to escape what is certain to become their icy graves at the Peak of the World. Together, they venture to find a place called \"home\" and a means of living a normal life.\nBut can their lives ever really be \"normal?\"\nSacrimony: A Tale of Love, Life and Death - In No Particular Order #1  is a 30 page standard comic book in full color. It features beautiful art,  a diverse cast of fully fleshed-out characters and colorful, unique fantasy world! Other rewards include stickers, enamel pins, magnets, prints and custom commissions.\nIf you're into character-driven stories dealing with complex relationships such as the Avatar series and Game of Thrones, then Sacrimony is perfect for you.\n(Recommended for mature readers on account of language and adult situations)\n\n\nHi there! I'm M Sorcier, the sole creator behind Sacrimony: A Tale of Love, Life and Death - In No Particular Order. I'm a self-taught artist and writer born and raised in New York and a first generation immigrant hailing from the teeny Caribbean island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. \nUnlike many other comic creators my age, I didn't spend my younger years hanging around my local comics shop and writing letters to Stan Lee with dreams of working for Marvel. I couldn't afford comics and all I really had was pencils, paper and an imagination that won't quit. I developed a passion for art and telling stories at a very early age, but I didn't know what to do with that passion or what my options even were.\nLife ended up taking over and while my peers were out studying art, writing their scripts, getting books published and running super successful Kickstarter campaigns, I was out working minimum wage retail jobs and dead-end internships, with no real direction in life, while still pursuing art and storytelling as just a thing I did to keep sane.\nSacrimony was an idea that I had in my head since my early teenage years but I didn't really start doing anything with it until my early 30's. So here I am at the tender age of 36, fearing that I stepped into the game way \"too late\", but I'm still trying my best.\nI created Sacrimony because I wanted the kind of story I never had  growing up. I could never really relate to the stories that had clear-cut, black-and-white heroes and villains because they just never felt like real life to me. Despite being a fantasy story with imaginary settings and races, Sacrimony at its core, is a story of love, family, friendship and what it means to be \u201chuman.\u201d Everyone is multi-faceted and capable of good, bad and everything in between and they\u2019ll do whatever they have to in order to navigate the world and cope with being dealt a bad hand in life.\nHonestly? Because I have no other means of getting my books out there.  I have a story that I want to tell and Kickstarter is such a great way to be able to raise the funds to actually do it while finding a wonderful, passionate audience. Not only that, self-publishing through Kickstarter allows me to have full creative control over my own project which is something that is very important to me.\nFunds will be used for the cost of printing the books and all other merch, kickstarter fees, and covering the costs of shipping. If I have  anything left over, I might buy myself some ice cream to celebrate.  Because I'm worth it!\nWant to see what happens next? You can download an extended preview here!

I'm Lisa LaRose, a Canadian painter and comic artist. I love to make detailed and delightful paintings from the strange ideas that pop into my head.  I spend my days painting in acrylics or making comics, and I earn my keep by selling paintings/prints and other items online.  This will be my third Kickstarter project!\nI spend an average of 100 hours working on each painting.\nSome of the places you can find me/ see more of my art and art-making:\n Website             Etsy             Instagram             Twitter             Facebook             TikTok \n\nSo why make puzzles?\nI love doing puzzles, but often when I am shopping for a new puzzle, I have a hard time finding an image that appeals to me. Cottages, landscapes, and balls of yarn are well and dandy... but where is the WEIRD STUFF?\nSo I thought...  what if I made my art into puzzles?\nThis Kickstarter is for funding the first 3 of my puzzle designs!\n I have these 3 designs planned, proofed, and ready to be printed!  \nPuzzles are a fun activity to do solo or with friends/ family. They make a great gift too! \nBased on my puzzle experience, these puzzles are a medium-difficulty. If you are concerned about difficulty, Toad Queen is the easiest of the three. Pick Star Fish if you are feeling up for more of a challenge.\n1000 pieces!\n Completed puzzle size: 20\"x 27\" (50cm x 70cm)\n Box size: 9.25\" x 7.75\" x 2.25\" (24cm x 20cm x 6cm)\n Bonus half-size poster print included (no fighting over the box top!)\nStandard puzzle size.\nSince I love to do puzzles myself, there were a few things that were absolutely necessary for my puzzles to have. After many many months of sampling and researching, I have a manufacturer that meets all my needs!\n\n1) Good color reproduction\nMy art is all about color and I wanted that to translate to the puzzles\n\n 2) A cute box (the ability to use my own design) \nThe design looks really nice on this cute lil' box size!\n\n3) Pieces with unique shapes\nI wanted all the standard shapes and enough variation in the cut so you definitely know when it's the right piece.\nThey aren't as crazy as some puzzles I've seen, but they are unique enough to help when it comes to those tricky areas.\n\n4) Pieces stick together\nYou can work on sections and move them into place no problem! Heck, you can even pick up the whole puzzle without it falling apart! (see the gif above)\n*PLEASE NOTE* shipping will not be charged via Kickstarter and will be collected later using Backerkit. \nPlease consult this table for shipping price estimates:\nThese estimates are based on shipping prices right now (in March) and may change slightly if postage rates go up between now and when the shipping is collected.\n Canadians: One of the advantages of Backerkit is I can charge shipping by province/region. The prices in the chart are the highest estimates. Shipping will be slightly cheaper than this for BC, AB, SK, ON, QC.\n\nVANCOUVER LOCAL PICKUP: *New* For those in the Vancouver, BC area who want to pick up your rewards (and not pay shipping), I will have a free local pickup option at New World Designs located downtown Vancouver near Waterfront Station.\n\nYou MUST check your email: \nPlease use an email that you will check, and keep an eye out for emails from Kickstarter and Backerkit. If you do not fill out your Backerkit survey when it is sent to you, I will not be able to send you your puzzles. \nYou should also keep an eye on your email in case your Kickstarter payment doesn't go through. If there is an issue when Kickstarter tries to collect your payment when the campaign is over, you will have only 1 week to fix it.\n\n\nTimeline: \nI currently have a deposit down for 500 Life puzzles to secure my quote pricepoint. Once the goal has been met, I will increase my deposit to include the 500 Star Fish and 500 Toad Queen puzzles.  \n\nOnce the campaign ends, it will take 2 weeks for Kickstarter to give me the funds so that I may pay for the order. I will also need to send out surveys (for those getting multiple puzzles) so can confirm I am ordering the right amount of each design.\n\nPuzzle production is estimated to take 1 month. Due to the size and weight of the puzzles, they must be shipped to me via boat, which will take 35-38 days. \n\nI will be fulfilling/ shipping international (non-USA) orders first, as they will have the slowest shipping time. The current time estimation is August 2021. \n\n\nKickstarter video music:\nEasy Lemon by Kevin MacLeod\nhttps://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3697-easy-lemon/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u2022COVID: We aren't out of the woods yet, and outbreaks could cause delays in manufacturing/ shipment.\nSome countries may not be accepting packages from Canada, so please check with your local post office.\n\n\u2022Increase in material costs/ crazy changes in USD or CAD: Part of why I am running now and not closer to the gift-giving-Christmas-season, is that paper prices are increasing and I wanted to keep my current quote locked down.\n\n\u2022Project TOO successful-could cause shipping delays: Seriously, depending on how many backers we get, I may need to hire some outside help for packaging and shipping orders.

Dance is something that is seen as beautiful, but many don\u2019t think about the pain that is done to one\u2019s body to truly be a dancer. Martial arts are thought of as violent because it\u2019s a form of \u201cfighting\u201d, but there\u2019s also a dance like quality to this work of art.\nBut once you dig deeper, the reader will quickly realize that The Dancer is actually a story about mental health.

Each issue features complete, stand-alone stories that are always exciting, sometimes humorous, and occasionally downright scary.\n(Okay,  it's not that scary. There are no nightmares here. But we've learned that young readers love the idea of reading comics their parents think are too scary for them.) \nWe're using this Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to print the 33-page issue, House of Fear: Rubber & Glue, and hopefully, we'll hit a couple of Stretch Goals along the way for some additional items. \nWhat's it About?\nOur first story, \"Rubber & Glue,\" introduces us to a couple of students from Savini Middle School.\nCaden and Isaac aren't exactly friends. \nAnd everything is most certainly not okay here. \nCaden thinks he has the upper hand, as always. But this time, he's in for a shock. Isaac isn't just repeating a childish retort...\n...but instead is casting a curse. One that will force Caden to live a day in the life of the bullied. \nThis story isn't the Monster-of-the-Month fare you've come to expect from House of Fear, but instead, examines the roles we play in middle school, and shines light on just how easy a harmless prank becomes something worse. It's as if Stephen King wrote an after-school special. \nThis issue also features a backup story, \"The Trees Have Eyes.\" This one starts peacefully enough, with Tosh and his dad out for a pleasant hike in the woods. \nWell, maybe not so peaceful or pleasant for Dad. And when they venture off the trail...\n...and into a copse of aspen trees, things take a turn for the worse.\nTrust me, you'll never look at Aspen trees the same again. \nWhat to Expect\nHere's what you can expect when you back our latest campaign:\nOne issue featuring two complete, stand-alone stories.\n33 pages of full-color thrills.\nFun, exciting comics suitable for (almost) all ages.\nBagged/boarded comics shipped in sturdy packaging.\nWe print House of Fear domestically, which means a faster turn around time (within 2 months of the campaign end).  \nWe're now printing on a heavy 70 lb paper stock with a 100 lb cover stock.  A heavier stock means the comics stand up to multiple reads and make the book more suitable for sharing. \nStretch and Milestone Goals\nWe recently had our 175th backer, which means every backer gets a set of print-at-home activity pages. This set includes prompts for kids to draw their own monsters and comics, and of course, also includes coloring pages. \nIf we reach 200 backers, all backers will receive a PDF of the B&W version of The Trees Have Eyes. See Jethro's line work in all its glory in this special version of the story. \nIf we reach 225 backers, I'll upgrade the Digital Deluxe PDF to a full, behind-the-scenes, making of book. I received lots of feedback after our last campaign for this style of book, and I'm excited for the opportunity to do it again for Rubber & Glue.\nOur First Kickstarter Exclusive Variant\nWe're big fans of the old EC comics, so for this campaign, we created our first variant cover as an homage to those horror comics from the 50s. Those are James Hislope's lines, and Josh Jensen's colors, with Matt Krotzer on letters and design. They absolutely nailed it, didn't they?\nAs a way to reward backers with a piece of House of Fear history, the variant is an exclusive to Kickstarter. We'll print to order (with an overage of 10% to cover possible damage during transit), so don't expect too many of these to make it to my online shop or to convention tables. \nThe Rare, Serialized Variant\nWe've also got a rare variant for this campaign. This one features art by Jethro Morales and colors by Josh Jensen. There will be no House of Fear trade dress on the cover. Just the frightful artwork. \nEach copy will be individually serialized to only 31 copies. \nBoyle Minifig\nWe've partnered with Justin at Saber-Scorpion to produce a limited-edition Boyle minifig. The look and accessories are specific to this issue and will only be made available during this campaign. \nThe image below is a prototype of what you can expect.\nExclusive, Crossover Print\nOur first House of Fear crossover is here! Anyone who backs a physical reward for this campaign and the one for Phil Falco's Haunting 1-3 will receive this exclusive print, signed by the writers on both books. (Digital backers who back both will receive a digital version of the art.)\nStunning art by Jethro Morales and Josh Jensen\nHaunting is a solid, supernatural horror comic for teens and adults. So if you have older kids in your house or if you like to sample new horror for yourself, now's the time to try something new!  \n The Rewards \nAdd Ons\nIf you've backed a print tier, you can add additional print copies of House of Fear: Rubber & Glue. You can also catch up on all of the House of Fear comics with the Digital Catch Up add on. We have stickers, too!\nAfter you select a tier to back, Kickstarter will take you to the Add-On page. If you see another issue you'd like to have, simple select it from the Add-On page. \nOther print issues of House of Fear will be available as add-on options after the campaign has ended.\nPreview Pages\nBelow are pages from House of Fear: Rubber & Glue.\nShipping and Delivery\nOur young readers aren't overly concerned with mint comics. All they care about is reading the story....and rereading it as many times as possible. \nBut there are a lot of collectors reading House of Fear, too. We know true horror is getting a Kickstarter package in the mail and finding a crumpled comic inside.\nWith that in mind, we pack our books with the same care we used in making the book and the love that we have for our backers.\nAll comics come bagged and boarded. \nAny order that consists of 1 or 2 comics will be shipped in a sturdy, oversize envelope (stay flat mailers from Pratt Plus). \nAll orders of 3 or more comics will be shipped in a Gemini Mailer for added protection. \nAll packages will be sent via USPS Media Mail, First Class, or Priority Mail, depending on weight.\nTimeline and Budget\nThe comic is 100% complete, so all we need to do is send the issue and sticker sheet to the printers. After 2-3 weeks, I'll start shipping everything to backers. \nBut where do the funds go?\nAbout half of the funds we earn through Kickstarter will be used to print the comic and other rewards. Shipping will take approximately 40% of the funds we receive, and 10% goes to Kickstarter for hosting the campaign.\nAny extra money we earn from the campaign will help pay for future issues of House of Fear.\n Meet the Creators \nWill You Help Us Make Comics for Kids?\nIt's simple: We love making fun, exciting comics, and we want to get them to as many readers as I possibly can. We can't do that without support from readers like you.\nThank you for checking out our latest project. We hope you find a reward that suits you well, and when you do, that you back the campaign and help us continue making exciting, action-packed comics for kids.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my FIFTH Kickstarter campaign! The comic is already complete, and all we have left to do is print the comic and other rewards. \n\nWe're big fans of the Kickstarter platform, and we know how important it is for backers to get their rewards in a timely manner. So we plan to do everything we can to meet your expectations. Of course, if anything comes up that throws us off schedule, we will keep Kickstarter backers updated.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital", "descp": "Receive a PDF copy of HOUSE OF FEAR: RUBBER & GLUE.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF of HOUSE OF FEAR: RUBBER & GLUE\nThank you/credit in PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["54 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "Deluxe Digital", "descp": "Receive a PDF copy of HOUSE OF FEAR: RUBBER & GLUE, which includes bonus behind-the-scenes art pages.

I was a storyboard artist on Classic Tales and Bob\u2019s Burgers.\nI'm so proud of my comic books, and they're only made possible through Kickstarter.\n\nIn 2018 I funded my first graphic novel on Kickstarter, Sneaky Goblins: an all-ages story of fantasy mayhem, inspired by Adventure Time cartoons, Tolkien and World of Warcraft. I followed that up with two new comics: Sneaky Goblins at College in 2019, and Mythic Creature Trainer #1 in 2020.\n Some of the films, TV and comics I've worked on: \nI've always loved drawing and telling stories.

Grow crops, nurture animals, and befriend the islanders. Decide whether to revitalize not only the town but also the surrounding coral reefs.  \nPromising to keep intact what makes classic farm sim games fun, Coral Island aims to modernize and make the experience more inclusive. We feature a large cast of diverse characters and weave environmental awareness into the core game loop \u2014  all the while keeping it a wholesome good time.\n\n\nThere are over 50 islanders living on Coral Island. Coming from all walks of life, get to know these people by chatting them up \u2014 extra brownie points for gifts!\n\nTransform your overrun land into a lush and lively farm. Find your play style by deciding what crops to grow, which animals to nurture, or what structures to build.\nChoose from a variety of crops, flowers, fruit plants, and trees. There are over 75 plantables in the game, ranging from age-old classics to the exotic and obscure native to Asia.\nCrops are seasonal, which means they only grow in a specific season. However, some crops can be planted in multiple seasons and be re-harvested every several days. \nFruit plants take 11 days to mature. They are bi-seasonal, able to grow 2 seasons out of the year, and will wither offseason. Does not need to be watered after maturity.\nFruit Trees take 28 days to mature and will not wither off-season. They bear 1 fruit a day, every day for the season, and will continue to bear fruit every year.\n\nMake a living by caring for animals and raising livestock. Though you'll first need to build a coop or barn to house them! These farm animals can be left outside during the day and will return inside as night falls.\n\n\nPoultry are farm animals that live in a coop. If fed daily, mature poultry usually produces 1 egg, and sometimes, a feather.\n\nBarn-dwelling animals range from the traditional Sheep and Cow to Luwak and Llamas. They need to be brushed and fed daily to keep their produce flowing.\n\nDive into the ocean to restore the coral reefs! Select a diving spot around the island, and unlock deeper levels to explore. Unravel all that the ocean has to offer.\nClean up the sea bed to make a home for rare fish, and collect ocean kelp to hone the quality of livestock and crop.\nBring processed kelp to Ling's Lab to permanently upgrade the quality of your products. Decide which you'll upgrade first: seeds, saplings, seedlings, fodder, or bait.\n16 singles and ready to mingle. Sweep them off their feet and find the one. Find out what their personalities are like, take them on a date, and fall in love!\n Unlock various relationship scenes and when you're ready, build a life together at the farm \u2014 perhaps even have children. Yes, no, maybe?\nGo deep into the caverns to mine precious gemstones \u2014 use the loot to upgrade your tools and farm. But beware, monsters protect rare finds so bring a weapon or two!\nPacked with a variety of outfits, accessories, and options to choose from, you are armed with plenty of styles to express yourself. Conform to the community or be different! There is no wrong answer because there is only one you in Coral Island.\nSelect 1 out of 3 starter houses. Upgrade, decorate\u2026 personalize! Purchase furniture, collect paintings and display exclusive decorations. Welcome home, Farmer.\nCatch a variety of fish, starfish, and squid! There are also crabs at the beach. Fun fact! Several freshwater and saltwater fish can only be caught at specific seasons or certain times (i.e: at summer dawn, or rainy winters).\nCoral Island was once home to an expansive variety of aquatic life. As you restore the island's ecosystem, more types of fish will be available to catch. Perhaps, you'll even cross paths with something legendary?\nLevel up! As you make your way around the island, you will earn skill points that can be invested into skills. \nDecide on a path and create an experience unique to you. Along the way, you'll unlock new, exciting techniques that might come in handy on the farm!\nGet busy and immerse yourself in Coral Island! You can pick projects to work on or a fun skill to develop in your free time... or not. Your time, your choice. Here are some of the additional features in Coral Island worth noting.\nImprove the town: Take part in community projects to build and liven up the town. Spare some extra gold to add a community garden for the locals or build a brand new museum and more\u2026\nFestivals: Join the local community in a Cherry Blossom Festival, annual beach clean up, and many more. There are 2 festivals each season that you can participate in.\nPets: Choose a companion. Decide between a dog, cat, monkey, fox & more! Your pet will play around the farm and come inside the house.\nWeather & Time: The forecast includes sun, wind, rain, storm, and snow. Coral Island also features a day and night cycle with dynamic lighting.  Set the pace by adjusting the passage of time with a time slider.\nCooking: Build a kitchen and start cooking. With over 70 recipes to learn, including Popiah, Lodeh, and Cauliflower Casserole. Gather all cooking utensils and try them all.\nQuests: Embark on adventures! There are elaborate quests that will give you cutscenes and storylines, and there are simple quests. Rack up relationship points and get paid!\n\n\nWelcome to your new home, a small town with big personalities called Starlet Town. It's located on the coast of Coral Island. This tropical island features a setting loosely influenced by Southeast Asia. You'll see this come across the lore, world-building, crops, animals, and more. Nestled in between the equator and northern tropic, Coral Island is graced by four seasons per year.\n\nThis is Coral Island. Segmented into 7 different areas, your farm is located on the left side of the map, just on the outskirts of town.\n Starlet Town is the heart of Coral Island. Not only is it roomy and features a butterfly garden, but this charming little town also has stories hidden behind its townies.\nThe Beach is rich with sparkly white sands, seashells, and seasonal fruits. On the pier sits a handsome old Inn and a gateway to ocean exploration, the Diving spot. \nThe Lake perhaps guards the most magical place in Coral Island. Find your way through the wooden bridge and discover the ancient temple. It\u2019s believed to be the main source of water and where the island's rich soil originates from.\nThe Forest is a mystic sanctuary for wildlife, filled with ruins and who-knows-what. Underneath the musky floor, it's a hoarding place for messages from the past, the Cavern.\nThe Lookout used to be a place where locals prepared for battles of old and whatnot. As time passed, the Lighthouse is now solely used for navigational aid. Come here and enjoy wicked sunsets and pick some wild fruits on your way home.\nThe Woodlands used to be part of the Forest, but since the arrival of humans, it is now tamed and family-friendly, without losing its green allure. Walk alongside the river to see the School, Taco Truck, and houses belong to those who prefer quiet nights over paved pathways of the town.\n Hillside, sandwiched between the Forest and Woodlands, is the perfect combination of green and privacy. Take a peek at the Vineyard and familiarize yourself with the local Carpenters.\n\nThe Coral Three were said to be the Goddess of Flowers, Merfolk, and Giants. Once upon a time, they worked together to maintain the balance of Coral Island. \nThe Goddess of Flowers was worshipped by both Merfolk and Giants. To this day, locals continue to believe that the Goddess is responsible for rejuvenating the island's water, soil, and well-being.\nSubmerged artifacts suggest The Merfolk Kingdom protected the oceans. It appears they were tasked with ruling the underwater world around Coral Island, making sure that order was maintained.\nLegend has it The Kingdom of Giants existed to cultivate the rich soil of Coral Island. Ruins around the island depict Giants, and what appear to be humans, farming alongside one another.\n\nPufferfish Drilling Corp. is a disgraced company whose goal is to drill oil on and around Coral Island. Set to open this Spring, they plan to lobby their way into the community and collect properties to secure voting rights.\n\n\nWe hope to color your days in Coral Island through music.

Please confirm how the add-on money should be assigned then.\n\nThe current plan is to release Coral Island for Steam on the Windows platform first. Since we've passed our Console Stretch Goals, Coral Island will also be coming to Nintendo Switch, Playstation, and Xbox! \n\nWe understand that localization is very important. Coral Island will launch into early access with Bahasa Indonesia and English support. Shortly after, we will update the game to support the additional 8 languages seen below.\nBased in Indonesia, our team currently consists of 20 passionate talents. This includes both permanent crew members and remote collaborators. Although this is our first game as a studio, our team is comprised of veteran and junior game developers.\nYou can learn more about us on our website: www.stairwaygames.com\n\nOur goal is to release the best version of Coral Island. We believe the only way to achieve this is through community involvement. With Kickstarter, we hope to build a community of passionate backers and involve you all in the process of development. All in service of producing the best farming game we can create.  \nSo far, development has been entirely self-funded. Although we have enough funds to complete the game, there are several features we would love to add but don't have the resources to do so. It's always been our dream to play a farming game that features changing seasonal outfits for NPC's, or finally, having kids grow up! We hope Kickstarter helps us realize some of the stretch goals we have for Coral Island.\nAs backers, we invite you to join our Discord to see daily developer diaries and have a direct open line of communication with us. \n\nDevelopment began in October 2019. Initially, we focused on preproduction and coding core features that now serve as the foundation of Coral Island. Over the last 6 months, we've shifted gears into full production.  \nOur focus right now is finalizing and polishing content for the Alpha that will be released to Alpha Farmer tier backers and above. From there, we'll work alongside the community, releasing two content updates and iterating feedback into the game before eventually launching into Steam's early access.\n\n\n\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped 5,000+ creators make their projects a reality, raising over $300MM through crowdfunding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been working on Coral Island for close to 15 months now. \n\nThe two biggest challenges we see ahead for the project are developing alongside community feedback and, provided we reach the stretch goal, implementing the multiplayer component into the game. \n\nDepending on the amount and type of feedback we receive, the dates for milestones on the development timeline may shift.

My name is Tracy, and I'm the creator of a small business called Atomik Cupcake Designs--I make kawaii accessories such as stickers, jewelry, keychains, and of course, enamel pins! This will be my 5th enamel pin Kickstarter project, and I'm really excited to share it with everyone! To have a look at the finished products of our past work, visit our shop here!\n\nThis collection of designs was actually influenced by my mother (how fitting!), who told me that she thought animal cookies would make great pin designs. It always weirded me out that these delicious cookies came in such obscure shapes, so when designing them, I tried to make them a more recognizable and give them a bit more personality. I also swapped out the traditional camel shape for an alpaca, because why not? =D\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR UK BACKERS:\nDue to new VAT collection laws, I am unfortunately unable to take UK pledges on this Kickstarter, and all UK pledges will be refunded at the end of the campaign. If you are from the UK and want to back these pins, please use these links to pre-order on our Etsy page:\n\n Animal Cookies Pins: https://www.etsy.com/listing/954546775/kawaii-animal-cookies-soft-enamel-pins \n Inflatable Shaker Charm: https://www.etsy.com/listing/954551593/kawaii-animal-inflatable-bag-shaker \n Heart Filler Pins: https://www.etsy.com/listing/940605160/kawaii-heart-shaped-cookie-mini-pin \nLearn more about all of the tasty designs below!\nEach of the four pin designs comes in the two traditional pink and white cookie colors! Because we wanted to dye the metal for these, our designs are soft enamel with an epoxy coating, with sprinkle details printed on top of the epoxy! Each pin measures between 1.5 and 1.75 inches on its longest side. They each have a backstamp of the Atomik Cupcake Designs logo, as well as two backing posts and pink rubber clutches.\n\nThese goodies have been added as stretch goals outside of the main design! All of these extras have been unlocked!\n Freebie rewards are compounded,  so higher tiers will get all of the rewards of the tiers before it! Those who pledged for a shaker charm or heart filler pin/earring set will receive both the glitter and cupcake sticker as freebies!\n\nHow add-ons work: If you'd like to add extra sticker sheets, filler pins, or keychains, just add that additional amount to your pledge. When surveys are sent via Backerkit, you'll have the option of choosing which rewards you pledged for!\n Project Launch: January 12\n Project End: February 5\n Production Begins: Middle/end of February\n Rewards Shipped: mid/late April\nThank you so much for checking out our Kickstarter campaign!

As a result, I have gained valuable experience in understanding not only how to manage a Kickstarter campaign, but about manufacturer standards, quality control, and how much time it really takes for pins to be made.\n\nThere is always the risk of factory mishaps which can delay the progress of a Kickstarter. These can include pins that have the wrong color, a high defect rate that requires a reorder, shipping delays, and other issues that can delay the production of pins. I've done my best to anticipate that sometimes these things happen (especially considering how crazy this year has been due to COVID), and I have set my delivery date accordingly to allow for PLENTY of time to get these all out to you!\n\nBackers will be notified every step of the way on whether we're ahead of schedule, on schedule, or delayed, so there will be no surprises!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nEnamel pins are made of a combination of hard enamel and plated metal.

We think our readers are smart enough to know that we aren't condoning these things, but we also know that in 2020, some people don't want to read about it. So: fair warning.\nThere's also donkey-f*cking.\nFRIED Comics is a proud purveyor of offbeat, irreverent pulp fiction since 2013, and a labor of love for Clay Adams and Alexandre O. Philippe.\nSo far, we have eight successful Kickstarters under our belts. (And between us we have a lot of belts. ) So, we're stoked to return to the scene of the crime.\nClay is the co-writer of RED XMAS, which was released in comic shops this December by Scout Comics, and served as co-editor for the NIGHTMARE THEATER anthology on Kickstarter. His feature script, THE ECLIPSE, placed second in the horror category of the FADEIn Awards, and his latest comic, ELECTRIC YOUTH, co-written with Kyle Roberts, was recently featured in the LA Times. He has written and directed for television and holds a BFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU. When Clay first met Alexandre, he thought, \"My, what a sophisticated European.\" Boy, was he wrong!\nFilm nerd/director Alexandre is the co-writer of RED XMAS from Scout Comics. His most recent documentary is LEAP OF FAITH: WILLIAM FRIEDKIN ON THE EXORCIST, now streaming on Shudder. He holds a Masters Degree in Dramatic Writing from NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and has written and directed numerous award-winning films and documentaries, including MEMORY: THE ORIGINS OF ALIEN, 78/52: HITCHCOCK'S SHOWER SCENE, AND THE PEOPLE vs. GEORGE LUCAS. When Alexandre first met Clay, he thought, \"My, what a stupid American.\" Boy, was he right!\nLeila is a comic book artist and writer living in Portland, Oregon. She draws SLEEPLESS, SHUTTER and writes AFAR at Image Comics. Leila has drawn for titles such as THE WICKED + THE DIVINE, SCARLET WITCH, AMERICAN VAMPIRE, and THE PANTHEON PROJECT. In 2015 and 2016, Leila was nominated for the Russ Manning Promising Newcomer Award for her work on SHUTTER. She only took this job because she thought she'd be paid in fries.\nBrett Nienburg is a Denver-based artist who has worked as a concept artist for LEGO and  designed sets for feature films. We're sorry we made him peel so many potatoes. He looks pretty sad about it.\nCharles is from Canada, so we imagine he looks like one of those flappy-headed dudes from South Park.* He has lettered books for Aftershock, Image, IDW and Top Shelf (among others) and is a founding member of Frozen Beach Studios. (*As far as we know, Charles has a normal-looking head.)\nUgh. Just... ugh.\nThe Package\nWe've gotten our fair share of comics that arrived mangled by the mail carrier.\nYou pay premium prices on Kickstarter, and you deserve better. That's why we've started using Gemini Comic Mailers:\nThese babies are sturdy. They require a little more money, a little more time (and a lot more tape!) but it's worth it to make sure your comics arrive in pristine condition.\nAnd if somehow your comic still gets roughed up?\nFrieda will replace it free of charge.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nWe are coming to Kickstarter to put the first two issues into print. The book is 100% complete, our printer is still operating as an essential business, and we are ready to deliver quickly.

My name is Gilles and I am a UK based artist with 9 years of experience in pop culture t-shirt and other merchandise design. I have now dived head first into the world of enamel pins and I am absolutely in love with it.\nKonNYAchiwa!\nThis project features Nya Nya Neko, a group of adorable cat girls. The pin series will see them taking on the personalities and outfits of some very special and popular princesses from our childhood. Inspired by a mixture of vintage dolls and kawaii plush toys, they are cute, eye catching and playful.\nPin Selection *IMPORTANT*\nDifferent characters will be unlocked as more Stretch Goals are reached. You will not have to select your pins until the very end of the Kickstarter Campaign, giving you a larger variety on available enamel pins to choose from.\nYour Contribution\nFunds from this Kickstarter will help to cover the costs of creating a minimum order of each pin as well as the moulds, screen printing elements, glitter features and backing cards. \nAdd-ons and Shipping *IMPORTANT*\nYou will be able to add additional pins, tees, stickers and prints, as well as other exclusive goodies at the end of the campaign when completing your survey.\nThe shipping costs attached to this Kickstarter DO NOT INCLUDE Tracked Shipping, but you will be able to UPGRADE TO TRACKED at the end of the campaign when completing your survey.\nMade of hard enamel in gold plating and approx 45mm to 55mm.\n Glitter features on all pin designs.\n Screen Printing on all pin designs.\n2 Rubber clutches at the back of each pin.\n #GillesPinClub branding on the back of each pin.\nEach pin is attached to an embosed and illustrated backing card.\nThe original Kickstarter goal of \u00a31000 will be covering the costs of the first 3 pins as shown below.\nThe following designs are made available after the project hits certain targets.\nThe goal targets reflect the costs of creating the pin moulds and set up fees, as well as minimum order of each pin. I will be updating the graphic below to show when goals are met.\nUnlike previous campaigns, I will be unlocked groups of pins together once reaching individual targets, starting with \u00a32000, \u00a33000, \u00a34000 and the final group at \u00a35000.\nNo more designs will be created or unlocked through this campaign beyond these designs.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Some of the designs may be subject to small changes during the campaign and in post production.\nBelow you will find the \"Glitter Guide!\" The areas coloured in pink will be glittered for that particular pin.\nThis \"Fairy\" Pin will be available as a FREEBIE for pledges of any 5 pins or more. \nNote: You can also see the prototype for the Nya Nya Neko backing card in the image above, designed to resemble a vintage doll box. \nI have self-funded some samples of the first 4 pins unlocked through this project. Below you can see some of the photos of the sample pins.\nNOTE: As you can see, The Fairy pin comes with very special Stained Glass Wings~! How fantastic does that look?!\nNext you can find some images of previous Nya Nya Neko enamel pins I have manufactured both through Kickstarter as well as my Patreon Pin Club.\nBelow are a series of questions which are frequently asked during my Kickstarter campaigns. I have complied this FAQ to help set your minds at ease about any queries you might have.\nIf your question is not tackled below, please feel free to leave a comment or send me a private message and I will get back to you as soon as possible. \nQ. Will the Villains be added on this set?\nA. Yes, I will be adding a series of Villains that go along with these pins, however they will not be added as part of this campaign. Instead there will be other campaigns to expand this collection. I have made this decision in order to make collecting the full set more affordable, especially in the current financial climate. \nQ. Why are these pins prices a little higher than you usual Kickstarter Pins?\nA. Due to the level of detail in each pin, the ammount of screen prints and the variants available for some of the designs, the Unit Price of each pin is much higher than some of my other designs, and therefore had to up the price slightly. However, the Early Bird prices still reflect the same discounts from previous campaigns.\nQ. Can I add more items (stickers, pins, t shirts) to my current pledge? \nA. Yes, you will be able to purchase addons ontop of your pledge rewards at the end of the campaign while filling in your surveys.\nQ. Should I add more money to my reward to purchase addons.\nA. No, please do not add extra money to contribute to your addons. Addons will be purchased and paid for at the end of the campaign separately to your pledges here on Kickstarter, using BackerKit.\nQ. BackerKit surveys never make it to my inbox. How will I get my survey?\nA. If your survey does not arrive once I send out the update here on Kickstarter notifying everyone that surveys have been sent, simply send me a private message here on Kickstarter or by email and I will link you directly to your survey. No surveys shall be lost here!\nQ. I don't have any funds to contribute to your Kickstarter Campaign but I'd love to help. How can I do this?\nA. Sharing a Kickstarter with your friends is the easiest and most efficient way to help any campaign. Thank you in advance to all those who share the link to this and all my other Kickstarters~!\nQ. Will my Reward come with Tracked Shipping?\nA. To keep the rewards at a low price point, Tracked Shipping is not applied automatically to each reward. Instead you can purchased tracked shipping for your parcel as an addon upon completing your survey.\nQ. My parcel has not arrived yet but I didn't purchase the Tracked Shipping. Can you help me?\nA. Unfortunately if you chose not to purchase Tracked Shipping, I am unable to determine if you parcel was delivered and where. The best I can do is confirm it was shipped to the correct address. So please do purchase the Tracked Shipping Addon if you would like to ensure extra safety to your parcel.\nI would like to take a moment to thank you for reading and supporting this Kickstarter campaign. I am so excited for you to receive your pins.\nFor the latest news about this Kickstarter as well as other projects, please feel free to follow me on Instagram at @GillesBone, Twitter at @GillesBone and on my Facebook Page GBIllustrations.\nKickstarter launches on January 28th and runs for 25 days.\nThe Kickstarter campaign will end on February 22nd.\nKickstarter Funds will be received after about 15 - 17 days.\nBackerkit surveys are sent for your pin selection, add-on purchases and mailing address info once the Kickstarter Funds are recieved.\nProduction will approximately take between 2 to 4 months due to the volume of designs. The duration may vary  due to the global pandemic. \nIt will take about 1 to 2 weeks for the pins to be shipped to me.\nI will package and send out your orders as soon as the pins arrive to my home.\nYou can expect to receive your pins no later than Mid July 2021. Please make sure that your address is correct to prevent any unnecessary delays. If there are any setbacks in the production process, I will keep you posted.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSome pins may vary ever-so-slightly from the mockups above during production, however such changes will be minor and few and far between.\n\nThere is also always the possibility of delays in production and shipping time, however I will be in close contact with the manufacturer throughout the entire process to make sure they are keeping with the timeline mentioned above.\n\nI will be personally examining each pin before dispatch to make sure that no one receives any blemished or defective pins.\n\nPlease make sure that you double check that your address is correct to make sure that you package does not get lost.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "\u2605 One Pin \u2605", "descp": "Choose 1 pin from the collection, including any pins whose stretch goals have been met.

We love the entire culture that surrounds them including the other media that they populate and have become popular in. We love the heroes and the villains, the bold and the subtle. We love how many different types of stories can be told and the many different genres and sub-genres that they can encompass.\nComic Books are unlike any other medium. They combine the beautiful imagery of art with the emotional and dramatic phrasing of prose or screenplay into this unparalleled art form that transcends time and class.   \nWe love being whisked away into fantastic and strange worlds filled with colorful characters and dynamic sequences of action, drama, horror and comedy. We enjoy being engrossed in an intricate murder mystery with the clues hidden in panels, or captivated by rich fantasy worlds full of creatures and races we've never seen before, or even entertained by alternate versions of our own world where people fly or become invisible, or can read minds!\nComic Books are our passion, and so we talk about them.

Make/100"}}, {"backer": "Lisa Moore", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "\"Blue\" is about being happy being you!\n\n\"Blue\" is a children's book that explores, through the prism of colors both common and unusual, what it might be like to be someone else and, ultimately being happy with who you are. It's a story about self-esteem. Being happy with the skin you are in. And that is a lesson that is becoming more and more important to teach to children even at the earliest stages of their lives. \nAfter reading story after story of children who were starving themselves to emulate their favorite pop star or the latest supermodel of the minute or who were begging their parents for plastic surgery before their age even reached double digits, I knew something was very wrong. And while I've never exactly been in love with the way I look, I have long since come to terms with it and found things about myself that I do love. So, I felt that it was important for children to see that there were a lot of good things about themselves that they can love, too.  So, I wrote the original poem about Blue. Which, with the artistic talents of Rodney Fyke of Hazzum Productions, has become the book that we hope to create through your kind and generous pledges. \nBlue Cover Art by Rodney Fyke\nBlue Contemplates Colors\nFallow? Zomp?\nBlue Talks to Old Grey\nThe Wisdom of Age\nAnger and Apathy\nRewards\nIn addition to the 30 pages \"Blue\" book signed by the author,  and the bookmark that reads \"I'm never \"Blue\" when I have a book to read\", I have commissioned four incredible prints based on the Blue character from four of today's most talented artists. They are Comfort Love and Adam Withers,  independent comics megastars and creators of the uber-popular \"Uniques\" and \"Rainbow in the Dark\", Chandra \"Spookychan\" Free, eclectic and amazingly talented artist and colorist for companies including Archaia Entertainment, Ape Entertainment, Image Comics, and creator of \"The God Machine\" and \"Machina Corpse.\", Sean Forney, the endlessly prolific print, cover and card illustrator and creator of the Scarlet Huntress, and Jeremy \"Skare Kro\" O'Ryan, independent graphic designer and illustrator with a nearly boundless imagination. At the two highest tiers, $100 and $200, backers will receive a personalized poem, written by me, featuring the person of their choice and Blue. And finally, the $200 tier features the one of a kind, original artboard from the print created by Comfort Love and Adam Withers.\n\nPrint Sketch from Rewards contributing artist Chandra Free\nPossible Print Process Sketch from Rewards Contributing Artist Jeremy \"Skare Kro\" O'Ryan\nMore Possible Print Process Sketches from Rewards Contributing Artist Jeremy \"Skare Kro\" O'Ryan\nSean Forney's \"Blue\" Print\nComfort Love and Adam Withers' \"Blue\" Print\n\"Spider-Blue\" original art by Rodney Fyke\nTARDIS original art by Rodney Fyke\nChandra Free Print\nJeremy \"Skare-Kro\" O'Ryan Print\nIron-Blue original art by Rodney Fyke\n\"Blue and the Ghost\" by Jeremy \"Skare-Kro\" O' Ryan\n\"Blue and the Ghost-Rainbow Edition\" by Jeremy \"Skare-Kro\" O' Ryan\nWho are we?\nI am John Wilson and the author of \"Blue\". I was an Art teacher in an inner-city school for 11 years until a variety of medical issues and chronic pain forced me to give up my career. Since that time, I became a comic journalist for websites including Comic Related, Complete Set, and CBR and wrote two comic books for Last Ember Press, \"Pneumatic Cases\" and two of the three stories in \"Fireside Tales\": \"Charmageddon\" and \"EEK! Lil' Monsters!\". \"Blue\" will be the first book created under the banner of my own publishing company, The Monkeywerx Publishing Company. \n\n\"Blue\" artist Rodney Fyke is a writer and artist from Cincinnati, Ohio. He's been working on and off in Independent comics since the early 90s. His art style varies from high detailed illustrations to cartoony drawings. His published projects include Superior Seven, Peanut, Puddin\u2019 n\u2019 Jelly, Pitter Patter, Unchained, and Roadkill Rampage. He has over twelve comics that have been published in which he's either written, illustrated or both. You can see more of his work at www.hazzum.com \n\nPledges \nThe lion's share of the money request, 3/4 or it will go to our first initial planned print run of \"Blue\", which is 100 copies. if demand and pledges exceed that, we will be able to print more to meet that demand. The remaining 1/3 of the requested funds will go to shipping the products, pay for promotional material like the bookmarks and flyers and, in part, pay the commissions of the talented artists that are providing the incredible prints that are available throughout this Kickstarter. \n\nWhere Your Pledges Go\nShipping\nA note on shipping: shipping is one of the most difficult to price and predict. We are genuinely committed to bringing you a quality package that is shipped securely. We will be using the best \"media shipping\" envelopes designed to ship books and prints. We have tried to keep costs low but international shipping and domestic shipping rates continue to rise. if you have any questions about specific shipping arrangements, feel free to contact us through the community section of this page. \n\nStretch Goals\nGoal 1: If we exceed our originally stated goal of $750 and are able to achieve $1000, everyone who pledged at the $15 level or higher (ie purchased a physical copy of \"Blue\") will receive a print by artist and designer Jeremy \"Skare Kro\" O'Ryan. \nGoal 2:  If we exceed our originally stated goal of $750 and are able to achieve $1500, everyone who pledged at the $15 level or higher (ie purchased a physical copy of \"Blue\") will receive a print by \"The God Machine\" creator and artist Chandra Free. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of our key challenges is not being embraced by parents, children, and the children's book community at large. This is my first children's book and may not follow the \"normal\" format. It also may not fall within a particular genre or age range. That may be a problem in getting acceptance and donations from more than just friends.\n\nThis is my first Kickstarter and while its success or failure will not mean that \"Blue\" will never see the light of day, it does mean that it will be delayed significantly longer as I save the funds to self-publish on my own.\n\nAs mentioned, this is my Kickstarter. It's impossible for me to know if it will be embraced or ignored until it happens and where I made mistakes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "$1 \"Who's Blue?\" Tier", "descp": "Pledgers at this level will receive the eternal thanks of all of us here at The Monkeywerx and you may tell everyone you meet today that you did a good thing for the color \"Blue\" today.\nINCLUDES:\nFeelings both warm and fuzzy!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "$5 \"Electric Blue\" Tier", "descp": "Pledgers at this level will receive a digital copy of \"Blue.\" A valid e-mail address must be provided to ensure delivery.\nINCLUDES:\nA digital copy of the \"Blue\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "$15-\"I'm so Blue\" Tier", "descp": "Pledgers at this level will receive a copy of \"Blue\", signed by the author, and a bookmark\nINCLUDES:\nCopy of \"Blue\", signed by the Author\n\"Blue\" Bookmark", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Limited (44 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "$25 \"Different Shades of Blue\" A Tier", "descp": "These unique tiers provide backers with the choice of two options:\n\nOn Tier A: Backers will receive a signed copy of \"Blue\", a bookmark, and the 5\" x 7\" print by independent superstar artist Sean Forney!\nINCLUDES:\nA: Signed copy of \"Blue\", Bookmark, 5 X 7 Print by Sean Forney\n\"Blue\" Bookmark\nCopy of \"Blue\", signed by the Author", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (46 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "$25 \"Different Hues of Blue\" B Tier", "descp": "These unique tiers provide backers with the choice of two options:\n\nOn Tier B: Backers will receive a signed copy of \"Blue, a bookmark, and the 5\" x 7\" print by artist couple and \"Uniques\" and Rainbow in the Dark\" creators Comfort Love and Adam Withers!\nINCLUDES:\nCopy of \"Blue\", signed by the Author\n\"Blue\" Bookmark\n5 X 7 Print from artists Comfort Love and Adam Withers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (48 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "$35 \"Blue Eyes Smiling at Me\" Tier", "descp": "Backers at this level will receive a copy of \"Blue\", signed by the author, a bookmark, and 5\" x 7\" prints from both superstar independent artist Sean Forney and \"Uniques\" and \"Rainbow in the Dark\" creators Comfort Love and Adam Withers!\nINCLUDES:\nCopy of \"Blue\", signed by the Author\n\"Blue\" Bookmark\n5x7 Print from artist Sean Forney\n5 X 7 Print from artists Comfort Love and Adam Withers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (48 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "$35 \"Blue Bundle\" Tier", "descp": "Backers at this tier will receive a signed copy of \"Blue\", a bookmark, the 5\" x 7\" \"Blue and the Ghost\" print, and the 5\" x 7\" \"Blue and the Ghost-Rainbow Edition\" print from independent artist and graphic designer Jeremy \"Skare-Kro\" O' Ryan.\nINCLUDES:\nCopy of \"Blue\", signed by the Author\n\"Blue\" Bookmark\n5\" x 7\" \"Blue and the Ghost\" print by Jeremy \"Skare-Kro\" O'Ryan\n5\" x 7\" \"Blue and the Ghost-Rainbow Edition\" print by \"Skare-Kro\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (48 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "$100 \"I'm Blue!

Whether it\u02bbs sitting with our loved ones at family gatherings, or sitting in the classroom listening to a teacher attempting to convince us of the relevance of historical figures. Stories keep culture and people alive, often providing a timeless link to our ancient traditions, myths, legends, hopes, and dreams. Stories also help us understand ourselves and the world around us. \nBUT.... what happens if the stories that we\u02bbre told exclude us?  \nA single story, a single ruling perspective creates stereotypes and perceptions that anything else is not important. When that one story becomes the only story, people start to question their existence and humanity. It is disempowering to anyone who does not fit the ruling stereotype. The problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story that matters.\nThe Moana Nui podcast is a safe haven for authentic storytelling and a space where humans from all walks of life can engage in thoughtful conversations.

We celebrate and empower the silenced voices of our ancestors and their accomplishments, while inspiring their descendants who keep their legacies alive.\nEvery culture has its own stories or narratives, which are shared as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation or instilling moral values.\nStorytelling forges connections between people and ideas. Stories convey the culture, history, and values that unite people. Stories build familiarity and help all of us to step into the shoes of another person and see things from their point of view. \n\nThe Moana Nui Podcast will be hosted by writer/creator/designer Moana McAdams and will make its home on Podbean with extended availablility on Apple Podcast, Spotify, and Google.\nMoana McAdams, Host\nPodbean Hosting Fees\nEditing Services\nShipping Costs\nReward Production\nOfficial Moana Nui USB\nKids Club tier - $50\nLock-In Your Special Guest Appearance on Season 2\n16 x 30 Canvas Art - $89\nWe\u02bbll Come Up With Questions Together & Have Some Fun!\nPersonalized Consulting with Moana\nOfficial Moana Nui Hoodie\nOfficial Moana Nui Mask\nAllen Carter is an artist, writer, promoter, and the sole creator of two independent comics titles called Damn Tourists and Cosmic Force.

Any change they cause could destroy history as we know it.\n\nA group of time traveling soldiers stands against them. They call themselves The Toxic Fruit.\nTheir battle has been waged for many years, but they've never faced anything like this: \nWhat are We Making?\nThe funds raised from this Kickstarter campaign will be used to print both the 11th and 12th issue of our fantasy comic series Tart. \nIn Tart 11, the two newest recruits are taken on one last training mission before they join the fight. Their task: infiltrate Nazi Germany during the 1936 Berlin Olympics.\nTart 11\nPlease note: Due to the setting, images associated with the Third Reich will be seen in this issue prominently. We are making the choice not to share them in this campaign, but do not want any backers to be surprised when they receive their books.\n\nIn Tart 12, the entire Toxic Fruit Organization must band together to try to repel The son of the King of Hell. \nTart 12\nA total of 52 brand new pages of Time traveling, demon hunting adventure.\nTwo new issues delivered together to maximize shipping costs.\nAn issue of stealth, followed by an issue of all out war.\nA brand new Enamel Pin starring the First Lady of The Toxic Universe: \nTart Acid!\n\nHow can I Catch Up?\nIf you are just learning about Tart, please don't be worried about being late to the party. Our previous backers have always supported us so passionately that we were able to print enough first edition copies of our comics that we have a bundle for you.\n\nThe Catch Up Tier includes the Tart Volume 1 trade paperback (collecting issues 1-3), and individual issues of Tart 4-12. \n\nIf you've been waiting to catch up on Tart, don't wait much longer. We are starting to run low on some of our first editions copies of Tart and can not promise we'll be able to offer this in the future.\n\nWant to know more about our series before you pledge?

IF YOU LOVE IT, BACK IT!!! \nWhat Our Peers Say about Tart\nWho Makes Tart?\nWhy are we Returning to Kickstarter?\nOur series has found our most passionate and supportive audience here on Kickstarter. It is not an exaggeration to say that we might not have been able to continue if not for those readers who found us and return again and again.\n\nWe want to continue giving that audience \"first dibs\" at our comics to repay that support. It has been asked of us if any other series has been on the platform longer than Tart, and we honestly don't know. But we are proud to have gotten ten issues into the world with the Kickstarter Community. We're going to be thrilled to hit an even dozen when this campaign is funded.\n\nAs always with our campaigns, this project is 100% ready to go. We never launch Kickstarters without all interior art completed, because delivering on-time is extremely important to us.\n\nThe funds raised in this campaign will go directly to printing enough issues of Tart 11 and 12 to fulfill this campaign and have issues left over for the convention circuit (when that resumes), create the Tart Acid Enamel Pin, and pay for shipping those rewards to our backers.\n\nAny additional funds raised will go toward the interior artwork of Tart 13 which is already underway.\n\nReward Tiers \n\nThank You!

The book was created and edited by Cloudscape board member, Emily Lampson and features heartwarming stories of life, love, and food, all of which connects the stories characters when they enter Mina's.  Some contributors have brought their own experiences to the book and others were inspired about moments throughout the history of Vancouver.  This book features ethnic diversity and represents all walks of life including individuals old and young, LGBTQ and people with disabilities throughout the history of the city we all love. \nCover art by Carolyn Wong\nThe anthology starts with Emily Lampson's story about the diner's opening in 1919, coinciding with British Columbian legislation passed which forbade white waitresses from working at Chinese businesses. Liz, a waitress, loses her job due to this law and goes to work at her sister Laura's restaurant, which is named after Liz's daughter Mina.\n\nWelcome to Mina's by Emily Lampson\n\nWelcome to Mina's contains happy stories and tragic ones taking place at the diner throughout the years.  From a delivery man finding forbidden love to curious people passing through on a much longer journey, Mina's is the destination to meet new friends. \n\nEmily's motivation for assembling Welcome to Mina's is to nurture the creation of more stories that take place in the City of Vancouver. The film industry regularly use Vancouver as a backdrop pretending to be other places, but not often does the city ever play itself. Our city is full of talented writers and artists working in comics, animation, film, video games, prose, and music, but the city itself is not always reflected in the work that we produce. Vancouver is a special place and we're so excited to share with you the lives of Vancouverites in these stories. \nCaught in the Storm by Evan Waterman and Lo Vicente\nWelcome to Mina's is edited and curated by Emily Lampson.\nA combined effort from talented writers and artists have created a 135 page book of wonderful black and white, grey-scale comics. \n\nThis beautiful cover is drawn by Seeroro - Carolyn Wong with stories written and drawn by\nEmily Lampson\nDr. Ray Hsu \n Jonathon Dalton \nArthur Protasio\nVictor Moura\nJohn Burwood\nAmy Fox\nWren Handman\nSabrina Symington\nDino Caruso\nHaley Boros\nJean Kindratsky\nAli Lupu\nEvan Waterman\nLo Vicente\nOliver McTavish-Wisden\nMatthew Nielsen\nMann Chalermwat\nKelly Chen \"Scarlet wings Kaili\"\nJeffrey Ellis\nJohn Ward\nLawrence Denvir\nTamiko Masters\nBlessings in Disguise by Arthur Protasio and Victor Moura\n\n\n$10,000 is our goal, although the cost to make this book is about $5,500 more than that, which Cloudscape has put up up front from revenue from past books.

Wild adventures I could get lost in as I followed the heroes along on their journey. Middle Earth, Hyboria, The Young Kingdoms, The Dying Earth. To me, it's not escapism to want to dwell in worlds like that for a little while. The wonderful thing about fiction, especially genre fiction is that it gives you a taste of the impossible - a window into another world. And that feeling, that exhilarating feeling of cracking open a book and getting lost in it, even for a moment, is something that I've always wanted to create for someone else. And I believe that Wailing Blade is a book that will.\nIt's often said that you should make the comics that you want to see in the world. In that respect, Wailing Blade is everything we've ever wanted to see in a comic. It's got action, it's got adventure. Compelling characters, and a lush, vibrant world for them to inhabit. We couldn't be happier to share it with you.\nWhat Exactly Is This Kickstarter For?\nThe team has already invested tens of thousands of dollars and thousands of man-hours into the development of this first WAILING BLADE series.\nThe WAILING BLADE COLLECTION issue is 100% complete and ready to print.\nWith your support here on Kickstarter, we can truly create the most incredible foil-enhanced, die-cut hardcover edition possible, while also offering some more affordable softcover and digital editions so all fans of hard-hitting dark sci-fi comics can TAKE THE BLADE! \nCHECK OUT THESE INCREDIBLE REWARDS!\nADD-ONS\n Want to customize your pledge and add a few more goodies?\n\nProject Budget\nYour support on Kickstarter will help us cover the large cost of printing and shipping thousands of books around the globe.\nWAILING BLADE PROJECT TIMELINE\nThe Kickstarter Campaign: Oct 20 - Nov 20\nKickstarter Funds Received: Dec 4\nWailing Blade Vol 1 to Print: Early December\nMerchandise in Production: December \nBook Manufacturing and Freight: (December/January)\nExtra Buffer Time for Unexpected Issues: (Late January)\nExpected Deliver to US Backers: (Mid February)\nExpected Deliver for INT Backers: (March)\nBACK WITH CONFIDENCE, BECAUSE COMIXTRIBE ALWAYS DELIVERS! \nWe've built our comics business by always delivering for thousands of backers like you. \nThis launch will be no different, as we look forward to serving long-time fans and first-time readers alike!\nTHIS BLADE IS SHARP, SO HERE'S HOW WE'LL PROTECT IT IN TRANSIT!\nAs Kickstarter fans and collector's ourselves, we know there's nothing worse than backing a comic project and then having your rewards arrive damaged.\nAfter consulting with our backers, we've revamped our shipping practices to ensure your comics and collectibles arrive in great condition.\nAll books shipped will be secured in Gemini Comic Supply Comic Flash Mailers, which provides impact-resistant protection.\nOrders with multiple comics will be sandwich packed and secured for additional protection.\nAnd our Wailing Boxes will be BUBBLE WRAPPED before being inserted into a second shipping box, so that it arrives in great condition.\nThank you so much for taking the time to check out our project.

This time, our young heroes face off against spiders. Lots and lots of spiders!\nIn \"The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs,\" Maeve is dreadfully scared of spiders. But when her younger brother is captured by the evil exterminator and his clutter of arachnids, she must overcome her fear to save him...and the world.\nWhat Do You Get?\nOur comics blend everything you love about Goosebumps, Scooby-Doo, and Tales From the Crypt. House of Fear was created as a way to introduce kids to scary stories, but our comics are great for anyone who likes fun, exciting fantasy-adventure comics. \nHere's what you can expect when you back our latest campaign:\nA complete, stand-alone, 32-page comic.\nA story suitable for all ages.\nOff-set printing for highest quality.\nBagged/boarded comics shipped in sturdy packaging.\nI'm confident you and your family will enjoy our comics. So confident, in fact, we guarantee your satisfaction.  \nIf you back the printed version and dislike the comics for any reason, return them for a refund (minus shipping fees).\nAnd these comics are already printed, so back with 100% confidence. Check out the limited edition matte covers. The matte cover with the shiny logo looks fantastic.\nThe matte covers have spot gloss on the title. They look incredible. And the cover stock is a little thicker, too, which is a nice bonus for collectors and children.\nWhat Critics Are Saying  \nIn 2019, Dark Horse Comics published a collection of House of Fear stories. \nWhen the book hit shops, we received good feedback from readers and critics. Here's what they were saying about it online... \nPreview Pages\nEnjoy this preview of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs. \nWhy Quickstarter?\nNot long after our last campaign, the House of Fear team created \"The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs.\" We had the Kickstarter page nearly complete, but the timing didn't quit work out. And then, when Covid hit, comics were moved to the back burner for awhile.\nDespite having already printed the rewards, we held off on launching until we made progress on future comics. Our goal for this short campaign is to reintroduce the series to readers, and get a jump start on creating more issues in 2021.\nThe Rewards   \nReceive a PDF version of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs.\nReceive a print copy of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs.\nGet two copies of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs. Perfect for collectors or those with 2-child households.\nGet a signed and numbered copy of the 100-page novella, Santa's Claws. Also receive the rare orange matte variant of Mr. Skinny Legs, plus the limited edition green matte cover, too.\nHave your pitch or Kickstarter page reviewed by a professional editor! This reward includes a thorough edit and review, plus a Zoom session to discuss the feedback. Plus all of the print and digital rewards.\nHave your 22-page comic script edited by a professional editor! Includes a substantive edit of your script, with detailed written comments, plus a Zoom session to discuss the feedback. Also includes the print and digital rewards.\nIs your son or daughter an artist? If so, they can design the monster for an upcoming issue of House of Fear. Includes a family Zoom session to discuss the project, plus email updates for each step in the comic-creation process. Includes the Mr. Skinny Legs print and digital rewards.\nIs you son or daughter interested in making comics? With this reward, they can be a part of the entire process. Includes a family Zoom session to discuss ideas, plot, and characters for the comic, plus regular email updates for each step in the process. Also includes all Mr. Skinny Legs print and digital rewards.\nBlack Friday Deals\nI've added two Black Friday reward tiers that feature the House of Fear Dark Horse collected edition. I have limited quantities, so if you're looking for a signed copy of the Dark Horse book, act now.\nReceived a signed copy of the House of Fear Dark Horse collected edition, plus two copies of the standard Mr. Skinny Legs (and the digital rewards, too).\nReceived a signed copy of the House of Fear Dark Horse collected edition, plus the limited orange matte cover, and the green matte cover (plus the digital rewards).\nMilestone Bonus\nWhen the campaign reaches 100 backers, every backer will also receive a look behind the scenes. Call it a director's cut, a digital-deluxe version, or a making-of supplement, but this book will be more than just a script book. More than just a handful of sketches and inked pages, too.\nFor this digital book, I've pulled together all the resources I have from when we made the comic, including the various stages of the script, art changes and the discussions about them, character descriptions, sample colors, and so much more. \nAdd Ons  \nAfter you select a reward tier, Kickstarter will ask if you'd like to add any other rewards. If you backed a physical reward level, you can add one or more of these House of Fear comics.\nWhere do the Funds Go?\nBecause the rewards are already printed and ready to go, the bulk of the funding will be used for shipping, packaging costs, and Kickstarter fees. All remaining money will help us fund the creation of future issues of House of Fear.\nWhat About Shipping?\nAll comics are individually bagged and boarded. \nAny order that consists of 1 or 2 comics will be shipped in a sturdy, oversize envelope (stay flat mailers from Pratt Plus). These will be shipped via First Class Mail. \nAll orders of 3 or more comics will be shipped in a Gemini Mailer for added protection. These packages will be shipped via Priority Mail. \nMeet the Creators\nWill You Help Us Make More Comics?\nIt's simple: We want to make more fun, exciting comics and get them to as many readers as we possibly can. And we can't do that without support from readers like you.\nThank you for checking out our latest project. I hope you find a reward that suits you well, and when you do, that you back the campaign and help us continue making action-packed comics for kids of all ages.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done everything we can to minimize risk for backers: All of the rewards are printed, the comics are already bagged and boarded, and I've secured the necessary shipping supplies. \n\nWe're big fans of the Kickstarter platform, and this is our fourth House of Fear campaign.

Aneksi has lived as a ghost for centuries and has learned to rejoin the world of the living.  She is at the cusp of finding purpose in her unlife in the modern world of the living.  She is, however, bound by an ancient curse to a demon named Sabanion.  As Aneksi pushes more into the world of the living, she must drag Sabanion with her.  \nIssue #2 continues the story of Spectress and her demon partner, Sabanion, and their bloody escape from Containment Facility-4.  They go up against the Moon Crew, the wardens of CONFAC-4, and the Exorcists, priests that wield the unknown power of The Sacred Forlorn.\n \nThere's nothing quite like Spectress & Sabanion, but if you enjoy fast pacing, tension, mystery and the macabre (Hellraiser, Immortal Hulk, Justice League Dark, the works of Cullen Bunn) this is the book for you!\nA unique story incorporating ghosts, Egyptian mythology, magic, demons, Delta Force operators, exorcists and more.\n24 interior pages of intense, full-color art.\nInside paper is glossy 70 lb text.

Not a u-rah-rah but from a closer, more personal perspective that doesn't come through in movies or pop culture.\n\nKickstarter is an amazing platform where I hope to reach a larger audience.  I want more people to enjoy this gritty escape into a world of magic, murk, victory and tragedy.   Covid-19 has halted the convention schedule this year, I want to offer comic book fans that independent creator experience.\n\n             The funds we raise through this campaign will be used to pay for the printing and shipping of the book, as well as cover Kickstarter fees and some art costs.

Now, she is... The Last Ember!\nA hooded figure watches her every move from the shadows, while a serial killer hunts beings of power like Ember, slowly making his way to her.\n\nPreviously, Ember had trouble dealing with her new abilities, and accidentally set a few things on fire. Not to mention having a run-in with a school bully, alienating her friends, and being watched by a mysterious hooded figure. \nIn the epilogue, we learned of the man hunting down people like Ember as his quest brings him closer and closer to her doorstep.\nIn \"Hunted,\" Ember tries to rise above recent troubles and get back to some semblance of normalcy, but Tiana, her new nemesis, isn't quite done with Ember just yet. She and her minions set out to make life a living Hell for Ember.\nElsewhere, the hooded figure meets with Quincy, a new player on the board as they make some startling discoveries and run into some trouble of their own!\n\"Hunted\" #1 is the first chapter in a bold new direction for The Last Ember, and is a great jumping on point!\nInterview on KICKSTART THE WEEK\nwith NICOLE D'ANDRIA\nWe've now unlocked ALL our Milestone Bonuses!\nA digital copy of TART Vol. 1 has already been sent to all backers! \nYou'll be getting a print of Ember by Mike Watson of Freestyle Komics and Short Fuse Media digitally or physically!

He has also been lettering comics for the better part of two decades, with work published through Image Comics, Action Lab Entertainment, Arcana, Moonstone, AC Comics and more. Celestial Falcon is his first foray into full-on co-writing a project.\nFederico lives in Rome and works as a Comic Artist for Sergio Bonelli Editore, Aspen Comics, Noise Press, Blackbox Comics, Ink Forged Studios, Last Ember Press & Remer Comics and likes drawing everything especially American Superheroes.\nHi there, my name is Andrea Celestini and I'm a comic book colorist. I work for American indie publishers since 2008. I also color erotic graphic novels for the French market. I worked for Evoluzione publishing, Action Lab Entertainment, Monkeybrain Comics, Splotch Comics, Outpost 426, BlackBox Comics, Tabou Editions just to name a few. If there's action, super heroes, monsters, explosions or pretty girls, I'm the one you are looking for.\nNicole is the creator/writer of Road Trip to Hell, her first creator-owned project! She's a passionate comic book collector who has worked for Action Lab Entertainment as marketing director, submissions editor and a script editor. She has also worked on several of their adaptations, including Peter David's Artful and on the Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir comics. She helped write an issue of their ongoing DollFace series. She's also an accomplished freelance editor. Learn more at ComicMaven.com.\n\nThe funds we raise in this campaign will help pay for the remaining art and colors, as well as printing costs. Anything extra we are fortunate to raise will be poured back into the project for future issues.\nThis platform has, time and again, proven to be a phenomenal community for independent comics, and one we've had great success on. \nCollectively, Last Ember Press has successfully funded 8 previous projects:\nFor this book, we've brought in the top notch art team of Federico Sabbatini and Andrea Celestini that are taking this series to the next level. Add to that the experience of editor Nicole D'Andria, and the time and money we've put into the issue already, and we feel we have a product worthy of the fantastic backers here on Kickstarter!\nWe've also commissioned this gorgeous variant cover by Francesco Tomaselli (Heavy Metal), and there are more surprises to come during the campaign!\nThis book is a passion project for me, and is the flagship title of our company. Ember is a character that was literally birthed from the creation of this company and has become very near and dear to my heart, and important to the brand that we are building. This is why we continue to step up our game with each new issue.\nThe Last Ember is also the kind of book I love to read. Mystery, action, drama, magic and fantasy elements, and a touch of romance. It's got it all!\n\nCheck out this stunning preview of The Last Ember: Hunted #1 with beautiful line art by Federico Sabbatini and gorgeous colors by Andrea Celestini!\nLeft to Right: Danny, Tiana, Kendall, Ember, Gaby (in order of height).\n\nHelp us make sure even more people know about this campaign and learn about The Last Ember: Hunted!

Murder! Mystery!\n In an alternate 1920s, a clueless girl and a man-about-town team up to dive into New York's underground world of rum runners and black market magic.\nIn an alternate 1920s, America's 18th Amendment outlaws both alcohol and spellcraft--the technology once used to power modern American lives. While the Practical Scientists have stepped in with their new technology, Arcanists won't go down without a fight, and continue to trade spellcraft and crafting materials to keep the art alive.\nThe 18th Amendment and the Practical Scientists of America\nIn this double-length issue, the irreverent Chester Radison gets Emily involved in an underground spell-dueling club run by his bookie Mikey Hernandez. Our rag tag pair will have to contend with the seductive spell slinger Sherry Blair, and may even run into her husband, Connor Blair--who happens to be  a Practical gangster. And if Emily can survive all that, luncheon with her sister's fianc\u00e9 might be a piece of cake.\nBlack Ball Issue 3 is the next exciting installment in the world of Arcanists vs. Praticals, spell running, moonshining mystery and adventure!\nManga-sized, double-length issue: over 60 pages of half-seas hootnanny adventures with Emily, Chester, and a colorful cast of characters\nBeautiful hand-colored, palette shifting art work -- you never know what you'll see next on each page as the colors and tones help tell the tale\nOver 30 pages have NEVER BEEN PUBLISHED on any platform. This will be the first time over half this book is ever seen!\nHello! I'm Melissa J Massey, creator of fine fantasy comics like The Alchemist of Aurillia, a fantasy adventure in the Ottoman Empire, and Vatican Assassins, a tale of the Vatican's demon hunting militia. I'm best known for creating lovable and emotive characters and drawing epic architecture. As I always say: when in doubt, slap a cathedral on it.\nBlack Ball is my ongoing webcomic series, publishing online since 2018.\nI've been published in anthologies from Wannabe Press, Arcane Inkdustries, and Kara Love.\nBlack Ball is many things for me: a challenge to write a concise story; a fun exploration of historical fantasy; and a deconstruction of typical 1920s literature. But as I have written and drawn the story, it has evolved into something much bigger as I look at the characters and the effects of removing a technology that people rely on. So you may find some themes developing in this issue in particular that feel a little familiar.\n\nHere's what people say about Black Ball\n\"This thing crackles like a 20's comedy, albeit with sound and color (which just makes it even better). You've really taken it up a couple notches artwise, since your triumphant return, mj. \" - Charlie Wise, Groovy Kinda\n\n\"I've been loving the limited color palettes you've been using for prior pages and enjoying when you break that for emphasis, but I have to say, this page is my favorite so far- the colors are just gorgeous, and the reveal is beautiful! The hot pinks with the electric blue are so vibrant and really give this page great energy!\" -Nattosoup\nAs a history nerd, there's lots of time periods that I love. But fantasy stories haven't yet taken advantage of them all.\nOne day while chatting in a comic creators group online, the topic of different fantasy setting came up, and I thought of the 1920s as being a perfect setting. The gears started spinning, and I began putting together a tale of magic, murder, and mystery...thus, Black Ball was born.\nThe best part of making Black Ball is just how much fun it is. Emily embodies a lot of how I felt about myself in High School. Putting her up against Chester, her total opposite, has resulted in some of my best writing and art yet, and it has been a joy to create their adventure through New York's underground together.  At the end of the day, that's why I make comics - to have fun, and to share that fun with others. \nAnd also to deliver crushing blows every so often...they don't call me a purveyor of fine fantasy comics and tragic shenanigans for nothing!\nMost of the project funding will go towards printing books, ordering the extra products, and covering those shipping costs.\n\n\n\nLooking for more? The first 90+ pages  of Black Ball are available online to read for free.\n BRAND NEW REWARD TIERS! Original Art at Black Friday prices!!!\n\nBeing a solo creator is a real challenge, but thankfully I have the support of great fans like you that help me bring these projects to life.\nWith you, we can make Black Ball issue 3 a reality, continuing into the meat of the story from Issues 1 and 2. I hope you come along for the ride. It's gonna be a blast.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my third time running a Kickstarter and last time around was a very smooth campaign.

That doom, almost single-handedly, was brought by General Almond and his army of Nutcrackers who were determined to take over the Planet and steal its resources.\nIssue Two continues this epic story while adding more characters and obstacles! You will meet new characters like the ominous Jack Frost, the evil Caesar Dimitrius, and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future among others!\nIssue Two will be a 30-page comic book written by Ryan Haack, featuring interior art by Rafael Sam. The comic book will also include a five-page back-up story with art by Tom Barton. \nBRIC-A-BRAC #2 Interiors, Rafael Sam\nBRIC-A-BRAC #2 Interiors, Rafael Sam\nPage 1, The Tragedy of Jack Frost\nPage 3, The Tragedy of Jack Frost\nExclusive Jack Frost Print\nTHE CREATORS\nWRITER/CREATOR - RYAN HAACK\nMy name is RYAN HAACK and I'm the creator and writer of BRIC-A-BRAC! Since I was a little kid, I was fascinated by Christmas and all the lore surrounding it! I loved the imagery, the decorations, the holiday specials, and I still do to this day! BRIC-A-BRAC is my attempt at creating a story that can show adults and children how valuable and important Christmas is as a concept! It's an incredibly useful holiday with ideals and values which we can implement every single day of our lives! I am so passionate about this story and had an absolute BLAST writing in the dramatic, fun, and always exciting world that is BRIC-A-BRAC! I am the host of the FAR-FETCHED STORYTELLING PODCAST and the creator of the web-comic the UNSPEAKABLE TEXT, too!\nMe circa 2002\nINTERIOR ARTIST/CHARACTER DESIGNER - RAFAEL SAM\nBorn in S\u00e3o Paulo, and raised in Recife (PE), Rafael Sam has worked as a freelance illustrator and comic artist for 9 years. He has worked in the area of textbooks and also comic books, in cartoon style, concept art, and has made scenes for animations. Some time ago, he worked for DreamWorks Animation's comics division, where he made 3 editions of the Madagascar title. He recently worked on the catharsis-funded Black Desert author project where he made the official launch at ccxp 2018. His Instagram is @rafael1234hc. \nCOVER ARTIST/BACK-UP STORY ARTIST - TOM BARTON\nTom\u2019s been working as an illustrator for the last 5 years. He\u2019s done several comics, including a short webcomic series for League of Legends called \u201cOlaf Vs Everything\u201d. His biggest influences are the likes of Joe Madureira, Chris Bachalo, and Ed McGuinness. When he\u2019s not working on comics, he\u2019s coming up with character designs, concept art, and writing his own stories. His Instagram is @tomo_tron.\nPage 2, The Tragedy of Jack Frost\nFAN ART FOR BRIC-A-BRAC #2! \nChristmas Money by The Howl Comics\nGeneral Almond by @ZachDB\nGarret by Milton Aguiar\nGarret, Marie and the Spider-Snowman by MuttManComics\n\nTHE LOGISTICS\nAs mentioned before, this will be a 25+ page comic book. It will be identical in design to the last comic we produced for BRIC-A-BRAC #1. Because they are so similar, it was very easy for me to calculate shipping costs and how much I will need to deliver the best product possible. Here's some breakdowns for those interested:\nPRODUCTION OF COMIC (ART/LETTERING) : $5,000\nPRINTING (ISSUE 2 and REPRINTS of ISSUE 1): $1,000\nSHIPPING (NATION-WIDE AND INTERNATIONAL) : $2,500\nEXTRA FEES (KICKSTARTER FEES) :$500\n\nSHIPPING\nThis book will not be completed before Christmas, although we presently have about 20% of it done. My goal is to have it in your hands by January or February, which was the same time the books were in the backers hands with BRIC-A-BRAC #1. The digital books will be available first. This might be upsetting to backers, but digital copies of issue #1 will be available before Christmas 2020. If the physical copy being delivered before Christmas is a deal-breaker for you, we want you to know that this story is about the idea of Christmas--not the holiday. On Planet Christmas, Christmas is every single day.

Ramon Alejandro Est\u00e9vez-Guerrero roams the earth fighting these monsters in memory of his late wife and to make a better world for his daughter \u2013 he is the MONSTER MATADOR!\n WHO?\nRamon Alejandro Est\u00e9vez-Guerrero - the MONSTER MATADOR! \nWHAT?\nBorn from out love of Mad-Max, Kaiju and Santo and... telenovelas?! The Monster Matador is an action-packed mash-up of all those things, with more than a few laughs to spare. Just don't laugh at the Matador. He does not like to be laughed at.\nHOW?\nYes, how?! How exactly does a 6 ft tall Matador fight giant-sized-Kaiju monsters? With a cape and sword, of course. Sometimes also with dirty diapers, but we don't need to get into that here (hint, check out issue #2)\nWHY?\nUh, why not? But seriously did you not see the pull quote from DAVID PEPOSE of the hit Kickstarter THE  O.Z., or the one from Ringo-Award Winner RYLEND GRANT, or Kickstarter mainstay Clay Adams or... well, you get the picture.\nBut seriously, this book is a wild ride. If you love any of the things I mentioned above, or if you just love good comics, I promise you'll love MONSTER MATADOR. And for you art lovers out there, the book is drawn by Ringo Award Nominated artist FABIO ALVES (BANJAX, THE JUMP). Just check out this cover: \nFabio Alves Cover\n Right?!\nMONSTER MATADOR is written by Steven Prince with Colorist Alex Zief joining Fabio Alves on art duties. We launched the first issue of our 3-issue mini-series, Tango of the Matadors, on Kickstarter in June 2020 and were fully funded in 24 hours! Now we're back with Issue #2. \nOur campaign is to raise funds to print Monster Matador: Tango of the Matadors #2 and hopefully hit a couple of Stretch Goals along the way.\nPsst, these are our variant covers from Tony Donley (ALBERT EINSTEIN: TIME MASON) and FANGORIA artist Puis Calzada. \nTony Donley KS Exclusive and Puis Calzada Limited Variant\nIn Chapter 1 we met the Monster Matador in the midst of battle with the dreaded Volagante and her brood among the Mayan ruins in Guatemala. Fighting alongside a rag-tag group of locals and joined by a second \"Monster Matador\", they formulate a plan to defeat the Volagante once and for all...\nPLAY\n\nChapter 2 continues the story with action, adventure, romance, and... betrayal. I'm hesitant to give away more because there are some great twists and turns and a cliffhanger that I guarantee will have your jaw on the floor. Oh, and there's that thing about fighting monsters with dirty diapers I mentioned above.\nThe main story is 27 pages and will be printed on UV coated glossy paper with a 100lb UV coated cover stock. Here's a look at what to expect...\nRingo Award Nominee for Best Cover Artist, Fabio Alves (BANJAX, THE JUMP), draws our main cover with striking colors from Alex Zief (HATCHET, RAMAS) featuring the Matadors and Angelo riding to battle.\nFabio Alves Cover\nIn addition to the main cover from Fabio Alves, you can also choose from our Kickstarter Exclusive Cover by Tony Donley and Variant Cover by Puis Calzada with colors by Alex Zief. Both covers will be printed in extremely limited quantities.  \nTony Donley KS Exclusive & Puis Calzada/Alex Zief Variant\nMissed issue #1? Don't worry, we've got you covered. Choose from the main Fabio Alves cover, KS Exclusive by Kyle Roberts or the Check Your Matador Variant. Both the KS Exclusive and Check Your Matador are available in very limited quantities. \nAs a special thank you and bonus, each Issue 2 cover will come with its own trading card. Certain tiers will also come with an additional Signature card signed by Creator/Writer Steven Prince. And you'll also have the opportunity to get a mini-print of Tony Donley's Kickstarter Exclusive cover.\nHonestly, we just thought this was cool... and it looks pretty awesome, too. This 9x12 glow-in-the-dark screenprint is printed by world-famous Nakatomi Print Labs on 100lb Cougar White stock. For the color scheme we decided to go with the colors of the Mexican flag to represent the Monster Matador's heritage. \nArt: Fabio Alves. Color/Design: Steven Prince. Limited Edition of 55. S/N by Steven Prince\nWe have a very limited amount of Tony Donley original art Sketch cards that will be available in their own specific tier. Here's a peak at some of the cards:  \nYou'll also be able to get sketch cards from series creator, Steven Prince. Here's a sampling:\nFabio draws digitally, so original art from Tango of the Matador's is rare to put it simple. Tony Donley's cover, however, was done in pen and ink on Bristol board. This is your chance to own the 9x12 original art to Tony's Kickstarter Exclusive cover in a reward tier that includes everything but the kitchen sink!. \nAll backers will receive extra bonus content throughout the campaign, and we'll be adding stretch goals along the wat including stickers, prints, digital comics and more!\nDETAILS COMING SOON!!! \n\nAnd if there is some combination of rewards that you don't see or would like, we are happy to work with you and get you what you want.

Jump on board now, because this will be your only chance!\nHAUNTING is an ongoing supernatural horror comic series. It is written and created by Phil Falco, with art by Anna Wieszczyk, colors by Andres Samboni, and letters by LetterSquids.\nHAUNTING follows Bram, your average, everyday bratty teenager...who just so happens to RAISE THE DEAD!\nWherever he goes, ghosts appear - restless spirits that attack the living viciously and without prejudice. Bram has spent his entire life turning a blind eye to the destruction and deaths caused by his strange ability. But his recklessness finally catches up to him in the form of Deacon, a mysterious and vengeful man from his past. Deacon corners Bram and Faith, a small-town girl with a tragic past, in Dusty Springs. Now Bram will be forced to learn that his actions have consequences... whether he takes responsibility for those consequences is another question entirely.\nOur first Kickstarter was a success, so we're back with more supernatural goodness! When we last left Bram and Faith, the two had just barricaded themselves in a church mausoleum. Unfortunately for Faith, she is unaware of Bram's ability. And she has no idea just how much danger she's in!\n\nCheck out this 5-page Preview for HAUNTING #2 below!

Big time.... Before I get started if you'd like an audio version of this section, click to hear about the campaign in my own words whilst scrolling.\nA few years back I picked up a camera and filmed myself trying to poach an egg. I stuck the clip on the Internet... and it changed my life. I taught myself how to cook online and subsequently fell in love with good food, plus accidentally became part of a really cool story; inspiring people to cook, helping viewers through tough times and, I guess to a degree, becoming an online friend to lots of folk around the world.\nMy Wife (aka Mrs Barry) made this as she said it sums me up in two photos?!\nIf you don\u2019t know, I live in Weston-super-Mare, a small seaside town in South West England. I absolutely love pizza and want to share my passion for it here in my town by creating an artisan pizzeria complete with wood-fired pizza, fresh dough and the most funky, cosy layout that doubles up as a cooking school for all you guys around the world.\nThis is a huge passion project of mine, I\u2019ve been waiting on the right premises for 18 months, and it is just perfect. Of course it\u2019s risky, everything is, but I believe in it massively and want to give something back to my hometown, as well as to everyone whose followed my journey over the years.\nYes, that's me lol\nHere\u2019s the twist: the campaign is called 'The People's Pizzeria' because the Pizzeria doesn\u2019t have a name, logo, colour scheme, anything...yet. I want you to work with me and vote to decide those things and so much more! I also want to give a portion of any profits away to a charity every year, and again you can help me pick that. Who knows, if this works maybe it could inspire other creators to give back too in a similar way.\nI\u2019ve created some hopefully awesome rewards: behind-the-scenes video diaries, signed cookbooks, digital cooking classes, right up to having your name on the wall, or your own pizza on the menu! There really should be something for everyone so please do check them all out, some even feature some very special guests...\nHere's answers to some of the most popular questions i've been initially asked\nWill you still be doing videos? Yep, don\u2019t worry, the channel isn\u2019t going anywhere! In fact, I could potentially be doing even more! I\u2019d love to film extra videos in the pizzeria from time to time, do podcasts there, special events and of course I will be hosting cooking classes both in person and for the internet & selling kitchen gadgets there & online....I\u2019ve some pretty big plans for extra content, watch this space.\nWhat do you need to raise? I need to raise an absolute minimum of \u00a320k to help pay for a pizza oven and some basic other essential costs. Any extra funds raised can help with refrigeration, a dough machine, fitting out costs, staff, rent & ingredients, the list is endless, but this will get me started. IF I do pass the target, I have stretch goals.\nWhy crowdfund? I love the concept of having a collaborative project with a community. I\u2019ve seen & backed my friends like DanNerdCubed, Stuart Ashen and Paul Rose do it and it\u2019s very inspiring. I love that it\u2019ll help build a great community around the project straight from the beginning to help shape what it is and can be, something that\u2019s not just mine but ours.\nIf you don\u2019t raise enough funds will it happen? Probably not. I have to minimise risks to make it achievable, so if you think it\u2019s a cool idea and want to help make my dreams come true, please support it!\nCan I get a reward as a gift for someone? Yep, a lot of the perks have no time limit so you can get them as a voucher for a birthday, Christmas, that anniversary you forgot about (it's tomorrow, I've got your back) or just a general gift.\nI live overseas, what\u2019s in it for me? I've tried to make loads of the rewards available to everyone, things that will be posted or emailed. And you know you may even come to England one day & have a day out by the sea with your pizza voucher, visit the place that you helped create and see your name on the wall! How cool would that be?\nThe pizzeria will also mean more, fresh content for you to enjoy wherever you are in the world. And let's not rule out one day making more locations in other countries too - dream big right?!\nWhat about the cooking school part? This will be so cool. The pizzeria will also host and produce cooking classes. You can come in and attend courses in person and we will also over time start to create modules for download, co-hosted by myself and an expert in the field, alongside e-books and recipe cards. This really is just the tip of the iceberg (lettuce) of the plans.\nIf you can\u2019t support the campaign, I understand, but you can also help in other ways - It might be that you are, or know someone that makes signs or drinking glasses & can help out. But honestly the thing that would mean the most to me is if you shared this campaign with as many friends as you can that may discover and want to be part of the story. Hopefully you can see that this isn\u2019t just a restaurant, it\u2019s potentially something really special.\nLook, I know this is completely bonkers, going from learning to poach an egg to possibly creating my own pizzeria and cooking school. But I truly believe in this and, just like in Wayne's\u2019 World, maybe just maybe, \u201cif you make it, they will come\u201d.\nThanks so much for your support, please check out the perks and until next time\u2026 thanks for watching.\nBarry xx", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy biggest risk is going for it.

Well done, guys.\"\n~ JLS Comics\n\"I'm really excited for the ride and where it's going to go!\"\n~ Comic Uno\nIssue one of Celestial Falcon was completely self-funded. We then came to Kickstarter with a Deluxe Edition of that issue with a new back-up story and additional content, which was successfully funded and has shipped out to our backers.\nWe are dedicated and committed to this story and will release it whether it gets funded or not, it will just take longer without Kickstarter. \n For Last Ember Press, Kickstarter has played an integral role in our business, having successfully funded 7 previous campaigns to date. We love the community on this platform, and we value your pre-orders and contributions toward seeing our projects birthed and completed. We truly couldn't do this without you.\nBy helping us accomplish this goal, we will be able to complete issue 2 in a timely fashion and continue growing this series right here on Kickstarter with you!\nWe'll be using the funds raised in this campaign to complete the art on this issue, as well as get it printed and shipped out to all our backers! Any additional funds will go right back into production for future issues! Here's the general breakdown:\nCheck out these killer pages straight from the issue! Plans are made, threats are encountered and secrets are revealed!\nThe Characters\n We Care About Our Products \nAnd we know you do too! That's why we make sure they are as safe as possible, bagged and boarded, and inserted inside Gemini Comic Supply Comic Flash Mailers to protect your investment!\nAdditional smaller rewards, if applicable, will be secured in bubble envelopes and placed inside the mailers with the comics.\nThe Celestial Crate will be bubble wrapped and then inserted into another shipping box so that it is not damaged either.\nIf you have decided to join us on this journey, THANK YOU sincerely from the entire creative team of Celestial Falcon and everyone at Last Ember Press and Shooting Star Universe.\nWe are already working on the rest of the issue, and once it funds we'll kick that into high gear so we can get it into your hands sooner.\nIf you haven't decided yet, scroll back through the page, and if you're a fan of SUPERHEROES, SHARKS, SUPERNATURAL VILLAINS and FUN, COMING OF AGE stories, please show your support by backing this campaign!\nIf you have backed it, consider spreading the word so more people like you can find it!\nYou can direct your friends to CELESTIALFALCON.COM/ks2 or use one of these links:\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nThanks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe realize how risky backing a project can be, so we want to alleviate that concern.\n\nLast Ember Press has successfully funded 7 previous campaigns, 5 of which are fulfilled, 1 is in the process as I type this (books are shipping to our HQ now), and 1 is having the art finished up currently. We have delivered and often over-delivered on our promises at the end of the day and will continue to do so.\n\nLEP and SSU are in this for the long haul. We are passionate and dedicated to completing quality books and getting them in the hands of our readers.\n\nAs for Celestial Falcon #2, while the book is not yet done, we have continued working on it leading up to and are still working on it during this campaign in order to get it completed as quickly as possible. We have also given ourselves some buffer room this time in case things do get delayed, so that you can expect to receive your rewards in the estimated time frame detailed on the page above and in the rewards.\n\nWe value your support and know that at any given time there are a number of other projects you could be backing instead of ours. We greatly and deeply appreciate you choosing to put your support with us on Celestial Falcon #2.\n\nSo really, the only risk is missing out on an awesome project should you choose not to support it.

He's the first person born with superpowers.  The city's current hero, The Ascender, was patrolling the skies in a metal suit (like Iron Man).  After Johnny's brother got hurt by a psychopath, and the Ascender chose not to intervene, or even help, Johnny decided that he could do a better job, and became KINETIC.\nWell, after two years, eight issues, and thousands of books sold online and at conventions, he's beat the bad guy, mastered his powers, and got the girl.\nNOW WHAT?!\nKinetic: Identities #1 picks up where the story left off.  When a villain from his past is up to his old tricks, it's up to Johnny to save the day!\nBut is Kinetic a match for the villains when this time, they're ready for him?!\nIf you are a card-carrying Kinetic VIP, welcome back!  But if this is your first time hearing about this series, don't worry, I've got you covered.  You don't have to have know anything to read and enjoy this issue, and I've also got plenty of catch-up tiers to get you up to speed.\nThree Main Covers to Choose from!\nI get emails, messages, and even mail to my PO Box all the time asking me when there will be more Kinetic. \nI'm happy to know the answer: RIGHT NOW.\nThere are even more awesome rewards further down the page, but here's a sneak peak at a couple of our reward tiers for backers:\nAt some of  our higher tiers, we also have rare and Kickstarter exclusive rewards, such as Physical Scripts, and these Ultra-Limited Black and White Variants:\nUltra-Limited - ONLY 30 available!\nThis is the first time Kinetic is being offered internationally, but also, ALL ORDERS SHIPPED IN THE USA HAVE FREE SHIPPING!\nI've also got a few other fun surprises up my sleeve as the campaign moves forward...\nThough I'm the writer and creator, Kinetic wouldn't be able to happen without the help of my entire creative team!  They should get all the accolades for how great this book looks!  Here's a little about me, and the rest of the creative team:\nThis book wouldn't be able to happen without the help of my wonderful creative team, and I am proud to call them collaborators and friends!\nSince my very first time behind a booth at my first comic convention, Kinetic has built up a dedicated fanbase...\nAnd a few reviewers, and industry professionals have had some nice things to say, too!\nThere's been a little hiatus since the last Kinetic book released.  We've had to deal with losing an artist and finding a replacement.  Thankfully, we found a wonderful talent in indie comic veteran Luis Rivera.  I met him at a convention, and hit it off immediately.  With Luis onboard, we could get started again.  I am proud to say that, except for Rafael, the creative team remains completely unchanged!\nI just had to tell more of Kinetic's story.  Like so many of you, I've also fallen in love with the world of Velo City, and I knew Johnny's tale wasn't over yet.\nWe're coming back to Kickstarter because my first campaign was so successful, and I want to keep sharing Kinetic with this wonderful community.  Since joining Kickstarter as a backer, I've helped over 50 creators by backing their projects and make their dreams come true.  Kickstarter really is the place you want to find the newest and freshest comics!\nSince last year, we've been running the gauntlet with 2020.  So why now?  Well, with so much going on in the world, the best way I feel that I can help is to continue offering up awesome comics to you.  A sense of normalcy is important in turbulent times, even if it's just a little getaway time away from the madness.\nThe funds raised here will be used to fund the print run of Kinetic, Identities #1, and shipping those books to you.\nIf we're lucky enough to overfund, we'll put that towards making more great comics.\n I would never ask you to back something that I wasn't 100% sure we could completely finish in a timely manner.  The artwork is almost totally done for this book, and I think Luis and Omi did a great job:\nNow, you may notice a few characters are unfinished.  Astute eye, my diligent reader! For the first time ever, we are offering to have you (or a loved one!) DRAWN INTO KINETIC!  You can either be a citizen saved by Kinetic (and help him try to catch the bad guys) OR become a nefarious GOON.\nFind out more about that, and a ton of other fun reward tiers, below...\n\n\nHere's the plan:\nThis is the first campaign I have run where our custom reward tiers (being drawn into the story) actually mean the art is almost entirely done.  I'm factoring in extra time it will take Luis, Omi, and Lucas to have high end backers drawn in the story.  I doubt it will take as long, BUT I'd rather estimate a long time and get you the book ahead of schedule than the other way around.\nHere's what our timeline looks like:\nAgain, I think this timeline is the worst case scenario.  I'd rather estimate a longer time period, and deliver early, than the other way around.\nI want to get these books into your hands as fast as possible. \nWe've gotten our fair share of comics that arrived mangled by the mail carrier.\nYou pay premium prices on Kickstarter, and you deserve better. That's why we've started using Gemini Comic Mailers:\nThese babies are sturdy. They require a little more money, a little more time (and a lot more tape!) but it's worth it to make sure your comics arrive in pristine condition.\nAnd if somehow your comic still gets roughed up?\nI'll replace it free of charge.\n\nThank you for checking out this Kickstarter!  Kinetic would not be possible without the support of the wonderful fans, and I appreciate you giving me the chance to make my dreams of becoming a comic book writer a reality!\nNow, I'm going to ask you to look over our awesome reward tiers, find the one you like best, and let's get Kinetic: Identitites #1 in YOUR hands!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the best parts about working on Kinetic, Volume 1 was it let me get a lot of the inconsistencies and mistakes out of my system. This book is nearly complete: all that's needed now to finish the art is to add in any likenesses from the higher end reward tiers, and then send it to the printer. My last Kickstarter fulfilled before it's estimated time, and I will do my best to fulfill this campaign early, as well.\n\nWith the uncertainties in the world, mainly shipping delays due to COVID, we have added a healthy buffer in the timeframe to account for any delays. We've also estimated very, VERY conservatively for how long it will take to finish artwork and print the books.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital - Kinetic: Identities #1", "descp": "A digital copy of Kinetic: Identities #1.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Deluxe Copy - Kinetic: Identities #1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["30 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Physical - Luis Rivera Cover", "descp": "In addition to the digital version, you also get the physical book - Kinetic: Identities #1, featuring the Luis Rivera cover.

Show\n 4th Radom Original Art Give-Away art by Kevin Leen was shown on the SkyStorm Universe Sanctum episode 2 currently on YouTube search SkyStorm Universe\n An immense stone of extraordinary power held the layers of time in sync from the instant the universe itself was created. \nThe stone was placed outside the time stream by the Time Lords who watched over and protected the stone throughout eternity.\nThat was the plan.\nUntil it was that some of the Time Lords desired the stone for themselves and caused the stone to be shattered into shards and scattered throughout history. But not before they escaped and vanished to scheme anew.\nThe banished time lord Marta assembled her own group of villainous Rogues to find the time lost shards, promising them wealth and power beyond imagining. However, what greater power could they imagine but the Time Stone itself?\nChronos and the other Time Lords sent forth their own guardian Agents who were given the task of finding each shard in the hope once the stone was pieced back together, it would set time back into balance before eternity itself ceased to exist.\nAnd so began The PARADOX WARS\u2026\nTime Agents Tamara Rose and Christiana Blood land in a future where steam engines and dinosaurs roam the land. They discover Marta even has a presence in this time recruiting more to her band of rogues and the importance of a dormant volcano and how it will help them get back to their home base of Infinity... if it still exists.\nFor over 25 years, we\u2019ve brought you the adventures of the heroes and villains of the Skystorm Universe and now with this Kickstarter, we bring it all together in Paradox Wars: Shattered Time. \nAs we launch our first Kickstarter campaign for Paradox Wars the art and coloring is done we just need to wrap up the lettering. \nThen off to print, package and ship but... that\u2019s where YOU are needed!\nPrinting and shipping is expensive and a major cost of this project.

After years of touring, releasing solo music, studying art, producing, and collaborating on the NAMO record, we've finally decided to dive into something we've put off for far too long. We've been making music here in Nashville for most of our lives, but we've never made a record just the three of us... until now!\nAsher's a drummer, engineer, and record producer. Aedan's a visual artist, musician, and songwriter. Skye's a singer/songwriter with two EPs and a few tours under her belt. Thanks to COVID-19 we found ourselves grounded in Nashville with time to make music together. On the day of our first official band meeting, a massive storm pounded Nashville, followed by a rush of damaging winds. The next day, the meteorologists said that it was a weather phenomenon called a \"wake low\"--a rush of wind after a storm, caused by a spike in temperature. Thus, a band was born. The concept for the record was born, too.\n We know there's a lot of darkness in the world. Right now, we feel like our calling is making beautiful art, and writing good, true songs.\nOur goal is to record a twelve-song, self-produced album. We spent weeks in quarantine planning this record and writing the songs together, and we're super excited about the opportunity to make them as beautiful as we can and share them with the world. We've already been in contact with some of our dream engineers and players, and we can't wait to show you what we're working on! To give you an idea of the sonic landscape we're aiming for, some of our influences right now include The National, Brandon Flowers, Better Oblivion Community Center, Ethan Gruska, S. Carey, M83, and Tyson Motsenbocker. If we can get close to the way those artists make us feel, we'll be happy.\nBUDGET\nWe thought a lot about this campaign, and the number we've landed on is $16,000. This is a LOT of money. But we feel confident that with this budget, we can make a really great sounding record. With this goal, we'll be able to bring in some of our favorite musicians and engineers in Nashville work on this album.\nIJM\nHere's the awesome part. Although we can't give any funds raised on kickstarter directly to a charity, once the campaign is finished and the record is out, we'll be giving 100% of Wake Low's profits for a year to an organization we love called International Justice Mission. IJM is a non-profit that works around the globe rescuing victims of human trafficking. We're so excited for the opportunity to try to use music as a means to help vulnerable men, women, and children in need. Check out IJM's website here!\nREWARDS\nIf you can help us, we've come up with some super fun Wake Low rewards. Here are some of the things we'll be offering:\nStickers\nCDs\nT-Shirts\nPrints\nHand-written Lyrics\nCheck out the reward tiers in the \"Support\" section!\nHOW TO HELP\nThe best way to help is to either pledge here on this page, or share this campaign on social media!

It\u2019s been my dream since I was a kid, struggling with Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia, to be in the comic book business. Comic books helped me learn how to deal with my learning disability. When I was 14-years-old, I wrote fan fiction for the X-Men and submitted it to Marvel in hopes that Stan Lee would read it. Someone from Marvel was nice enough to write back to me saying that Stan loves to hear from his fans and encouraged me to keep up my writing. As naive as I was at the time, it spread my passion for the business like a wild fire and inspired me to go to art school at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Applied Media Arts. I have been working on Night Wolf since I was 16-years-old. The story and the characters have grown up with me, evolving into the amazing tale that it is today.\nWhy a werewolf comic book? Well, I have always loved any werewolf or supernatural related entertainment in movies, video games, etc. I didn't feel like there were any comic books out there doing werewolves any justice, so I decided to make a comic book based on a werewolf anti-hero myself. In high school, after I started developing Night Wolf, I got into Werewolf: The Apocalypse is a role-playing game by White Wolf Publishing.  I love the artwork in the game guides so much that I longed for them to put out a comic book to build on their world. Unfortunately, it never happened, but the artwork heavily influenced how I like my werewolves should look in my comics.\nCarlos Herrera is a Professional illustrator residing in Santiago City, Chile.

I appreciate so it so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm a relatively new creator and Night Wolf is my first comic book series. In April of 2016, I launched a failed Kickstarter campaign for Night Wolf Issues 1-3. I played the game on hard, setting a $20,000 goal. However, I did manage to raise $5,064 from my 74 backers, unfortunately Kickstarter is all or nothing. At the time I only had the character designs, a cover and 5 sequential pages during that launch. Even though the Kickstarter didn\u2019t fund I was bound and determined to publish my story. Because I didn\u2019t have the funds to finish the first issue, I decided to raise the money on my own doing freelance web design work to pay for the artwork. \n\nAfter self-publishing Night Wolf Issues 1 and 2, I launched another Kickstarter in October 2019 to print Night Wolf Issues 3 with a more reasonable funding goal of $5,000. The campaign successfully over funded, thanks to the amazing 217 backers that I refer to as my Wolf Pack. Now I'm back and ready for round 3 to print Night Wolf Issue 4.\n\nI know it seems like there's a lot going on all over the world right now that is very stressful for us all. Collecting, reading, and creating comics books have always been an escape from the stressful things in my life. My hope is that by creating my comics books and putting them out into the world for you to enjoy also helps to relieve some of your stress as well. And that is what I am laser focused on doing!\n\nIn addition, I have been educating myself through the Comixlaunch course, which is a Kickstarter training program created by Tyler James. Tyler is the Publisher of ComixTribe and has successfully funded over 17 Kickstarter campaigns.

Brown\u2019s Like Father, Like Daughter returns with a heart pounding sixth installment \u2013 self publishing for the first time under Calamia\u2019s brand Comic Uno, a reliable source in comics for over a decade. \nWriter - Kat Calamia\nNext to her weekly comic book reviews on Comic Uno, Calamia also currently works for Newsarama and DC Comics\u2019 DC Universe with bylines with IGN, Fandom, and TV Guide. She has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Communications and minor in Journalism through Marymount Manhattan and a MFA in Writing and Producing Television from LIU Brooklyn.\nArtist - Wayne A. Brown\nBrown has been an artist his whole life, being more passionate about art than anything in the world. He has a degree in Graphic Design, four wonderful children two boys and two girls, a beautiful wife.\nColorist - Lisa Moore\nLisa Moore is a comic book enthusiast, colorist and illustrator, who has worked as a colorist on books like GARFIELD, PEANUTS, BRAVEST WARRIORS, and more for BOOM! Studios, DAMSELS AND GRIMM for Dynamite and more. She's the writer of SECRETS OF WILLOWMYST from Last Ember Press where she's co-Publisher. She also just got married to her best friend - Brant Fowler!\nLetterer - Matt Bowers\nMatt Bowers is a Memphis, TN based artist that puts out an ongoing comic book simply called MEMPHIS. He also does freelance lettering for several indie comic book titles such as: Like Father, Like Daughter, They Call Her...The Dancer, American Dreams, Crucified, Concrete Jungle, Snatched, and Lawfully Evil \nLFLD #6 Regular Cover\nA father with superpowers, leaves his wife and daughter to become \u201cInvulnerable\u201d - the world\u2019s only superhero. Ten years later his daughter discovers that she has inherited the very superpowers that made her father leave their family.\nSix issues later - Casey and Invulnerable begin to reconnect, but is it too late? Following Like Father, Like Daughter #5\u2019s big revelation \u2013 issue 6 lifts the curtain on Casey\u2019s mother\u2019s double life.\nJessica pays Jim\u2019s mother a visit.\n This issue is all about the VILLAINS \u2013 characters just as grounded as the superhero plot!\n\nFollowing the release of the Like Father, Like Daughter #1\u2019s variant cover by Zack Dolan. We wanted to debut even more variant covers for Like Father, Like Daughter #6 from some amazing artists - exploring all different sides of the Like Father, Like Daughter universe.\n Cover B \u2013 \u201cThe Future/Celebrating Pride Month\u201d \u2013 Wayne A. Brown \nThese first two arcs have had a very heavy focus on Casey and her family drama, but I\u2019ve always said the heart of this book is and will always be Stephanie and Casey\u2019s friendship. Stephanie has been a support system for Casey, and now it's Casey\u2019s turn to be that for Stephanie as she explores her own self-identity. \nThere are plenty of coming out stories in media, but not many for bisexuals, and this is something I really wanted to explore with Stephanie's arc. I\u2019m excited for everyone to meet Stephanie\u2019s new love interest, Faith! It\u2019s a storyline I\u2019m very proud of that I can\u2019t wait for the world to see.  \nCover C \u2013 Black and White \u2013 \u201cFamily Reunion\u201d \u2013 E.V. Cantada\nAs our second arc continues you will be seeing the darker side of Like Father, Like Daughter. If you thought our first arc had an emotional punch \u2013 just you wait. E.V. Cantada the artist for my comic book, They Call Her\u2026The Dancer, beautifully displays this intensity with a Black and White variant. \n Cover D \u2013 \"Welcome to the Band\" - Sarah Leuver AKA ComickerGirl \nSure - there\u2019s a lot of drama, but Wes, Stephanie, and Casey\u2019s friendship will bring some levity along the way, as you can see with Comickergirl\u2019s variant, best known for her DC TV fan art. \nBack up both Brant Fowler's The Last Ember #1: Reforged and this Kickstarter at their physical tiers or higher to receive this beautiful print by Linnea Jalando-on, best known as @PapurrCat on Twitter.

Thank you so much!\n ...and some sweet stretch goals unlocked! (See below)\nThe king\u2019s dragon trainer is fired for accidentally unleashing a mutating corruption on the royal stables. Now, he must save his job and his reputation by finding a long-lost cure before the advancing orc horde takes advantage of this new weakness in the kingdom\u2019s defenses.\nThe main character in Mythic Creature Trainer is Ulrick.\nHe loves his pet griffin and takes him everywhere. Ulrick is always trying to get his housemate, Felka to help him out of a tight spot. She's a palace sentinel: an elite force of king's guards. Felka doesn't really care if Ulrick succeeds or fails, but she'll pitch in when it suits her.\nUlrick's boss is not all that he seems. Kevin the goblin has his own plans, and he's willing to throw Ulrick under the bus to get there.\nWhen orcs and goblins get together, that means trouble.\n Ulrick will discover the hard way that approval from others isn\u2019t the most important thing in life. There are characters in the story that will stand at different points on this spectrum: some crave approval and status, while others shun it and do what they feel like, without regard for others. \nWill Ulrick save the city and his reputation? More importantly, will he stay a total flake or become a towering pillar of integrity?\nBumper-sized 48-page issue!\nThis isn't my first Kickstarter! \nI've funded and fulfilled to satisfaction 2 other campaigns in the last 2 years. Here's some feedback from happy backers:\nSome of my happy kickstarter backers!\nHi! I'm Ren\u00e9, Australian cartoonist. I created, wrote and drew Mythic Creature Trainer.\nI've worked in the animation industry for over 20 years: in character design, animating for Disney on 10 different films, making flash animation for software and pilots for TV series. I was a storyboard artist on Classic Tales and Bob\u2019s Burgers.\nIn 2018 I funded my first graphic novel on Kickstarter, Sneaky Goblins: an all-ages story of fantasy mayhem, inspired by Adventure Time cartoons, Tolkien and World of Warcraft. I followed that up with a new comic: Sneaky Goblins at College, which successfully funded in 2019.\nSome of the films, TV and comics I've worked on:\nI've always loved drawing and telling stories. Making this book was a labor of love, and I hope that comes through as you read it.\n Included in every copy of Mythic Creature Trainer #1: Sophie the Spy is a 9-page short story, written by me and drawn by the talented Jake Kalsbeek, animator and cartoonist hailing from San Francisco! \nJake K, artist on Sophie the Spy\nJake worked as a 3D animator for games, DVD, commercials and TV, and has begun posting pages for nis new webcomic, Super Rocket Space Punch! Jake has strong memories of his first time experiencing E.T. in the movie theater as a five year old, reading Calvin and Hobbes in elementary, and finding Miyazaki\u2019s Nausicaa manga in college.\nSet before the events of Mythic Creature Trainer, this short story introduces us to the world of creature trainers, and shows us the link between the Sneaky Goblins storyline and Mythic Creature Trainer.\nSophie in spy mode: ingratiating herself with the savage orc tribe!\n \n   It's been so awesome to have Jake involved in the comic. Having another comic artist make his version of my characters is such a blast- it almost feels like my comics are gaining a life of their own!\n If you've been following the adventures of Sneaky Goblins, you might find this chart useful:\nYou get every single story pictured above when you back at the Catch-up Bundle!  (AU$90) pledge level and higher.\nMy 2018 Kickstarter: the Sneaky Goblins graphic novel!\n\nMythic Creature Trainer #1 comes in the regular BLUE SKY edition plus two limited-edition variant covers: CORRUPTION and SOPHIE THE SPY. Check below for full details about all reward levels.\nYou can grab yourself a limited SOPHIE THE SPY cover with the 'All the Editions!' pledge level.\nOver the last year, I've been making and posting the pages of this comic on my weekly webcomic: www.mythiccreaturetrainer.com. Now the first chapter is complete, and it's time to print the book! With your help, I'd love to make this book a reality, and get it into the hands of readers like you. \n\u00b7 A massive 48 pages, including cover\n\u00b7 full colour\n\u00b7 Perfect bound\n\u00b7 Cover: 105lbs (It'll feel sturdier than your average floppy comic book)\n\u00b7 Interior paper: 70lbs\n\u00b7 Size: 6.625 x 10.25in. \nIt will be beautiful!\nThe comic pages are 100% complete and ready for print! Your pledge will make this book a living, physical reality: a crisp, sweet-smelling printed comic book. \nAnd we're so close. Once this campaign funds, all l have to do is make the Thank You page and then send the files off to the printer.\nHere's my process for making a comic page: from rough sketch, to inks, to final colours:\nThe amount raised will all go to funding a print run of 1000 copies of the comic. Copies of the comic left over after the campaign will be stock that I can sell at comic conventions, libraries and book shops.\nI've come to Kickstarter to help get this book into as many hands as possible, and I'd love your support to bring it to life.\nLet's have a peek inside!\n\nWant more? GET A FREE PDF SAMPLE OF THE COMIC HERE!\nHere's what you get in each pledge level... with pictures!\n\n Here's some more of those signed sketches included in the AU$55 level and above:\nThey look great framed in regular 6x8\" window frames from Target:\n I made a process video making one of the sketch rewards:\n Check out more of the sketches available on this Pinterest board.\nYou can tell me which character you'd prefer in the comments, or through the Kickstarter survey at the end of the campaign, once the pledges have gone through. I can't guarantee you'll get the drawing you want, but I can get you your favourite character!\n Stretch goals UNLOCKED!\nWhat will the funds be used for?\nI'm only on Kickstarter to print the book and get them out to all of my wonderful backers! I'm not trying to make money or reimburse myself for any of the time I spent making the comic itself.\nThe whole amount raised will go back into the book, the rewards, and  shipping it out safely to you:\nYou should have your books by the end of November 2020.\nI plan on sending the final book files to to the printer as soon as the funds come through from Kickstarter (about 2 weeks after the campaign ends).\nPrinting will take a month or two- at the most. \nPostage is a bit more unpredictable, especially given the current state of the COVID-19 epidemic. But I've built in a buffer just in case there is a delay at any stage.\nI'll be packing and shipping the books from Melbourne, Australia, and from Pennsylvania, USA.\n Want to help the campaign?\nI'd love a share on the socials!

Oven-safe, non-stick silicone dividers that will streamline your cooking and divide your ingredients, to make one-pan meals and meal prepping a breeze.\nEveryone loves sheet pan cooking, but it\u2019s not always as simple as putting everything in the oven together and coming back to find it has all cooked evenly. Reality is, not everything takes the same amount of time to cook. With Cheat Sheets, you can easily remove ingredients when they're ready and never overcook them again.\nWe get it... If you're new to oven cooking, it can feel like a bit of a science experiment that involves a lot of guesswork. That's why we've tested the most popular everyday ingredients and created an easy timing guide so that you\u2019ll get perfect results every time.\nCheat Sheets are made for meal prep. With our modular dividers, you can cook all of your ingredients with even better organization and control. \nYou can fit up to 6x small portions or 3x large portions on a single sheet pan and with multiple sets, you'll have everything you need to prep for the family or a week's worth of meals.\nWith Cheat Sheets you can easily separate ingredients and flavors without having them mingle. Whether you want to use different marinades, cook savory and sweet dishes at the same time, or simply don\u2019t want your food to touch, Cheat Sheets has you covered.\nSeparation also comes in handy for families with different preferences, allowing you to create different portions for those with special dietary requirements or specific tastes - because not everybody likes pineapple on their pizza.\nAluminum foil and parchment paper are hugely wasteful and non-recyclable. Sheet pans are also notoriously difficult to clean, collecting stains and grime with every meal.\nWith Cheat Sheets you'll never have to scrub another sheet pan again and you'll save tonnes of wasted paper and foil. Cheat Sheets are naturally non-stick so clean-up is a breeze. They're also dishwasher safe!\n\nThe Cheat Sheets dividers are made with a premium, food-grade silicone material resistant to temperatures up to 450 degrees F. The dividers will fit on a standard half sheet pan or perfectly on the Prepd Sheet Pan included with each set.\nThe Prepd Sheet Pan is made from Aluminized Steel and coated with a non-stick PTFE and PFOA free coating.\n\nAround 18 months ago we had an insight...\nOut of all the Prepd Pack owners (now over 100,000 people), those who consistently meal prep all use sheet pans. But sheet pans have never changed since their inception. They are hard to clean, require you to constantly waste parchment paper and aluminum foil and are not designed to best serve how we actually cook, ie, multiple items in the oven at once.\nWe knew there had to be a better way. A solution that is easier to clean and gives ultimate versatility to the sheet pan. Allowing you to easily time each ingredient of the meal. A zero-waste solution removing the need to constantly create non-recyclable waste.\nWe were immediately drawn to silicone as it is completely food safe to high temperatures, naturally non-stick, long-lasting and resistant to bacteria. In our first phase of development, we tried dozens of different types of silicone and different colors to ensure our solution would be stain-resistant and have perfect heat transfer. Then we started our testing and prototyping phase. \nThis is where we started cooking meals in the Cheat Sheets to ensure every dimension was perfect and more importantly, food cooked just as well as on a 'naked' sheet-pan.\nWe then opened our first tooling, received FDA approval and did a wider beta test. The feedback was phenomenal all round.After hitting our Kickstarter funding goal we have kicked off all of our final tooling so that production can begin shortly after the campaign end.\n\"Cooking just might be the single most important thing you can do for your dietary health . . . \"Cooking just might be the single most important thing you can do for your dietary health . . .

It doesn\u2019t have to always be health food, so long as you cooked it and know the ingredients, that's enough.\nSince we started Prepd in 2015 it has been our sole focus to help make preparing meals at home easier and more enjoyable. By creating tools and systems to help make healthy living easier, we hope to make healthy resolutions - lifelong habits.\nPrepd was founded by two industrial designers, Chris Place & Will Matters.

We think our readers are smart enough to know that we aren't condoning these things, but we also know that in 2020, some people don't want to read about it. So: fair warning. \nThere's also donkey-f*cking.\nFRIED Comics is a proud purveyor of offbeat, irreverent pulp fiction since 2013, and a labor of love for Clay Adams and Alexandre O. Philippe.\nSo far, we have seven successful Kickstarters under our belts. (And between us we have a lot of belts. ) So, we're stoked to return to the scene of the crime.\nClay is a writer and filmmaker who's funded seven projects on Kickstarter with FRIED Comics. His feature script, THE ECLIPSE, placed second in the horror category of the FADEIn Awards, and his latest comic, ELECTRIC YOUTH, co-written with Kyle Roberts, was recently featured in the LA Times. He has written and directed for television and holds a BFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU. When Clay first met Alexandre, he thought, \"My, what a sophisticated European.\" Boy, was he wrong!\nFilm nerd/director Alexandre's most recent documentary is LEAP OF FAITH: WILLIAM FRIEDKIN ON THE EXORCIST. He holds a Masters Degree in Dramatic Writing from NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and has written and directed numerous award-winning films and documentaries, including MEMORY: THE ORIGINS OF ALIEN, 78/52: HITCHCOCK'S SHOWER SCENE, AND THE PEOPLE vs. GEORGE LUCAS. When Alexandre first met Clay, he thought, \"My, what a stupid American.\" Boy, was he right!\nLeila is a comic book artist and writer living in Portland, Oregon. She draws SLEEPLESS, SHUTTER and writes AFAR at Image Comics. Leila has drawn for titles such as THE WICKED + THE DIVINE, SCARLET WITCH, AMERICAN VAMPIRE, and THE PANTHEON PROJECT. In 2015 and 2016, Leila was nominated for the Russ Manning Promising Newcomer Award for her work on SHUTTER. She only took this job because she thought she'd be paid in fries.\nBrett Nienburg is a Denver-based artist who has worked as a concept artist for LEGO and  designed sets for feature films. We're sorry we made him peel so many potatoes. He looks pretty sad about it.\nCharles is from Canada, so we imagine he looks like one of those flappy-headed dudes from South Park.* He has lettered books for Aftershock, Image, IDW and Top Shelf (among others) and is a founding member of Frozen Beach Studios. (*As far as we know, Charles has a normal-looking head.) \nUgh. Just... ugh.\nThe Package\nWe've gotten our fair share of comics that arrived mangled by the mail carrier.\nYou pay premium prices on Kickstarter, and you deserve better. That's why we've started using Gemini Comic Mailers:\nThese babies are sturdy. They require a little more money, a little more time (and a lot more tape!) but it's worth it to make sure your comics arrive in pristine condition.\nAnd if somehow your comic still gets roughed up?\nFrieda will replace it free of charge.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nPLAY\n\nWe are coming to Kickstarter to put the first two issues into print.

Each story in the series follows an \"unspeakable\" event that's been intentionally hidden from the world by supernatural forces. UT is an extremely unique anthology because every single story is written by the same person, (me) Ryan Haack! \nWith this volume, we're bringing you seven short comic stories (black and white), the first act of a graphic novel (in color) and five short prose stories! It's my goal to create a cohesive, truly unique experience with UT2 and I can't be more excited to be able to bring it to you through Kickstarter! \nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to fund the printing and shipping of the SECOND volume. If you look at the rewards, you get a deluxe reprint of the FIRST volume of UT with extra content along with the second. Don't worry, we got ya covered! :)\nSo what are these stories really about?\n In the past, Unspeakable Text focused on stories in many different places all over the world. It was fun to explore new and exciting locations but there seemed to be a lack of any real focus and the stories really didn't affect each other like I hoped they would. With this new effort, our goal is to create a more cohesive and integrated narrative thread by bringing you unique stories all based in North America. \nThe Macbeth (Page 1) by Andrew Anthony\nPage One of The Lost Episode, art by Magin Marques\nIn Unspeakable 2, you will meet the most infamous scribe of the Unspeakable Text: Ichabod Crane, and his newfound purpose after that night at Sleepy Hollow. You will read tales involving Erinyes of fate, math problems that manifest, mutated beasts and so much more. And yes, you will be taken to cities like New York and Chicago, to the unforgiving Death Valley desert,  and to secret societies hidden deep underground. Each of the fourteen stories are based in a different location and depict unique characters and obstacles. \nWhatever Happened to Ichabod Crane (Page 2) by Giovanni Oliveira\nBen Tomb (Page 1) by Jarrod Bezzina\nMath Storm (Page 1), by Bobby Sassone\nMr. Frost (Page 10) by Carlos Rodriguez\nGhost Train Running (Page 1) by Todd Kale\nI'm truly blessed to be able to work with some of the best artists I've ever known in this volume. Putting this line-up together has been such a joy and I hope you can see it from the samples I've provided.  This campaign features eight short comic stories all written by me (Ryan) and drawn by incredibly talented artists:\nCarlos Rodriguez - @carlosrdzart\nTodd Kale - @toddkale\nAndrew Anthony - @axemanandrew\nRobert Sassone - @coolbonesman\nBoogie Bot - @boogiebotcomics\nGiovanni Auditore \nJarrod Bezzina - @jarrod_shujin_bezzina\n @pinelo_art\nEric Kent - @ericlkent\n Yes, you heard it correctly. We're bringing five short prose stories in the mix this time around, all written by Ryan. \nIn these stories, you will encounter small-town legends, twists on famous Bible stories, and ancient fish that live deep down in the sea, possessing secret knowledge. There's so much more I could tell you about these stories, and I guarantee you I wouldn't put them in this anthology if I didn't think they fit.

Bram has spent his entire life turning a blind eye to the destruction he's left in his wake and to the deaths he's indirectly caused.

Therefore, I've taken great consideration to make Bright Ideas, Dark Mind of the highest quality I can.\nOf course!\nEach physical book will receive a numbered and signed 3\" x 4\" bookplate, exclusive to Kickstarter! Pretty cool, right?\nI mean, since you're helping me make this thing I wanna make sure you have something you can't get anywhere else.\nKeep an eye out for an upcoming Kickstarter update where YOU can help choose the final art!\n \n  Hey, there! I'm Ryan Kroboth, and I'm an illustrator, colorist, and writer from Pennsylvania. \nMost of my art education has been self-taught through books (and later blogs). However, in the last few years I've taken digital coloring, lettering, art, and digital inking courses through Comics Experience. \nThrough these classes, I\u2019ve experienced a large leap in my artistic growth in a short period of time. The biggest being learning to color digitally, and learning about color in general.\nPerhaps one of the most exciting parts of Bright Ideas, Dark Mind is it contains just about all of my digital colors after the Comics Experience course. You\u2019ll get to see my experimentation and growth across the course of the book!\nI have a passion for teaching, and I love sharing the lessons I\u2019ve learned with others. And I\u2019ll be sharing a story or two throughout the campaign.\nTo bring you the best possible book, I teamed up with Dave Lentz to help me with the logo and the finalized design of the book. Dave has been a big help with Sunmaker, and you'll see some of his art in Bright Ideas, Dark Mind in our Cthulhu story!\nHere's a bit more about Dave:\nDave Lentz is a family man, letterer, graphic designer, and sometimes artist. When he's not making comics he's usually reading them.\nHe is a fan of Star Wars, Batman, Ninja Turtles, and ninjas in general. \nSome of his credits include Metalshade, Spero: Breaker of Worlds (coming soon from Source Point Press), and Arabella Damage (coming soon from Action Lab).\nYou can find some of the things he do here\nFew things get me as pumped as an awesome art book!\nWhat's not to love?!\nWhile some collectors are looking for a single image that resonates with them to hang on their wall, I prefer a book that collects the work of an artist.\nI love seeing the growth across multiple projects. \nNot only that, but I feel like I get more value from an art book. I wanna see all the art!\nAnd I wish more artists collected their work into books. I feel it's not a common thing in the comic artist space... I'm always looking when I find a new artist I dig! Seriously, every artist should make an art book!\n(You can ask my friends. I'm always bugging them.)\nWith my passion for art books, I'd love the opportunity to offer one of my own.\nReaching the point in my artistic journey to consider this is a bit mind-blowing, honestly.\nAs there was a point that I almost gave up on art.\nIn high school I discovered Deviant Art. This was my first window into seeing art from other artists. The sheer talent of the work crushed my confidence. In retrospect I know this is silly, but at the time I felt like I'd never be \"good enough\". So I stopped drawing for a very long time.\nAsk any artist and they will tell you drawing is a part of who you are.\nEventually I found my way back. And through the encouragement of my wife I finally took the steps of becoming the comic artist I'd always dreamed of being.\nI'm still learning and growing. Over the last few years I've released two self-published creator owned comics, done several anthologies, and had the privilege of sharing the worlds of other creators by doing pinups and a few covers.\nBright Ideas, Dark Mind collects developmental material and sketches of those pieces.\nAnd I'm hoping to raise money on Kickstarter to fund a print run of the book so I can share those with you.\nAt one point seeing great art crushed my confidence, now it inspires me.\nI'd love the chance to inspire you and others.\nThe book is already 99% complete! The only page left to complete is the one bearing your name as a backer.\nI'm looking to print 100 digital-press copies of the book through PrintLore.\nTherefore, most of the funds will go to cover printing costs. Kickstarter and Stripe take a small fee off the top, with the rest of the money raised going to cover shipping.\n \n   \n  Here's what to expect for the campaign:\nAs an avid collector of books, I want to make sure you receive your book in excellent shape.\nNot only will it be shipped in a Lil Packaging bukwrap cardboard mailer to keep your book protected, you will find it secured by cardboard inserts and wrapped in a plastic sleeve to shield it from the elements.\nBut the real secret?\nNinjas.\nThat's right. Your own personal package protector. These guys will keep your shipment safe, as no one wants to mess with a ninja.\nNo one.\nWhile I've done my best to attempt to select shipping materials that will best keep your product safe, I'm aware that things do happen.\nIf for any reason you receive a package at fulfillment that doesn't meet your quality standards I will replace it at absolutely no cost to you.\nI know there are collectors out there, and I want your book to make it to you in excellent condition.\n Thank you for the opportunity to share my project with you.\nI'd like to ask for your support in bringing Bright Ideas, Dark Mind to life. Please back this campaign today and allow me to share my journey with you!\nWith gratitude,\nRyan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI understand what it means to ask for your support. \n\nThis is my third Kickstarter, so I (more-or-less) know what to expect.\n\nThe biggest challenge to the campaign is the outside vendors, namely our printer. I have nothing but confidence in our printer, PrintLore. I've worked with them on my previous Sunmaker campaign. If any problems arise, I have had great communication from the company and I don't think that will change.\n\nAll the shipping supplies have been purchased, meaning all shipping costs will be for postage.\n\nI'm very familiar with Kickstarter platform having backed over 300 campaigns. This helps give me insight to what a backer looks for and expects. In addition, I am a part of the ComixLaunch course which specializes in crowdfunding comics. With this community I have an experienced group to turn to should the unexpected arise.\n\nAnd above all, I pride in communication.

We're Fred Schroeder & Dave Kellett: Directors of the award-winning comics documentary STRIPPED. That Kickstarter-backed film got to #1 on iTunes, and featured the first-ever interview with Calvin & Hobbes creator Bill Watterson. And today, we'd like to talk to you about a new interview series focusing on comics and animation called Story/Line.\nStory/Line will be a love-letter to the art of cartooning, featuring in-depth, thoughtful interviews about the craft. These will be deep conversations, in the style of a PBS or BBC interview. Each will be beautifully shot in 4K, with one of the best crews in Los Angeles. Among our four Kickstarted interviews, we've already scheduled with Academy Award-winning Directors Chris Miller & Phil Lord (Spider-Verse, The Lego Movie, and every other great movie from the last decade), Eisner-Winning cartoonist Scott McCloud (The Sculptor, Understanding Comics, 24-Hour Comics Day), and the Eisner-Winning cartoonist Raina Telgemeier (Smile, Sisters, Guts)!  \nWe're still booking guests for STORY/LINE. And like we did with STRIPPED, we're actively reaching out to a diverse variety of creators for this first season, and the hoped-for seasons to come!\nAs you can imagine, shooting at television quality and paying our crew and artists what they rightfully deserve costs *cough-cough* a big chunk o' change. We've already conducted an interview with Jake Parker (Skyheart / Inktober), and a secret BONUS interview (see reward tiers, below!) -- so we've been able to METICULOUSLY budget the costs for four more episodes. Have a look: \nAnd here's the really good news: If this Kickstarter allows us to make this first mini-season of Story/Line, we're hoping it lays the groundwork for ongoing seasons with many more interviews! \n Here's a quick guide to help you decide what rewards you'd like for backing the project! \n This Kickstarter is about the production of delightful, downloadable interviews -- so every reward will be getting that in one shape or another. But in addition to those episodes, higher tiers will also be receiving awesome items such as...\nFred Schroeder is an award-winning film-maker, with thousands of hours of TV, film, and commercial experience here in Los Angeles and around the world.

He also holds two Masters degree in the history of comics, which prepared him for LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE BUT DOING THIS SHOW.

So, while filmed projects are notorious for unforeseen/unexpected costs, we believe we've safely projected what we'll need to complete the project as planned.\n\nSCHEDULE: While there is always a risk that unforeseen production delays could occur, we are committed to making Story/Line.

He has also been lettering comics for the better part of two decades, with work published through Image Comics, Action Lab Entertainment, Arcana, Moonstone, AC Comics and more. Celestial Falcon is his first foray into full-on co-writing a project.\nLucas Santos (Penciler, Cover Artist)\nLucas is a 2D and 3D artist developing artwork for comic books, and concept art for the entertainment industry.

She also inks and creates clip art among other things.\nVariant Covers by Lisa Moore, Riccardo Faccini and Lucas Santos.\nWhy Celestial Falcon became the story I had to share with the world:\nChris: Growing up, I loved writing. I loved telling stories to people who would listen. Celestial Falcon is a story that was created around a time where the world needed a bit of hope. HOPE: that was what I wanted this character to represent above all else. Of course there\u2019s your \u201ctruth and justice\u201d but 'hope' had to be the number 1 thing. In the times we live in right now the world needs a little bit more light, a little bit more positivity and that is what I wish to bring the world through my stories, our writing, through Celestial Falcon.\nWhat attracted me to the story of Celestial Falcon:\nBrant: Early on in my friendship with Chris, he shared with me the story behind Celestial Falcon. He and his friends had created a YouTube series called Epic Story years ago that was one version of the story, which I watched in its entirety. I could see the passion Chris had for these characters and this world. When I read the actual stories the videos were derived from I began to understand the rich and detailed world Chris had crafted.\nWhen Chris asked me to come on as co-writer on the book, I was a little hesitant because I didn't want to step on his toes, but at the same time I felt I had something to add to this world. Together, we have tweaked and modernized the story and taken it to a whole new level, intertwining our writing styles and voices to make something truly unique. And while, yes, it's a superhero book, there's a lot more to it than you see on the surface, and I'm very excited to reveal some of those secrets, twists and turns as the series moves forward!\nCheck out our interview on ComicFrontline.com with Nicole D'Andria by clicking here or clicking the image below!\n \"Very professionally done.

I loved telling stories to people who would listen. Celestial Falcon is a story I started to write back when I was 15 years old. It was a personal story I honestly started to write about myself. My original pitch was \u201cit\u2019s my life with a super hero twist\u201d. This was a story I wrote mostly for my close friends and family to read and enjoy, which they did. As I continued to write Celestial Falcon, I realized how passionate I was about this story above all my other stories. Books filled with over 20 stories, outlines of futures stories, time lines, characters\u2026 a whole universe was created almost overnight from Celestial Falcon. Fast forward nearly 15 years later I decided to team up with my closest friend Brant Fowler to bring the world this story in comic form.\nCelestial Falcon was created around the time where the world needed a bit of hope. HOPE: that was what I wanted this character to represent above all else. Of course there\u2019s your \u201ctruth and justice\u201d but hope had to be the number 1 thing. In the times we live in right now the world needs a little bit more light, a little bit more hope and THAT is what I hope to bring the world through my writing, through Celestial Falcon.\nBrant Writes...\nWhat attracted me to the story of Celestial Falcon:\nEarly on in my friendship with Chris, he shared with me the story behind Celestial Falcon. He and his friends had created a YouTube series called Epic Story years ago that was one version of the story, which I watched in its entirety. I could see the passion Chris had for these characters and this world. When I read the actual stories the videos were derived from I began to understand the rich and detailed world Chris had crafted.\nWhen Chris asked me to come on as co-writer on the book, I was a little hesitant because I didn't want to step on his toes, but at the same time I felt I had something to add to this world. Together, we have tweaked and modernized the story and taken it to a whole new level, intertwining our writing styles and voices to make something truly unique. And while, yes, it's a superhero book, there's a lot more to it than you see on the surface, and I'm very excited to reveal some of those secrets, twists and turns as the series moves forward!\nThis team has put their own money into this project already, producing the standard edition from their own pockets, not to mention all the time invested. The main story is COMPLETELY DONE and the backup story is penciled and inked! It will be done during the campaign.\nWith your support, we can take this Deluxe Edition to print and use any additional funds to pour into the next issue so we can keep bringing you more Celestial Falcon!\nLast Ember Press has had great help from the Kickstarter community in launching and growing our brand, and we've had great success doing so! Now we are expanding with the Shooting Star Universe brand and looking to deliver yet another awesome campaign with Celestial Falcon #1 Deluxe Edition!\nCheck out this preview to see what's in store in the book, and be sure to scroll down to get a sneak peek at the new back-up story!\nThe Backup Story\nIn this Deluxe Edition of Celestial Falcon #1, we included a brand new 4-page story that features each of our six main characters, giving a little peek into each of their lives.  We reached out to some other artists we work with or will potentially be working with to put these four pages together: Riccardo Faccini (page 1), Rowel Roque (pages 2-3) and Lucas Santos (page 4):\n\nThis is all the cool stuff you can get for supporting Celestial Falcon!\nCOVER GALLERY\nCheck out these amazing covers, including the brand new main cover done especially for this Deluxe Edition!\nMain Cover (A) by Series Artist Lucas Santos!\nCover B, Sand Angels Virgin Variant by Lisa Moore!\nCover C, Vintage Movie Poster Variant Featuring Chris.

Spread back out again any time. \nSpread Out or Stack Up as Needed\nA Single EZSTAX File Organizer\nEZSTAX File Organizers are a series of interlocking trays designed to hold standard 8.5\" x 11\" papers. They have four alternating tabs on the front and a finger hole in the middle for easy access. \nNesting Fins Stack to Form an Organized System - The five hollow fins nest on top of the EZSTAX below it allowing you to stack them while taking up little more room than the papers you put on them. \nHollow FIns Allow EZSTAX to Connect With Each Other\nAdd to a Stack- If you have just a few papers to add, simply tilt EZSTAX upward to add a paper to any stack of files.\nAdjust to Any Stack Size - Like an endless set of letter trays, you can stack them about as high as you like.  Add another tray to a stack any time or make multiple stacks for multiple reasons.  Try doing that with traditional desktop organizers! \nFunctional - With a finger hole in the middle and four alternating label tabs (a set of blank labels included), it's easy to organize your papers and grab what you need any time.\nDurable and Reusable - Re-label anytime you want to change your files.  The four alternating tabs make it simple to name your files.  We will include a set of 1/2\" x 1 3/4\" labels (Avery 8167 equivalent) making it easy to print labels or to hand write in multiple colors.  Additional labels are easy to find if you run out.\nPortable - Take your files with you.  File outside on a gorgeous day.  Work in the kitchen then put them away.  Or file at your favorite coffee shop. \nAdaptable - Use them like a simple inbox/outbox system.  File by category, project, function, etc.  Collate presentations.  Store long term large stacks on shelves. \nNot Just For the Office -  Clean up that kitchen mess of bills, coupons, kids papers, and other \"to do's\".  Keep a stack wherever paper piles tend to form.  Organize mail right where it tends to go.\nGreat in the Office, Home, or Home Office\nPatriotic and Sustainable -  Sure, it would be cheaper to manufacture elsewhere, but each EZSTAX File Organizer is Made in the USA from Recycled Materials! \nEconomical - Most letter tray and desktop filing systems average $3 to $6 per \"level\" or more.  EZSTAX File Organizers will retail at about $1.50 per tray.  Go ahead and compare that to the cost of file folders and a filing cabinet as well. \nVersatile - Do you have multiple forms, brochures, or other materials that you need easy access to?  There's no better easy way to keep them handy than EZSTAX.\nEZSTAX File Organizers\nWhether you use them in the home, office, or home office, EZSTAX File Organizers are sure to make your life easier.

We have listened to our customers along the way and have learned how many of you enjoyed filing using our EZSTAX organizers, even the ones designed more with clothes in mind.\n\nWe've listened to your requests, ideas, and concerns and feel we have created the perfect product for filing papers. We are so very excited to get it into our customers' hands! \n\nIt's been a heck of a ride and we've learned a lot along the way. While we were a couple months late shipping on our first project, we did ship to every one of our backers and are very proud of our first success. \n\nWe don't feel there is much risk to your pledge. We WILL get this done. Our systems are already in place for manufacturing, packaging, and shipping. Just add your support and we're good to go. \n\nThanks to you, we are a successful business now with the ability and knowledge to complete this project and put the EZSTAX File Organizers in your hands on time.\n\nOne of the things we have learned is that to sell a product to the big box retailers takes a lot of profit and margins. We have done the best we can to keep the pricing down for our Kickstarter backers. We anticipate the KIckstarter pricing to be about a 10 to 30% discount to future retail pricing. \n\nSo....get them while they are hot and help us make this another success!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Tell us what you want to see next!", "descp": "Even $1 counts as a supporter that helps rank us higher on Kickstarter.

It's a series of goofy literature comics poking fun at all your favorite authors, and now it's time to collect them into a delightful hardcover! \n\"Anatomy of Authors\" is a hilarious take on High School biology charts...but instead of pointing out where the \"thorax\" is, we're going to learn truly important things like:\nWhy does every character name in a Dickens book sound like a weird Pok\u00e9mon?\nDid Shakespeare coin new words by hanging out at the mall?\nHow did Mark Twain master 1,000 jobs...but never master combing his dang hair? \nThese comics are 100% free to read on the site, so check 'em out!

Here's a quick guide to rewards you'll get! (And to help, each level calls out the added reward from the previous level!) \n In addition to the book, higher reward tiers will also be receiving awesome items such as...\nPlanning on backing at the THE CRITIC'S CHOICE or THE COMPLETIST levels, and would like a piece of SHELDON original comic art? You're welcome to claim *any* SHELDON original in the archives: Just look for comics that don't say \"PURCHASED\" underneath them in red text on the site. If you would like an ANATOMY OF AUTHORS strip, here is a handy-dandy spreadsheet!   \n We are making the book! Hooray! And now we're shooting to add these stretch goals to your book - at no extra cost to you!! \nRemember Anatomy of Animals? The book turned out great and we intend to duplicate it's look and feel, but with a more literary feel.  \n We're planning to ship your book out in December using USPS. And, because we'll be shipping direct from the studio, each package will be getting a little smooch on its way out the door. EXTRA SMOOCHES FOR YOU, BASICALLY.\nA NOTE FOR INTERNATIONAL FRIENDS: We're charging *exactly what it costs us* to ship from the USA. So if you live in London or Sydney or Berlin, the shipping, alas, is what it is. But to help, we made a handy-dandy shipping chart to help your decision, BELOW. Sometimes, going up or down one tier can save you a bit, so it's worth comparing. \n Dave Kellett is the cartoonist behind the webcomics SHELDON and DRIVE, the co-Director on the comics documentary, STRIPPED, and one of the voices behind the podcast COMICLAB.

You\u2019ll be able to name your familiars and make it official with your signature and date~!\nKickstarter is crowdfunding platform. It's also a wonderful community of creatives hoping to take things from ideation to creation!  Since Kickstarter is an \"all-or-nothing\" format it means that if a project doesn't get funded you will not be charged.\nYou can always pledge now risk-free and pay later! Increase, decrease or even cancel your pledge at any time during this Kickstarter. Pledging also helps to unlock designs and fun freebies during the campaign! You can pledge for all the items you want, regardless of their locked/unlocked status. \u2764\nYou will only be charged when the Kickstarter campaign ends. If we don't reach our goal by the end of the campaign date you will not be charged. It's that simple! This campaign is set up to run for 27 days. The end date is listed at the top of the campaign along with the funding goal.   \nKickstarter backers are also getting a discount by participating here first. (PLUS receiving any fun goodies that may be unlocked along the way.) After the campaign, all enamel pins will be sold for a higher price in my shop\u2019s website!\nIf you ever have any questions about how this works, or about this campaign in general you are always welcome to contact me! \nAll the pins will come on a fancy holographic foil backer card!

They will all be in a gold finish and come with two pink rubber backings!   \n These additional stretch goals are thanks to the love and support of backer community! \u2665 Additional designs may be added, so check back often!\n One thing I love about Kickstarter is all the fun extras! Every backer will automatically receive a FREE 'Certificate of Adoption' and a 'Mini Art Thank you Print'! \nNote: Extra 'Certificates of Adoption' are available as an add-on! \nUnlocked: \n\u2b50 FREE matte vinyl sticker for all backers! \n\u2b50 Any backer with 2 or more pins in their pledge will get the \"Kiki's Hat\" pin for FREE! \n\u2b50 Any backer with 4 or more pins in their pledge will get the \"Kiki's Hat\" pin AND the \"Kiki the Witch\" pin for FREE! \nBe sure to share this campaign with your friends and family so we can have more fun goodies to share! \n Extra goodies are now available in this add-on section. This area is constantly updating so be sure to check back often! \nTo add these items to your pledge, add the correct amount to your pledge total for each additional item you would like to receive!\nFor example, if you pledged for $22 for x2 pins + $4 for shipping costs and you wanted to add 2 art prints ($12) your new total would be: $22 + $4 + $12 = $38. \nPlease be sure to read each add-on section carefully as the amounts and instructions will vary by item! \nWant to add an additional pin to your pledge? \nIf you are an early bird backer and you would like to add additional pins to your pledge:\nadd $10 per pin to your current pledge total with shipping.  \nIf you are not an early bird backer and would like to add additional pins, please change to a higher reward tier!

Below is an approximation of how the timelines should work.\n  Early September 2019 - Project Ends\nThe Kickstarter reward survey will be sent out to backers when the campaign is over and fully funded.

Clearly much too young to be on her own, and with limited verbal communication skills (though she gets by with a little sign language), it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how this mysterious being, named Tamberlane, ended up in their care.\nFostered by Belfry, the accident-prone bat with a heart of gold, and guided by a colorful cast of animal characters, Tamberlane\u2019s mysteries continue to unfold. But one question remains on everyone\u2019s mind: who (or more specifically, what) is she?\nChapter 3 Summary\nThe citizens of Treehollow are preparing to host the region\u2019s annual Sovereign Festival for the first time in 12 years. Belfry and Tess must resolve their fight, and soon, because they have to work a festival booth together. Meanwhile, Oakewood and his godson Milo are deep in the process of learning about Tamberlane, observing her in experimental situations in hopes of getting closer to unlocking the mystery of her origin.\nTamberlane is an ongoing LGBTQIA+ created comic that updates every Wednesday and is rated PG13.

I've also been successfully fulfilling orders for my online shop and Patreon, I've got a streamlined fulfillment process, and a handful of helpers to get through it all.\n\nHowever, there is always a risk with a crowdfunding project. As I'm hoping to have the books in my hands, fulfilled, and ready to sell before GeekGirlCon (November 16-17 in Seattle!), the turnaround is very tight. My aim is to be sure the rewards are in the mail before I head out to vend, but that may not be possible if there are delays. I've tried to build in a bit of a time buffer, but it's still tighter than I\u2019d like!\n\nIn addition, my health goes up and down. I struggle with chronic pain and fatigue that can sometimes kill my ability to work for days at a time. If it strikes at the wrong time, fulfillment may be delayed. Plus, manufacturers can sometimes take longer than I anticipated.\n\nBut for all of that, as long as this kickstarter is funded, there is zero possibility it will not be fulfilled. I'm a hard worker with a proven track record.

The Players!!! We are ready when you guys are to get your characters whipped up and plugged into their respective slots on the cover. \nI am expecting these sessions to be 100% bonkers. No need to worry about deep back stories or anything. We can handle all of that down the road. Lets just focus on getting these guys, gals, freaks, creeps and weirdos whipped up and have some FUN.\nCover for The Ring of Karma\n \"A young vampire is on the run, wanted dead by both criminal and corporate factions. His father was right. In this world, there is no such thing as right or wrong. Good or Evil. There are only consequences for the choices you make.\"\nThe Angelblood Chronicles of Mystiq Volume #1 is suited for an audience 18 and up, and is inspired from game play sessions of the table top role-playing game Angelblood.\nAt the start of Mystiq\u2019s story we see him at a major crossroads in his life. He isn\u2019t sure of who he can trust, what he should do, or where he should go. But by the end of the series we see him reunite with his estranged father, and join a secret organization that was constructed to maintain a delicate balance in the world called Karma\u2019s Hand. He gains new friends, pisses a shit ton of people off, and acquires some BADASS superpowers along the way.\nThis volume will include the initial 3 chapters of Mystiq's story, drawn by Gaspar Sabater in his version of a classic manga style. The book has been fully completed and is in the editing process now. We may be adding some additional pages to showcase some of our upcoming stories and add The Ring of Karma comic short. \nCurrently 76+ pages of content for the graphic novel\n5 pages or more of the Ring of a Karma comic short\n8.5 x 11 size; glossy cover; full color\n150+ pages of content for the game book\n8.5 x 11 size; glossy cover; full color\nGame Changer Card: Designed featuring one of the 7 major corporations in the world of Angelblood. Made with a rigid plastic (similar to that of a credit/ debit card) that will identify you as a \u201cGame Changer\u201c at any event where we are present.\nThis story was developed during the entire time I was in the creation process of the game Angelblood. Mystiq's story is full of violence, gore, betrayal, and intrigue\u2014the works. If you\u2019re fans of dark anti-hero comic book heroes like Blade, Venom and Punisher or enjoy podcasts like Critical Role, Join the Party or The Adventure Zone you\u2019ll enjoy this series. \nIn many ways, Mystiq is the eyes through whom I see the world, and now you can, too. Throughout the series, you\u2019ll experience a wide array of emotions. And with your support, we will not only be able to delve deeper into his story, but also the countless others that have yet to be awakened. \nThis series of graphic novels will expose nearly every facet of the game world and show how interwoven all of the factions, clans and corporations are. I am extremely proud to have made it this far, being able to produce the 3 chapters of this story on my own.\nWho are we?\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI started Angelblood Publishing LLC with the mission to build a launching pad and a platform for up and coming creators and illustrators. I wanted to give something back to the genre that shaped my imagination as a child. I allow the fans of Angelblood to take control of it and shape it how they see fit. I firmly believe that we need to start cultivating platforms that support all artists as they are in the beginning stages of their careers. This support in turn allows them to continue to develop their skills and we as their supporters get to witness their growth 1st hand.\nJust imagine if the Kickstarter platform was around when Frank Miller, Steve Dillon or Jack Kirby were first starting their careers. As a backer you could support them on their journey and purchase the first comic book they ever had drawn.  \nThe kickstarter audience is perfect for what it is I am trying to accomplish. I have learned so much, and am regularly blown away by the willingness to aid creators on their journeys toward becoming great and fulfilling their dreams. Not just for the amazing and creative rewards that come from backing projects, but also the joy and since of accomplishment we get as a community when a project we back is successful. \nI have been in the process of working on this publishing company for the last 15 years and I have finally reached this moment where I can start taking the next step and shining a light on so many young and talented individuals.   \nSneak peak inside the game book\nWhy do I want the game book?\nYou love playing tabletop role-playing games\nYou love comics and graphic novels\nYou have a character idea or story that you\u2019ve been waiting to develop\nYou think it would be cool to be listed as a comic/ graphic novel creator \nPLAY\n\nWhere are the funds going?\nChapters 1-3 have been completed, and are in the editing process now and our game book was completed in 2017 (You can view all of the information on that project here). Please feel free to look back at both of the previous successful campaigns. The illustrators aren\u2019t the only ones growing and getting better over time. So am I. The progressive steps we have taken to not only deliver quality rewards but deliver a quality presentation is something I am proud of. I want everyone to see how far we have come and assure them that we will continue to grow and get better with time and support. \nI do want to add color to this book and I feel like I can add a few more pages leading into the 4th chapter slightly to give readers a much more climactic cliff hanger. Printing and shipping costs are always a need based on the number of backers we get for physical copies of the books. There are a few surprises that I have for the digital backers. Keep your fingers crossed. \nYou may have noticed that there are two different covers for book. YES!!! WE HAVE VARIANTS. Currently 2 and we are waiting the 3rd to be completed. We will be adding a separate reward tier for anyone interested in collecting all 3 covers. Make your pledge today and stay updated.\n\n\nThe priority goal after this project has been funded is to make sure that we have taken care of ALL our backers, once we have that confirmed we can then start production on the next project. If all goes as planned, we will be able to produce 1 graphic novel every 2-3 months. I am pushing to come back to Kickstarter with our 2nd graphic novel project The Angelblood Chronicles of The Cape before Christmas. It is an ambitious goal but we have gotten this far, and I think we can do it. Any funds collected beyond our initial goal are already reallocated toward bringing the backers THIS project the best possible product we can deliver both in print and digital formats.\n\nWhat are people saying?\nWe have some of the best fans. And they are so incredibly creative I cannot wait to their stories produced so that I can share them with you all. I hope to see of you join this rapidly growing list very soon.\nPLAY\n\nHow the game work?\nOur unique game system simplifies the outcomes of the dice roles creating seamless and organic plot points for our players. In the following sequence, you see the main character Mystiq is having a hard time with some baddies. That actually happened on the table. I was rolling very poorly that day and the GM was hammering me. But I had a few tricks up my sleeve, as Mystiq often does.\n The dice will tell you not only IF you hit your target, but also where you hit the target, and vice versa. Did you hit them in the head, the arm, the torso, or the leg? Having this location- based combat system makes it super easy to have exciting and challenging combat sequences and you never have to worry about choreography. Just let the dice tell the story.\nI sincerely thank you for taking time out of your day to visit with us and hope you like what we have to offer. Pledge your support and tell your friends about us.  \nBE A GAME CHANGER!!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest challenge will be the printing. We need to be able to print enough copies of the books that are ordered and keep the price point low enough so that we can get them printed and shipped without any major complication. If we get hundreds of orders for the physical copies of the books, we don't foresee an issue at all. If orders for physical copies of the books are small then we have to account for that and make the adjustment to a small run. We are looking to partner with two different printers at this time to accommodate both occurrences. Once we have those partnerships firmly in place we will be posting that update on our project page and in the project updates.\n\nWe are doing everything we can to increase the size of our audience and bring more attention to the project. Feel free to engage with me through the comments. I would love to hear from you and converse about what we have coming down the pipeline. \n\nAside from printing, the only challenge I foresee would be a delay incurred from getting the additional pages added and/or adding the color to the book. We will be posting updates regularly to keep everyone up to date on the progress of the book, whether challenges arise or not.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Angelblood Publishing LLC\n3 created \u00b7 22 backed\nAngelblood Publishing digitally publishes comics and graphic novels that are based on the stories told via actual and original game play...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Game Changer Special", "descp": "I cannot do what I do without the Game Changers.

I'm very excited to announce my third enamel pin series here on Kickstarter: The Pup Treats Collection!\n\nABOUT THIS PROJECT:\nThe 'Pup Treats' series was first inspired by my own pup, Molly, who passed away within the last year from cancer-related complications at the age of 13. Molly was a husky mix that we adopted from a shelter when she was about 5. In the nearly 8 years that I had with her, she was a wonderful little member of the family and had been there for some of the toughest times as I learned to become an adult. Dogs are far too good for this world, and the bond that we have with them means so much. \nWhile toying with the idea of commemorating Molly as an enamel pin, I also thought about how nice it might be for other people to have tiny renditions of their beloved pets! As an avid animal-lover, I created the Kittea Ceremony Enamel Pin Collection earlier this year for all the kitties and kitty-lovers out there--now it's time for the dog-lovers!\nSo, let's take a look and see what's on the menu!\n If we surpass our funding goals and are able to fund ALL of the designs, there are a couple additional goals that I'd like to try for as well!\nAtomik Cupcake Designs has made a range of hard enamel pin designs in the past; here are a couple examples from our previous Kickstarters! \n Reminder: Kickstarter is a pledge-now, pay-later platform! You have nothing to lose by pledging early (in fact, you can save a few bucks by grabbing an Early Bird reward!), and if the pin that you want doesn't get unlocked by the end of the campaign, you can drop your pledge!  \nThank you to everyone SO MUCH for your continued support! <3 Without the Kickstarter community, I would not have been able to make NEARLY as many creative goodies as I want to. Not to mention, your support inspires me to keep going and keep making more things!

Sometimes, there are factory mishaps (my last Kickstarter had a slew of them) that can include pins that have the wrong color, a high defect rate that requires a reorder, shipping delays, and other issues that can delay the production of pins. I've done my best to anticipate that sometimes these things happen, and I have set my delivery date accordingly to allow for PLENTY of time to get these all out to you!\n\nBackers will be notified every step of the way on whether we're ahead of schedule, on schedule, or delayed, so there will be no surprises!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "One Pup Treats Sticker!", "descp": "Get a 3-inch glossy vinyl sticker of any of the 8 main pup treats!

We didn't raise our goal last time, so Haunted Days is back with a lower goal.\n          Instead of trying to raise enough to do the entire comic, we're going to start smaller.\n\nJust a little rundown for any newcomers:\nHello! My name is Liz. I\u2019m a writer, mother of three, and entrepreneur. \nHaunted Days is a story about a pre-teen girl named Clair who can see ghosts. After the passing of her grandmother/legal guardian, Clair is relocated and brought to live with her Aunt Cleo in the town of Thompsonville. As if starting at a new school and having to make new friends wasn\u2019t hard enough, Clair finds herself in the midst of a ghostly mystery.\n          Hamilton House is haunted by not one, but dozens of spirits. All of which claim to have been \u201cdrawn to the house\u201d. Clair is determined to help these spirits cross over as well as find the angry spirit that first died at Hamilton House and help them rest in piece too.\n  I\u2019m the writer behind Haunted Days. The artist working with me on this project is Satra Thai. Once the first few chapters are complete, I will be posting the series to Line WEBTOON (webtoons.com). I\u2019m hoping to start posting chapters by November. \n\nFor samples of my writing, please check out my Wattpad Page (@ElizaDuivenvoorde). \n          I have written a couple novellas, short stories, and a short comic, all of which you can find on Amazon Kindle. I\u2019m currently taking a break from on two novels (a YA fantasy, and a dark fantasy series) to put all my focus in this project.\n          Here\u2019s a link to the kindle comic; Loxi Foxy and the Three Ducks https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01IA8XJ3S/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_dtQ6CbQ1XKQWM\n          And also a link to a fan fiction I wrote on Wattpad:\nhttps://my.w.tt/8eNjaHmu0W\n  Satra is an artist on DeviantArt. You can find her portfolio here: \nhttps://www.deviantart.com/satrathai/gallery/58398455/Portfolio\n            She also has her own project that she posts on YouTube when she has the time. It\u2019s titles Peppermint Winter. https://youtu.be/xrp_o7YPqdo\n  Funding:\nFunds that are raised will go towards helping pay the ever talented Satra. We will be making the last of the character designs, then the first few chapters.\nWhen Season 1 is complete, that is when I will be getting the comic formatted and printed for all of you. \n\n\n\nMain Characters:\nClair Harper, our main character.\n        Daughter of Sophie Harper and Max Crews.\n  Clair\u2019s father was never in the picture and her mother passed away when she was three years of age. She was then raise by her grandmother\u2014Beatrice Harper\u2014until her passing. Clair is now in the care of Max\u2019s sister, Cleo Crews.\n        Although Clair had never met her aunt Cleo before, the two formed an instant bond.\n        Cleo works as an event planner and is currently organizing a haunted house event for halloween. Cleo offers to take Clair to the town\u2019s real life haunted house, which happens to be where the event is taking place.\n        Clair obviously excepts and is surprised when she arrives at the house to find that it\u2019s not just haunted by one ghost, but multiple. She discovers that one ghost in particular is drawing all the other spirits to the house. She takes it upon herself to find out who this ghost is and help them move on.\n        She\u2019ll make some friends\u2014both living and alive\u2014along the way as she solves this mystery.\n\nGrace Prince. Daughter of Ellen and Joseph Prince.\n        Grace\u2019s father passed away in a car accident five years ago, and Grace\u2019s mom is the town\u2019s mayor.\n  Grace has a free spirit vibe to her. He loves adventure and a good mystery.\n        Although she isn\u2019t one of the \u201cpopular girls\u201d, Grace is well known around the class and school. She makes sure she knows who most students are and what grade they\u2019re in. Being part of the student council, and her class\u2019 student body president, is a serious honour for her.\n        Grace\u2019s dream is to lead like her mother.\n  Grace and Clair become friends almost instantly. Although Clair is a bit odd, Grace doesn\u2019t mind. She actually finds it curious and entertaining.\n        Little does she know that becoming Clair\u2019s friend comes with its own adventure.\n\nEsmeralda, a ghost girl who died in the 1950s.\n  Esmeralda is one of the many ghosts living in the Hamilton House. She is the first ghost Clair meets in the house.\n        Esmeralda follows Clair home and requests that she help the main ghost of the house move on, because the mysterious ghost seems to be very angry and restless.\n  Although Esmeralda doesn\u2019t remember how she died, or much about her past, she is a happy spirit. She still feels lonely like all the other ghosts in the Hamilton House, but she doesn\u2019t let that keep her down.\n\nT.J. Jones, son of Maggie and Julian Jones and younger brother of Aspen Jones.\n        T.J.\u2019s mom is a dance instruction and his dad is a privet investigator.\n  T.J.\u2019s full name is Tobias-John Jones but he shortened his name in the first grade to make it less of a mouthful.\n        Along with most of the other boys in his class, T.J. is very into basketball. Although he likes other sports too, baseball is by far his favourite.\n        T.J. also has a secret love of mystery novels and national mystery documentaries. It\u2019s something he has in common with his older sister; his mom says it\u2019s something they got from their father.\n  T.J. lives across the street from Cleo and Clair and he\u2019s also in Clair\u2019s class.\n        His detective instincts go wild when Clair shows up and he decides to investigate her. But what he discovers isn\u2019t exactly what he expected. \n\nAaric Edwards is the oldest of two. His younger sister\u2014Alicia\u2014is in Clair\u2019s class. His parents are Pam and Ian Edwards.\nAaric and his sister are ten months apart in age but aren\u2019t very close. Aaric keeps to himself and has two close friends\u2014Zane and Zach\u2014whereas Alicia is a social butterfly.\nAlthough Aaric isn\u2019t much for socializing and being the center of attention, he doesn\u2019t let that stop him from pursuing his interests. Mainly basketball. Aaric doesn\u2019t see himself as a basketball player in the future, as s career, but he still enjoys getting competitive with the kids in the grade lower than him.\nAaric has a pet turtle named Henry. Henry was a gift from his grandfather, given to Aaric to keep him company while in the hospital after falling down a set of stairs.\n\nEmily Green is the daughter of Penelope and Alexander Green. Emily\u2019s grandmother, Marylin Green, lives with her family and has since Emily was five. She and her grandmother are very close because of this.\nEmily is a major book worm. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a good novel or a textbook, she can get easily lost in it. Her love of literature is one of the things she shares with her grandmother; Emily sometimes even reads her textbooks or novels to Marylin, since the woman can no longer read on her own.\nEmily doesn\u2019t have many close friends at school, but she isn\u2019t lonely. The characters in her books keep her company. She does like it when Grace Prince offers to have a homework date at the library, though. And when Clair shows up in their class, she can\u2019t help but become friends with the girl.\n\n\nRewards:\n\nGoals:\nClair Reward/Fully Funded UNLOCKED\nClair, T.J., Grace, Aaric, and Esmeralda as keychains.\n\nEmily Reward/$1,100CAD UNLOCKED\nEmily themed bookmark, keychain, and sticker. \n\n\nCleo Reward/$1,200CAD\nCleo themed bookmark, keychain, and sticker.\n\n\nIris Reward/$1,300CAD\nIris themed bookmark, keychain, and sticker.\n\nVictor Reward/$1,400CAD\nVictor themed bookmark, Keychain, and sticker. \n\nTabitha Reward/$1,500CAD\nTabitha themed bookmark, keychain, and sticker.\n\nThanks for your interest!\n~Liz", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challanges we've been facing is funding and time. \n\nI (Liz, the writer) and commissioning Satra for the art, which costs money.

I am thrilled to have met my project target and to be in a position to add stretch goals!  \n* * * Wooohah - STRETCH GOALS * * *\nStretch Goal One: Slab Roller - \u00a3150 in additional funds \u00a31000 project total (inc fees)\nA slab roller allows me to hand build my pots and plates at a faster rate and with more final consistency. The roller rolls the clay flat, clean and smooth and more importantly to the same thickness. This will mean my hand built work will have a more even drying process resulting in less loss during firing. It will also speed up my production process allowing me to offer more made to order slots with shorter turn around times. \nStretch Goal Two: Pottery Wheel \u00a3250 in additional funds \u00a31300 project total (inc fees)\nAfter having to sell my pottery wheel to pay home bills I started a new venture into hand building ceramics and the journey has been fun but challenging. An ultimate goal would be to be able to purchase a refurbished kick wheel so I can continue to offer a wider range of shapes and designs and to produce a higher volume of ready to post items in larger batches.\nFind me on social media;\n https://www.instagram.com/themintymountain \n https://www.facebook.com/MyMintyMountain \nHere is my story so far... \nI am a self-taught potter based in Buckinghamshire, working around my little family and grumpy cat. I spent 3 years saving to set my own small studio up. It was so liberating to be able to purchase my kiln, pottery wheel and small garden shed along with a whole bunch of exciting accessories. I was set up and ready to throw myself in at the deep end. \nI have already been overwhelmed by the continued support from my followers and the crafting community. I really have been able to realise my dream, and since 2013 I have been sending pieces of my work from the UK all over the world. In fact, I have sent orders to 23 different countries; from Russia to Japan, from Scotland to Hawaii, from Mexico to Alaska. I have sent orders to 39 of the US states and for over 1000 sales recorded on Etsy, I have a 100% 5 star feedback rating. I am extremely proud of my achievements and more importantly, I still love what I do.  \nSadly at the start of this year due to personal circumstances I had to sell my pottery wheel to cover a months rent. To say this broke my heart would be an understatement - but I have managed to continue to run my little business by individually had building each order. As long as I had my kiln and my clay, I was golden. \nAlas, my kiln has recently started to misfire and after a short investigation and consultation it looks like her days are numbered. I've been able to source a temporary fix for a limited number of firings to complete outstanding orders, but unfortunately I have had to stop production of my most popular made-to-order items, as I can not currently guarantee quality or success. It's a bit of a punch in the gut, especially as this income is so vital for me here. \n A working kiln is an essential to a small potter like myself. I have decided to purchase a refurbished kiln, and have already found two possibilities. I can't afford to fund the purchase entirely, but I do have a small amount of savings set aside for Christmas that I will be putting into the kiln fund as a float. So, I am looking for your to help to raise the remaining amount, enabling Minty Mountain to get back up and running.\nThank you all for your kind words and continued support. I am forever grateful to you all!\nEmma\nxxx ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs my business model is already running and my products are tested and well established the risks are reasonably low. \n\nI have already stopped producing made to order items until a kiln can be secured. \n\nI have secured two possible kilns and have a third back up option. \n\nI will be making as many rewards as I can when they come in to ensure a swift turn around and dispatch to pledgers. \n\nI already have a qualified electrician on standby to test the kiln so I can get cracking!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a32 or more", "title": "My sincerest gratitude", "descp": "I have already been overwhelmed by the support I have been shown during the best and worst times of this creative journey.\nAll pledges however great or small mean the world to me.

The high-quality visual standard quickly grabbed the interest of many users on social media, including a consistent group of foreign fans. Their enthusiasm inspired us to launch this kickstarter campaign, in order to bring Bianca also outside Italian national boundaries.\nThis work marks the professional debut of the two authors, Paolo Margiotta and Francesca  Perrone, and also serves as the spearhead for Shockdom\u2019s adventure in the International  market.\n\nSo, who are these two authors, and who else contributed to the creation of Bianca - Little Lost Lamb?\n\nIf Paolo is your nerdy stereotypical writer, with an academic past in linguistics and a penchant for good food and videogames, who also happens to mildly hate social media (and people in general, he says, but nobody believes him), Francesca is a young and very talented 23 years old artist, who you might know by the online nickname Lillayfran. You also probably already saw some of her work, since she is behind some of the best Boom Studios \u2018Steven Universe\u2019 covers.\nThey met at the International Comic School in Naples, where both studied with some of the finest Italian comic book writers and artists. Sharing a complementary artistic affinity, the two decided to take a shot at it: the project soon came into shape and was showed to Shockdom at the prestigious Lucca Comics fair. Only 3 days later, they were talking business and contracts. It\u2019s not something you see everyday.\nOther notable people who helped a lot are Paolo\u2019s sister, Marina \u2018MaW\u2019 Margiotta, a webcomic artist with a PhD in genetics, who hugely contributed to the coloring and lettering process, and Davide Maimone, the 3D artist who made the trailer.\n\n\n\nWHERE DO WE GO NOW?\nWell, it depends entirely on this fine community!\nWhat happens here and now is up to you.

My name is Liz. I\u2019m a writer, mother of three, and entrepreneur.\n  Haunted Days is a story about a pre-teen girl named Clair who can see ghosts. After the passing of her grandmother/legal guardian, Clair is relocated and brought to live with her Aunt Cleo in the town of Thompsonville. As if starting at a new school and having to make new friends wasn\u2019t hard enough, Clair finds herself in the midst of a ghostly mystery.\n       Hamilton House is haunted by not one, but dozens of spirits. All of which claim to have been \u201cdrawn to the house\u201d. Clair is determined to help these spirits cross over as well as find the angry spirit that first died at Hamilton House and help them rest in piece too.\n  I\u2019m the writer behind Haunted Days. The artist working with me on this project is Satra Thai. Once the first few chapters are complete, I will be posting the series to Line WEBTOON (webtoons.com). I\u2019m hoping to start posting chapters by November.\n  Funds that are raised will go towards helping pay the ever talented Satra. If there are any extra funds, then that will go towards step two of the Haunted Days goal; animated TV show. The show would have two seasons with at least ten episodes per season.\n  For samples of my writing, please check out my Wattpad Page (@ElizaDuivenvoorde). \n       I have written a couple novellas, short stories, and a short comic, all of which you can find on Amazon Kindle.

You won't believe how small these premium shopping bags pack. These tiny shopping bags are convenient to carry in your pocket at all times, are super comfortable to carry, and easily carries 66lbs (30kg).\n\n\n\nAvailable in eleven colorful designs + black, blue and gray color.\nWouldn't it be nice to always have a comfortable bag handy?\nWe consume somewhere between 1 trillion to 500 billion of plastic bags per year, and it\u2019s an unnecessary waste. Reusable bags are great for the environment, but normally they\u2019re bulky or poor quality. Nanobag 3.0 is a premium shopping bag so compact that you'll barely feel carrying it. The compact super-soft fabric easily folds into your pocket, and does away with impractical reusable shopping bags.\nHere are the designs you can choose from in our backer survey.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the positive feedback from our backers that drives us!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nanobag 3.0 can easily carry 66lbs (30kg).\n18 liters of space should be enough to cover your daily needs.\nThe bag is so compact and soft that you will hardly notice carrying it in your pocket.\nIt even fits in the watch pocket of your jeans.\nOur custom made diamond ripstop fabric has an extreme weight to strength ratio.\nThe reinforced handles distributes the weight evenly for comfortable use.\n\n\n\nNanobag 3.0 is 5% lighter than its predecessor.\nThe fabric measures only .002\" (.05mm thick), or around half the thickness of a human hair.\nThe bag weighs only .73oz (20.7g).\nWe\u2019ll plant one tree per bag \nWe're committed to making you a climate positive product. That means that we give more back to the planet than we take. We consider our bags environmentally conscious, as they contain less materials than other bags in their category and help reduce single use plastic bag consumption. This time we\u2019re also stepping up our tree planting efforts further. For each bag we sell we\u2019ll plant one mangrove tree with the Eden Reforestation Project. Mangrove trees are one of the most effective tools against climate change, and stores ten times more carbon than land based tree species. Mangroves take the carbon out of the air and bind it to the ground, thus preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere. One single mangrove tree can store around 1750lbs (800kg) in its 40 year lifespan.  As an added bonus they prevent soil erosion and help sustain coastal ecosystems.\nWe will plant one tree for every bag pledged for with Eden Reforestation Projects.\nCommitment to excellence\nWe're committed to creating high-quality products that you'll love. The bags are made with premium custom made fabrics and we've put in place a thorough quality-control and testing process to make sure you receive a great final product. We guarantee that your bags will be of excellent quality.\n\nShipping\nWe offer FREE International registered shipping to backers pledging for 4 bags and above. All parcels will be shipped with tracked air mail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team:\nTiptop Things are a group of friends working together to infuse everyday items with premium quality and cutting edge technology.  Nanobag 3.0 is our fifth Kickstarter campaign, and you might have seen our earlier Nanobag and Air Deck campaigns.

"project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What's Project Hoax about?\nSet in 1994, a group of school kids plan to get their own back on the local bully, but get more than they bargained for when they try to stage a monster hoax.\n Who will enjoy Project Hoax?\n Comic collectors who are fans of all-ages comics.\n Parents/aunties/uncles wanting to give their child/niece/nephew a unique gift.\nIf you like the idea of an all-ages horror comic that takes you back to growing up in the 90s and a story that you can enjoy with your child/niece/nephew.\nWhat do you get when you back Project Hoax?\nAll reward backers receive a full-colour 36 page digital copy of Project Hoax.. \nAll print copy reward backers (\u00a33) and above receive a full-colour 36 page print copy, bookmark and an A4 poster.\nAbove the print copy reward you can also get a bike helmet sticker, Charlie's Project Hoax planbook, an 8GB cassette tape USB drive or even a video game cover commission by our artist, Dan Butcher.\nMy name is Samuel George London, I'm a comic book writer from Hampshire in the UK and creator of Project Hoax.\nDuring the 90s, I was about as suburban as a young lad can get. I had a curtains-style haircut, I had a paper round, I had a tape player and I had a BMX. Most weekends and evenings I was at my local dirt jumps with my friends.\nI always look back fondly on those memories, and I've always tried to think of a story that could encapsulate what it was like to grow up in the 90s. Twenty-five years on, I've written my \"love letter\" to the 90s with Project Hoax.\nWith that in mind, here are a few of the first pages...\nI hope you enjoyed those pages, and that it gets you excited about Project Hoax. Feel free to read those pages in more detail by clicking here. The story of Project Hoax itself is 30 pages within a 36 page comic and the art is drawn by our awesome artist, Dan Butcher.\nDan is best known for his brilliant superhero webcomic, Vanguard, but he's also known for being co-host on the Awesome Comics Podcast. And as you just saw from the pages above, Dan has an impactful style of art that's perfect for this story.\nDan Butcher's Impactful Art\nAlongside Dan, we also have an editor on TEAM HOAX, in the form of Nicole D'Andria. Nicole, is the Marketing Director and Submissions Editor at Action Lab Comics. She edits numerous comics for Action Lab, from Dog of Wonder to Zombie Tramp. She also adapts Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir to comics and co-writes DollFace.\n Outside of Action Lab, Nicole writes comic book related articles for Comic Frontline, works as a freelance editor and is currently writing the second issue of her successful Kickstarter comic, Road Trip to Hell.\nOur editor, Nicole D'Andria.\nNow that I've had the pleasure of introducing you to the team, it's with even more pleasure to introduce you to the main characters from Project Hoax.\nOur Main Characters\nCharlie is the leader of the group, with Aseem being his indie-music-loving \"second in command\". Brian is the rich one of the group and has all the latest video games, gadgets and clothes. Then there's Dev, who keeps the group glued together with his humorous anecdotes and sometimes silly behaviour. Finally, there's Jack, who's a couple of years older than the lads and is the local bully.\nThe script is written and edited, the artist is on board, the printers are ready and as long as we're fully funded we'll be able to have all of your rewards with you by October 2019, in time for Halloween.\nApart from the comic itself, the first reward I'm really excited about is the Bike Helmet Sticker (10cm x 6cm). When I was a lad in the 90s I went through quite a few helmets for BMXing and rollerblading. Whenever I got a new the first thing I did was kit it our with awesome stickers, and now is my chance to pass on that tradition with the Project Hoax, Bike Helmet Sticker reward. It's also good laptops, which is more likely these days.\nBike Helmet Sticker (10cm x 6cm)\nThe second reward I'm excited for is the Project Hoax Planbook. As I mentioned before, I used to BMX and roller-blade during the 90s, and during school (usually English Literature class) I used to daydream about building the perfect ramp. I drew and planned these ramps in my school notebooks. With that in mind, it stands to reason that if I had planned to stage a monster hoax on a local bully Charlie would do the same. This reward is an 8 page, A5 printed booklet of Charlie's plan for the hoax. In order to not spoil the story we can't show the interior but here's a sneak peak at the cover.\nCharlie's Project Hoax Planbook\nThe third reward I'm excited for is the 16-bit variant cover print copy by the brilliant John Stratman. If you're a fan of Mr. Sunday Movies on YouTube then you might have come across his work before on their 16 Bit Scenes videos. Anyhow, as 90s video games feature in the comic, John has drawn a 16-bit graphic variant cover that you can collect on top of all the other goodies you get through the previous rewards, including a print copy of the original cover design.\n16-Bit Variant Cover by John Stratman\nThe fourth reward I'm excited for is the Cassette Tape 8GB USB Drive. Whether it be Green Day or The Offspring, I love looking over my old tapes but in all honesty they're completely useless and I should probably get rid of them. However, I love the reminder of how technology used to be and so this reward unites old technology and new by turning a cassette tape into a very useful and cool 8GB USB drive. This reward will be a Kickstarter exclusive, with only 20 available at this level and an additional 10 at the Video Game Cover Commission level! Once they're gone, they're gone!\nProject Hoax Cassette Tape 8GB USB Drive With Accompanying Case\nThe fifth and final reward that I'm really excited about is the Video Game Cover Commission. Video games were a big part of my childhood in the 90s and specifically the Sega Mega Drive. When you read Project Hoax, you'll see this love of video games shine through but I wanted to add to this by offering an A5 video game cover commission drawn by our very own, Dan Butcher. And don't forget you'll be getting the Cassette Tape 8GB USB Drive reward as well!\nProject Hoax Video Game Cover Commission Example\nThe way it works is that after the Kickstarter we'll ask you for a photo of the person or anything within reason you want featured on the cover. We'll also ask you what your favourite video game covers are in order for us to come up with a title and look for the game cover. If you love 90s video game covers, and like the idea of having your own game become a reality, then this'll be the reward for you but be aware that there are only 10 available.\n\u00a31,400 - EXTRA DIGITAL ISSUES - UNLOCKED\nOnce the campaign is over I'll send everyone all backers a digital copy of my first comic book, Milford Green, which is about a Victorian alien adventure. I'll also send everyone the first two issues of Dan Butcher's comic, Vanguard, which is about a UK based superhero team.\n\u00a31,600 - FEGA & FINTENDO VIDEO GAMES A5 PRINT - UNLOCKED\nAlong with all of your Project Hoax swag print copy backers (\u00a33) and above will receive an A5 print of the Project Hoax FEGA and FINTENDO covers of both the original cover by Dan Butcher and the 16-bit versions by John Stratman.\n\u00a31,800 - PERFECT BOUND UPGRADE - UNLOCKED\nThis stretch goal will enable us to upgrade the binding of the book from staples (saddle stitched) to perfect bound. Making it a nicer book to look at, hold and store.\n\u00a32,000 - 4 EXTRA \"BEHIND THE SCENES\" PAGES - UNLOCKED\nThis stretch goal will enable us to add 4 extra \"Behind The Scenes\" pages to the digital and print book.\n\u00a32,200 - 16-BIT GRAPHICS WALLPAPERS & PRINTS - UNLOCKED\nAs mentioned before, video games were a large part of my childhood in the 90s and so I have a real affinity for 16-bit graphics. With that in mind, if we reach \u00a32,200 we'll be able to have the Project Hoax front cover and the Kickstarter thumbnail recreated in 16-bit graphics. These will then be available for all backers as desktop and phone wallpapers. Plus for print copy backers (\u00a33) and above you'll receive both A4 and A5 prints of the 16-bit cover and Kickstarter thumbnail.\nThe artist we have on board to do this is John Stratman from the US. If you're a fan of Mr. Sunday Movies on YouTube then you might have come across his work before on their 16 Bit Scenes videos.

You're the best!\nWe've already unlocked two stretch goals-- see below for more!\nGet a free PDF comic here: www.tolcraft.com/free\nThis book includes 3 fun fantasy stories:\nGoblins at College\nDank and Sophie were students at Fitch's Academy for Young Assassins. Dank always struggled with the practical aspects of the course, but he wasn\u2019t always great with the book-learning, either. How did he get his grades up and what gave him the passion to do it?\nHow do you make that poison again?\nBog the Orc\nBog might be a giant, beefy orc with decent mutton chops, but he never quite fit in. What kind of orc leaves his tribe and strikes out alone in this wild and dangerous world? This short comic reveals all. \nIt's... complicated.\nStop the Dragon\nDank, Bog and Sonya the Wizard arrive in a small town, hounded by a terrible menace: a greedy, fire-breathing dragon! They'd rather avoid a fight, but they are quickly drawn into the town's nightmare. They'll need to work together to defeat a foe more powerful than any of them have faced before! \nAfter a long journey, you need some R&R!\n\nThe three stories in this comic are based around the characters found in my graphic novel, Sneaky Goblins. What\u2019s that you say-- you haven\u2019t read it yet? Don\u2019t worry about it, you can enjoy the book even without reading the original. Besides, every pledge level AU$15 and up gets a PDF of the original graphic novel.  \nThe vanilla cover plus two limited-edition variant covers. Check below for full details about all reward levels!\nSo whether you\u2019re a die-hard Sneaky Goblins fan, or you\u2019re checking out my comics for the first time, I hope you have as much fun reading this comic as I did making it.\nBog vows to spread the good name of orc-kind.\nHere's what they're saying about my first Kickstarter project, the original Sneaky Goblins graphic novel:\nSneaky Goblins is a delightfully fast and funny fantasy adventure. It\u2019s packed with incredible creatures, lovable underdog characters, and it transforms all the familiar Lord of the Rings-style quest tropes into something really fresh and engaging.\n-Lucas Testro, The Radioactive Lounge podcast, Ep 109. \nThis comic excels in the character design. The design for Dank and Bog passes the silhouette test, they\u2019re interesting characters to look at. The set-up, the character design, the world-building- it\u2019s all there. You should definitely go check out Sneaky Goblins, it\u2019s a really fun comic! \n-Jason Sigler, Digital Strips Podcast, Ep 517.\nSamwise Didier\nSneaky Goblins is a fun read and I love the characters. Glad Bog was able to somewhat get his hand back - an orc mage is a fun character. Now I'm looking forward to the mecha-ape invasion!\n-Samwise Didier, art director\n\nBut it's not just for grown-ups! Did you know kids love Sneaky Goblins too?! \nSome beaut shots sent in by proud parents all over the world!\nHi! I'm Ren\u00e9: creator, writer and artist of Sneaky Goblins at College. \n I was a character animator at Disneytoon Studios and a storyboard artist at Southern Star Entertainment. I'm also a compulsive comic creator! I've chipped in to a number of different comic anthologies and webcomics. \nSome of the films, TV and magazines I've worked on.\nI've always loved drawing and telling stories. Making this book was a labor of love, and I hope that comes through as you read it. \nSo why did I write Sneaky Goblins at College?\nEvery one of these stories has a special meaning for me, and each is built around a theme that goes to the heart of who I am and where I've come from...\nGoblins at College Have you ever had a passion and then lost it somewhere along the way? When I worked in an animation studio, I was super-motivated to progress to the department that would give me the greatest capacity for expression and the best use of my skills. Trouble was, once I got there, I discovered the new role was a massive step up! The work became overwhelming and I quickly lost the drive to rise to the challenge. I wish I had someone like Sophie to drag me through the difficulty and help me remember what I loved about animation in the first place.\nBog the Orc is a story about an outsider. Even though I'm part of the majority Anglo culture here in my native Australia, growing up I always felt a bit on the outside. When I was a child in the 80s, it wasn't cool to like drawing or comics or video games. Being an introvert didn't help either. Bog eventually has to leave his home, but now he has a chance to step out and be the orc he was meant to be!\nA rare sighting of young Ren\u00e9 at the beach.\nStop the Dragon is a good old fantasy Dungeons and Dragons- style fantasy romp, but the character I most identify with is the elderly priest who just wants some peace and security for his monastery. Priests in the fantasy genre are often portrayed as self-serving and manipulative. For once I wanted a man of the cloth who was straight down the line: no machinations, no ulterior motive: just straight -up concerned for the safety of the town. \nIf you'd like to know more about what makes me tick as a creator, here's a short video documentary about me and my work:\nOver the last year, I've been making and posting the pages of this comic on my weekly webcomic: www.tolcraft.com.

(Standard Image book size)\nWhy Kickstarter?  \nThis comic book is 100% complete and ready for print! All I have to do after the campaign is make the Thank You page and then send it off to the printer.\nMy process for making a comic page: from rough sketch, to inks, to final colours!\nThe amount raised will all go to funding an offset print run of 1000 copies of the comic. Copies of the comic left over after the campaign will be stock that I can sell at comic conventions, libraries and book shops.\nI've come to Kickstarter to help get this book into as many hands as possible, and I'd love your support to bring it to life.\nLet's have a peek inside!\nWant more? Get a sample PDF of the comic here: www.tolcraft.com/free\nWhat will the funds be used for? \nI'm only on Kickstarter to print the book and get them out to all of my wonderful backers! I'm not trying to make money or reimburse myself for any of the time I spent making the comic itself. \nThe whole amount raised will go back into the book, the rewards, and  shipping it out safely to you:\n  Here's what you get in each pledge level... with pictures!\n\n Here's some more of those signed sketches included in the AU$50 level and above:\nSome sketch page reward examples.\n Click here to check out the Pinterest board for more examples: The Kickstarter Pinterest board\n And what kind of kickstarter would this be without...\nYou should have your books by the end of November 2019. \nI plan on sending the final book files to to the printer as soon as the funds come through from Kickstarter (about 2 weeks after the campaign ends).\nPrinting will take a couple of months- at the most. I also want to have a buffer just in case there is a delay at any stage.\nI'll be packing and shipping the books from Melbourne, Australia.\nThanks so much for checking out my campaign.

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

The comic started in January 2013 and is currently in its second season. The purpose of this Kickstarter is to collect the first season of Table Titans into an elegant KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE hardcover book, for our fans who have shown us amazing support over the debut of our comic and for anyone who has just discovered us!\nTable Titans celebrates the stories and memories we create with our friends while role-playing and is a love letter to the greatest role-playing game of all time, Dungeons and Dragons.\nWHAT IF I'VE NEVER PLAYED D&D... OR ANY OTHER ROLEPLAYING GAME?! WILL I STILL LIKE THIS COMIC??\nIf you like high adventure, swords and sorcery, action, drama, comics, laughing and a whole lot of fun then Table Titans is for you! It DOESN'T MATTER if you've played D&D! No... seriously, it doesn't matter but don't be surprised if you makes you want to try it out! Whether you're a hardened RPG vet, a casual reader with a slight interest in the game, or if you think the whole thing is plain hooey, Table Titans, or any roleplaying game, is about telling good stories!\n TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS BOOK!\nTable Titans Volume 1: First Encounters is already finished and ready to print. In fact, If you like, you can go read the entire story right now online! Table Titans has already started its second major storyline, with a new page being posted online every Tuesday and Thursday.\nTable Titans Volume 1: First Encounters collects season one of the Dungeons and Dragons inspired webcomic in print for the first time! This will be an oversized, full-color, action packed adventure featuring KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE cover treatment. That's right, the retail editions of Table Titans Volume 1: First Encounters will look completely different than the Kickstarter editions and you can only get the Kickstarter editions by being a backer!\nWhen we first started the comic a year ago we had no idea the outpouring of love we'd receive from fans of the comic. Ever since we wrapped up the first season we've been getting asked about a print edition. So much so that it became clear to us that we NEEDED to Kickstart this book. Because alone we could print these comics but TOGETHER we can make a tome worthy of our fans!\nUMMM... THAT BOOK LOOKS PRETTY NORMAL, HARDLY A \"TOME\" WORTH OF MY ILLUSTRIOUS BOOKSHELF!\nNotice that \"Designs Not Final\" asterisk at the bottom there? That's because the book isn't designed yet. You see, if we'd done a design it's be a good book but with your help we can make it a great book. Our very first stretch goal features book design by the award-winning designer of the Scott Pilgrim and Sixth Gun series, Keith Wood!\nUPDATE: Standard Edition Mockup from Keith Wood! (not-final)\nBecause our backers are amazing we funded almost immediately and got Keith started right away. He's already sent us a 3D mockup of the Standard Edition book! Please note that the art is not final but this is very close to what the cover and interior design will look like. We're hoping to have a mockup of the Deluxe Edition soon!\nUPDATE: Deluxe Edition Concept Mockup from Keith Wood! (not-final)\nKeith is on FIRE! We just got the concept of the Deluxe Edition and we're floored. It's a little hard to see in pics but that's PURPLE FAUX LEATHER with GOLD FOIL. Keith is also planning on adding lots of intricate details to the cover in the form of effects, deboss, and emboss, but they're not worked into the design yet. More pics coming \nWHOA, REALLY?!\nYeah, and it only gets better from there. With your help we can fill the books with extras, bonus content, and special features. Every penny we make from the Kickstarter will be going right back into the books.\nBONUS CONTENT AND EXTRAS! LIKE WHAT? ELABORATE!!!\nWell, we don't want to reveal all our goals at once but you might have noticed that there's a lot of content on the Table Titans website other than the comic. After all, the comic is inspired by a game. Plus, with Keith Wood potentially designing the book who knows what kinda crazy KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE cover treatments he's going to put in there. These books can only get better! We KNOW our fans can make this book amazing, let's turn Table Titans Volume 1: First Encounters from a one night adventure into a year long campaign.\nSOUNDS GREAT, I LOVE BOOKS, BUT TELL ME ABOUT ALL THE OTHER LOOT!\nOH HO!

In it, Bee, an out-of-work twenty-something, has a life-changing collision with a mysterious creature she names PuppyCat (\"A cat?... or maybe a dog?\"). Between space and time, Bee and PuppyCat take on an intergalactic babysitting gig to pay another month\u2019s rent. Now, you can help Bee write a happy ending for PuppyCat\u2019s tale of betrayal, intrigue, and magical sparkle transformations.\nAmassing 4 million views since its July release, the original 10-minute cartoon stands as a favorite among animation fans the world over (watch it again, why don't you http://youtu.be/lOG_UtLxh58 ). Now, overwhelmed with your emails and comments asking for more adventures of Bee and PuppyCat, we want to produce a Bee and PuppyCat series exclusively for our YouTube channel, Cartoon Hangover. But we need your help.\nOur minimum goal is to produce six, brand new, six-minute Bee and PuppyCat cartoons. The more money we raise, the more cartoons we make. The series will be overseen by the creator, Natasha Allegri. Production will begin immediately, the first episode will be released in the the summer of 2014.\nWe know what you're thinking, and you're right; this is a lot of money for a handful of cartoons. To make a television-quality production, though, isn't cheap, and it takes a lot longer than most of us would like, too. Here's why we're asking for $600,000.\nBee and PuppyCat, like most of your favorite cartoons, will be \"traditionally animated,\" which means that each element is drawn by hand. It is time - and labor - intensive.\nEach cartoon's pre-production stage will consist of writing, storyboarding, casting and recording (in a top-of-the-line audio production facility), creating an animatic (shooting the storyboard with the final recorded dialogue), designing (backgrounds, characters, props, effects), coloring (of those models, effects, backgrounds, props, etc), and timing (which requires the director to go frame by frame creating exposure sheets). There will be as many as 25 cast- and crew-members on pre-production side alone.\nAfter pre-production, we'll send all those assets to an international studio where dozens of artists will draw every element for every frame, layout, key pose, animate, in-between, ink and paint, and, finally, composite. The animation then returns to sunny Burbank, CA, where Natasha and her team will give everything a good look and recommend changes. The overseas studio will make those changes and, after a little back and forth, will deliver the final animation.\nHere's what happens in the post-production stage: the animation is edited; sound effects, including foley, are recorded and added; and the composer creates the score. The sounds effects, music, and dialog are finally blended together with the animation in the last step of production, the final mix.\nSo, yes, these cartoons tend to be a bit pricey. But the good news is Frederator and Cartoon Hangover have tremendous partners who are eager to reward your helping the Bee and PuppyCat Kickstarter. They include: \n  As an independent production company, Frederator Studios requires outside funding to produce cartoons. \nAs you can imagine, the process of rounding up financial support this way takes a long time - years, usually. \nIn most cases, the companies providing funding want a voice in how that cartoon is made. We've decided seeking funding from fans through Kickstarter is not only the fastest way to bring you Natasha Allegri's Bee and PuppyCat series, but also the best way to preserve the creator's artistic vision.\nThis also gives you, the fans, a chance to help make a show you love possible! By working with you we can help make the show faster and better than by traditional funding streams. \n\nIf we're fortunate enough to exceed our goal, we'll produce more episodes while continuing to reward you for your support. Here's what we currently have planned...\nBee and PuppyCat is brought to you by Natasha Allegri, Frederator Studios, the production company, and Cartoon Hangover, the YouTube channel.\nNatasha Allegri created \"Bee and PuppyCat\" to be part of Cartoon Hangover's anthology of original animated shorts. She and Frederator Studios then spent more than eighteen months making the film, initially split into two parts. \nSince 2010, Natasha has been a key contributor to Cartoon Network's hit series, Adventure Time, as both a character designer and a storyboard revisionist. It was her gender-swapped characters Fionna and Cake, first seen through her own Tumblr page, which led to two (so far) episodes featuring the show's \"bizarro\" characters. The characters were such a hit that publisher BOOM! Studios asked Natasha to write and illustrate the Adventure Time with Fionna and Cake comic book series.\nFrederator Studios is the independent animation studio behind some of the most beloved animated series of all time, including ChalkZone, The Fairly OddParents, Fanboy and Chum Chum, My Life as a Teenage Robot, Adventure Time, and Bravest Warriors. Founded by Fred Seibert in 1998, Frederator has produced more than 200 short films and 16 TV series. Frederator is well known for its cartoon anthology series Oh Yeah! Cartoons and Random! Cartoons, descendants of Seibert\u2019s What a Cartoon! series of shorts, intended to give a voice to cartoonists and animators. \"Bee and PuppyCat\" broke through Frederator\u2019s Too Cool! Cartoons shorts program produced for Cartoon Hangover.\nCartoon Hangover launched on YouTube on November 8, 2012, as part of YouTube\u2019s original channel initiative. Since then, the channel has added more than 780,000 subscribers and had more than 50,000,000 views, making it the third fastest growing channel of all the YouTube funded channels. In October 2012, Cartoon Hangover launched its first series, Bravest Warriors, created by the mind behind Adventure Time, Pendleton Ward.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrederator is expert at producing cartoons so there is very little risk that a cartoon will not be made. Frederator has made hundreds of hours of cartoons. The producers working on Bee and PuppyCat have decades of experience producing content and Frederator itself has been in business for over 15 years. Frederator has worked with dozens and dozens of creators to bring their visions to screen including the original two-part Bee and PuppyCat cartoon with Natasha. At this budget level, Backers should feel highly confident that the Bee and PuppyCat series will have a high production quality and be totally awesome. \n\nWhen it comes to the Kickstarter we're working with Breadpig, Inc to make sure everything goes well.

The song will be available as a download to anyone pledging at the CAVE BLAT level or above. Thanks for all the support, folks.\nUpdate: Wow! We're incredibly grateful for all the support you've given the book. Lots of folks have been asking for a new stretch goal, so after much deliberation, here's what we've come up with: If we reach $85,000 every backer at CAVE BLAT level or higher will receive a brand new, full-color, professionally-illustrated, poster-sized, fold-out map of Aerwiar. The map will be large and detailed and suitable for framing if you so desire.\nWe've also added a new pledge level: SKONK. At this level, which is limited to only 5 backers, you'll receive all the rewards associated with the CHORKNEY pledge level plus Andrew will work with you to add a name of your choosing into the story of The Warden and the Wolf King. That means you could add your own name, or a loved one's name, as a character or place in Aerwiar. Andrew will work with you in order to find a way to fit the name you choose into the world naturally. \nUpdate: We've crossed the $45k mark. That means we'll be issuing a new edition of The Monster in the Hollows in HARDBACK. Awesome!\nRight now, everyone who pledges at the CAVE BLAT level or higher will receive the following (In addition to pledge level rewards):\n-The Warden and the Wolf King jam-packed with illustrations\n-The Warden and the Wolf King upgraded to hardback\n-The Monster in the Hollows digital audiobook\n-The Warden and the Wolf King digital audiobook\n-The Monster in the Hollows in hardback\nNext up? Pembrick's Creaturepedia. Thanks for all the support, folks. We're blown away.\n--AP & Co.\nThe Wingfeather Saga began almost 10 years ago with On the Edge of the Dark Sea of Darkness (writing began in 2003/published in 2008). Since then the series has become a favorite of families around the world, winning the Christy Award for Young Adult Fiction in 2010 for North! Or Be Eaten. But like every good story, the Saga has to come to an end, and in early 2014, Rabbit Room Press will release the final installment of this epic tale.\nRallied behind Kalmar Wingfeather, the Wolf King of Anniera, the people of the Green Hollows are prepared for war. But high atop the Killridge Mountains in Castle Throg, Gnag the Nameless broods over dark secrets, and those secrets may prove more than a boy, even a boy king like Kalmar, can bear. \nWhile Leeli, Podo, and Nia, fight to save the Green Hollows, Sara Cobbler and the wildy transformed Peet the Sockman strive to overthrow the Fangs of Dang and liberate the long-enslaved people of Skree. \nBut Kalmar and his brother Janner, the Throne Warden of Anniera, will be driven into darkness to face a nameless evil (that has no name). Dragons will rise. The Jewels will shine. And in the end, an Annieran will die.\nWe want to publish the grand finale of this story in style, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here on Kickstarter. If we make our goal of $14,000 that will allow us to publish the book as a high quality trade paperback, just like we did with The Monster in the Hollows in 2011.\nPre-Release in time for Christmas!\nIf we meet our goal, we're also committed to delivering an early pre-release version of the book to Kickstarter backers who pledge at the RAT BADGER level and above--and we're going to get this version of the book to you in time for Christmas. \nThis special pre-release will be an early proof of the book in PDF format that you can read on any device that supports PDFs (such as an iPad or a Kindle or a laptop). Because it's an early proof, it will not contain final artwork and will be subject to change as final edits take place, but if you are looking for something special to start reading on Christmas Day, this is just the thing.\nBut wait! There's more. If we can exceed our base goal, we\u2019re going to start adding value to the book in some exciting ways. And the best part is that everyone will able to benefit from these awesome additions. \nWhat kind of added value?\nStretch Goal #1 - Illustrations: For The Warden and the Wolf King, we\u2019re working with illustrator Joe Sutphin. Joe is a big fan of the Wingfeather Saga and we're really excited about the work he's doing. Visit his website here to see some of his other illustration work.\nAt our base goal, we know Joe will be doing 6 original illustrations for the book as well as new maps. But we want to do better than that. If we exceed the $14,000 goal, we\u2019ll be able to pay Joe to do even more illustrations---maybe a LOT more. Joe's art will be in the book, no matter what, but the more you help, the more illustrations he\u2019ll be able to do. Instead of 6 illustrations, as in The Monster in the Hollows, we\u2019d like to see a dozen or more. \nBut wait\u2026there\u2019s more!\nStretch Goal #2 - The Warden and the Wolf King in Hardcover: The second Stretch Goal takes effect when we reach $25,000. If we reach that threshold, we\u2019ll upgrade our production plans and publish The Warden and the Wolf King in hardcover. That means everyone who contributes (at RAT BADGER level or above) will be automatically upgraded to the hardback edition. \nStretch Goal #3 - The Monster in the Hollows Audiobook: The third Stretch Goal takes effect when we reach $30,000. Upon reaching this goal, we\u2019ll commit to producing the digital audiobook of The Monster in the Hollows (book three). Andrew Peterson will read the book, and everyone who has pledged (at the CAVE BLAT level or above) will receive it as a free download. And don't worry, Andrew is no amateur. He's narrated several audiobooks over the years.\nStretch Goal #4 - The Warden and the Wolf King Audiobook: The fourth Stretch Goal takes effect when we reach $35,000. At this point, we\u2019ll also produce the digital audiobook of The Warden and the Wolf King. Andrew Peterson will read it, and once again, everyone at the CAVE BLAT level or above will receive it as a free download. \nBut wait! There\u2019s more!\n\nStretch Goal #5 - The Monster in the Hollows in Hardcover: If we reach $45,000, we\u2019ll publish a hardback edition of book three, The Monster in the Hollows, and yes, everyone who\u2019s pledged at CAVE BLAT level or above will receive a copy\u2014for free!\nAnd, finally, here\u2019s the one we\u2019re most excited about: \nStretch Goal #6 - Pembrick's Creaturepedia: If we reach $65,000, we're going to publish something really special. Throughout the Wingfeather Saga, there have been references to Pembrick\u2019s Creaturepedia. Pembrick, the story goes, ventured all across Aerwiar, putting himself at great risk, to catalogue the strange and wonderful (and hungry) creatures of his world. And because of his great sacrifices, Annieran and Skreean people have, for many years, sat safely in the comfort of their homes to read about Gargan Rockroaches, and Snick Buzzards, and Sea Dragons, and Flabbits. For generations, the people of Aerwiar have stared rapturously at Pembrick\u2019s well-noted illustrations and thanked the Maker that they\u2019ve never encountered the horrors depicted therein. \nShould we reach $65,000, Rabbit Room Press will publish Pembrick\u2019s Creaturepedia so that you too may peruse the terrors and wonders of the Aerwiaran wilds from the security of your own home. Each and every contributor (at the CAVE BLAT level and above) will receive this hallowed tome for free. (Though it won\u2019t be delivered until the spring/summer of 2014). \nStretch Goal #7 - Fold-Out Map: If we reach $85,000 every backer at CAVE BLAT level or higher will receive a brand new, full-color, professionally-illustrated, poster-sized, fold-out map of Aerwiar. The map will be large and detailed and suitable for framing if you so desire.\nStretch Goal #8 - An Original Song: If we make it to $110,000, we'll hire producer-extraordinaire Ben Shive and record an original song from The Wingfeather Saga: \"My Love Has Gone Across the Sea.\" Andrew and Ben will work together on the arrangement and, since it's a song sung by Leeli, they'll find an awesome female vocalist here in Nashville to do the singing.\nLet us sum up.\nIf we reach $14,000, the Warden and the Wolf King will be published in early 2014, and everyone receives the pledge rewards listed in the sidebar.\nBut...\nIf we reach at least $110,000, everyone who\u2019s pledged at the CAVE BLAT level or higher will receive (in addition to the pledge rewards listed in the sidebar):\n-a hardback edition of The Warden and the Wolf King\n-a hardback edition of The Monster in the Hollows\n-a digital audiobook of The Monster in the Hollows\n-a digital audiobook of The Warden and the Wolf King\n-Pembrick\u2019s Creaturepedia \n-a poster-sized, full-color, fold-out, map of Aerwiar\n-a download of an original song from The Wingfeather Saga\nWe\u2019re confident that with your help, we can reach our goal of $14,000 and publish The Warden and the Wolf King. But for us to do all the rest, we need your help. \nShare this page! Link to it, and put it on your blog, and tell your friends, and your librarians, and your village elders.

Forget canoe rides and knot tying lessons \u2013 these kids are more likely to compete in the annual Golem Derby, or discover the proper way to train a Chimera!\nPicking up directly after the events of Phoenix Watching, Felix the Fae, Argee the Cyclops, and Moxie the Kitsune were almost burnt to ashes by a injured Phoenix... and they've barely been at camp for a day! Looking to stay out of trouble, the trio decides to spend some time relaxing on the shores of Leviathan Lake. Sirens, Kappas, Nymphs, Kelpies - what could possible go wrong? But when something ancient arises from the lake's bottomless depths, it becomes clear that someone - or something - is attempting to sabotage the entire camp!\nVisit www.campmyth.com for more information on Camp Myth, and be sure to \"Like\" the series on Facebook at www.facebook.com/campmyth and follow it on Twitter at www.twitter.com/campmyth.   \n(Artwork by Jay Camay, coloring by Lisa Moore)\nWhat Makes Camp Myth Unique?\nFrom the beginning, I wanted Camp Myth to give readers a unique way to connect with the series. Since the overall theme is about celebrating cultural and racial diversity, I paired with an amazing artist, Jay Camay, and gave fans (or, in this case, backers) the opportunity to design their own mythic campers, which were then featured as illustrations in the book.    \nThe response was absolutely incredible! Book One saw fourteen people from across four continents create Minotaurs, Centaurs, Kitsune, Sirens, and everything in between! It was amazing to correspond with those backers and watch their ideas come to life, and I can't wait to do it again!\nYou can check out the entire illustration gallery RIGHT HERE.   \nOx the Minotaur & Natious the Cyclops (backer-designed characters!)\nRewards\nThere are a few new additions to the reward tiers for this campaign, and I'm excited to explain some of the major changes.\nPersonalized copies of Kraken Fishing are only $20!-In addition to an ebook copy of Phoenix Watching, a wallpaper of the Kraken Fishing cover, early access to Kraken Fishing in all ebook formats, and your name listed on the Camp Roster (Thank You Section), you'll also receive a signed softcover of Camp Myth: Kraken Fishing - all for just twenty bucks! And you'll also be eligible for all of the awesome stretch goals as they unlock!\n*NEW* Camper Portraits!\n-Want an inexpensive way for you (or someone you know) to have your own mythic camper featured in the book? The $40 tier introduces \"Camper Portraits\" to the series! These quarter-page illustrations will let you choose from 10 potential mythic races, and design them by selecting styles from a survey list of five groups of features: Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Hair, and Expression.\nYour name will be featured underneath the portrait, and you'll be placed with other backers to form \"Camp Clubs.\" Think of it like yearbook photos, only you'll be a member of the Dryad Gardening Committee or the Centaur Bowling Team.\nFor example, here are three different Minotaurs that Jay illustrated from three unique surveys:\nFriendly, Sporty, and Bully Minotaurs.\n(For a complete list of Races/Traits, check out the F.A.Q at the bottom of this page.)     \nFull-Page Camper Illustrations!\n-Returning from Phoenix Watching, these gorgeous full-page scenes will feature a camper of your design having fun (or facing danger) on the campground. I will work with you in bringing your vision to life, and the character will be illustrated and featured in Kraken Fishing! Like Ox and Natious posted above, here are two more examples of the quality you can expect for your character:\nKaelan the Centaur & Zerra the Kitsune (backer-created characters!)\nHave Your Character Featured in a Special Bonus Story!-How would your camper survive a run-in with the titular Kraken? In this limited tier, I will also feature your custom camper in a bonus story included with every copy of Kraken Fishing! In the true spirit of Camp Myth, your character will team with a select group and have your own adventure on Leviathan Lake!\nWant to read the Bonus Story from Phoenix Watching? CLICK HERE FOR \"SNAKES AND CAMPERS\" - See how seven backers found themselves in a burning forest... and attacked by Basilisks!\n*NEW* Colored Canvas Print of Your Camper!-Perhaps you'd like to immortalize your custom camper as a piece of artwork that would be suitable to hang in the finest of art galleries!... or your room. In either case, your full-page character illustration will be professionally colored and sent to you as an 8x10 canvas print.\nBe Featured on the Cover of Camp Myth #3: Cyclopean Archery!\n-If you've read Phoenix Watching, you might notice a few familiar faces being \"greeted\" by the Kraken on the cover illustration. Aside from Felix, Argee, and Moxie, the other campers are backer-created characters from Book One, who now have a permanent place in Camp Myth history - directly on the cover!\nThis reward will guarantee your camper a place on the cover of Book Three, most likely doing something awesome with an enchanted bow that shoots all types of magical arrows! If you like what you see of all the artwork featured on this campaign page, act now, because this tier is limited to just five backers.   \nStretch Goals\nSince the first campaign, I've gained a much better understanding of the costs and logistics involved with designing, creating, and distributing all kinds of reward items, and also where I could have saved time and resources. As it stands right now, I feel that $3000 is the amount needed to launch the next volume of Camp Myth (taking into account art, design, editing, production, distribution, etc.) but that's without any of the awesome bonuses that I'd like to make to really turn Kraken Fishing into something special.\nCollectable Merit Badge Pins-I'm a huge fan of the merit badge collection aspect of Camp Myth, and want to provide readers with a unique item that can be associated with each volume. That's why, from here on out, I'd love to have every book come with a collectable pin based on the titular merit badge.\nKraken Fishing Merit Badge... In Pin Form!\nI'm extremely excited about the possibility of having these pins associated with the series from now on, and hope to have the opportunity to create them for all of you.\nBut wait, what about Phoenix Watching? Worry not! Hitting the right stretch goals will allow me to also produce that merit badge pin, and you'll be caught up with both Camp Myth adventures so far.\nExclusive \"Skyfire\" Merit Badge Pin!\nUPDATE: Starting today, anyone who makes a $50+ donation to both Camp Myth: Kraken Fishing and Jess Owen's novel, \u201cSkyfire\u201d will also receive a limited edition merit badge pin for GRYFON TAMING, featuring Shard, the main character in the Song of the Summer King series. The badge will be based on this design, and made in the same style and quality as the other collectable merit badge pins.\nGryfon Taming Merit Badge\nCamp Myth Bonus Novellas\n-I've had a lot of fun ideas for additional Camp Myth stories over the past year, and I think it's the perfect time to explore some of these concepts.\nThat's why I've added four novellas to the Stretch Goals list: Campfire Tales, Camp Myth's Got Talent!, A History of Camp Myth (by Asterion the Minotaur), and A Walking Tour of Camp Myth (by Loam the Golem). I'll unveil more information if we approach these goals. For now, here's cover for Campfire Tales:\nCamp Myth: Campfire Tales\nCamp Myth: Life After Kickstarter\nIt's been a wild ride for Camp Myth since the first Kickstarter campaign last summer. Fall saw the release of Phoenix Watching, which officially kicked things off for the series. It's since received a host of positive reviews from both backers and new readers alike.\nCheck out the Amazon page, where it has an average of 4.8 out of 5\nIF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD A PERSONALIZED SOFTCOVER OF PHOENIX WATCHING TO YOUR ORDER, JUST ADD $15!\nOR, IF YOU WOULD LIKE A PERSONALIZED KINDLE AUTOGRAPH OF PHOENIX WATCHING, VISIT CAMPMYTH.COM AND SELECT THE \"KINDLEGRAPH\" OPTION!\nThe iOS Visual Novel: Hydra Raising\nI'm a huge fan of visual novels, and soon after the release of Phoenix Watching I became obsessed with the idea of bringing the world of Camp Myth to that medium. Jay was taking some well-deserved time off, so I enlisted the help of a programmer and a new artist to try a new spin on the camp art style. A few months later, Camp Myth: iOS was released for free on iPhone/iPad, with the 8-part story, Hydra Raising. Why not download it today? :)  \n\u201cCamp Myth is a Wonderful Book for iPad and iPhone \u2013 5/5\u2033 \u2013 theiphoneappreview\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re picking up this app for your own personal enjoyment, or as a fun story for your kids to read, Camp Myth is worth your admiration.\u201d \u2013 dotTech\n\u201cWell suited for a very young reading audience while still being able to entertain the older audience.\u201d \u2013 appstorearcade \nAlong the way, I was also contacted by indie game company, Third Eye Games, to see if I would be interested in bringing the world of Camp Myth to life as a tabletop RPG. As a huge gamer myself, how could I refuse? I worked closely with 3EG to help bring the flavor, story, characters, and locations of the camp grounds to life, and the result was a game that I'm extremely proud of. In fact, I've spent hours just messing around with the character creation system, and have had a blast just designing new campers. The PDF version of the game was just released last month, with the actual books being printed right now.\nIf you or anyone you know enjoys a good tabletop adventure, why not CHECK OUT CAMP MYTH: THE RPG!   \n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly suited to children but also fun for adults. The book is absolutely dripping with flavor, character, and humor and it is a joy to read through.\u201d -Accessible Games (4.5 out of 5)\nAbout the Author\nI hope all of these examples show how dedicated I am to making Camp Myth a successful series, but what makes me qualified to write these books in the first place? Well, I've been featured in nearly two dozen publications \u2013 both online and print \u2013 including Nelson Literacy 8 (the current 8th Grade Language Arts textbook for Newfoundland and Labrador). I'm currently a Parsec Awards finalist for Best Short Story, and will also be featured in the Chuck Palahniuk-headlined anthology, Burnt Tongues (Medallion Press) in August 2014.\nTo learn more about my work, visit www.chrislewiscarter.com.\nSharin' the love!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRealistically, there aren't many risks and/or challenges associated with this project.

Even the long-reach goal of a 5-song Broodhollow EP was reached! I can't believe how far this Kickstarter went! \nAs we enter the production and fulfillment phase, you can follow me on this Kickstarter page in the Updates section and Comments sections, as well as on:\nBroodhollow\nTwitter: @krisstraub\nFacebook for Broodhollow\nMy other comic, Chainsawsuit\n\nAnd if you missed the opportunity to back, the softcover books and many of the posters, postcards, pins will appear in my online store after the Kickstarter has been fulfilled.\nHello hello hello! My name is Kris and I've been making comics online since the year 2000. I also wrote the short horror story Candle Cove. You can find me on Twitter at @krisstraub.\nLast year, I started a new horror project!\nBroodhollow is a cosmic horror adventure set in the 1930s. It's about an unlucky encyclopedia salesman, Wadsworth Zane, who is summoned to a small idyllic town to investigate an odd inheritance from a distant relative. But what seem like a series of supernatural encounters could all be an imaginary figment of Zane's obsessive disorders -- which he calls The Pattern. \nThe little town of Broodhollow, West Virginia is charmingly quirky during the day, and terrifying at night, and it only seems to be getting worse the longer Zane stays. He manages to make a few allies, but it's not the people that are the problem.\nBroodhollow wants to get inside your home, and it's desperate for your help. \nMy goal is to raise $27,500 to cover the printing, fulfillment labor and shipping of at least 2,000 high-quality, full-color 124-page softcover books, and a limited number of clothbound hardcover editions, in addition to new pins, posters, and other backer rewards. \nThanks to backers, the proposed book dimensions have been enlarged to at least 7\" x 10.5\" (landscape)!\nBroodhollow will be told in interconnected stories each designed to stand on their own. The first story, Curious Little Thing, is over 110 pages of full-color comics. I'm not asking for you to fund the creation of Curious Little Thing -- it's done. In fact, you can read the entire story right now. I've been giving it away for free online, page by page, since October of 2012. \nThis is my first color comic and my first digitally painted comic. Broodhollow has been about pushing myself to grow as a cartoonist. I will be working with printers and knowledgeable professionals who will help me translate the Broodhollow you see on-screen onto the printed page. I'm very aware that there's a lot of dark scenes in this story with a lot of small, bright details -- I want the books to capture all of them.\nThis Kickstarter is about a book, so backers at all listed reward tiers are getting one -- whether it's digital, softcover or limited-edition clothbound hardcover at the higher tiers.\nIf the goal is not reached by the completion date, no money will change hands and zero books, pins or posters will be made. Bummer!\nWith your contribution, you are helping to bring a unique horror story into the world. The central mystery of Broodhollow is very well fleshed out -- and even though the first book is a complete story, we barely glimpse any of the puzzle at the town's center. It's a twist I haven't seen or read anywhere else, and I want to deliver it to you in future stories.\nSo what gets made if we do hit the goal, besides the book? Oh! What delights await you, dear traveler!\nThe timeless 1930s affect of Broodhollow is a joy to work in, and ideas pour out of me as blood would from an open wound. I've got postcard sets! And 12x18\" cardstock posters!\nAnd I've commissioned fine brass pins for the Society of the Skull and Shovels -- an order we're introduced to in the first story, but one whose importance isn't fully known yet. Luxuriate in their gleam!\nAnd at even higher tiers, I will craft misery for you from whole cloth, by drawing you in Broodhollow fashion being chased by a unique new tormentor of my design! You can even appear in the next story. (I can't promise that it will end well for you.)\nIf Broodhollow Book 1: Curious Little Thing goes over target, I have enhancements planned that will improve the books, the strip and the Broodhollow experience for everyone! And of course, the further we go over the goal, the better able I will be to devote time to more Broodhollow stories in months (and years) to come!\nScroll down after the graphic for descriptions of each stretch goal!\n$30,000 - REACHED - A downloadable pack of hi-res 1920x1080 wallpapers featuring key moments from Book 1 has been unlocked for ALL REWARD TIERS!\n$40,000 - REACHED - A 12x12\" Kickstarter-only print has been unlocked for all reward tiers at and above $33!\n$45,000 - REACHED - ALL softcovers will now feature tasteful spot gloss treatments!

Hit \"Continue to Next Step.\" Then confirm your new pledge!\nMake a note to yourself of what you've added on! When the project has completed and the merchandise is ready to ship (estimated mid October 2013), I will send a backer survey asking for important information, like your shipping address.

It was going to grow up and blossom into a glorious and rich story if not for the fact that I LOST STRIP SEARCH (smashes flower pot against wall in fit of passion)  \nThis Kickbuster is the embodiment of my hope that other people liked the sound of my story as much as I do, and are willing to help me make this a real thing.\nThe Tale Of This Chick\nThe Last Halloween is an online black and white comedic graphic novel that follows the adventures and misadventures of Mona Merkins, an average ten year old girl.\nIt's Halloween and she's all dressed up and ready to go trick or treating, when it becomes apparent that there isn't going to be any trick or treating this year. Monsters have been set loose upon the world and are intent on extinguishing all human life. Humanity's only hope rests with Mona and a squad of dysfunctional undead youngsters.

Each update would consist of, on average, three inked 11x17 inch pages. At the end of the nine months, I will have reached the end of Volume One, at 110 pages.\nAnd to all those JSPH fans who need their fix, never fear, I love JSPH and will continue to update while TLH is airing.

Scroll down to see some more information about the stretch goals, the return of Webcomics Weekly, and new reward tiers!\nABOUT THE BOOK\nIn 2008, I co-wrote the \"How To Make Webcomics\" book with my good friends Scott Kurtz, Dave Kellett and Kris Straub. At the time, this book was embraced as the seminal book on the subject. For years, each of us has been honored by colleagues and newcomers alike who have told us what a fun and informative read the book was.\nAnd then, they all say the same thing: When are you gonna do a follow-up?\nUnfortunately, with each of us busy on different projects, it has been impossible to get together to do a second edition.\nThen it occurred to me that I had already written the sequel. In 2009, after the book came out, I launched a Web site, Webcomics.com, that has been updated daily ever since with the same kinds of information we put in the book. Using those posts as a starting point, I started assembling chapters and adding new content. By the time the dust settled, I had a 300-page book that covers a wider range of topics and goes even deeper on the content from the original book.\nAnd now I want to get that book printed and distributed so it can become a resource for an entirely new generation of cartoonists. I'm asking for money to cover the related costs of that endeavor -- editing, printing, etc.\nHere are some page spreads from the book. As you can see, it will cover some of the same material as the previous book -- updated with new information and tutorials...\n...and it will cover some topics that weren't around when we wrote the first book (like social media and digital downloads)...\n...mainly, the book will maintain the tradition of the first book by getting as much information as possible into every page -- while addressing the subjects in an informal and fun way.\nThere are even step-by-step tutorials for all levels of cartoonists. whether you're installing Google Analytics or upgrading your ad-delivery system to Doubleclick For Publishers, you'll find easy-to-follow guides.\nSTRETCH GOALS!\nAs I said in the video, I'd like to take this book one step further, and to do that. I'm going to need a little help from my friends. And I've added a few new rewards to make it worth your while.\nThe first -- which will begin recording if we reach $12,500 -- is a new podcast that I'm calling Webcomics Confidential. This podcast will be a series of interviews with some of the brightest names in webcomics -- the top creators and some of the people who work behind the scenes to help those creators succeed. The first interview will be with George Rohac. George is The Director of Business Development for What Pumpkin Studios. Beyond Homestuck, he has assisted creators of comics and video games to reaching over $4 million (cumulatively) through Kickstarter. Needless to say, this is a guy that webcartoonists need to hear more from.\nThe second -- which will begin once this campaign reaches $15,000 -- is a new episode of Webcomics Weekly with Scott Kurtz, Dave Kellett, Kris Straub and me. To say that I'm excited at the prospect of recording new episodes with these guys is an understatement.\nAll backers of this Kickstarter campaign will get advance downloads of the podcasts. We've got new rewards to entice you to back this project (or increase your pledge amount). New podcasts, some familiar voices, and some cool, new rewards.

Freelance stuff is fun, don't get me wrong-- I truly appreciate every opportunity I've been given. Kickstarter though, is my chance of doing a book without limitations. It gives me the ability to do the book how I envision it, and it opens up so many other possibilities. For example, being able to have talented people that I have come to know and love, lend their own talents to the project. As well as the incentives, like the \"creature creation\" pledge. These are things I feel I wouldn't have the ability to do if I were to take the project to a publisher.\nThe story is complete, but unfortunately, I lack the proper funding to really kick the production into full swing. I have started working on what I can between freelance gigs, but I fear it could be far too long before the book makes it to print unless I try an alternate route. The last thing I want to see it become is something that inevitably gets pushed to the back burner collecting dust. This is a story and vision that I have wanted to share for some time, and I have come too far to give up on it now.  \nIt's not only my chance to do the book how I see it, but it\u2019s also a way to raise enough funding to complete the first book, print it, and get it in your hands. Assuming the first book is a success, I look forward to having the chance to produce the remaining books, via kickstarter, and allowing the fans (YOU!) to be much more involved in the incentives for the next go around.\nWHY $12,000?:\nAfter crunching the numbers, this is the necessary amount in order for me to accomplish all that I am offering. The money would fund the printing of 500 full-color 100+ page soft cover copies of the first book. It would also go towards creating and distributing the rewards to all of those who pledge. Last but not least, and I'm not going to lie, a good portion of the funding will enable me to take time away from my full time job and to dedicate my time and efforts into making this book a reality. \nYes, I could do the book in my spare time. But there is no telling how long it would be before I would actually be able to print the book. I feel I owe it to you, and to all who support this project, to get this book done in a reasonable, timely manner. Also, I want to be able to put my heart and soul into every page, making each one something to remember and well worth every penny you pledge: You have my word on that.\nThe projected completion, printing, and mailing of \u201cBAAKO, Book 1\u201d, along with all pledge rewards, is January, 2014. Layouts are done, and I am in the process of inking and coloring pages, which I will complete no later then the beginning of December 2013, assuming our goal is reached.\nIf we surpass our goal of $12,000, there will be plenty of stretch goal incentives that I think you will enjoy! These will include faster completion time, buttons, stickers and all sorts of cool little extras, more printed copies of the book, a hard cover versus soft cover, a stand-alone sketchbook, and a plethora of pin-ups done by other artists willing to contribute their talents. \nWHAT I WILL ACCOMPLISH WITH YOUR SUPPORT:\nI will finish and print the first book of BAAKO, and deliver on all that I am offering you! Most importantly, I want to show that standing up for what you believe in means something; I want to accomplish the goal of staying true to myself. Lastly, I hope to set an example for my children, showing them that, in order to do what you love and to truly be happy, you must take that leap of faith.\nBOOK 1 PLOT.\nIt all began when a great star fell from the heavens, unleashing an evil force known by those who inhabit this world as \u201cthe Hatred.\" From that day onward, it has become a constant struggle for survival. The Hatred continues to grow and to consume everything in it's path, leaving behind nothing but a barren wasteland, distorting anyone caught in its path into grotesque minions whose only purpose is to serve and further its onslaught, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction.\nThe story begins quite some time after the Hatred has spread, leaving very few civilizations remaining. It will follow a mysterious young girl, unscathed by the Hatred. She is discovered just on the outskirts of its reach and is taken in by a very small tribe preparing for their next battle. Believing the girl is of great importance, the leaders of the tribe decide to send her away to meet with one who they think could clear away the fog that shrouds her past. Wanting to stay and prove herself a true warrior, she agrees. Unfortunately, before she is able to make it to her destination, tragedy strikes, leaving her with no choice but to turn back the way she came. As she sets out to rejoin the tribe, other mysterious figures come into play. They have hidden interests of their own in regards to our young heroine.\nAs the first book comes to a conclusion, we will find out who (and what) these \"mysterious figures\" are and what their true intentions are. We\u2019ll also learn our heroine's true potential and her purpose in the fight against the Hatred.\n1 of 3 BAAKO TRADING CARDS!\nBAAKO is the story of a young girl coming of age in a world full of unimaginable terrors. She must find the courage to set out on a journey full of peril, loss, and betrayal and learn to overcome it all.\nThe story is inspired heavily on the fact that I have a daughter of my own. To tell a story with a strong female lead without the \"physical\" attributes that are so commonly attributed to such a role is of huge importance to me.\nThis is a journey of uncertainty: of knowing what has to be done, getting out of your comfort zone, building up the courage to take that leap of faith, and hoping you land on your feet!\nBAAKO is a fantasy tale at heart and a culmination of everything I've ever wanted to do in my own book. The story is a mix of multiple genres and a place for my imagination to run wild and free! \nA LOOK AT BAAKO:\nBelow are a few pages to give you an idea of what the book will look like. The book will be in full color and have dialogue, and as the kickstarter continues on, I will update as often as possible with new pages.\nBAAKO leaping into action to help a fellow tribesman!\nCharacter lineup 1\nA page from the 100 page BAAKO sketchbook!\nBAAKO MONSTER WATERCOLOR!\nLAST BUT NOT LEAST:\nMuch like everything else in this world, you can't do it all by yourself: I need help. I need YOUR help. I want every supporter to see all of my intentions for what they truly are, and I will be as transparent as humanly possible in order to accomplish this goal. So, if any of you have any uncertainties or questions regarding BAAKO, please feel free to contact me directly at any time. I would be more than happy to personally answer any and all questions you may have about this book.

It's taken a long time to get here but we hope you enjoy the new Scarlet Huntress material we've got coming!!!\nScarlet Huntress has been a passion and a long journey for us. We have worked hard to develop the characters, back stories, and story arcs to keep readers interested. The original book, Scarlet Huntress #1, came out in 2006 but Scarlet first appeared in two other anthology books called Portal. After seeing great reviews and success with #1 we took our time developing the next phase of the story and published Scarlet Huntress #2 in 2011. Soon after came the ancillary books Scarlet's Guide to Cryptids and a children's book version Little Red Riding Hood: Origins of a Huntress. People have been asking for more stories and more books so we've come up with this kickstarter to help fund our and everyone else's dreams of seeing more Scarlet Huntress hitting the shelves.\nThis kickstarter will allow Sean to take time away from other paying work to finish the art on the new Scarlet Huntress book. The stories have been written, and cover is done, and now we just need the time and the money to finish the art and get it published and into the hands of readers. People all over the country and some international readers have been asking for new material, but it's hard to justify getting the art finished when we also need to put food on the table and stay afloat as a family. This is where the wonderful idea of kickstarter comes in - it allows us to seek funds to help produce this awesome new work!\nThis new book is a collection of 3 stories, each of which have a very different theme and style because they've been written by 3 different writers (John Barker, Bryan (Stratos) K. Borgman, and regular Scarlet Huntress writer Stephanie Forney. Below you will find a description of each story and a short bio on each of the people involved in the new book. \nStory #1 - The Hollow - by John Barker                                      Scarlet finds herself hunting werewolves in a small town in Siberia. But she soon discovers that werewolves aren't the enemy in this case... it's something bigger and blood-thirsty, a cryptid beast who will not be stopped easily. \nJohn Barker is an award winning poet, and author of the critically acclaimed Arcana Studios graphic novel, The Dead Cell. With story telling described as deeply layered and dark, John is also the author of an award winning series of essays on the philosophy of theology, and is a Doctor of Divinity. John has several other projects soon to see solicitation including, \u201cThe Dark\u201d, \u201cAvery Vernum and the Monsters on the Sun\u201d and \u201cArmy of Pharaohs\u201d, all of which are sure to continue to explore the deepest, darkest corners of the human psyche.\nStory #2 - Enter the Huntress - by Bryan K. Borgman                  This story takes us into the future with Scarlet, where she is well-established as a werewolf huntress and has begun working with the Special Mission Force (an organization that works to fight all various kaiju monsters in our world). \nBryan K. Borgman(aka Stratos) is the founder of Bailey Records and creator of Kaiju Kaos - The Miniatures Game. The two-time award-nominated recording artist/soundtrack composer has worked on dozens of projects over the past decade, including CyberNet, Warlands, Rezolution, Pulp City, Spycraft, and more. Stratos will serve as executive producer of \"This is Scarlet Huntress\", a soundtrack EP that is one of the stretch goals of this kickstarter. Stratos will also serve as primary composer and producer of the entire album. In addition to music duties, Stratos is offering metal and resin miniatures from his Kaiju Kaos game as additional stretch goals. The gaming miniatures include Scarlet Huntress sculpted by Fiendish Fabrications and Vincent Malakov (aka the Big Bad Wolf) in werewolf form sculpted by Bryan Steele, plus kickstarter-exclusive limited edition resin castings of Atticus the Wicked Werewolf sculpted by Steven Patt. For Stratos's discography, visit www.baileyrecords.com. For more information on Kaiju Kaos, visit www.kaijukaos.com or check both out on Facebook. \nStory #3 - by Stephanie Forney                                                This story will be a continuation where issue #2 leaves us - after Scarlet's first kill she starts to do more and seeks out the hiding places of werewolves in order to find out more about them. \nStephanie Forney is co-creator of Scarlet Huntress with husband Sean. Steph wrote Scarlet Huntress #1, Scarlet Huntress #2, Scarlet's Guide to Cryptids, and Little Red Riding Hood: Origins of a Huntress (which she also did the artwork for). Together the Forney's both travel around the country to comic book conventions promoting Scarlet Huntress and Sean's other professional work. Steph is a visual arts teacher who works at a high school in central Ohio and also a co-founder of Help for Heroes, a start-up non-profit that focuses on helping comic book artists fighting cancer.

It sounds boring and I think it probably is.\nApparently it wasn't boring\nIn fact, it turns out \"Downloadable Content\" was one of the most popular projects we've ever done. People loved the; back when when we put the episodes up on iTunes, they were #1 in Comedy. Of course there was much more to it than \"us guys\" sitting around looking at news with a mic on. What we thought people would hate - just how nonlinear the comic-creation process is - was what they seemed to like. How conversations would spiral off into space, collect strange minerals, and then return to inform the strips. How \"real life\" would suddenly come up and influence the topic.\n\u201cDownloadable Content\u201d stopped in 2009 because it was always a hobby - Kiko, one of our designers, edited the podcasts in his spare time.  He doesn't really have that anymore.  We started doing episodes of Penny Arcade: The Series dedicated to the writing process, and while people liked them, they didn't do what DLC did, which was to put you in the room and leave you there.  We want to get back to that, in a way you can depend on.  We want it to be a regular part of the site, the real deal.\nTell me more\nOkay, I will.\nOur first Kickstarter was an endeavor that changed how we make Penny Arcade pretty dramatically, and we got a ton of great feedback from it. One thing people were very clear on was that some of our \"stretch goals\" should have been their own Kickstarters.  We figured it out.  Or, you figured it out, and then told us.  So, this project is for \"Downloadable Content\" alone, and all stretch goals will either further reward backers or make this specific project better.\nFor example: The first stretch goal is an original theme song written and performed by myself (Tycho, occasionally also Jerry) and Kris Straub. That\u2019s fresh. The second stretch goal improves a backer reward. If we get super stretchy, or elastic or whatever, we can \"enlengthen\" this season. And so on.\nHere's the basics, though: we need some dedicated recording hardware, and an audio guy to edit the episodes.  Together, these things will keep the turnaround smooth and make the process reliable.  After pledging, you will also feel good inside.  And outside.  You'll feel good on your skin.\nThe content which will be available to download\nIf funded we'll produce a season of 20 original episodes of \"Downloadable Content\u201d, which works out to roughly one episode a week. The first episode will launch immediately after the Kickstarter ends; backers will receive a direct download link to it and all successive episodes. Each episode will be between 20-60 minutes, edited for the soul of wit. Backers get them first, and after two weeks every episode (barring those exclusive to backers) will go up as pay-what-you-want.\nStretch Goals\nWe have them.

Lets break another record.\nLoVe always, \nkristen bell\nDay 1: Messages from Rob & Kristen\nAlmost since Veronica Mars went off the air, there's been talk of making a movie. In that span, I've taken different tactics in dealing with the question of whether it might happen. To be clear, I've always wanted to make a Veronica Mars movie. I love writing these characters and working with these actors. Kristen Bell has always wanted to make the movie.\nThere was a moment, a few years ago, when we thought we had a real shot at making it happen. I developed a pitch that revolved around graduation day at Hearst college -- Wallace and Mac were graduating at least, Veronica had been sidetracked by freeing Keith from prison. Plus, there was a murder in Neptune that was affecting the beach city's spring break business in much the same way a great white shark affected the beach community of Amity. I probably stoked fan fervor in my optimistic comments about the prospects. Warner Bros. wasn\u2019t convinced there was enough interest to warrant a major studio-sized movie about Veronica and the project never got off the ground.\nAfter that, I tried to tamp down expectations. I didn't want to be guilty \u2014 at least not twice \u2014 of building up hope when the odds seemed so long. Still, without fail, in every interview I do or every place I speak, I get the \"will there be a Veronica Mars movie?\" question. Even after a couple of years of downplaying the chances, I'd still run across blog postings headlined, \"will Rob Thomas shut up about the Veronica Mars movie, already!\" I was trying to. I promise. \nI first found out about Kickstarter a couple of years ago from an Austin musician friend of mine \u2014 Robert Harrison, lead singer of Cotton Mather, the band that gave us \"Lily Dreams On,\" our closing song of season 1. He financed a rerelease of the band's fantastic Kontiki album. Later, I was marveling about Kickstarter with another buddy of mine who said off-handedly, \"You should use Kickstarter to raise the money to make the Veronica Mars movie.\" I chuckled. That seemed like a silly idea in the moment. We'd need millions. But for the next few weeks, the notion was never far from my mind. I started doing the proverbial back-of-a-cocktail-napkin math. The average pledge on Kickstarter is $71. Hell, if we could get 30,000 people to give the average donation, we could finance the movie, particularly if the cast and I were willing to work cheap. The most common donation amount on Kickstarter is $25. Surely, 80,000 of our three million viewers would find that price-point viable! \nOf course, Warner Bros. still owns Veronica Mars and we would need their blessing and cooperation to pull this off. Kristen and I met with the Warner Bros. brass, and they agreed to allow us to take this shot. They were extremely cool about it, as a matter of fact. Their reaction was, if you can show there\u2019s enough fan interest to warrant a movie, we\u2019re on board. So this is it. This is our shot. I believe it's the only one we've got. It's nerve-wracking. I suppose we could fail in spectacular fashion, but there's also the chance that we completely revolutionize how projects like ours can get made. No Kickstarter project ever has set a goal this high. It's up to you, the fans, now. If the project is successful, our plan is to go into production this summer and the movie will be released in early 2014. \nLife has taken Veronica away from Neptune. In the years since spoiling Keith's chances to be reelected sheriff, Veronica hasn't taken a case. But something big is about to bring her back home and back to her calling. My goal is to include as many of your favorite characters as possible. It is, after all, time for Veronica\u2019s 10-year high school reunion. Keep in mind that the more money we raise, the cooler movie we can make. A two million dollar fundraising total probably means cross words are exchanged at the class reunion. Three million? We can afford a full-on brawl. Ten million? Who knows... For some reason the Neptune High class reunion takes place on a nuclear submarine! A Hobbit shows up! There\u2019s a Bollywood end-credit dance number! I\u2019ve always wanted to direct Bill Murray. We\u2019ll figure out something cool. Hey, if that total goes high enough, I\u2019ll bet the good folks at Warner Bros. will agree a sequel is a good idea.\nThanks to everyone who hasn't lost faith.\nRob\nDay 1: A Message from Kristen\ndearest marshmallows... \nI am currently the happiest blonde in a hamster ball the world has ever seen.

After gaining powers at a very early age, Kerri Masters ran into one serious life event after another. She was enslaved by a maniacal villain, forced to help some of the world most heinous villains kill her live-in boyfriend rather than watch him destroy the world, and found herself alone and carrying a child who could well develop more power than both of his parents combined. Raising kids is already a herculean challenge. Raising a kid with enough power to crack planets is a whole new ballgame! After five years of retirement, Dynagirl has the urge and the opportunity to return to hero work, but should she?\nOverall Theme: At the heart of things Dynagirl is about how very real the whole hero game can come to be, and how our choices in life stay with us forever. Sure, she might stop a plane from crashing into the ocean, or save an old lady from crossing the street into oncoming traffic, but she\u2019s still got every day life, and her son, to deal with when she goes home at night. With this story we tackle things most comics never go anywhere near, and we do it because it's compelling and makes for a great comic.\nOur characters are regular normal people faced with incredible situations. Dynagirl is without a doubt a character driven story centering mainly on our main character, but also tossing several other very interesting and flawed individuals into the mix as her supporting cast.\nWhy It\u2019s Different: Dynagirl is so much more real. The art is stylized to portray people as they would actually look rather than the Barbie and Ken reality seen in most comics these days. People have weight, they have flaws, they look like real people look! The story is also a deep, and often fun take on the superhero genre. It's serious and smart without portraying the world around us as too dark or sinister. There will be villains, and many of them very terrifying, but in Dynagirl, there\u2019s always hope, and with hope you can do anything.  \nPraise for our previous work:\nJohn Barringer for acomicbookblog.com: \u201cThis story is thicker than molasses and issue #2 just increases the potential of some great story telling. Take a break from the mainstream and pick up this story.\u201d\npigs-of-the-industry.blogspot.com: \u201cOne of the best things about this comic is the way it handles its large cast of characters. It\u2019s easy to believe these heroes and villains have been fighting it out for a while now.

What has changed has to do with life and economic situations, which now force us to reach out for alternative means of funding the work we love to produce. What we want to do now is take the story we have already completed and get it out there to as many people as possible in printed form, as well as fund the completion of the next chapter in her story. Our first focus will be to take the first six issues of Dynagirl and put them into one complete volume, including a ton of sketchbook and behind the scenes stuff. We will use collected funds for printing costs, promotional purposes for getting the word out, and to produce and ship all backer rewards.

THANK YOU ALL! Beyond initial funding, if we could get to $70,000 I can then include a good size \"preview\" of the second graphic novel into everyone's copies of \"Volume 1\". This particular section would be about Captain's Hook, where he came from, and a glimpse into what drives him (and yes all the information came from J.M. Barrie!)\nIf we could get to $100,000 we could open up Volume 2 for purchase, but I understand that is probably just a dream! :)      \nTHANK YOU ALL FOR A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN! :)   \nAbout this project...\nMy goal is to adapt the original novel of Peter and Wendy by J.M. Barrie into a graphic novel that is as true to source as possible. The original story is one of the most beautiful novels I've every read, and has always been a huge inspiration to me. I feel current adaptations leave a lot of the original story left untold, or have fundamentally changed story elements. Therefore I feel doing this Graphic novel is a terrific way to highlight the fantastic original story of Peter Pan in it's entirety. I also intend to further explore Peter Pan and Captain Hook's backstory by adapting parts from J.M Barrie's The Little White Bird  ( prequel to Peter and Wendy) and a little known information given by Barrie about Jas. Hook into the story. \nI also would like to create something that parents can share with their children. It's my hope that creating something children can also experience will encourage reading, creativity, and appreciation of classic tales.\nThose that have not read the novel may not realize just how much deeper and more involved the original story is. I don't want to give away all the differences between present adaptations and source material, but I promise it will be worthwhile to experience them if you are a Peter Pan fan like I am.\n                              (click image to see larger)\n2 page spread preview (unlettered) This part adapted from \"The Little White Bird\"\nI am not a Peter Pan expert, I am just a person who is a lifelong fan who loves the story.

I will be adapting and penciling the artwork, while my husband, Ray Dillon, will be tackling inking, coloring and lettering. Ray and I previously worked on the New York Times Bestselling adaptation of Peter Beagle's The Last Unicorn Graphic Novel by IDW. You can see some at our work on TLU HERE.\nI am focused on Volume 1 of Peter Pan right now because I don't want to keep backers waiting for over a year for the whole series to be completed before they receive their reward.\nUpon first sight, $48,000 seems like a lot of money. However, Kickstarter campaigns are not straight donations and in reality a campaign costs a lot  of time and money to fulfill rewards ordered and manage correspondance. So only part of the money asked for actually go towards creative production of the book. \nProduction costs- We are the entire creative team for the book, and if you break down what funding we'd get for the 90 pages of full production work we'd create, the rates break down to less than we would get paid elsewhere. I didn't even include funding for the time to adapt, letter, design, create promotional images, covers, pin ups, take care of the Kickstarter, or work on the sketchbook. In short; we are not becoming rich by any means with this campaign. Our only intent is to be able to work on Peter Pan, and be able to survive through it!\nKickstarter/Amazon Fees - Roughly 8%-10% of final funding\nTaxes -  self employed rates apply\nProduction of books - These rates vary depending on amount ordered, but takes up a nice chunk of funds\nShipping & shipping supply - Another large chunk, depending on amount shipped\nBuffer Amount - This should be included in ANY Kickstarter. This includes money aside for dropped pledges, lost books, refund requests, and any errors and miscalculations.\n                              *   *   *\nHow Kickstarter Works...\nKickstarter is unlike regular online ordering experiences in that you are not just buying an item for precise arrival, you are joining us in our personal adventure to complete this project. You'll be with us for both the victories as well as the bumps and difficulties, all culminating in receiving the final product which we have all given so much to achieve. Kickstarter is more about supporting ideas, people, and projects than it is to receive an item right away. Just so you're aware of everything before you join us in Neverland! :)\nStep 1. Create a Kickstarter account, and determine payment method\nStep 2. Decide which Reward you'd like, taking special note of any shipping estimates.\nStep 3. Wait and see what happens! If our campaign is successful by December 20th, then your card will be charged and your reward is secured. If our campaign is unsuccessful, then your card will NOT be charged.\nStep 4.

Tweets, facebook posts, blog posts, whatever you want to do to help, we would eternally appreciate it!\n                              *   *   *\nRewards...\nWe are aiming for September 2013 for delivery on most rewards. Please consider this includes an overestimate of about 4-5 months for research and production, 1 month for design, 2 months for printing, and 1 month for shipping.\n***Christmas 2012: For those who order Peter Pan: Vol. 1 as gifts, you will have access to a printable certificate on December 20th featuring new Holiday Peter Pan artwork.

The story will be about the first 3rd of the original story, as well as extra bits from The Little White Bird and, if space allows, a small peek at an adaptation of little know information given by J.M. Barries about Captain Hook. For bonus material I hope to include an interview with Christine De Poortere, Peter Pan director from the Great Ormond Street Hospital, as well as a brief biography spotlighting their relationship with Peter Pan.\nPeter Pan: The Companion Guide: A sketchbook sized 90 page booklet that includes ALL the penciled artwork for Volume 1, as well as thoughts and notes on the adaptation process by me!\nSigned/Sketch/Artwork Copies: These copies will require longer processing time as to have time to create the artwork on the interior cover :) Signed copies should be much faster.\nCameo Reward: This reward will require a photo and release of likeness form signed.

Barrie passed, he relinquished all rights and profits to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in England. His hope was that Peter Pan's success would forever serve to help children in need. The novel version of Peter Pan is now in public domain, however I am determined to keep to the spirit of Barrie's gift. If somehow this series (Volume 1 and onward) becomes successful upon regular publication, it is my goal to benefit GOSH in some way.

Simmons, and thank you so much for your consideration of my project, Knights of P.O.W.E.R.! The official website for my comic series is at http://www.angelwolfcomics.com/ and although there will be exclusive updates for backers here at Kickstarter, some production artwork from the series will be on the official website as the Kickstarter campaign goes on.\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION: \nFive survivors of tragedy have joined together to save others. This is their calling... This is their power. \nTen years ago, the Journeymen, in an effort to save their youngest member Skyblaze and New Jersey, managed to defeat and possibly kill their worst enemy Valence... but in the process sacrificed themselves. Nowadays, a grown-up Skyblaze and his girlfriend Gel operate as heroes and meet others inspired by the Journeymen. Tech Enforcer, who lost his son to senseless violence, acts as a mentor for Sapphire Red and Steelglove, two heroes with very painful pasts. \nPreventing a political assassination brings the five together to form the Knights of P.O.W.E.R. Despite the tragedies each of them faced in their own lives, they refuse to be considered victims and provide hope and strength by example. Working together, they share some of their most closely held secrets in order to help each other... and also to survive the return of Valence, who plans to use their powers against them so she can kill the last of the Journeymen and their legacy.\nTHE MAIN CHARACTERS:\nTech Enforcer (Gary Winter): His suit contains a number of weapons only he can access. After he lost his son to senseless violence, this former boxer began protecting his neighborhood and now mentors others. Gary started the P.O.W.E.R. Foundation in memory of his son. He sees the Knights project as the ultimate outreach of the cause, and leads the team.\nSapphire Red (Rachel Summerlin): Her powers come from a mystical jewel that bonds with a pure soul. Her powers include flight, casting intense light and energy blasts, and above average strength. Like the rest of the team, she is a survivor of tragedy and looks to help others instead of being a \"victim\". Never one to show too much force, she is kind and compassionate until innocents are threatened. \nSteelglove (Dan McCall): A sculptor, Dan has cast metal bodysuits to fight crime in. He is seemingly hot-tempered, but also very protective. He is maybe the one with the most to learn on the team. Steelglove has made it his personal mission to track down predators so that kids can feel safer. Dan feels a strong bond with Rachel and has deep feelings and admiration for her that he has yet to express.\nGel (Angela Sparks): Arguably the most powerful hero on the Knights of P.O.W.E.R. team. She can mold her mysterious gel substance into any shape, in unmeasured lengths, into any texture and strength of durability. Her sense of humor and warm smile gets her through any tough challenges she faces and also eases those around her. Angela is the longtime girlfriend of Skyblaze, whom she met when they were both still kids, shortly after the separate events that changed each of their lives forever.\nSkyblaze (Steven Tate): He can defy gravity, create rings of fire, and is one of only a few heroes who can survive in space. Ten years ago, he became the last of the hero team called The Journeymen after their final battle with their biggest enemy, Valence. Despite his awesome powers, he's still sometimes troubled by what he had to see and do when he was a kid sidekick. Steve and Gary met briefly when they were younger, and now they are about to meet up again to help form a new team that will help lead the way to a brighter future.\nThe Journeymen: The most admired super-team of their generation, the Journeymen were the epitome of bravery and selflessness in the pursuit of freedom and dealing out justice. The team was led by SolarStar, and over time had various members, including Luna Moonchild, Highspeed, Thunderblast, Sharpshooter, Gypsy Moth, Sidetracker, and Foresight.\nThe villains: The Knights of P.O.W.E.R. do not have it easy as they go up against hordes of villains, ranging from sadistic monsters, lethal weaponsrunners, political assassins, and immortal rulers.\nValence: She is the powerful sorceress who supposedly died in a final battle with the Journeymen years ago. Unaware of her survival and the slow return of her powers, Skyblaze and Gel meet up with other heroes inspired by the Journeymen. It is now that Valence strikes, to not only destroy the legacy of the Journeymen, but to also use the new team's various strengths against them.\nFiretrap: As Valenceseeks revenge on the last of the Journeymen and his new friends, Firetrap leaves one Knights of P.O.W.E.R. member to question almost everything he believes he knows about criminals.\nThe Blade Twins, Barbed Wire, Miss Stress, Lineman, Switchblade, Kamoflague, and WARSHOP are among the other adversaries to test our heroes in their first adventures.\nTHE PERSONAL SIDE:\nThis story goes beyond a superhero story for me. There are many elements of the storylines that either come from personal experiences or events that have happened to friends of mine or those I have met, and viewpoints, news stories, and conflicts that have resonated and left impact, along with causes and charities that I truly believe in. Sure, it may be extrapolated onto the canvas of a superhero drama, with big fights, explosions, and high stakes risks thrown in for fun, but when it all comes down to it, these are characters with personal flaws and tragic backstories that I feel have weight and are really stories that I want to tell. Each character is one I have had with me for quite a long time. \nWHY I AM RAISING FUNDS:\nThe funds raised here on Kickstarter would be used to help cover both printing costs and colorist fees for the \"Heroes and Hexes\" storyarc (which would be published as the first 5 issues of the series, and, of course, as a tradepaperback). Anything raised beyond the funding goal would go towards more copies of the book being printed, marketing campaigns and promotional materials, and anything else truly relevant to the successful printing and distribution of this first storyarc. If things get really, really crazy in fundraising, additional funds will be used towards printing and color on the second storyarc and the tie-in mini-series, and maybe even to promote the book at a large-scale convention such as San Diego or New York. \nAlthough I feel I am pretty good at coloring, I know there are much better colorists out there, and that's why I have contacted some of the most talented colorists I have met, including Ross Hughes, Matthew Swift, Splash!, and Ann Uland, for covers and hopefully some interiors. I'm doing the creation, writing, artwork, and maybe even lettering on this project, so giving some of the coloring to those who I feelcan do it better than I can speeds the whole process up and helps it look more beautiful in the finished piece. Some of these colorists have done work for Marvel, DC, and Image, and their work is stellar. Matthew and Ann live around here, and both seem like great people and I enjoy their work. I've had the pleasure of working with Ross Hughes before on two issues of another project and really enjoyed his colors over my artwork, and Splash! though I've yet to meet him in person, has colored some of my art for a poster before, and I loved it. I truly feel the color will be in good hands.\nRemember that with Kickstarter fundraising, I have to meet my goal in order to get the pledge rewards out to you. Kickstarter is all-or-nothing funding. If I successfully reach my fundraising goal, the project continues to move forward and all the paid pledge rewards go out according to the notated schedules. If I don't reach my fundraising goal, though, you won't be charged for your pledges at all. Please feel free to share this page and project information with friends and family, so that this project can be printed and in color! Thanks so much!\nTHE GOAL: \nHere is the plan! If the Kickstarter campaign is successful, my goal is to have Issue #1 completed and printed up in time for a debut at (or before) the 2012 Cincinnati Comic Expo (September 22-23). Going forward, here's a general outline of when I am thinking each issue and the trade paperback would be printed by (or before), using conventions or holidays as relevant goal markers: Issue #1: September 2012 (Cincinnati Comic Expo)... Issue #2: December 2012 (Christmas)... Issue #3: March 2012 (Lexington, Gem City, and April's C2E2)... Issue #4: June 2013 (Derby City)... Issue #5: September 2013 (Cincinnati Comic Expo)... TPB: December 2013 (Christmas). That way, the whole first storyarc of 5 issues is wrapped up within a year's time, and collected a couple of months later, which isn't too bad for an independent comic book.\nSPECIAL THANKS:\nFirst and foremost, to my beautiful wife, Shannon, for being the love of my life and helping film parts of a video for this project!\nTo THE BIG CREAK, one of my all-time favorite bands, for permission to use \"The Stars Are Falling Out of the Sky\". You can purchase their albums buying clicking on the links to iTunes and CDBaby \nTo my parents, for always believing in me!... To all the writers and other collaborators who gave me feedback and other comments!... To Brant, for the refined logos he did based off my sketches!... To the colorists-in-waiting, hope the campaign succeeds and we get to work together!\nAnd of course, many thanks to those of you who pledge to help this project!\n--Scott D.M.

People who make content learn to like it, because they want to make content, and they also want to eat food and sleep under a roof, and the opportunity to do both at the same time seems like a pretty good idea. \nAfter the \"dot com bubble,\" we ran the site entirely on donations for over a year. The word crowdfunding hadn't been invented yet; back then, people simply called it \"begging,\" but I think it's clear that those days are long past. We look back on that period with incredible fondness, and I don't think we're the only ones. It was just two of us then, not the juggernaut that it is now; we have mouths to feed, as it were. I think we had assumed it wasn't possible to do it that way anymore - to operate a site at this scale without advertising dollars - but it occurred to us that we'd never actually asked. People often want to know how they can support the site in a way that doesn't involve t-shirts or looking at advertising, and I think we may have a way. What I'm saying is that we want to sell out, and we would love to sell out to you. \nHow Do You Intend To Do That\nBy doing this. \nLeaderboard Ad Removed, $250k Goal\nThat's for the amount you see on the right. If it turns out to be something people want to see, or not see as the case may be, we'll add stretch goals to restore old services we used to offer, convert the entire site to a Creative Commons license, and ultimately remove every ad from the site for an entire year. We intend to be a company that succeeds by making things, specifically things for you, and are orienting ourselves toward that goal. \nAll ads on homepage removed. $525k goal\nSo, we're turning to you. Would scouring ads from Penny Arcade, with everything that entails, be something you\u2019d be willing to reach into your pocket for? The more we considered it, the more we agreed it might just be. Not only would you no longer have to look at advertising when browsing Penny Arcade, but not having ads would create a chain reaction that would lead to a bunch of other interesting stuff. Without the almighty \"pageview\" to consider, why not populate the RSS with full comics and posts? Why not enable and even encourage apps, first and third party, for people to read it however they damn well please?\nThat seems pretty compelling to us, but in keeping with Kickstarter tradition we\u2019ve greased the wheels with a buffet of backer rewards and stretch goals. This is an amazing experiment in our opinion. If it doesn\u2019t work Penny Arcade will be fine. We\u2019ll keep going just like before with no interruption in service and nothing will change. But if it did work, I mean, wow.\n\nThat would be something. \nStretchgoals:\nUpdate #1: $550k Stretchgoal\nOne of the things that excited us most about the idea of trying an ad-free model was the amount of time it would give us to actually make comics. Currently, we do all kinds of creative services projects that are part of the existing model, but in their absence, that's all time we can put to work for you. We have a ton of weird settings, and ideas for more, that are simply not possible with the schedule the current system imposes. What we're talking about would be new projects, in settings you already like, that run ALONGSIDE the week's comics, not in their place. Like, oh, I don't know... THIS?!?\nWe have quite a year planned, if you're game.\nCW(TB)\n-----\nUpdate #2: $325k Stretchgoal\nAdditional Revelations! \nWe're just revealing things right and left around here. It would be our great pleasure to acquaint you with Automata: Silverside in lieu of our typical \"creative services\" work. The first of these projects unlocks at $325,000, and we're chomping at the bit. Or champing at it; I can never remember if you chomp or champ. In any case, there won't be anything left of this bit by the time we're done. We're going crazy on it!\n(CW)TB\n-----\nUpdate #4: Penny Arcade Leaderboard Stretch Goal Unlocked! Stretchgoals up to $999k revealed.\nIt's unbelievable, but the campaign has reached our first funding goal of $250k in four days. We've been blown away by the support thus far, and the interest from people outside the industry makes us think we might be on to something here.\nAs promised, we are revealing the stretch goals up to $999k ... behold! (check out the updated list up top!) The new goals we've revealed are:  \nJerry Cosplay: Jerry has agreed to Cosplay as the character of the community's choice (by vote) for one day at both PAX East 2013 and PAX Prime 2013. \nStrip Search Web Show: Discussed in a flurry of tweets, Penny Arcade: The Series Season 4 will be our version of America's Next Top Webcomic titled... STRIP SEARCH. This incredibly ambitious and expensive production will bring together over 10 up and coming webcomic hopefuls for a week of grueling challenges and horrifying social experiments, hosted by Mike and Jerry. For what? A considerable cash prize and integration into the Penny Arcade offices for one year. \nTwisp & Catsby Children's Book (free online): Mike and Jerry will create and publish online (for free) a Twisp & Catsby Children's Book. \nOriginal Tabletop Adventure: Mike and Jerry will write a completely original tabletop adventure, not tied to any particular system, to be released for free. \nFree PA Comic Reader developed for iOS and Android \nPA Blanks/Creative Common License: We will release, with each Monday, Wednesday and Friday strip, a blank version of the comic (art without word balloons) for your editing and remixing enjoyment. In addition, we will open the ENTIRE PA archive to a Creative Common License under CC BY-NC-SA. \n-----\nUpdate #5: Automata Project Unlocked, More Lookouts Info, Comic Sketch Reward and Additional Q&As!\nWe\u2019ve just crossed the $325,000 mark, meaning the Automata strip for 2013 is LOCKED IN. As a teaser, Mike created this image to give you an idea of what\u2019s in in store:\nOur next goal is to make Jerry cosplay as whatever you want him to, which for those in the office is VERY EXCITING. If that goal is met, we\u2019ll first open submissions via an online survey, and then select the top 5 choices by raw #s. From there, we\u2019ll have another online vote-off.\n\nLooking down a bit further on the stretch goal list, Jerry also wrote this piece to go along with a new sketch by Mike for the Lookouts, Daughters of Eyrewood:\n\ndaughter, daughter,\nkilled her father\nlook at what her\nblood has bought her \nNew Reward - Original Comic Pencil Sketch\nThis isn\u2019t a reward you\u2019ll find on the right side but is actually one that applies to ANYONE that contributes more than $2,500. You will receive in the mail, one of the original pencil sketches from the Penny Arcade archives (and for those donating $5k, you\u2019ll receive two, and so on). \nThese sketches are what are scanned in and digitally inked, so each online strip has ONE pencil sketch associated with it. These are the ORIGINALS. (please note, the strip you receive will be at random) Since Mike no longer does the pencil sketches ahead of time, this part in the process no longer exists making these extra rare.\nWe've also updated the FAQ with some additional questions. Please check them out below!\n-----\nUpdate #6: $350k reached, new rewards added!\nWe crossed the $350,000 mark over the weekend, so it looks like this thing has some legs. After listening to a ton of feedback, we have a few more rewards that may interest you!\n\nPrecipice Promotional 1 GB Flash Drives - $250 (30 available)\nWhen we made Precipice of Darkness, Episode 1, we had manufactured 50 USB Credit Card drives (seen here) for media kits, etc. With this reward level you\u2019ll receive this Flash Drive in the mail filled with the digital versions of Books 1 and 2 and the remastered Jerry tracks! We have two versions of the drive (Gabe and Tycho) \u2013 which you receive will be picked at random. Add $10 for International addresses.\n1 lb of Jerry\u2019s Coffee Roast - $300 (10 available)\nJerry will ship to you a one pound bag of his signature coffee beans that he roasts himself. Add $10 for International addresses.\n\nLogo Design by PA Design - $1500 (10 available)\nGive Kiko and Erika the name of your company and a synopsis of what exactly it is you do, and delivered to you will be the one-colour AI/PDF/PSD files for your further manipulation. This is the team that designed the PAX Logo, the Trenches Logo, the Child\u2019s Play logo, etc.\n\nBrew with Jerry - $2500 (4 available)\nIt\u2019s no secret Jerry loves brewing, and this reward gives you the opportunity to brew with Jerry in Seattle. You only need to handle your transportation, and Jerry will take care of the rest. Must be 21 or older.\n\nPing Pong. Your Team vs. Team Inferno - $5000 (1 available)\nInvite you and up to 9 of your friends for an officially sanctioned match against Team Inferno in Seattle, WA. The most expensive pizza you have ever purchased will be included. You just need to handle transportation.\n\nPA will crash your birthday party - $5000 (1 available)\nMike and Jerry and possibly some other people will crash your party and totally eat all of your food and drink everything in your fridge. Must be in the Seattle area.\n\nKhoo will plan your bachelor party - $7500 (1 available)\nThis is for planning and day-of execution only. Robert Khoo will take whatever your pre-determined budget is and plan a\u2026 uh\u2026 experience for you and your friends. A more detailed description to this reward would be against the code. See PA:TS S02E28 for reference.\n\nMike and Jerry DM - $8000 (1 available)\nMike and Jerry will be your DM for you and 3 of your friends, running an adventure just for you. You just need to handle transportation to Seattle.\nWe\u2019ve also been getting some really interesting ideas for stretchgoals from readers \u2013 if you want to suggest some before we announce our next set of them, send an email to ks@penny-arcade.com. Thanks!\n-----\nUpdate #8: The Final Cosplay Vote + More details on Strip Search\n(Note: Skipped #7 since it was just the initial cosplay vote)\nWe've crossed the $375k mark, meaning Jerry is on the hook for cosplaying as the character of your choice. We did open submissions in Update #7, and after over 15,000 suggestions, here are the top 5 to vote on:\n\n1. Bayonetta\n2. Sailor Moon\n3. The Fruit Fucker\n4. Tycho\n5. Yummy Chan\n\nHonorable mentions go to Strawberry Shortcake and Lollipop Chainsaw. ;)\n\nAlright, vote here!\n\nGabe also just posted an update on Penny Arcade about Strip Search, but you can read it here as well:\n\nI admit to being a huge fan of reality tv style game shows. I love shows like So You Think You Can Dance, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, and Master Chef. I even watch shows like Ink Master and Shear Genius. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s singers, chefs, fashion designers or gardeners. I love watching groups of people pushed together to compete at something they are good at. I don\u2019t know a thing about cooking or dancing but I can\u2019t get enough of these game shows. I\u2019m always amazed when the challenge is something like \u201cmake a fruit tart\u201d and one guy says \u201cshit I\u2019ve never made a fruit tart before\u201d and then he proceeds to make a fucking fruit tart. I could never do that and maybe that\u2019s why I love watching it so much. Could you pull a theme out of a hat and then write and draw a comic strip about it? Probably not, but I\u2019m guessing you might like to watch people who can.\n\nThat\u2019s the idea for our new show Strip Search. It is the next goal in our Kickstarter and It is a reality game show for web cartoonists. Like any of these other shows I mentioned it is about watching incredibly talented people face off in a competition with a reward that could change their life.\nIn the case of Strip Search we are talking about ten people. Each one of them a talented cartoonist. They will all live together in a house here in Seattle. They will compete in a series of challenges that will test their skills and we will slowly whittle them down until we are left with one winner. This cartoonist will win a cash prize along with integration into the Penny Arcade machine. That means a studio in our office but it also means access to our business people, our merchandising operation, our designers, and our ping pong table. The winner will get plugged into the Penny Arcade family for one year. We will not own any of their work, and there will be no evil contract to sign. We will just be there to support them and help grow their comic in a way that very few other organizations could.\n\nTycho and I will be the hosts and participate in the judging but we won\u2019t be alone. We are very lucky to have friends in every corner of the industry from syndicated newspaper comics to book publishers, and web comic pioneers. We\u2019ll be bringing these folks in as guest judges and mentors throughout the competition. You\u2019ll also see everyone here in the office working with these contestants. It\u2019s a huge undertaking for us but incredibly exciting I think.\nThere is something magical about watching a comic strip come together. I think Strip Search is a show that could appeal to a much bigger audience than anything we\u2019ve done before on PATV. So if you could help us get the word out I\u2019d appreciate it. Tell your friends who like reality TV and tell them to tell their friends. I\u2019d love to see Strip Search get funded and if it does we are very close to the goal of all ads removed from the home page and our Daughters of the Eyrewood Lookouts comic.\n------\nUpdate #9: More Lookouts Art, a New Reward, FAQ Update, Jerry Cosplay\nWith 15 days left, we've raised almost $400,000, which is nearly a half-a-million dollars, which is basically a million! Right? Or...? Listen. We don't have time to thrill you with our incredible mathematics right now. It's time to reveal the terrifying revelations of Kickstarter Update 9!\n\nMore Lookouts!\n\nGabe drew more concept art for Daughters of the Eyrewood to further entice you:\nI know this level seems out there, but we still have 15 days! We are also adding another reward level at $50 for a hi-resolution, 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d print of the above Lookouts image sent to your door. Please add $5 for international addresses. (this level also includes all previous rewards!)\n\nJerry Cosplay Poll Results!\nI'll be honest, I'm actually a little shocked at the result. The winner is... the Fruit Fucker?

Through all the trials and tribulations, they forged on and created Ringtail Cafe Productions, an independent small press publishing company that specialises in comics and magazines.\nThe comic itself has a mix of action, drama and comedy.  The book follows the exploits of various members of a secret organization that operates out of a coffee shop.  They attempt to foil the League of Villainous Evil - a collection of largely minor villains held together by a steady declining dental plan.  Things have started to change though and there's various new players coming into this secret power struggle.\nA big part of the Ringtail Cafe comic comes from the characters and their personal viewpoints and adventures, from the former catburgler turned leader to the put-upon music student stuck running the storefront, everyone has a distinct personality.  We love the whole ensemble cast, but like many folks, we all have our personal favourites and we hope you will too.\nIn issue six: When Adam and Jaime (who invites himself along) take the rescued orphans on an outing to a baseball game, they run afoul of some NEXT Goons.  This issue marks the first appearance of Candystripe and the HERO Taskforce.\nThis issue features art by Cindy Ramey (Starfire Agency, Nightshift) and writing by Darren Mueller (The Confectionaries) and Elizabeth Stein.  As of right now, we have the overall story written and are ready to begin work on the actual pages.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nRingtail Cafe #6 is the first new issue of the book to be produced in two years.  As the studio grows, the focus is ever more on mainstream comics and distribution. A fully anthropomorphic book such as Ringtail Cafe has always been an uphill battle to justify the time, effort and expense of printing in large quantities for widespread distribution. This Kickstarter is not just about making an issue happen, it is about helping anthropomorphic comics become more mainstream staples in comic shops and book stores.  \nWe've chosen Kickstarter for funding because it's very safe and accessible for everyone, making is possible for a variety of people to contribute.  It's very secure because if the project doesn't meet its goal, no money changes hands.  \nBy donating, you're not only contributing to the creation of a new issue of Ringtail Cafe, you're also supporting the production of anthropomorphic comics in general.  We'd love to spend even more time on the strange exploits of these fun and furry characters and we can... with your help.\nREWARDS\nWe really loved getting to work with the baseball theme in this issue, so when we went to do the rewards, we really wanted to bring along some of that fun to you folks.  To that end we have a lot of unique baseball themed rewards, including custom baseball cards, personalized RTC baseball jerseys and even appearances in the upcoming issue of the comic.  In addition to the things we've listed, if we pass the $2,500 mark, we\u2019ll be throwing in some additional items we wanted to include but couldn't justify at $2000.   Be sure to keep an eye on our updates and we\u2019ll keep everyone informed of how things are going.\nHere's a list of the different rewards we're offering:\nA Digital Copy of Issue 6 \u2013 This is a pdf (or other format digital comic book) that will be released early exclusively for project backers.  This is your chance to read the book before it's available to the rest of the world.\nSet of RTC Buttons \u2013 4 limited edition baseball themed buttons made just for the release of this book (Jaime, Adam, Candystripe and Ian).  We don't do official RTC buttons very often and this marks the first time Candystripe and Ian have been available.\nLimited Edition Print \u2013 This is a pin-up picture of Jaime Grey from Ringtail Cafe posing... well... like Jaime.  This print is signed and numbered and will only be available in extremely limited quantities after this Kickstarter event.\nLarge Baseball Team Print \u2013 You'll get an 11\u00d717 print of the entire Ringtail Cafe crew in their baseball uniforms.

You'll receive both a physical 11\u00d717 print and a 300dpi digital version of the picture.\nCustom Baseball Card \u2013 Want something you can't get anywhere else?

Find out more information on our latest stretch goals at Update #12.\n-Update ~ $6000 stretch goal: send CREATURES to ORIGINS!-\nThank you all so much for putting us over our goal in less than 72 hours!  Now we want to take CREATURES to the next level, all the way to the Origins Game Fair!  This is the biggest annual board/card game trade show in the US, held in Columbus, Ohio in the Spring, and we want CREATURES to take it and the gaming industry by storm.  We are asking for funds to cover the cost of a booth (~$900), booth design, airfare, hotels, lots of extra decks to sell, etc.  so we have set a stretch goal of $6000 to help fund this grand adventure.\nIf/when we hit the $6000 goal, there will be an extra special bonus reward added to EVERY backer level $5 and above-- a special, limited edition animal to be added to your deck available only to kickstarter backers!  The mystery cards will be revealed on the backer's blog upon reaching the goal.  Keep up the great work!\n-ABOUT THE GAME-\nCREATURES is a creative, strategic card game that blends friendly competition with a good laugh!  It is intended for 2 to 6 players, ages 8 and up.  The game is comprised of 96 playing cards consisting of either a \u2018FRONT\u2019, \u2018MIDDLE\u2019, or \u2018BACK\u2019 portion of 32 particular animals.  Each animal is illustrated across the three cards, and includes a fun fact about that animal and a corresponding \u2018strength\u2019 value ranging from 1-10 (e.g. a mosquito is strength-1, and a grizzly bear is strength-10). \nGameplay occurs as players mix and match \u2018FRONT\u2019, \u2018MIDDLE\u2019, and \u2018BACK\u2019 cards in their hand to create entirely new creatures, and stage attacks against the creatures in other players\u2019 hands.  For example, the \u2018FRONT\u2019 of Octopus (4), the \u2018MIDDLE\u2019 of Hippopotamus (7), and the \u2018BACK\u2019 of Armadillo (1) combine to create OC-POTA-DILLO (12)! \nThe illustrated portions of each card align to create an image of the new creature with a zany new fun fact.  A creature which conquers all other players in a single turn becomes a \u2018Champion\u2019.  Can you be the first to achieve 5 \u2018Champions\u2019?  May the strongest creature win! \n-WHY CREATURES IS AWESOME-\nCREATURES is not a veiled re-boot of existing face card games such as poker or bridge, but a refreshingly new and creative game unlike anything else.  It is a harmonious blend of the simplicity of traditional card games such as Uno or Skip-Bo with the strategy and creativity of more complex card games such as Canasta or Phase 10. \nThe game is fun for many levels, easy to learn, and difficult to master. \nWhen is the right time to attack?  Which creature should defend an oncoming attack?  What if someone holds a *POISON* creature!?  The quirky artwork and jumbled-up animal facts keep players of all ages engaged and amused.  With almost 22,000 possible CREATURE combinations, the gameplay is always fresh with every hand delt!\n-WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES-\nThe pledges YOU make will cover the costs associated with designing and printing the first edition card decks professionally, including tuck boxes, shrink wrap, etc. as well as registering the CREATURES trademark and copyrights.  Did you know it costs $40/month to list a new item on Amazon.com?  This is where your money goes!  We will also be printing CREATURES T-shirts and refrigerator magnets so you can show off your undying support of the game to friends and family.  Any amount we raise in excess of our stated goal will go toward trade show exhibitions, marketing material, additional deck printing, etc. so please continue to support!\n-MORE INFORMATION-\nPlease visit the official CREATURES website at www.CreaturesCardGame.com for more information, images, rules, etc.\nHit us up on Twitter @CreaturesGames!\nThank you for pledging and helping make CREATURES become a reality!

I\u2019ve been around comics most of my life and have been most things you can be in comics: reader, collector, retailer, and creator.\nOver the years, I\u2019ve accumulated my share of characters and stories and set them in my own personal playground called Sparta Bay, an East Coast city that is home and habitat to a great number of the world\u2019s AMPS (amplified beings) whether they are super, scientific or mythical.\nSo, I decided it was time to shoot for having something definite going on with this Sparta Bay imprint. I\u2019ve already had some talented artists consent to help me play with the idea of doing a sketchbook which will be out in time Wizard World Chicago in August, 2011.\nContributing to the sketchbook are artists like Gary Barker, Neil Vokes, Steven Howard, Chris Noeth, Rudy Garcia, Fred Lang and others. And some will be inked by me.\nAnd I'll be including an original Ursula short story, written by me, of course.\nThe Ursula Sketchbook is the first effort in all this. Starting as a collaboration with Gary Barker, Ursula is the story of a young heroine trying to live up her family legacy as a Valkyrie-type and at the same time, live some kind of normal life. She has a natural aversion to the undead of all types, which are anathema to her. It\u2019s unnatural to be dead but still walking around. Of course, this constantly puts her in situations where she must deal with those undead-of-all-types. Living in Sparta Bay will do that to you.\nThe fundraising goal will go toward printing the sketchbook and getting it out. Anything above and beyond that will set the stage for the first mini-series, the first of several if I have anything to say about it.\nAnd I do.\nThank you for giving this a look. A Bigger Thanks if you decide to help out.\nAh, heck, thanks in any case.\nContributors (so far, there are still a couple in the works!):\nGary Allen Barker\nNeil D.

It was first seen in the pages of Skin Deep, with a Jub Jub Bird and a Bandersnatch playing the card game. At the time I just threw some words from Jabberwocky into the dialog to make it seem like a weird, fun game. Many readers expressed interest in actually playing Borogove, so I sat down and started to create a game. Now I want to print it so everyone can play and enjoy!\nHow Much Will This Cost, and Where Will The Money Go?\nI'm asking for $5,500 dollars. The majority of that will go into printing 500 decks of cards, which according to the quote I got from my printer, will cost approximately 2,000 dollars, sans shipping. The rest will go towards various incidental costs such as packing and shipping the cards out to backers and funding the completion of the rest of the cards!\nHow close is the game to completion?\nI currently have the box design, all four cards of the Hare Suit, all four cards of the Jabberwock suit, the card back, and the rules card completely finished. Part of the proceeds of the Kickstarter will go into the production of the rest of the cards, which would be the eleven other suits in the game.\nIs it just a regular deck of cards?\nNope! This is a new game! Like a regular deck of playing cards, there are 52 cards, but instead of 4 suits of 13 cards each, the Borogove deck is comprised of 13 suits of 4 cards each. You can take a look at the rules right here to see how the game differs from a usual card game!\nCredits\nSf\u00e9 Monster, in addition to editing my chicken scratch so my words are readable and I don't sound like a raving lunatic, designed Borogove's Jub-Jub Birds and Momewraths. Also Sf\u00e9 is an all round rad friend!\nA big thanks to Ashton, AKA Lord Lethonai, for playtesting Borogove and making sure it's playable.\nThe lovely readers of Skin Deep for pushing me to make a card game!\nAnd of course, my husband Ben, for encouraging me to pursue my dreams (yes that is corny but it's true!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #89", "update_userinfo": "University of Nottingham Crowdfunding Survey!", "update_content": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/963152868/skin-deep-vol-3-greetings-from-dogpatch\nI have a NEW KICKSTARTER to fund my third graphic novel, Greetings, From Dogpatch!

We're Dave Kellett & Fred Schroeder, creators of the comics documentary STRIPPED.  This film is our love-letter to the art form: Bringing together 60 of the world's best cartoonists into one extraordinary, feature-length documentary.  The film sits down with creators to talk about how cartooning works, why it's so loved, and how as artists they're navigating this dicey period between print and digital options...when neither path works perfectly. \nSet to an *original* score by Stefan Lessard of \"Dave Matthews Band,\" this should be a really special film. It's been a two-year labor-of-love for us, and we can not wait for you to see it.  But the post-production phase is the super expensive phase...and we need your help to finish it.\nWe have a lot of incredibly talented Hollywood professionals who believe in the film, and as a result are discounting their rates to help us complete it, but it's still an expensive process. With your financial support, we'll be able to complete the editing, special effects, sound mixing, and color timing -- and bring a really special film to life.  \n***STILL ACCEPTING PLEDGES***\nThanks to your continuing support, we've met the minimum level for the Kickstarter drive to fund.  But we're still accepting pledges, to tackle the additional budget items, below.  So, why donate now? Self-interest, for one thing! The DVD price won't change, but by \"purchasing\" the DVD at the $25-level, now rather than later, it will help us make a better film, with features including....\nCLOSED CAPTIONING: We want this film to be accessible to everyone! Help us add a closed-captioning option to the DVD.  Additional Budget: $2,500\nANIMATIONS: We want to hire independent animators to create snippets and shorts to illustrate points of the film. We had already budgeted for a set amount of AfterEffects, but an increased animation budget will give more work to worthy artists, *and* make the film really shine. Additional Budget: $30,000\nHIGH-FIDELITY SOUND MASTERING: Good films live and die by their sound quality.  Listen to an indie film, and you'll see what we mean: They often sound terrible. With just a little extra, we can bring this film into Dolby. Additional Budget: $10,000\nTRAVEL: We've lined up additional interviews with folks like Jeannie Schulz, Mike & Jerry of Penny Arcade, and more. But we'd also still love to sit down with Lalo Alcaraz, Keith Knight, Matt Groening, Garry Trudeau, Randall Munroe, Art Speigelman, and others.  Additional funding will help make those trips possible for our crew and equipment.

Realizing their own personal connection to the victims, detectives Jason Hawking and Willow Barnes of the NYPD Special Crimes Squad take the case.\nAs the detectives get deeper into their investigation, they discover that not only might their suspects be part of the Russian Mob, but that The Raptor may have a private stake in the case as well.\n_______\n\nBLAIR SHEDD has illustrated everything from children's books and logos, to novel covers and sketch cards.

We're Vantage Point Productions, the crew behind Season 2 of Penny Arcade: The Series.\nAfter the huge fan response to the PA:TS episode featuring Scott Kurtz and Kris Straub (\"The Takeover\"), we thought it unfair to the universe not to create a web series featuring the comedic stylings of this dynamic duo. We approached Scott and Kris and we all agreed that this should happen.  However, after emptying our pockets on the table we realized that it would be difficult to produce the show on a handful of lint-covered Runts, two nickels, and a rupee (?).  So, in need of capital to make this show a reality, we humbly come to you.\nWhat, you ask, would a Scott and Kris show entail? We're looking to produce a ten-episode series (like the pilot episode above) in addition to a three-disc DVD featuring outtakes and behind-the-scenes material. When we reach our goal, the show will air on PATV starting Summer 2011.\nThe budget from Kickstarter will go solely towards the cost of production: cameras, microphones, editing, travel, soundtrack music, audio mixing, DVD authoring and duplication, Kickstarter and Amazon fees, and so on.\nBy backing this project, not only will you be helping us produce the show, you'll have access to unique and exclusive rewards including signed copies of the DVD, your name in the show credits, original art and books from Scott and Kris, extra footage of the production and much more.\nWe're excited about this project because we get to work with Scott and Kris. You might be excited about this project because you get to see Scott and Kris. Most importantly, Kris is excited about this project because he believes it's one step closer to reuniting with his estranged father. Scott's just always \"excited.\"\nSo let's make it happen.\nHelp spread the word: http://www.tinyurl.com/scottkristv\nThank you so much for your support!\n- Vantage Point Productions", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Final Rewards", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 174, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vantagepoint/kris-and-scotts-scott-and-kris-show", "project_name": "Kris and Scott's Scott and Kris Show"}}]
