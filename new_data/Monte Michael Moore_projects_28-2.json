However, with La Muerta #1: Onslaught, all our additional rewards and stretch goals are standing by to print and all the creative work is complete! \n\nOur printing partners are secured (and they are fine with our edgy content), our budgets are complete, our shipping supplies are ready to order and our manpower is lined up. We just gotta print, receive, prepare, assemble, pack and ship. \n\nWe\u2019ve completed most of our other Kickstarter campaigns (and began shipping on all but two within 8 weeks of our campaign end date) and learned a bunch each time. And regarding rewards fulfillment, I\u2019ve owned mail order companies for over thirty (!) years. My team and I have extensive publishing and manufacturing backgrounds and ship on time (or reasonably on time). We prep and ship in a clean environment. We will make sure all your rewards are delivered as promised, packed securely. \n\nIf you\u2019ve backed us in the past you know this to be true. We take every phase of our campaign, including shipping, quite seriously (while having fun and listening to music doing it). \n\nYou can count on this: whether we have hiccups or not, we will be in communication with you during the entire process and update you in a timely manner. \n\nWe want to assure you that beyond making the coolest products possible, the printing, assembling, packing and shipping of these items in a top-notch manner is equally important to us. \n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019d like to thank all the readers, backers and collectors who have supported our last twenty three (!) Kickstarters. \n\nYour response to our work has been AMAZING! \n\nWe simply cannot thank you enough! \n\nBecause of you, COFFIN COMICS LIVES!!!! \n\nSWORN!!!!!!!!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 6 or more", "title": "1.

The first of a proposed comprehensive trilogy ('SILVER' and 'BRONZE') of art books, featuring a huge selection of work from over thirty five years in the comics industry by artist and writer Liam Sharp. Backers will also receive an all-new creator-owned 25 page comic, 'The Chronicles of Lib LaRoche', written and lavishly illustrated by Liam, completely free! And on top of that they'll receive an exclusive collectable card from a planned Tarot deck used in the Lib LaRoche universe.\n\nENCORE: GOLD features an incredible introduction by legendary writer Grant Morrison, a creator profile by renowned journalist and interviewer Geoff Boucher, and is a showcase of some of Liam's all-time favorite pieces.\nENCORE: GOLD - THE ART OF LIAM SHARP\nENCORE: The Art of Liam Sharp hardback cover mock-up\nBIOG\nLiam recently wrapped his ground-breaking and acclaimed epic 24 issue run on DC's The Green Lantern with Grant Morrison, and is currently working on Batman: Reptilian with superstar writer Garth Ennis. But before that, and before his award-winning six issue limited series 'The Brave and The Bold: Batman and Wonder Woman' (which he also wrote) and before the wildly successful 'Wonder Woman: Rebirth' with fan-favorite writer Greg Rucka, Liam had a long and distinguished career as an artist and also a writer of both comics and prose fiction. He has also been a well-regarded boutique publisher, co-founding both the Mam Tor imprint and the ground-breaking digital company Madefire. \nLiam has worked for Marvel, DC,Vertigo, Wildstorm, Image, Darkhorse, Fleetway and Dynamite, producing a huge range of eclectic work in every imaginable genre. Encore - The Art of Liam Sharp  is intended to celebrate this long, creatively restless and innovative career, and will be a must-have book for collectors, fans and new-comers alike. As Grant Morrison writes in his introduction -\n\n'Knowing the standards (Liam) sets for himself, witnessing first-hand the constant striving for new goals, new achievements, I\u2019d hazard a guess he has barely begun the latest phase of his artistic journey, is only now stretching his peacock wings as we his audience are invited to sit back and applaud the dazzling display\u2026'\nENCORE: The Art of Liam Sharp book with dust jacket mock-up\nABOUT THE BOOK\nAvailable with or without the Conan dust jacket, ENCORE 'GOLD' showcases work from across Liam's extensive career, presenting much of the hyper-detailed art in it's black and white unlettered form for the first time in print - from the spectacular high fantasy of THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD: BATMAN AND WONDER WOMAN, to the incredibly intricate sci-fi realms of THE GREEN LANTERN. \nWithin these pages you will also find many examples of Liam's full-color work - both traditional and digital - which pays homage to the masters of the past whilst also pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in the industry.\nThe cover to Liam's 'THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD: BATMAN AND WONDER WOMAN' series. Colors here by Romulo Fajardo JR.\nCatwoman Cover\n'MOULDERING STONES' featuring Red Sonja. A personal piece that ended up being a cover for Dynamite Comics.\nJudges Dredd, Death and Anderson from a poster produced for a feature on the artist in the Megazine.\nPromotional art for Liam's Manthing series with writer J.M.DeMatteis for Marvel - a favourite series for both creators\nEASTER EGGS!\nThe book also promises to contain a host of un-lockable Easter Eggs, linking to (amongst other things) a film shot by Liam's son, Lorcan, where he talks about his career, techniques and life-lessons. \n There will also be a unique opportunity to receive one of Liam's huge (18\" x 24\") original black and white pages (see below) from his iconic Green Lantern run with Grant Morrison for the first person to break a hidden code within the pages! \nSeason 1, page 10, issue 10 of THE GREEN LANTERN - unlock the code hidden in the pages of ENCORE 'GOLD' to win this page!\nABOUT THE COMIC\nAs the first stretch goal was unlocked, along with the book backers will now receive a free 25 page comic, featuring all-new material, and telling the origin of Liam's character Lib LaRoche - a gothic female Conan in a new-weird world of sci-fi and fantasy elements (previewed below!) \nLib LaRoche: Jubileumboek preview art\nPage from Lib LaRoche - placeholder lettering only\nLib LaRoche sample page - placeholder lettering only\nOFFERS\nENCORE 'GOLD' comes with multiple options:\nPDF only\nWithout dust jacket\nWith Conan dust jacket\nDust jacket and signature only\nDust jacket, signature and remark\nDust jacket, signature and exclusive bookplate \nDust jacket, signature with remark and exclusive bookplate\nDust jacket, signature, exclusive bookplate, original head sketch (3 options) \nDust jacket, signature, exclusive bookplate, original torso sketch (3 options) \n50% off for retail orders of 10X basic hardback and dust jacket edition\nExamples of previous torso sketches by the artist.\nFUTURE VOLUMES \nENCORE 'GOLD' 'SILVER' & 'BRONZE' box set mock-up\nENCORE 'SILVER\", the second volume, will be a celebration of the intricacy of pure black and white comic art.\nENCORE 'BRONZE\", the final volume, will feature a complete retrospective of Liam's career, from assisting the great Don Lawrence, through 2000ad, Marvel, Image, DC, and beyond. Over a series of interviews Liam talks to writer and teacher Dave Gillette about the trials and tribulations, good times and bad, and about the masters of the past that inspired him, and the artistic heroes that eventually became his friends. For comic historians it promises to be a goldmine, for aspiring artists there'll be a chance to hear first hand what it is like having a long career in comics and the visual arts.\n'SILVER' & 'BRONZE' are slated for publication late 2021 and 2022 respectively. \nThe slip case will be available for purchase with the third and final volume.\n\nBOOK SPECIFICATIONS\nENCORE - THE ART OF LIAM SHARP 'GOLD\"\nHardback with optional dust jacket\n144 pages\n7.5\" x 11\"\nFIRST STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nNow everybody who buys ENCORE:GOLD also gets the first ever 25 page Lib LaRoche comic free with the book, and what's more it will be signed by artist/author Liam Sharp!\nLib LaRoche comic #0 cover mock-up - not final art.\nSECOND STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nNow included with the book and comic will be one of a set of six cards, of increasing rarity! Five of them will be picture cards from the world of Lib LaRoche. The sixth will be a simple gold design with a QR code on it that will gift the owner something completely unique! \nOnly FIVE of the GOLDEN CARDS will be sent randomly into the world with the books, for you to discover!\nMock-up of the Lib LaRoche card set\nA brand new set will also be available with both ENCORE:SILVER and ENCORE:BRONZE.\nHuge thanks, as always, from Liam and all of us in Team Sharpy! \nTS\nFINAL STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nAfter asking around we decided on the final stretch goal, and it's going to be a great one for everybody who has backed this campaign. \nUltimately the free comic is fun, and the cards will be collectable and beautiful (more on that shortly!) but those things often get lost over time, and what's left is the book.\nSo with that in mind -\nTHE BOOK\nHaving hit $110K the book will have a page-holder ribbon, an embossed cover, and the dust jacket will have an added metallic ink. It already has heavy, high-end paper of the finest quality, and will be stitched and not glued. It will truly be a beautiful product!\nTHANK YOU ALL so much for the incredible support!!!\n\nBut also-\n\nUPDATE ON THE CARDS\nWhat I didn't say before, and what you are now just learning, is that Lib LaRoche uses cards as part of her character trait - no spoilers! There will only be two hundred copies only of each of the first five cards that will have a gold surround. So everybody who buys this book will automatically get one rare collectable card that will never be reproduced with the gold border again! ENCORE:SILVER will do five more new cards in silver, and ENCORE:BRONZE another five in (you guessed it!) bronze.\nAfter that we are planning to create a deck of cards, the tarot set of Lib's realm, that can be used as regular tarot cards, or traded. These will feature the same cards that come with the three books, but without the gold, silver and bronze surround.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs most of the art already exists and the majority of the book has already been compiled, there is very little that could delay the production of the book(s), baring production issues, and the unforeseeable happening to Liam that might prevent him completing the all-new content promised. \nAt the very least there are already five original unpublished pages, and the book can be filled out with other material from his career in the event of an accident or illness.

Each comic book will feature different artists, to ensure not only a high quality, but also creating a platform for  outstanding artists.\n\nThe story begins with Leona and Karmen arriving in Egypt in modern times. They are tricked by the Flow of Time and landed inside a pyramid. As they walk inside, they awaken ancient forces that attack them. Leona comes into conflict with the forces that attack her, while Karmen turns into an owl and seeks shelter somewhere in the pyramid. Leona ends up being captured and the villain reveals herself as an ancient Egyptian queen who felt the sands of time carried by Leona and knows that she could use them to restore her physical form and exercise her revenge against her enemies, the Sisterhood of Mummies.\n\nIf you wanna know more about the MIDNIGHT WITCH (even though you can read this crossover as standalone oneshot, as intended) then go to the Kickstarter HERE which launched simultanously. \"But I do not wanna pay double shipping?\" well, we got you covered here in this lovely video-update!\nISSUE ONE: the origin issue in which we saw the rising of the Sisterhood,  the  introduction of the Khepri god/computer and during a new adventure  Sisterhoods leader Rand is shown to share his mind with Dymonos!\nISSUE TWO:  High-priest Dymonos makes a heart-wrenching  discovery that not only lets him question his loyalty towards his master, the mighty god  Khepri, but also sets him on a path of righteous revenge and  destruction.\nISSUE THREE: Love & Betrayal in a solo-issues as Gwynn takes center stage and combats Nazi Werewolves in a fight till the death - all in ONE intense issue.\nYou can order all of these as an Add-On.

As his contact list grew,  so did his interest in the complete field of comics. Starting up a Bad Grrl Comics Fan club in 2001 was the first step to go further then his own living  room. Soon thereafter he began setting up websites for Arthur Suydam, Eric Basaldua, Broadsword Comics, and focusing on titles like Vampirella,  Cavewoman, Hack/Slash and more... He even  started working with the FACTS comicon organization where he also met  the founder of Broken Frontier and shortly thereafter began doing headlines for this news site. Later he founded the website COMICSFORSINNERS which more resembles his prior BadGrrl fanclub. Nowadays Richard dabbles in Art Agency, sending out comic Press Releases and since 2019 publishing various comic books.\n\nYonami - Paulo Teles (AKA Yonami; Creator) is a Graphic Designer by  graduation and comic book artist for passion, works as manager for House 137 Studio and  along with his team has provided stories for publishers such as Stone Arch Books, Glyph Productions, Galaxy Graphix, Dynamite, Zenescope, Marvel and DC through the years. Today, the House 137 Studio got a partnership with the accessibility company All Geek and  created the All Geek Comics brand for publishing their books in Brazil.\n\nRodrigo \"Rod\" Monteiro (Writer) is a Brazilian writer who has been working in the comic business for the past nine years, being part of the Brazilian House 137 Studio since its foundation in 2015. Among his published material is \"The Midnight Witch\", \"The Fairy Tales Unit\" and \"Undead  Nightmare\". All of them are currently available (in English) at the  Webtoons website.\n\nCezar Razek (artist) is a Brazilian artist who has been working in the comic business for many years, with Battlestar Galactica over at Dynamite and also the inter-company crossover between TopCow and DE with Witchblade/Red Sonja. He has also worked on Stargate, Vampirella, Doc Savage, Dejah Thoris, Zorro, and many more!\n\nWalmir Archanjo (cover artist) is a modest guy and a very committed professional with many published works such as the kid's book, the Whispering Peppers.\n\nBrad Chavarria (Guest Artist + cover artist) fell in love with comics at about age 4.  \"I was able to get a few sketch card gigs of Red Sonja,  Witchblade, Vampirella and Warlord of Mars, that gave me my first \"pro\"  work. It helped establish me and it gave me a sense of belonging in this  wonderful art community.\nNow, I was offered this WONDERFUL opportunity by Richard Boom, who was  one of my \"original\" Crusade forum friends from about 2 decades ago, to  produce a cover for this Kickstarter event, of which I will be forever grateful.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nActually I have FIVE books all done like this...

We just gotta print, receive, prepare, assemble, pack and ship. \n\nWe\u2019ve completed most of our other Kickstarter campaigns (and began shipping on all but two within 8 weeks of our campaign end date) and learned a bunch each time. Regarding rewards fulfillment, I\u2019ve owned mail order companies for over thirty (!) years. My team and I have extensive publishing and manufacturing backgrounds and ship on time (or reasonably on time). We prep and ship in a clean environment. We will make sure all your rewards are delivered as promised and packed securely. \n\nIf you\u2019ve backed us in the past you know this to be true. We take every phase of our campaign, including shipping, quite seriously (while having fun and listening to music doing it). \n\nYou can count on this: whether we have hiccups or not, we will be in communication with you during the entire process and update you in a timely manner. \n\nWe want to assure you that beyond making the coolest products possible, the printing, assembling, packing and shipping of these items in a top-notch manner is equally important to us. \n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019d like to thank all the readers, backers and collectors who have supported our last twenty two (!)

The idea here was to ensure that most backers would receive their packages within a few days of each other. While this strategy has worked well for us in the past, Coffin Comics HQ has limited warehouse space and it has become increasingly challenging for our team to fulfill campaigns in this manner, as our operation has grown significantly over the last couple of years.

And regarding rewards fulfillment, I\u2019ve owned mail order companies for over twenty-nine years. \n\nMy team and I have extensive publishing and manufacturing backgrounds and ship on time (or reasonably on time). We prep and ship in an ultra-clean environment. We will make sure all your rewards are delivered as promised, packed securely. If you\u2019ve backed us in the past you know this to be true. \n\nWe take every phase of our campaign, including shipping, quite seriously (while having fun and listening to music doing it). \n\nYou can count on this: whether we have hiccups or not, we will be in communication with you during the entire process and update you in a timely manner. \n\nWe want to assure you that beyond making the coolest products possible, the printing, quality checking, assembling, packing and shipping of these items in a top-notch manner is equally important to us. \n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019d like to thank all the readers, backers and collectors who have supported our last twenty (!) Kickstarters. Your response has been AMAZING! \n\nWe simply cannot thank you enough! \n\nBecause of you, COFFIN COMICS LIVES!!!! \nSWORN!!!!!!!!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 6 or more", "title": "1) Treacherous Infamy Digital Copy", "descp": "Read the all-new original graphic novel, Lady Death: Treacherous Infamy on any computer or mobile device!\nDelivered as a DRM-free PDF.\nNOTE: This reward tier does not include unlocked free bonus items.\nINCLUDES:\nLady Death: Treacherous Infamy - Digital Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["127 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "2) Coffin Comics Series VII T-Shirt", "descp": "Red and white discharge printing on black! 100% cotton.

So I'd like to \"level up\" some rewards and stretch-goals as we progress! Fun isn't it? Hey! That means YOU, the awesome backer, gets more freebies!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHello! My name is Anna Zhuo. I'm a self-taught artist that works with both traditional and digital mediums!  My work is heavily inspired by anime/manga. I work with ink, watercolor, copic markers, and digital on my PC and iPad Pro. I am a published artist, best known for doing cover work for many retailers. Some covers I have done are for popular titles such as Vampirella, Lady Death, Unnatural, The Magic Order, Mercy, Fathom, and Hit-Girl.\nIMPORTANT: If you are new to Kickstarter, please be aware that there will be a backer survey that is sent out at the end of a successful campaign. This is when your order will be finalized with all your add-ons. Filling out this survey is crucial so I can make sure you are getting 100% what you are paying for!\nSKETCH4RT is a line of art books I am starting that features black/white sketches, process sketches,  anatomy studies, unused or rejected covers, ink drawings, and much more! This specific book features works from 2010-2019. It'll start with my most recent works to oldest, a trip down memory lane! The purpose of organizing it this way is to show that what we all started somewhere. It is through many years of hard work, practice, and dedication to get to where we are today.  Remember, practice makes progress. There are 3 different options for this book: Standard, Hardcover, and Collector's Edition.\nStandard/Hardcover has the same art and 80 pages, while Collector's has alternate cover art and extra 20 pages (100 pages in total)! Hardcover is now limited print-to-order and will be numbered! It means the amount printed will equal the amount ordered here!\nPersonally, I've always been fascinated to look through doodles and sketches by other artists. I enjoyed seeing the progression of a piece of art, figure out what the artist might be thinking, how they see things, and etc. On top of that, I liked seeing how an artist has progressed over the years.\nCollector's Edition has an alternate cover art and features an additional 20-pages that includes my most recent work, published covers and it's process. To make it even more of a collector's item, it is limited to 100 copies world wide, signed and personally hand-numbered!\nThis is also PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES! The cost of production is higher than overseas, but I'd like to support small companies of my own country. This also ensures faster turn-around time, higher-quality product, and best customer service.\nPlease read over each reward tier to see which one you'd like to pledge. Most items are also available as add-ons or combined with existing pledges. Some are also limited options. Once you make a pledge, you can change it/adjust. When the campaign ends and you are charged, you will not longer be able to change it.\nFREE GOODIES! ! ALL PHYSICAL BACKERS WILL RECEIVE ALL UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS! Once fully funded, additional pledge amounts will unlock new incentive goodies that will be included in your pledge rewards, for FREE! More will be added along the way when new goals are met!\nSOME STRETCH GOALS HAS LEVEL-ED UP ! Meaning you'll get extra rewards! Three golden tickets will also be randomly inserted to 3 different backers boxes for a chance to win more goodies!\nUPDATE: IF AN ITEM IS SOLD OUT, it can no longer be added as an overpledge!\nWant to add more items to your selected tier? No problem! In order to add-on an item or combine another item from another tier to your existing pledge, you will have to do an 'overpledge'! (Only certain rewards are allowed as add-ons!)\nPlease make your initial pledge.\nAfterwards, go to \"MANAGE MY PLEDGE\" button located up top.\nAdd the additional $$ amount of the other rewards you'd like.\nAfterwards, please message me your request through Kickstarter.\nEXAMPLE:\nYou pledged $20 Standard edition tier, but would also like to add the hardcover edition ($40). Go to \"manage my pledge\" and add additional $40 to your total. You pledge amount should now be $60.\nWhen you message me, I will make a note to your pledge. You don't have to do anything else until the campaign ends! If you do end up changing your decision, please let me know.\nAll rewards will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail due to the size and weight of the books. From experience, this is the most safe, quick, and inexpensive way for both domestic and international packages. Shipping will take 1-3 days for US, and 6-10 days for international. Insurance will be added equal to the amount that you have pledged.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith every project, comes risks and challenges, especially uncertainties that may come due to COVID-19. There could be delays, limitations on outing and incoming shipments. That is why I have selected a printer I have worked with before, based in the United States.

Nope, not here!\n\nThis book is 100% COMPLETED and proofed. It is 100% READY TO PRINT with all your help on a successful campaign! Once funded and released, everything will be going to print.\n\nLast, but not least, I am personally quality checking, processing, and shipping every order.

As his contact list grew, so did his interest in the  complete field of comic. Starting up a Bad Grrl Comics Fan club in 2001  was the first step to go further then his own living room. Soon  thereafter he began setting up websites for Arthur Suydam, Eric  Basaldua, Broadsword Comics and focussing on titles like Vampirella,  Cavewoman, Hack/Slash and more... He even started working with the FACTS comicon organization where he also met the founder of Broken Frontier and  shortly thereafter began doing headlines for this news site. Later he  founded the website COMICSFORSINNERS which more resembles his prior BadGrrl fanclub. Nowadays Richard  dabbles in Art Agency, sending out comic Press Releases and since 2019 publishing various comic books.\nMarkus von Renthe-Fink: Story Editor / story 1 penciller\nMarkus has loved comics and creating art since childhood. His road to creating comic books, though, took several detours. After graduation he had to admit to himself that it would be next to impossible to make a living by drawing comics in Germany, and relocating to the US wasn't really an option, even though at this point his drawing abilities were quite good. So he spent the next 20 years in the dreary profession of a graphics deisgner. It took a pep talk from fan-favorite artist Greg Capullo during a book signing in Frankfurt to get Markus back on track; after being told that in the meantime, the \"bullpens\" at the publishers had ceased to exist: all you needed nowadays to break into comics were talent, a scanner and an internet connection. With newfound enthusiasm, determined to take the comic book world by storm (or, failing that, a gentle breeze), Markus set out to find a partner-in-crime - enter Richard Boom, who was happy to take Markus aboard. Initially (and rather inadvertently) he took on the role of story editor, trying to bring some sort of order and continuity to she sprawling wealth of material that represented the \"Sisterhood\" universe. Hungry to get his teeth into the actual creation of art, he took the script for a 10-page story apart at the seams (with the blessing of original author Viktor Kruithof) and hammered it into a full-length comic book story. These pages will see print as Sisterhood #2 sometime in the spring of 2020, and, as life sometimes comes full-circle, will feature a variant cover by none other than Greg Capullo. \nDeviantart  Portfolio\nFacebook: The Art of Markus von Renthe-Fink\n\nRenee Rienties: story 2 penciller\nRenee Rienties is an independent comic artist from the Netherlands.\n                        She made her start in the world of comics in 2016 with her smallpress book \u201cMy Daily Life Comics\u201d which was received well by her readers online and at comic conventions.\n                        In 2017 her art took a dark turn, from funny cute gag comics to creepy bloody horror. Here she worked on a story in \u201cOyasumi\u201d A manga collaboration she started with two fellow artists. Where she drew her comic \u201cDistortia\u201d  Her creepy art will leave a chilling impression for you to remember.\n                        In 2018 she worked on a chilling short story in the \u201cHollandsch Manga\u201d anthology series made by various Dutch artists.\n                        If mystery, thriller and horror are your thing, then you have something to look forward to. Right now Renee is working on a new chilling book that will come out end of 2019.\n                        Website / links:\n                        Instagram: http://instagram.com/artofreneerienties/\n                        Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ArtOfReneeRienties/\n                        Website: https://artofreneerienties.com/\nRichard, Ren\u00e9e and Markus\nBio's for the Original Artist, providing you some cool art-opportunities, via real commissions!\nGUEST ARTISTS:\nRALF VAN DER HOEVEN is an autodidact if you ever seen one. Hailing from the Netherlands, he is a well-received artist in the fantasy- and comic-community.\nAfter doing illustration work for Valkyrie and Artvlam he started a company with the Belgian Dominiek Vermandere called Lakoro. With Dominiek he's co-owner and creator of the new comicbook series for all ages named: Troltrol. (www.troltrol.be)\nThe first dutch book was recently published and is available.\nBesides that Ralf fills his time making several variant covers for Dark Dragon Books (The dutch-translated Deadpool and Lady Mechanika).\nHis dream of creating an original comicbook of his own is taking shape in his free time and besides that he's putting together his first ever fantasy artbook via Dutch Publisher Dark Dragon Books Art Collection.\nART GRAFUNKEL is designer by day, doodlemonkey by night, Belgian Waffle by birth, and nerdy by nature.\nHis  geeky artwork has been featured in VISIONS FROM THE UPSIDE DOWN: A  STRANGER THINGS ARTBOOK (Del Rey), TRANSMETROPOLITAN: ALL AROUND THE  WORLD (CBLDF), WORMWOOD: GENTLEMAN CORPSE (IDW) and he's doodled  sketchcards for STAR WARS GALAXY and MARS ATTACKS (Topps). He is a comicon-regular and brings smiles to folks he knows as well as folks he does not...\n                  He also thinks it's pretty pretentious, writing all of this third person.\nROBIN MIES is a Dutch illustrator, sketch card and comic artist.\nIn recent years he has made various sketch card sets under his own management, but he has also been able to draw for, among others, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 and Thor: Ragnarok. Partly because of this, his illustrated blank covers are becoming increasingly popular.\nDISCLAIMER: all contributing artists (Ebas, Ryp, Capullo etc)  have agreed to me using their gifts to me under the condition that NO  profit will be made. ALL profits will be going towards the creative  team!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter\nThe comicbook is all written  and penciled.

So I want to come back here and make this a complete series of oneshots, showcasing new talents during this whole adventure!\n\n About this particular project: I have decided to only do a regular cover and one variant cover. This makes me certain the printing will not be a too big of a deal.\n\n Shipping will be done worldwide via the ultra-reliable German postal services as they reside just mere minutes away from my town. The extra perk of this, is the fact that Shipping via Germany is just as reliable as via my own country of the Netherlands, but cheaper for your wallet.\n\n I am failry new at this Kickstarter-game

coloring and lettering and graphic design)!\n\n Although all are well versed in the industry, we do understand that there are possible unforeseen issues such as:\n Manufacture Delays \n Shipping

Note  that customs for your  local country may  hold on to packages for a week  or longer and incur  additional charges that is the responsibility of  the backer. We will not  mark items as a \"gift.\" We know that  shipping  overseas is  very expensive and we wish it was cheaper, too!  We help by subsidizing  some of the shipping cost. We make no money from the shipping charges collected.\nFrank Cho is offering a selection of his original Harley Quinn cover artwork to help fund this campaign. Each original is drawn on 100 lb. Strathmore bristol board using Micron pen with archival inks. Those works with tonal highlights were done using Copic markers. Each tier comes with The Art of Frank Cho signed hardcover book and all five 13 x 19\" premium signed prints. These originals will ship within the U.S. using USPS Priority Mail. Art shipping international will be shipped using FedEx International Mail. Original art packages will be shipped in late December. A total of three packages will be sent. The original art displayed is not guaranteed for inclusion in the book and do not serve as interior page samples.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy you should trust Flesk Publications? John Fleskes answers:\n\nI pride myself on having an 18 year record of publishing over eighty art books. I've run twelve previous Kickstarter campaigns with artists such as Brom, Frank Cho, J.A.W. Cooper, Jeffrey Alan Love, Gary Gianni and Mike Mignola (Hellboy: Into the Silent Sea Studio Edition), Petar Meseldzija, Richard and Wendy Pini (Elfquest), Mark Schultz, and Daren Bader and Lance HaunRogue. Most of these have been on time. We are very open with our backers and communicate through updates often to keep you up to date.\n\nIn some cases, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over eighty books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would.\n\nThanks to everyone has supported us.

I get to be an explorer, an inventor, a biologist. An adventurer. Through my years playing D&D, working for TSR, Wizards of the Coast, and then freelancing, I had the privilege of revealing wonders to people who share my love of the fantastic. I dissected dragons to see how they work. I found friends and companions\u2014from spacefarers in distant solar systems, to pirates and thieves and magicians, to a certain dark elf. Whole cultures, entire races, emerged into the light. Along the road I discovered a world of my own, which is still unveiling. Many of you have been with me every step of the way. Your appreciation of my efforts made it all possible.\nUPDATE: Thanks to the overwhelming support, the page count is now 336. Depending on how these last two days go, I may be able to push it to 352! That includes most of the paintings I've done plus some essential process and concept art.\nFound Worlds will be a record of our excavations together, a compilation of every world we\u2019ve uncovered. I want to put it all in this book, and that's why we're here. It\u2019s going to be big, and I want to share art and process for everything from the beginning of my career to all my finished paintings\u2014Dungeons & Dragons, Drizzt, Magic: The Gathering, Warcraft, The Evertide, and countless other realms. I'm asking for your help to make it happen. Are you ready to take another journey with me?\nIntroduction by artist and friend, John Avon, with commentary by Donato Giancola, Mark Nelson, Marie Brennan, R.A. Salvatore, and others.\nSample pages\nFound Worlds will be 9\"x12\", with over 290 pages of illustrations printed at the best quality modern printers can achieve. The time and finances it takes to make a book this size possible can skyrocket quickly, and you know I'm a perfectionist, but I want this to be a beautiful and lasting portfolio of my work. In the meantime, I'm halfway done with my second novel in The Evertide series, but illustration still pays the bills; Found Worlds may give me room to continue building this universe with story and art.\nBesides the book, I'm offering quite a few rewards as a thanks to backers. Some of these are brand new or expanded compilations of my art, while others are discounted or rarely-offered items. Take note below that we'll charge for shipping after the campaign and before the books ship next year. \n THREE 8.5\"x11\" Prints - printed on premium luster photo paper with an archival 8-color process.\n Sketchbook Vols. 1 & 2 - I've done so many black & white drawings and concept pieces over the course of my career that there's no room for all of them in one book, so I'll include them as sketchbooks instead. I'm still finalizing their contents, but one will likely feature my concept work for 3rd Edition D&D. The other will collect finished pen and ink illustrations. Between the two I\u2019ll also share additional process on some of my favorite paintings.\nNo dragons were harmed in the making of this book...\n The Special Edition - Found Worlds, but wrapped in a dragonskin textured leather and stamped with a silver foil title. Each of these books will come signed and numbered. Each edition of this book comes with a hand-drawn sketch, or Remarque, inside\u2014unique to that book.\nPLAY\n\nOur printer showcases the wonderful \u201cDragonskin\u201d leather I\u2019ve picked out for the Limited Edition slipcase and book cover. Dragons have scales in armored areas, but skin more like that of an elephant or rhino over most of their bodies. This was a perfect match. \n The Collector's Portfolio- These 13\"x19\" prints are usually convention-only. For the first time here online I'm offering collections at a reduced price. Choose from Drizzt, Dragons, Magic: the Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons, D&D Monster Manual Dragons, and the Lady Trent Collection.\n\nFor the wyrm that needs everything\n Limited Edition Metal Evertide Print* - Offered only through this Kickstarter as a thank you to my highest backers is this 20\"x20\" Metal print of the iconic Evertide statue. Signed & limited to a number determined by this Kickstarter.\n*The metal print will ship in a separate category from all other tiers.\nI've received the proofs for the metal print in the Dragon's Hoard tier, and they are gorgeous!\nPLAY\n\nOther Limited Edition Prints - I'm only offering the metal print through this Kickstarter, but most all of my paintings are available as limited edition prints through my website toddlockwood.com \nSHIPPING- I\u2019m going to charge for shipping AFTER the campaign when the books are ready to ship. Which means you'll likely receive a survey from our Kickstarter with an opportunity to enter your address and pay for shipping then. I'll keep everyone updated with reminders when that survey is open / emailed. I've done my best to estimate realistic shipping for different countries. Again, these are just estimates, and I've tried to design the rewards so that they will ship to your door easily in one container, all except for the Metal Evertide Print. For this, and thus for the Dragon's Hoard tier, we will have to charge shipping separately from the other tiers. I'm working with some European services to decrease these costs, but please be aware of the shipping before you pledge, and feel free to email or contact with any questions. See \"regular shipping\" for all other tiers besides Dragon's Hoard, below:\nRetailers\u2014If you want to purchase 5 or more books for your own storefront, please email me: todd@toddlockwood.com\nAdd-ons - If you would like to combine tiers or purchase multiple versions of a tier, you can increase your pledge to cover the total amount of them added together. After the campaign ends, we will reach out to anyone with extra funds pledged to survey them about the additional rewards they are interested in.\nThank you so much for taking the time to visit this campaign. Thank you for believing in what I love. Thank you for coming with me on this journey.\nThe best is yet to come!\n\u2014Todd Lockwood", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've tried our best to talk with the printer in detail and hammer out a deadline for this book.

A blizzard may strike for a week, a dragon may burn my house down, or the economy could collapse into ruin taking everything we know with it in a nuclear apocalypse.

This then gives us a real headache when it comes to working out how to charge everything at once!\nYou probably have a limited number of sockets, which means that you are forced to charge different devices in different places around your house.\nIt can be chaos on your table\nSome cables are not compatible with your device\nApple tried to build a better charging platform before, but they failed, dramatically.\nSo, if you can\u2019t get a good charger from Apple, what do you do? Do a search for \u201call-in-one wireless charger\u201d and you will find quite a few out there. However, they all have similar problems, 1) they are not reliable, 2) they do not charge all of your devices and 3) they look cheap and plasticky.\nFor all those Apple family users, we decided to create the ultimate 4-in-1 wireless charger, the only charger you will need.\n\nMFi Certified 4-in-1 Wireless Charger for All Apple Devices & Qi Certification\nWe care about our Apple devices, just like you. \nIncorrectly charging your devices can cause long term damage to its battery life. This is why we designed our wireless chargers in a very specific way. The MFi & Qi certification means that all the electronics are designed and specifically tuned for apple devices. This ensures that you are charging in a safe manner, exactly the same as your Apple original charger.\nDrop and Charge\nCharging Has Never Been so EASY!\nAs the world's first chain-coil wireless charger, both the Air quad and the Air Trio have  high-power wireless charging transmitter chain-coils built within the deck zone, which means you can simply drop your Qi-supported device and it starts charging at up to 10W speed. Life is simple, never again do you need to go looking for the charging spot with a so-called wireless charger.\nYour Life is Free, Don't Be Limited by Devices\nCharge Your Apple Watch Any Way You Like\nLicensed by Apple, the Apple Watch charging module can either flip up or down with a simple click. This allows you to charge your Apple Watch safely horizontally, or vertically when you use it as a night clock.\n18W Super Fast Charging Port\nCharge your phone up to 50% within 30 minutes\nBoth support 18W fast charging and can charge your phone to up to 50% within 30 mins. Saving you time for the more important things in life instead of waiting for your device to be charged.\nCase Friendly Design\nDesigned with an adjustable controller, the lightning/type c terminal can be adjusted to fit your device charging no matter whether it wears a case on or not.\n\nTechnology Should Serve Human, LDR Design Ensures Your Nice Sleep \nWe know you may charge your devices in your bedroom as you go to sleep. With the LDR (light-dependent resistor) sensor, the light goes dark automatically when lights off, so that you can sleep peacefully.\nUsing Whilst Charging\nThe Air Quad is also equipped with a foldable stand, helping you to charge devices upright. So you can keep an eye on incoming messages, weather alerts, scores or what\u2019s playing on Spotify. You can also use it for hands-free FaceTime calls or for watching live videos on Facebook and Instagram.\nSpace-Saving Foldable Design\nWhen there is no need for you to charge the iPad or other devices on the terminal, you can always decide to fold it and save space.\nLiving Organized to Be Successful\nOrganize All Your Apple Devices with A Compact Design\nBeing the ultimate 4-in-1 wireless charging station, the Air Quad charges your iPhone, iPad, AirPods and Apple Watch in one small, simple place and keeps them neat and tidy. Say goodbye to messy cables. Never again will you need to look for your charging cables, now you can live organized.\nNever Settle for Average, We Always Go for Top-Tier Materials.\nBuilt with the premium material combo of aramid fiber & chrome-plated zinc. Both the Air Quad and the Air Trio are designed to be luxurious. The precisely cut aramid fiber face provides an unforgettable, luxurious and sexy smooth touch. The zinc alloy frame provides stability and a high degree of accuracy. Both materials are engineered to dissipate heat effectively whilst still giving that high-end appearance.\n\nCustomize your Air Quad /Air Trio, and make it really unique now.\nAvailable ONLY for Kickstarter, and limited 200pcs ONLY. (Out of stock)\nWith the laser engraving technology, now you can put a few texts on the product in the rear section, like your name or your mottos or anything you would like to say to your friends, etc. By engraving, you really make it unique and memorable.\nIf you want the customization service, please add $15/CAD20 when pledging. We will contact you for confirmation when the campaign is ending.\n\n Optional Silver or Black Color \nAir Quad/Trio comes with two different colors: black and silver. They are both enhanced with genuine aramid fiber and chrome-plated zinc, but the polishing process is a bit different. \nThe classic black version is polished by matte sand paint which offers a smooth texture. The silver version has an extremely dashing look because the entire back area is electroplated with bright chromium, which involves many times of polishing, reshaping and CMC. That means, more techniques and stricter design demand are required for the silver than the black version. \n\nHow to use Air Quad & Air Trio\nAir Quad & Air Trio Voltage Test:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapters Available in CN, US, AU, EU, UK types.\n Note: Customization is out of stock", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not our first time explore in the multi-device wireless charging field and we have a pretty good idea of what to expect and how to do things right.

So far, we are ready for the Air Trio mass production and now trial testing for the Air Quad. \n\nHowever, we also know that sometimes hidden obstacles and challenges can occur out of the blue.

We\u2019re passionate about designing travel products that become trusty companions. Why the name Gravel? You know that sound when your tires leave the pavement for a dirt road? That's where the adventure begins, that's Gravel.\nDirt roads have led us to some of our favorite places in the world - hot springs, mountain trails, and beautiful scenic routes. To us, Gravel is the means to take us somewhere amazing and we're committed to finding solutions that enhance your travel experiences. \nWe\u2019re SO dang happy to share this with you.\n Introducing The Layover Travel Blanket \nWhat is the The Layover?\nLet\u2019s face it, traveling is exhausting. You just can\u2019t predict when you\u2019ll need extra comfort. Long uncomfortable flights, napping on the floor during delays, transfers, road trips... how do you stay comfortable?! We set out to take the edge off and make your journey even better.\nWe included a ton of awesome features to make this blanket perfect to take comfort everywhere you go. See why below.\nHow to back this campaign:\n1. Click \"Back This Project\" & select reward level\n2. Want to add more blankets to your reward? You can easily add additional travel blankets post Kickstarter via BackerKit survey)\nJump to our FAQ if you need a more detailed answer\nWait, why does this blanket make traveling better?\nHere's The Problem: Getting comfortable while traveling or on the go is really tough. You aren\u2019t likely to carry your grandma\u2019s super comfy quilt on a plane unless you want to look like you\u2019re headed for an adult sleepover. Blankets just aren\u2019t packable!\nYou never know if the plane you are boarding will get drafty, if you will be stuck on a super long layover, or if you'll end up in a window seat up against the cold wall of a bus. We thought there had to be a much better way.\nHere's The Solution: The Layover will change the way you look at travel blankets forever. We incorporated a ton of neat features to keep you comfortable on the go. Here's a quick walkthrough:\nSpace & weight of your luggage on the go is vital.\nDetachable & Hideaway Stuff Sack\nThe attached stuff sack packs into a zippered pocket on the side of the blanket to keep it out of the way when using the blanket.\nEasy Stuffing w/Patent Pending Stuff Sack\nStuffing into stuff sacks is the worst. To solve this, we added 3\u201d of extra material for easy grip & stuffing.\nYou can then use the drawstring to quickly cinch down and convert the material down to its most compact size.\nThe breathable insulation core keeps you feeling just right. Fun fact: Our insulation is 100% recycled PET plastic (i.e. water bottles) & keeps high performance standards.\nMicrofleece Kangaroo Pocket\nWe've lined the inside of the Kangaroo pocket with microfleece for a soft place for your hands.\nInside of the Kangaroo Pocket\nSnap Blankets Together & Increase Blanket Width\nWant a wider blanket size to share with a friend? Compatible snaps line the edge of the blanket to increase width to as many blankets as you want. \nDon't worry, we did the math. It only takes 386,376,478 of our connected blankets to make it to the moon.\nSpill Proof/Water Resistant\nSizing\nTech Specs\n Nylon: 20D\n Insulation: 40 gr/sq m made from PET plastic\n Warmth Rating:  60\u00b0\n Zipper: YKK\n Weight: 11.4 ounces\n Drawstring: Paracord\nAnti-Static + Waterproof Coating\n Machine Washable \nWashing Instructions\nThe blanket is machine washable. Tumble dry it on low or hang dry.\nWhen will it all ship?\nTimeline:\nOur Story\nChris met Lance in 2017 with an idea to design a better toiletry bag for traveling. \nHoly smokes - we\u2019ve shipped 37,000+ products to 108 countries around the world. Because of your incredible support we've been able to continue to design products that make traveling a little easier and better.\nWe have the raddest Kickstarter backers around - we\u2019re so thankful for the bestowed backer trust. We're busy designing a lineup of travel products that solve problems we and other travelers experience.\nLifetime Warranty\nWe are so confident in our product's build that we have added a lifetime warranty - plain and simple. If the blanket doesn't hold up for what it was designed for then let us know and we'll make it right.\nReturn Policy\nWe only used premium materials to ensure years of use. We will repair or replace any blankets that somehow don't hold up to do what the blanket was designed to be used for. We do not offer refunds or returns on blankets that were received as a Kickstarter reward.\nWe\u2019re passionate about creating amazing products and Kickstarter is a way for us to launch our brand. As you've read, Kickstarter isn't a store and rewards are a thanks for supporting the project which is why we cannot offer refunds or returns. Your pledge means so much and we take it very seriously. We will do anything we can to make sure that this exchange leaves with good vibes for everyone involved.\nOutside The USA? International Customs Calculator\nWe are so pumped that we have shipped this product to 108 countries. Backer rewards are merchandise and not gifts. We value your support SO much and want to make every interaction super positive all the way through this process. If you are backing our project outside the USA you will likely have to pay customs. \nShipping fees DO NOT count toward customs fees. Here is a shipping calculator for you to understand what you will be paying your government to import this product. \nhttps://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/\nNeed further help?

They make some of the world\u2019s most incredible products and even though we have everything in place, there's always a risk working building a new product.\n\nWe've made thousands of products and have hired a experienced manufacturing team to ensure quality and to keep us on our timeline. Our manufacturer will everything possible to make sure we delivered backer rewards promptly.\n\nWe put a lot of processes in place to reduce the chance of errors.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe didn't cut any corners with material selection to ensure rips and tears are minimized plus stress points get extra attention. We also designed reinforcements in areas used most. Two examples:\n\n1. Snaps are reinforced with extra material surrounding them to reduce rips\n\n2. Attached stuff sacks can get stress on the connected parts when packing. We added a snap to the piece of material that connects the blanket to the stuff sack. When packing away if the material is getting too much stress, the snap will break loose vs cause threads to take the beating.\nReusability and recyclability\nWith our Lifetime Warranty, we want to make sure that the blanket, as do all our products, gets years of use. Instead of just throwing away a blanket for a warranty claim we want to closely examine and attempt to repair.\n\nIn 2018 we also used only minimal packaging. One cardboard box was designed to serve as packaging and the shipping box (vs a box shipped in a box). We also do not use single use plastic in any packaging. We opted to use tissue paper to protect the product inside.\nSustainable materials\nInsulation: 100% recycled material. Certified free of harmful chemicals and are safe for human use. Organic certification means that textile and fabric products are grown according to strict guidelines on the use of petroleum based fertilizers, pesticides and synthetic products.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nEven though with some factories it is a new concept to really reduce waste we are pushing them to be more conservative with waste. It's amazing how much plastic can be used just to ship thousands of products from a factory to a warehouse. We take steps along the way to reduce all waste.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe're very close (as friends and physically) to our fulfillment center. Waste when fulfilling thousands of orders at once also is pretty ridiculous. Giant plastic bags are a standard & used to gather all the products together to take to the distribution center. For this project we are going to work with our warehouse/distribution center to make sure this waste is minimized (hopefully to zero!).", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 99 or more", "title": "Early Bird: 1 Layover Blanket", "descp": "Get The Layover Travel Blanket for $31 off the retail price ($130).\nINCLUDES:\nThe Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,223 backers", "Limited (2 left of 3225)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 120 or more", "title": "1 Layover Blanket", "descp": "Get The Layover Travel Blanket for $10 off the retail price ($130).\nINCLUDES:\nThe Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["24 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 190 or more", "title": "Early Bird: 2 Layover Blankets", "descp": "Get TWO of The Layover Travel Blankets for $70 off the retail price ($260).\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 The Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,079 backers", "Limited (1 left of 1080)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 240 or more", "title": "2 Layover Blankets", "descp": "Get TWO of The Layover Travel Blankets for $20 off the retail price ($260).\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 The Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 280 or more", "title": "3 Layover Blankets", "descp": "Get THREE of The Layover Travel Blankets for $110 off the retail price ($390).\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 The Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["79 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 460 or more", "title": "5 Layover Blankets", "descp": "Get FIVE of The Layover Travel Blankets for $190 off the retail price ($650).\nWe can't wait to see you snap all five of these together :D\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 The Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["41 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 84 or more", "title": "SUPER Early Bird: 1 Layover Blanket", "descp": "Get The Layover Travel Blanket for $46 off the retail price ($130).\nINCLUDES:\nThe Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "300 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 168 or more", "title": "SUPER Early Bird: 2 Layover Blankets", "descp": "Get TWO of The Layover Travel Blankets for $92 off the retail price ($260).\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 The Layover", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "200 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Re:Pack // Keychain Face Mask IS LIVE ON KICKSTARTER!", "update_content": "Well hey there,\nSuper psyched to share a sneak peek of our upcoming Kickstarter project!

Justin's \"PoseMuse\" material has proven to be an invaluable resource for both inspiration and literal reference. Highly recommended!\" ~Brad Thingvold - Comic Artist\nMy name is Justin Martin. I'm an author and an artist who wants to create the next book in my Poses for Artists series, 'Volume Five - Hands, Skulls, Pin-ups & Various Poses'. The book will include my latest pose resources, available on my pose-blog, PoseReference, that now has over 50,000 followers. Volume five primarily includes poses that have never been made available, along with a compilation of poses that I've put online for free over the past three years.\nThis Kickstarter is essentially an advance pre-sale for 'Poses For Artists Volume 5  . It will help cover the costs of publication, while giving perks and major book discounts that are only available in these Kickstarter rewards. This is my way of offering more to the artist community, and everyone who has supported this passion project over the past few years. \nThe cover, poses and publisher files for Volume Five are almost done, but I need your Kickstarter support to finalize everything and make the project happen. Your support helps  cover the cost of supplies, equipment, book design, publicity, pre-production, acquiring ISBNs, publisher/account fees, shipping, travel, website fees, fulfillment and book printing.\nVolume 5 Hand & Skulls Examples\nMy poses simplify the human form in a way that can sometimes remove the inevitable anxiety that comes with drawing a person, and speed-up your art, over time, increasing your own understanding of human anatomy, proportions and movement.\nMy intention is to share my simplified poses online and in print, so they might inspire everyone to pick up a pencil or stylus and create new art. I understand that sometimes, you just need a creative nudge to help get the pencil moving and break that pesky block. In my heart, I believe that helping to empower artists makes the world a better place. \nVolume 5 Example Poses - Based on photo references from SenshiStock\nTo give you an idea of what I've published in the past, see my previous books on my website PoseMuse.com (all available on Amazon and Gumroad).\nVolume 1 - Dynamic and Sitting Poses | Buy > |  \nVolume 2 - Standing Poses | Buy > |  \nVolume 3 - Fighting & Various Poses | Buy > |  \nVolume 4 - Couples Poses | Buy > |  \nYour support is your invitation to the community, and be an important part of making this next volume happen.

Unlike traditional \u201clow frequency vibration\u201d or \u201chammer impact motion\u201d massage devices, STRIG incorporates micro-vibration technology to accelerate muscle relaxation and promote the growth of muscle fibers. STRIG also emits micro currents throughout the muscle to reduce the build-up of lactic acid in order to prevent muscle soreness. \n\n\n\nStrig\u2019s curvature design was designed by a team of physical therapists who have devoted a lot of time and energy into product research. \nIts ergonomic design molds perfectly to any body type while allowing you to press directly onto the muscle and get to at those hard to reach areas. Strig is also designed to help everyone obtain professional-quality massage treatments whether you\u2019re at home, the office, the gym, or any other location.\nWe believe that having access to professional quality massages at an affordable price is something that everyone deserves.\nMicrocurrent is a Nobel Prize-winning therapy for muscle pain management. STRIG's microcurrent technology was developed to precisely mimic the human body's natural electrical properties; it helps re-boost your biological electrical system.\nSource :  https://bit.ly/2XdOjHV\nThe human muscle layer is located beneath the skin and fat tissue layers (Epidermis, Dermis and Subcutaneous tissue). Therefore, it is hard to reach with traditional vibration massage devices because they tend to only reach the surface level tissue layer. However, STRIG's microcurrent technology sends low-level electrical currents(25uA) that mimic the body's own natural electrical current which helps in stimulating the deepest muscle layers. The microcurrents emitted from STRIG also help reduce the build-up of lactic acid which can help prevent muscle soreness when used in advance.\niPhone and iPad use capacitive touch screens. These screens use a finger's electrical conductivity to disrupt the screen's own electrostatic field. So that is why STRIG can unlock the iPhone passcode because it emits microcurrents. In contrast, the traditional massager can\u2019t unlock the iPhone passcode since it doesn\u2019t emit microcurrents.\n\nGeneral Blade-type Massage Tools vs. STRIG\nThe general blade-type massage tool(for IASTM) is made for professional use, because, in order to use it, you are generally required to have professional massage certification to locate and treat the damaged areas with the appropriate amount of pressure. However, Strig is designed to add micro-vibration technology to the blade-type massage tool, which helps you to experience a professional-quality massage with ease, even if you don\u2019t have professional knowledge and skills.\nSTRIG increases the temperature of the area that is massaged by generating friction heat. This heat promotes greater blood circulation in the treated area which allows for more nutrients and oxygen to be delivered to the damaged muscle tissues. Through this, the muscle tissues are stimulated properly and the cells repair themselves at a faster rate.\nBoth hammer impact motion massager and blade-type massager differ in the way they impact on an object. As you can see from the thermal sensor images, most massages implement the use of a ball or hammer shape to create high impact on a specific hitting point. This does not stimulate the muscles evenly and can be very painful. STRIG\u2019s blade design is designed to mold perfectly to any body so that you can experience a massage that can be performed evenly throughout the targeted area.\n\nStrig has three adjustable levels of micro-vibration intensity to meet your needs depending on the designated massage area. One press of a button will allow you to change the intensity of your massage.  \nSTRIG: USB-C Chargeable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to out 8th update post \"Removeable Battery? Done.\" for more information. Thank you!\nAs a physical therapist who has been treating patients in hospitals for over 10 years, I became very accustomed to using different IASTM tools. Traditional IASTM tools allows the user to release Myofascial pain (a fancy word for muscle pain) through soft tissue mobilization. Since 2015, my team and I have trained physical therapists as well as those in training and also helped each person create tools that suited each individual's style. \nThe IASTM tools I was using were somewhat effective and easy to use, but they did not synergize well with the Graston technique, which I specialized in.

This is a unique product that combines elements of microvibrations and electro-microcurrents. We have spent hundreds of hours testing to ensure the robust durability of Strig over extended periods of use. We have scientific data that heat and vibration frequency levels are beneficial to users. It is important to note that we will ship the product worldwide and there may be some delays due to taxes, tariffs and other import regulations in each country. If the delivery is delayed for more than a certain amount of time due to the above problems, we will deliver the goods to our backers by individual airmail such as DHL. This is our plan B.\n\nWe already have all of the prototypes ready for mass production, so we think there will be no problems during the duration of the campaign, but there may be some unexpected situations that may arise later on.

A concentrate of my last years of work.\n  The reason I love monsters and creeps is that they're fun. I've spent the last 30 years with Aliens of all kind around me when I wasn't directly working on them. Not even mentioning the creepy cover art and daily work I design for my fellow colleagues, writers or publishers like Titan Comics, Upper Deck Entertainment, Big Dog Ink...\nThe  reason why I did not add ladies as you can see in the print option, is  that I want to have something special added. Who knows how well all  goes, and I can add prints, trading cards or a limited extra Artbook with only ladies involved!\n  \"Aliens, Heroes and Other Creeps\" is a 48 pages, full color A4 artbook, my very first in that format.

Mutant Mayhem Minis WILL be a reality thanks to all of our early backers. From this point on, we are advancing towards unlocking lots of cool free stuff and new options for all our backers! Scroll down to the Stretch Goals section to see what's coming next...\n The upper tier rewards offer a great deal on per figure cost, that just gets better with each new Free Reward Unlocked. Currently:\nComplete Character Set: 21 figures for $80 = $3.80 per figure\nGM Bad Guy Set: 25 figures for $90 = $3.60 per figure\nGet It All: $40 figures for $160 =$4 per figure\n*All the Mut-O-Rats combined count as just 1 figure for the above calculations.\nThe Story Behind Mutant Mayhem Minis\nThe goal of this kickstarter is to raise funds for mold-making and production costs to create a line of figures specifically for the Mutant Crawl Classics playing game (and of course, also great for any old-school post-apocalyptic game, Gamma World, etc.). If you are awesome enough to give us money to make it happen, the pewter figures themselves will be your reward!\nTo get things started I sculpted 15 detailed player-character pieces, including an array of Pure Strain Humans, Mutants and Manimals. I also created a few different monster pieces, and these figures were used by my wife and myself for the Mutant Crawl Classics games we ran at Gen Con this year. All of the sculpts have already been mastered, and enough pewter castings run to make production molds. We\u2019re partway there already, we just need your help to afford production molds and a pile of metal to get these guys out into the world. And hopefully, this will just be the beginning\u2026we plan to add tons more characters, adversaries, and even terrain bits to the line down the road!\nFor those who haven\u2019t been seen it yet, Mutant Crawl Classics is a role-playing Game of Post-Apocalyptic adventure published by Goodman Games and compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Fantasy game. Humans work alongside mutants and mutated sentient plants and animals to survive a radioactive world of dangers and horrors, and uncover the mysteries of the world that came before. Learn more here. \nA Free Adventure Module\nAt all Reward Levels, all backers are entitled to download our FREE 22-page adventure The Goats Of Travail! This adventure features miniatures already unlocked during the campaign --spider-goats! 4 downloadable full-color battle-maps are also included! It's available right now --if you are already a backer, head on over to Update #18 for download instructions! If you're not a backer yet, as soon as you make that happen, then head over to Update #18 to get your free module!!\nThe Heroes\nBelow are pictures and a brief description of all 15 characters in the initial line. Note that as an added bonus, all pledges will receive access to a free PDF file, with character sheets and backgrounds for all the characters. These are the exact same stats we ran at Gen Con\u2014balanced, playable, and fun!\n  BAM-BEE\nDeer Manimal. Insect-like antenna combine with radar-dish antlers to provide exceptional sensory abilities. \n  BAT GUY\nMutant (mutated human). Recovered an ancient artifact, a \u2018Graphic Novel\u2019, and uses it as an instructional manual for Life. He now considers himself the Wasteland\u2019s Crime Fighter.\n  BELLE\nCow Manimal. Always brings milk and cheese for everyone. Just\u2026don\u2019t ask where she got it.\n  BOB-DAR, The Bob-arian\nPure Strain Human (Sentinel). Wielder of the legendary \u2018Shield of Yield\u2019.\n  CAP\u2019N PLATYPUS\nMutant (mutated human). Quills of a porcupine, bill of a duck, mane of a lion. Heart of a hero.\n  DHAR-RYL\nPure Strain Human Scout. Super-capable redneck with a heart of gold. And a crossbow.\n  DOK-TOR ZAY-ISS\nOrangutan Manimal. Stretchy. Calls himself an \u2018Orangu-twang\u2019. Thinks he\u2019s a genius. If true, he is operating on a whole other level.\n  FLOWER\nPure Strain Human Shaman. The bark-like skin on her limbs marks her as a follower of Gaea, the AI god of Nature, if the plants and flowers growing in her hair weren\u2019t enough of a clue.\n  GUT-FACE.\nMutant (mutated human). Ewww, his mouth is in his belly. But he\u2019s got a cool scorpion-like tail that acts as an extra hand, so that\u2019s cool.\n  HAROLD\nCactus Plantient. A little go-getter. His extra limbs make him extra-fast and extra-stabby.\n  LAHR-REE\nPure Strain Human Shaman. Lahr-Ree is a follower of HALE-E, the AI of video games and pop culture. He doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense in day-to-day conversations, but he can call upon amazing powers in times of need.\n  MISTUR TODE\nToad Manimal. His ability to mesmerize enemies makes him truly formidable. Those who prove resistant to his charms simply get whacked on the melon.\n  PIERCE\nPure Strain Human Healer. Her little mutated friend Brane the Rat might actually have the medical degree, but, if not much of a healer, Pierce sure knows how to hurt people.\n  PLISS-KIN\nMutant (mutated human). His imposing size gives him extra strength, making his stop-sign greataxe even more devastating. Oh, and he shoots lasers from his eyes.\n  TRIBELLA\nMutant (mutated human). Don\u2019t get on her bad side when she\u2019s having a Bad Hair Day.\nA Word about the Gen Con Adventures\nWe ran two different adventures at Gen Con: The Gaea Protocol, and The Temple of ZIhA. They were very well received, and we certainly hope to publish these as 3rd party official MCC adventures. We thought about actually making the modules part of this Kickstarter, but have decided to work on them separately. Minis are what I know, and I know I can get these guys turned around quick for you all. Getting the modules to a polished and shiny state might take a bit more work and is really more of an unknown factor for us. The good news is, when we do get the modules ready, all these miniatures will already be done and waiting for them.\nAdd-ons: The Bad Guys\nI also sculpted a bunch of bad guys for the games, and they\u2019re pretty cool, too! Since they are bad guys, I figured some folks might not need \u2018em at all, and some folks might want multiple copies of some or all of them. Therefore, I have made them available as Add-Ons to the main Pledge Levels. If you want some, simply add up the numbers from the costs below and add that total on to your pledge amount.\nP\u2019lutians\n  These \u2018creatures\u2019 may look like some sort of magical swamp monster, but they are actually more akin to robots. An advanced Gaea Node in the center of each uses tractor beam and force field technology to draw pollution to itself, where it can then be ambulated back to a processing facility for purification. At least, that\u2019s how it was supposed to work. Now, their programming has become corrupted, and they spread pollution and death across the land. \nZihans\n  A race of little mutant iguana-manimals. These guys are none too bright and are generally hostile to other sentients. Recently, they have discovered some ancient \u2018monster movies\u2019 that have led to them displaying some truly odd behavior. They walk with exaggerated stomping motions, like they think they\u2019re really big, and they carry bottles of Inferno Ant Extract, which they chug and then spit at their enemies, making it look like they are breathing fire. Also, they\u2019re little nudists.\nGihans\n  These mutated Gila Monster Manimals have been seen in the company of the Zihans lately, and they may have been watching some of the same movies. They are much bigger than the zihans, and also a little smarter and a lot crueler. \nCult of ZIhA Minions Set\n  This set contains 8 Zihans and 2 Gihans, and is enough minions to run the Temple of ZIhA adventure when we do finally get around to publishing it. Even if you just wanna use them in your own adventures, these are the type of Minion monsters that you\u2019re likely to want in multiples.\nCult of ZIhA Lieutenants\n  The final boss monsters of the Temple of ZIhA, available as a set or individually, and detailed below.\nBob-Ziha\n  A giant extra-mutated Gihan. Bob-Ziha is no genius, but he\u2019s big. Like, real big. His fans among the tribe have dressed him up in special armor so he looks even more like their monster-movie idol. This is a large model that stands on a 2\u201d circular base and is cast in 6 different pieces. \nGig-Ann\n  This female Gihan is a cosplay fanatic, and borrowed props from the movie theater to make her look.\nGlow Dan\n  Dan is heavily mutated from a base Gihan manimal, possessing wings, a beak, and glow-in-the-dark skin. \nAngry Russ\n  Russ is a mutated Zihan with a spiky carapace. His friends noticed he looked a bit like one of the monsters from their movies, and to help further the impression they painted him brown. The brown paint irritates his skin. Thus he is angry. Angry Russ.\nAdd-Ons Cost chart\nBe sure to check back as the Kickstarter progresses\u2026Stretch goals that are met will also become available as Add-Ons.\nStretch Goals\nIf we meet our minimum funding goal, we\u2019ll start throwing free stuff on the pile to entice new backers to jump on board, and to entice all of you to find those new backers and direct them over here. \nWe want very much to give you all great value for your pledges, but it is also important to deliver on time, and not slow the project down. To that end, I\u2019m going to be sculpting like a madman DURING the ks project, and trying to finish the sculpts for the new goals before they are announced. We\u2019re also going to throw in a few goals that are minis I\u2019ve sculpted previously that fit in great with the post-apocalyptic theme. \n The three types of Stretch Goals\nFree Reward: This is something that will be added FREE to your rewards, IF you\u2019ve pledged at the appropriate level. Realistically, I can\u2019t give out lots of free stuff to backers who pledge at all the lower levels\u2026I\u2019ll lose my shirt. Therefore, Free Rewards are only available to backers who pledge at the levels of Complete Character Set, GM\u2019s Bad Guy Set, Get It All, or your own MCC Mini (either one).\nThe exception to this is that if you pledge at a lower level and also throw enough Add-Ons into your pledge to meet or exceed the $80 value, then I will also throw you the free stuff.\nAdd-On: These are new minis that will be added to the Mutant Mayhem line, but that I can\u2019t afford to give out for free. These will be available to all backers to purchase as Add-Ons if we meet the stretch goal.\nOption: This Stretch goal unlocks a new variant or pose for a mini currently in the line-up. You will be able to select either option as your reward (if you are at a reward level that gets the mini) when you fill out your Backer Survey after the kickstarter. You will also have the option of purchasing the new pose as an Add-On, so you get both (or all) varieties.\nBig Spender Alert\nIf you really love our stuff and want to spend as much as two people would, then golly, we really love you too, and want to reward you as much as two people! So if you pledge $240 or more, you will receive DOUBLE the Stretch Goal Free Rewards. If you pledge $320 or more, you will get TRIPLE the Stretch Goal Free Rewards.\nTHE GOALS\nHere\u2019s a few of the first goodies we\u2019ve got lined up: \n  We\u2019ll start things out by adding some FREE minis to your pile that are already available, but nonetheless very cool and appropriate to the post-apocalypse setting. These pieces were called Spawn Rats in my Tentacles & Eyeballs line, but come slinking up here as Mut-o Rats \u2013regular vermin that have been exposed to some bizarre mutagenic compound, and changed into something even grosser! Since we have reached $4,000, all pledges at the $80 level and above will get a full set added to your rewards for FREE: 3 tiny Mut-o rats, one larger Ankle-Biter Mut-o Rat, and one Den Mother Mut-o Rat.  Stats for these beasties will also be added to the Character PDF. \n  Originally marketed as Spawn Fiend Mutants in my Tentacles & Eyeballs line, these guys are a perfect fit for MCC as poor souls who got exposed to some mutagenic toxic waste. Now that we've passed $5,500, each pledge at the $80 level and above will receive a set of all 3 figures as a FREE REWARD! They also come with pewter \u2018mutation sprues\u2019 that allow you to assemble them in many different ways. Mutant Crawl Classics-compatible stats for these guys will also be added to the Character PDF. \n  The Plantivore is a powerful mutated monster that gains its sustenance from consuming other sentient plant life \u2013plantients!! A nightmare for all plant-based player-characters, the Plantivore is now added as a Free Reward for all pledges $80 and up! As always, we will also include a Mutant Crawl Classics compatible stat-block and write-up in the Character PDF as well.\nWhat started as a way to create spider-silk more rapidly through the magic of genetic engineering has gone horribly horribly wrong with the addition of rampant radiation...behold the SPIDER-GOAT! Does whatever a Spider-Goat can! Including adding himself as a FREE REWARD to all pledges $80 and over, and adding himself as a $6.00 Add-On option to all pledges now that we have hit the $9,000 mark. The picture is a high-quality 3D print Erica painted up for us...he doesn't exist in pewter yet, but now he soon will!\nAnother monster from the MCC Bestiary, the Caprapod Warder is actually some strange sort of colony creature that has a kind of symbiotic relationship with Spider-Goats, and basically acts as a Spider-Goat Shepherd. As we have now reached $9,500, the Caprapod Warder Mini is unlocked as a $7 Add-On available to all pledge levels. The SPIDER-GOAT ENCOUNTER PACK is also unlocked!  This Add-On is a convenient way to get 5 more Spider-Goats --all the Spider-Goats you would need to run a challenging encounter, plus the Warder, all for only $28.\nSo our $9,500 Stretch Goal, the Caprapod Warder, is even weirder than most MCC baddies. If it takes too much damage, its body fragments and splits into a bunch of little 'Sap Pod' monsters --and that's what these are! At $10,000, these 6 cute little Sap Pod critters unlock. Each one sits on a \"Tiny\" sized 1/2 base. Get all 6 of them as a $4 Add-On, or get them all as a FREE REWARD with the purchase of a SPIDER-GOAT ENCOUNTER PACK!\nSo we made it all the way to $9,500 and unlocked those stretch goals, then got knocked back down a bit as a few big backers had to leave for real-life reasons. Since that put our next stretch goal a bit farther away, I thought I'd give us some extra incentive to get there.\nWhen we reach $10,000, not only will the Warder Sap Pods unlock, but all Backers at $80 and above will now get a SECOND SPIDER-GOAT added to their rewards for FREE!\nHere's another reward right from the MCC Bestiary...the CROACHLING! Of course mutant cockroaches infest the radioactive wastelands!! They will also infest your rewards...that is, if we can make it to $10,500. When we meet this stretch goal, all backers pledging $80 and above will receive a croachling mini as a FREE REWARD, and he will also be available to all backers as a $5 Add-On. (Picture is a digital rendering of the 3d model...real-world version coming soon!) This croachling's name is Tom, and he shows that even in the post-apocalypse, being a cockroach is still 'Risky Business'.\nSo, here's the thing about Croachlings...there's never gonna be just one. And that includes in your Rewards! If we make it to $11,000, a second pose of this fun monster will be added as a FREE REWARD to all pledges $80+, and will be available as an Add-On for $5. This guy's name is Earl.\nHot on the heels of Earl is Joy, our 3rd Croachling pose. This cockroach gal is ready to join the swarm --and your rewards--if we reach $11,500. She will then be added to all pledges of $80+ as a FREE REWARD, and be available to buy as an Add-On for $5.\nRounding out the croachlings is the fearsome Croach Commander! This boss monster towers over his minions, standing over 30% taller. If we reach $12,000, there will be two ways for all backers to get him. The first is as an a $7 Add-On, easy-peasy. The second is as part of the CROACHLING ENCOUNTER PACK, which also unlocks at the same time.\nThe Croachling Encounter Pack is a pile of croachlings --everything a gm needs to run a challenging encounter. For $28 Add-On, it includes 6 croachlings (2 of each pose) and the Croach Commander. Got a big group? Super-Size it --add 3 more croachlings for just $40 total.\nThe Platco(TM) Security Bot version 1 is one of Platco's most popular models. Highly customizable, it features numerous hard-points to which different gear can easily be attached for different tasks, and is an ideal combination of durability and affordability.  This model, the 1-A, is fitted for Crowd Management, and features high-decibel speakers, flashing light, and easy-to read 'Emoji Screen' that clearly conveys the robot's current operating parameters. When you think Security, think Platco(TM)!\nAt $13,000, the Platco Security Bot can be yours for the low low price of a $7 Add-On. Of course, if you pledge $80 or more, it will be yours for the super-low low price of FREE!\nAt $14k, we unlock a HUGE Add-On --the Yvox! He's a multi-piece model kit, featuring a resin body and pewter wings, legs, tail and face bits. \nD&D has the Bullette, Gamma World Has the Sep, and Kevin Bacon had the Graboids. Now, at $16,000, we welcome to MCC...the UNDER-BITER! I'm really excited about this one: a mutated shark that telekinetically burrows through earth and even concrete to attack unsuspecting PCs anywhere! When we reach this stretch goal, all backers who have pledged $80 or more will get this cool medium-sized (on a 1\" base) Under-Biter for FREE! All backers can also order as many as they like as an $8 Add-On. \nHey! What's this?? Even more stuff unlocks at $16k! Medium land-sharks are cool, but no one is REALLY afraid of a shark unless it is bigger than they are. Enter these 2 ginormous Add-Ons. These large-sized Giant-Underbiters each sit on a 2-inch base, and definitely look like they could swallow a PC whole!\nMORE TO COME\u2026.!!!\nShipping\nShipping is complicated, and I\u2019ve seen way too many Kickstarters get in trouble by not charging enough for it, over-charging for it, communicating it badly, etc. I\u2019m gonna try to make it as simple and painless as possible, therefore.\nShipping will be extra\u2014it is not included with the pledge amounts (all that would really mean is jacking up the pledge values enough so that I think I\u2019ll have enough to cover it). When your order is put together and ready to ship, we will send you an email with the shipping cost, with a link to pay by Paypal. \nIf you would like an estimate on shipping, the weight chart below shows the expected shipping weights of some of the pledge levels at this time (this may change if we unlock a lot of stretch goals\u2026I will try to update these numbers as I am able). You can use the USPS Shipping Calculator to get an idea of the shipment cost from our shipping location (Michigan, ZIP 48183) to your location. Think of this as a ball-park number\u2026I may have to add a bit for packaging material and labor (probably about a dollar) Optionally, you can feel free to message us with your expected pledge and location, and we can provide you with a personalized estimate.\nShipping will be by USPS First Class Package delivery or Priority Mail, whichever is more economical. International orders are welcome, and delivery will be by First Class International Package or Priority Mail International, whichever is more economical.\nWe will be prioritizing keeping shipping costs down in our packaging over \u2018Out-of-Box Experience\u2019. If we can fit all the figures safely in a Small Flat Rate box, we\u2019d rather do that than put everything in a great big box that has individual little pretty boxes for all the figures.\nI know paying for the shipping separately can be a bit of a hassle, but I think it\u2019s the best way to make sure you get your rewards and pay the absolute least amount possible.\nSHIPPING WEIGHTS BY PLEDGE*\n   *Estimates only\u2026actual weight may vary according to Add-Ons and figures selected, and by Stretch Goals included. \nDelivery Times\n20-odd production molds, a pile of casting, and lots of packing and shipping\u2026I estimate I\u2019ll have about a solid month\u2019s worth of work to do to conclude this project, maybe a bit more. Just to give myself some wiggle room, I\u2019m setting the estimated delivery as 4 months from the end of the Kickstarter. I will post weekly updates to keep everyone informed of progress, or any impediments to progress that may arise. \nWho is Dark-Platypus?\nAndrew Barlow\nDark-Platypus Studio is mostly and mainly me, Andrew Barlow. I\u2019m an illustrator, sculptor, game designer, writer, all around creative guy. I\u2019ve been running Dark-Platypus for over a decade now (I lose track of the years), making gaming tokens, life counters, miniatures and artwork. I make molds and do casting for a variety of small game companies, including Microworld, Hydra Miniatures, Firelock Games and others.\nErica Barlow\nMy lovely wife Erica helps out tons around here. She\u2019s a veteran gamer who writes and runs fantastic adventures, she has just as much gaming experience as I do, but unlike me, can also remember stuff, which I think makes her experience actually count a lot more. She also knows her way around a paint brush, and painted most of the pieces photographed here, with only minor touch-ups added by myself.\nAndrew Oswell\nA great friend and a great DM, Andrew is on board to help facilitate all the various logistics involved in running the Kickstarter. Actually born a gamer, I think, Andrew has superior skills in a lot of useful areas. He\u2019s an excellent writer, great at logistics and management, knows tons about game rules (and how to abuse them) and is a master dm. Also, he thinks he\u2019s Batman (he\u2019s not\u2026I\u2019M BATMAN, but we let him dream). You may see Andrew pop up in the comments as he helps me stay communicative here\u2026for future reference and to avoid confusion, HE is Andrew, while I am Andy (that\u2019s how we do it in our own gaming group, and it works pretty well).\nGerald Gentry, Chris Klann\nMy flunky/friends who I have been training in aspects of my work. They can at least usually manage to pour metal without burning themselves. Both work as Security Guards in real life, and are gamers whenever they aren\u2019t doing that. Gerry has vast knowledge of all classic rock and musicians in general, and is a fantastic resource in any trivia challenge. Chris has encyclopedic knowledge of all things Dinosaur and all things Pokemon, which comes in useful\u2026whenever that kind of knowledge is required.\nF.A.Q.\nThis will be added to as people begin to Ask some Questions Frequently.\nCan you do a Painted Set pledge level?\nSadly, neither Erica nor I will have time to paint sets of figures for rewards. The only way we could make this work is by hiring a painting service to do it, and then adding the cost of the service into the pledge amount. We\u2019d be making no money from that (unless we marked it up), so it wouldn\u2019t be helping the project to move forward. I recommend contacting a painting service directly. If you like, you can contact me before shipping and I will drop-ship your rewards to the painting service of your choice for you.\nMutant Crawl Classics and MCC RPG are trademarks of Goodman Games.

Whether you are a casual fan or a rabid one, we've got you covered. \nI loved Lovecraft even before I knew his name. His lore permeated every inch of my childhood. I didn't know, for instance, that H. P. Lovecraft was the mind behind the Necronomicon when I watched Evil Dead. I didn't know he was the grandfather of psychological horror as I binged In the Mouth of Madness, Jacob's Ladder, Aliens, and dozens of other terrifying movies in my youth. \nI didn't even know Lovecraft created Cthulhu until well after I called the Great Old One's name. However, the older I got, the more I grew to appreciate the warped mind behind some of my all-time favorite things, and I wanted to create something that could show that love, with people who loved Lovecraft as much as I did, for people who loved Lovecraft as much as me.\nAnd Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is the result of that process.\nAfter the success of my first anthology, Monsters and Other Scary S^&t, I asked my fans, and fans of the book, what we should cover next, and they told me Lovecraft. \nImmediately, I was like \"YESSSSS!!!!\" \nMonsters and Other Scary S^&t was all about how monsters can represent anything from cute to scary and everything in between, and Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is just like that, but with Lovecraft. It's 35 stories that show just how deeply Lovecraft has permeated the  essence of our culture. \nWhen I create a book, the first thing I sit down to figure out is how my book can be different from everything else on the market. After all, there are HUNDREDS of Lovecraft anthologies out there, both from Lovecraft himself and from loads of authors who have carried the torch for him in the last century. \nAdditionally, there are tons of stories told from a Lovecraftian horror point of view, dealing with the creepy, unsettling nature of humanity. I didn't think we could compete with those, nor did I want to, either. \nThere is one thing I love, though, that I haven't seen a lot previously...a book devoted to the mythology of Lovecraft's universe. \nYou see, I've always been fascinated by the gods and monsters of Lovecraft, and I never seemed to get enough of them in the stories I read. Most Lovecraft stories are filled with the horror aspect of Lovecraft, but low on the mythology. \nBut my favorite part of Lovecraft is the mythology he crafted, the gods he made, and the way that mythology differed from the myths of every other mythology out there. So that's what I set out to create.\nCthulhu is Hard to Spell is a book steeped in the mythology and gods of Lovecraft. The stories inside it's pages follow the spirit of Lovecraft, but often strays from the tone of Lovecraftian horror. \nSure, some of the stories in this book are Lovecraftian in nature down to their very core, but there are also funny stories, cute stories, fantasy stories, sci-fi stories, and much, much more which build on the Lovecraftian mythos. \nIf you love the gods and monsters of Lovecraft, then Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is going to be your jam. \nBest of all, this anthology is ALL AGES APPROPRIATE. These aren't stories made for children necessarily, at least not all of them, but we toned down the cursing (there is none), the violence (there is no blood), and there was never any sex, to make sure you could show it to your child, even if they won't understand it all. \nI've had conversations with many people at shows asking for a book to indoctrinate their children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins, etc, into loving creepy things, and I think this book is a great primer for that, while being enjoyable to people who already love the creepy, too. \nWe listened to you from the last anthology, and made sure this was: \n-Appropriate for all ages (even though we deal with some very dark topics) \n-Full color\n-Shorter stories (2, 4, 6, or 8 pages) \n-All stories are even numbers, so they begin and end on the same page throughout. \nWe used your feedback to make this anthology even better! You opinions are very important to us, and we appreciate them very much. \nBackers really loved our first anthology\nThe real reason we're doing a second anthology is because Kickstarter backers and fans loved our first anthology so much. I was hesitant to do a second anthology before the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t campaign launched. \nHowever, the response from backers was so positive that I gladly decided to go into the fray a second time. There is nothing like geeking out about something with creators and fans, and that is what our anthologies allow us to do.\nCheck out the reaction to our last anthology. We hope this anthology has an even better reaction! \nWe brought back a bunch of creators from the first book and added a ton of new faces so we can make this book even more amazing! \nWhy do the other creators love Lovecraft so much? \nWe all have our reasons for loving Lovecraft, so listen to some of our creators talk about why they got involved in the project. \nWho am I? \n My name is Russell Nohelty, publisher of Wannabe Press, a small press that creates weird books for weird people, creator of Katrina Hates Dead S%&t, Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter, and Pixie Dust, along with the editor of both the Monsters and other Scary S^&t, and this anthology.  \nI have raised over $70,000 on Kickstarter from 7 different projects, and have gotten exceedingly good at crafting amazing books which audiences love. My previous two projects, Monsters and Other Scary S^&t and Pixie Dust, both raised north of $25,000 from over 600 backers each. \nI have a simple motto when it comes to Kickstarter. I outlay all the money to get the book print ready, and then I bring it to my audience and ask if they would rather have a cheaply made paperback edition, or a beautiful hard cover edition. \nSee, I can go hit enable distribution on a soft cover edition right now, but luckily Kickstarter backers have again and again wanted the hardcover edition, printed in the most beautiful way possible.\nWhat are some of the stories in this book? \nNora (art and words by Angela Oddling) -- a dejected teenager living in an ice village sets out to find Aphoom-Zhah and thaw his cold heart. \nThe Dunwich Boys (art by Esther Pimentel, words by Eddy Hedington, letters by Nikki Powers) -- Yog-Sothoth has materialized in a house in Dunwich, and the Dunwich boys have to banish it from their neighborhood. \nThe Eternal War (art and words by Eric Young) -- A retelling of the origin story of Lovecraft's universe, translated from the Voynich manuscript. \nCat is Cryptic (art and words by Megan Hutchison) -- a retelling of the Cats of Ulthar, one of Lovecraft's most beloved stories. \nTsathoggua's Triumph (art by John Edingfield II, words by Clay Adams) -- Tsathoggua dreams of his eventual conquest of the universe. \nCleaning the Mess (story and art by Brandon Perlow, words by Paul J. Mendoza, Letters by Wilson Ramos, Jr.) -- Cthulhu has conquered another world, but all he really wants is his master to come find him. \nSong for the Harbinger (art by Brianna Gilmartin, words by Heather Kenealy) -- Ghroth doesn't understand why nobody likes his singing, all he wants to do is harmonize with planets, and they keep blowing up. \nThe Yag-Kosha Mystery (art and words by Kelly Dochy) -- Yag-Kosha, the pacifist alien, has a mysterious koan for you. \nMons (art and words by Matthew Childers) --Explorers on Mars find an ancient tome that could unlock the secrets of the universe, or unleash a Lovecraftian horror. \nThe Summoning of Brkthruslpk (art by Robin Dassen, words by Don Perkins) -- A group of kids works to summon the ancient god Brkthruslpk onto the world. \nNo DQ (art and words by Ryan Fisher) -- A weak, sickly wrestling fan gets to live out his fantasy of being a star after a mysterious stranger endowing him with an enchanted garment. \nSlumber (art by Lloyd Ladera, words by Sarah Anderson) -- After being woken up on a spaceship, a man has to escape the Lovecraftian horror chasing him. \nThat's Cthulhu to You (art by Zac Skellington, words by Leo Baxter Kiker) -- An oddities store gets a new pet: Cthulhu. \nHow to Summon the Dark Lord Hastur (Art by Cara Stemo, words by Johnny C, letters by Travis Duda, logo design by Nathan Burns) -- A card game, a tragic birth, a goverment experiment, and a violent crime all converge to release a deadly horror on the world. \nChurch of Mormo (art by Claire Leslie, words by N.S. Kane) -- Greek spirit Mormo goes door to door trying to recruit Cthulhu worshipers to her cause. \nShe Came Upon a Great Tree (art by Nick Kremenek, words by Mike Speakman, edited by Greg Smith) -- A delivery driver and part-time cultist must find a great tree to unleash Cthulhu and Hastur onto the world. \nFlycatcher (art by Dan Scalisi, words by Frank Martin) -- Even though they have been warned for years, the fly people of Dipterra are not prepared for the wrath of Yba'sokug. \nThe Rally (art and words by Mary Bellamy) -- Lucifer needs new generals, and has decided to recruit Lovecraftian gods to his cause. \nWhy is this book going to be so awesome? \n1. It's 176 pages of glorious comics! - That's a massive amount of awesome comics about monsters! Over 150 pages and 35 stories!\n2. It's gonna be in hardcover! - There are lots of comics, but how many are printed in hardcover? Not many! \n3. All the UV spotting! There's gonna be spot UV all over the cover. I love spot UV and I've gotten exceedingly good at using it over the years. There might even be a little surprise if we can blow past our regular goal on that front. \n4. Glossy art paper - Most books are printed in gloss lamination, trapping all the glorious line work under an ugly, gross, yellow film. This anthology is different. It's printed on glossy art paper, which means the ink shines on top of the paper and looks like it's simmering, just like the any other art book on the market today. After all, we believe that comics are beautiful works of art and should be printed as such. \n5. Our creators have credits from all your favorites companies. Our creators have worked with Marvel, DC, Oni, Tokyopop, Heavy Metal, Fantagraphics, Upper Deck, Sony, and more along with brands like Teen Titans, My Little Pony, Invader Zim, Ghostbusters, Horizon Zero Dawn, and more. We have creators who have been nominated for Eisners, won Glyphs, Silver Eagles, WGA awards, and more! \n6. There are just so many many Lovecraftian gods and monsters. There was only one rule in this anthology; all of the stories needed to contain at least one Lovecraftian god or monster. This book is full of different types gods you know like Cthulhu and Azathoth, and ones you've never heard of as well! \nAnd you can get the whole book, including shipping, plus a pdf copy AND audio commentary for just $40, INCLUDING SHIPPING (in the US, at least)! \nWho drew that dope cover? \n It was drawn by Aaron Alexovich, creator of my favorite indie comic of all time, Serenity Rose, a 500+ page graphic novel about a previously famous witch trying to come to terms with her powers in a very weird town. Read it. Buy it. Love it.   \nIf you've never read that book, you probably know him from his work on Invader Zim, both the television show and more recently on the comic book. \nAaron is a powerhouse in the world of indie books, and Zim is one of my favorite animated shows of all time. He also drew the cover for the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t anthology. I really wanted him to come back for this anthology too, and I was so stoked when he said yes!  \nOn top of it all, Aaron might be one of the few people on earth that loves Lovecraft, especially Cthulhu, even more than me, which I once didn't think possible.\nDid Dirk Manning really write the foreword? \nYes, Dirk Manning, an icon of Lovecraftian horror comics on Kickstarter, wrote the foreword for Cthulhu is Hard to Spell. He didn't have time to contribute, but he asked me if he could do the foreword, and I of course said yes. \nDirk has raised a ton of money for Nightmare World, Tales of Mr. Rhee, and more on Kickstarter, and that he wanted to contribute to this book means the world to me. \nHere is a snippet of what he wrote, which made me smile. \nFor now, take the time to enjoy this book.\nWhile it\u2019s (another) unspoken truth that anthologies are often a hit-and-miss prospect, I can honestly say that there wasn\u2019t a story in this collection that I didn\u2019t enjoy... which shouldn\u2019t be surprising since it\u2019s a reminder that just like you\u2019re not alone in what you know and feel, these stories reminded me I\u2019m not alone either.\nI was honored when I read those words. So yes, file under: Dirk Approved. \nWhat are some other stories in the book? \nAshes to Ashes (art by Laura Neubert, words by Virginia Drohan) --  Quachil Uttaus learns what it means to be human.     \nOne Last Chance (art by Ben Herrera, words by K.J. Kaminski, colors by Emmanuel Torres) -- Humanity has one last chance to save the universe as they fight against the forces of Zathog on the planet Zarr. \nA 10,000 Year Curse (art by Dave Lentz, words by Dave Lentz and Ryan Kroboth, Inks by Rob Simmons, Colors by Ryan Kroboth) -- Even the old gods needs a night off, but it's often impossible to find a reliable babysitter, even for them. \nThe Call of Stone (art and words by Shannon Kirkwood) -- After a woman dies, she finds her true purpose in protecting the Star Mother. \nLove Story (art and words by Christie Shinn) -- A love story about Mnomquah and Oorn's eternal love. \nBasatan vs. Satan (art by Lady Beaver, Words by Steve Waldinger, letters by T. Perran Mitchell) -- Basatan returns to the surface to take his rightful place as ruler of Earth, but Satan has other plans.\nThe Art of Losing (art and words by Nathan Leuth) -- After her family dies and the Apocalypse comes, a young woman finds strength in music. \nSunset at Sarnath (art by Wesley Wong, words by Wesley Sun) -- An old man, a young girl, and a pig discuss who was responsible for the end of the world. \nThe Marriage Counselor (art by Melissa J Massey, words by Madeleine Holly-Rosing) -- Mnomquah and Oorn go to marriage counseling, because even the best marriages fall apart sometimes. \nWhere is the money going? \nGreat question. Here is a pie chart of the distribution of the funds. This is subject to fluctuation based on pledges, but should be a good guide. \nBook production and printing - $9,000 (41.5%)\nShipping - $6,000 (27.7%)\nPins - $334 (1.5%)\nKickstarter fees - $2,166 (10%)\nCreator residuals - $2,166 (10%)\nEmergency - $2,000 (9.3%)\nYou may ask why I have such a high emergency fund, and I would respond that it is why I have been able to successfully deliver 7 campaigns, because stuff always goes wrong, and sometimes in a big way. \nWhat can you get for your pledge? \nI am not the kind of creator who offers a ton of different rewards, but I do want to offer some awesome ones. Here's what you can get for your money. \nBefore I move on, I want to point out a couple of our coolest rewards. First, I want to thank Andrew Pawley for making this awesome paper doll, which EVERYBODY who pledges even for $1 will receive! \nYou have to build it yourself, but it looks just so awesome when it's set up.\nSecond, for the first time ever, I am doing an exclusive PIN designed by Aaron Alexovich specifically for this campaign. I have this pin in hand already, and it is AMAZING. \nAlso, we'll be offering our variant white eye addition of the Monster anthology, instead of the normal yellow eye edition. I only had a couple hundred of these white eye variant Soulless eye editions made, and they are almost gone! \nThe Crush it on Kickstarter course is my introductory course about how to run a Kickstarter campaign. It will show new creators (or ones who want to up their game), how to create, launch, fund, and distribute their campaigns. As a person who has run eight campaigns and successfully filled all but this one (only because it's currently running) without going over budget, and having raised almost $100,000 on Kickstarter, I know a thing or two about this stuff. \nMore importantly, I am a seasoned course creator through my website, The Complete Creative. If you would like to see the course, you can do so by clicking here. \nMy How to Make an Awesome Comics Anthology course is one I made specifically for this Kickstarter. After my previous anthology campaign, people asked me a ton of questions about how to make a comics anthology, but I was too overwhelmed to answer them. This time, I wanted to be prepared, so I laid out my exact strategy for making an awesome comics anthology. \nI'm very proud of this course and think that whether you are a seasoned pro at anthologies or just starting out, you can learn a ton from this course. I take you all the way from finding your theme through running your Kickstarter campaign. \nPlus, if you buy this course you ALSO get my Crush it On Kickstarter course absolutely free. You can check out the course by clicking here.\nWho are the rest of the creators? \nThe Eyes of Yba'Sokug (art by Jonathan Howard, words by Michael R. Martin) -- a poem about the end of the world, which feels eerily relevant in our current times. \nThe Believer (art by Claudio Sanchez Viveros, words by Christian Douglas) -- A Nyarlathotep cultist pontificates over the horribleness of man as he speaks to his daughter. \nRise (art and words by Bradley Sheridan) -- Hastur is frustrated that his minions cannot overtake a town run by a godzilla monster. \nThe Calling (art by Katrina Kunstmann, words by Caleb Thusat) -- An adventurer fights his way through a dungeon in order to take on a Lovecraftian god. \nThe Last Convention (art by Lea Seidman, words by Anne Toole) -- The world is over, and everyone has to choose how they are going to die by going to the last convention and being pitched by different cultists or the various Lovecraft gods. \nThe Crossroads (art by Silvio DB, words by Terrance Grace) -- Lovecraft writes a letter to his ex-wife as he slowly goes mad. \nThe MC (art by Nic Touris, words by Jack Holder, letters by Micah Myers) -- An agent to Lovecraftian gods has to deal with his unruly clients as he tries to get them work. \nAzathoth's Slumber (art by Erik Lervold, words by Russell Nohelty, additional colors by Vlaire Donaghue) -- The outer gods have been playing music to keep Azathoth asleep for millions of years and they are sick of it. \nSneak preview of one of the stories! \nTake a look at one of the stories from the book! This is a story that I created and wrote with my good friend Erik Lervold. We are reprising our team-up from the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t anthology! \nDid you dig it? If you did, then it's time to pledge. \nStill on the fence? No worries. Click here to get a 50+ page preview. \nI hope you believe this is going to be an amazing anthology. If so, pledge to the campaign and make this happen! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I have been able to deliver seven projects, there have been complications with some. I feel as though I have fixed all of those issues at this point with my supply chain, but there are always some more that pop up. \n\nFor instance, with the monster anthology, we had to wait an additional 3 months for the glow-in-the-dark eyes to be applied correctly, and fix errors in the covers. \n\nWith Katrina, we had to wait 8 more weeks in port due to customs than we wanted, delaying our release from July until September. \n\nThese things can and do happen, and I can't say they won't happen again. However, I have done everything possible to ensure that we will have a smooth operation and these books will be in your hand as soon as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Paper toy!", "descp": "Get a downloadable Cthulhu paper toy designed by Andrew Pawley from Galaxafreaks and Cthulhu Kids!\nINCLUDES:\nPaper toy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Lovecraft", "descp": "Get a digital copy of the anthology in .pdf and .cbz form!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["348 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Audio Commentary", "descp": "Get audio commentary of my thought process about each story, why I placed it in the book, and fun stories about the book's creation.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy\nAudio Commentary", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Hardcover edition of the book!", "descp": "**NO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SHIPPING CHARGES!**\nGet a physical copy of the book in all its hardcover glory!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy\nHardcover copy of the book\nAudio Commentary", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["358 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Special Thanks", "descp": "**NO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SHIPPING CHARGES!**\nSpecial thanks in the book!

Please back us!\nThe Al Rio Tribute Art Book Volume Three!\nThis book covers art from the year 2008.\nThis is Terry Maltos. I was Al Rio's business partner and friend for 10 years. He died unexpectedly in 2012 and left us with hundreds of amazing pieces of fantasy art, character art, model sheets, commissions, comic book cover art and sexy pinups to enjoy, appreciate and learn from.\nThis Kickstarter campaign is to raise money to publish Volume Three in a series of books I'm producing to make a historical record of Al Rio's incredible artwork.\nVolume One covered the years 2003 - 2005\nthen...\nVolume 2 covered the years 2006 - 2007\nNow?\nThere's enough artwork, so 2008 will get a book of it's own!\n\u00c1lvaro Ara\u00fajo Louren\u00e7o do Rio \"Al Rio\" was born May 19, 1962, and died January 31, 2012. Volume One of this series contains a nice Biography written by Jerry Whitworth. He was a great man with a beautiful family. \nHe worked with many publishers on many different titles and publishers including Marvel, DC, Wildstorm, Image, Dark Horse, Chaos Comics, Zenescope, and Crossgen.\n\nThis is a REAL BOOK you can hold in your hands! \nHardcover - 80 pages.

It's mostly the shipping and cost of production. Last time, these books were over 3 pounds with packaging and sometimes International orders cost more to ship than the book itself! Since Kickstarter counts the amount collected for shipping in the total, the amount we need to raise is much more (this is a mistake I made in the past which cost me lots of $$).\nAlso, these are amazing full-color, hardcover books. If you participated in my previous Kickstarters you know the books are high quality! Plus the Kickstarter fees, the PayPal fees, design by the incredible Mark McNabb, promotion, packing/shipping materials, taxes, bonus goodies and official licensing from Al Rio's family, who was kind enough to let me make this book to help document Al Rio's life's work.\nPayment Note! If you can't pay through Kickstarter - pre-pay me directly with PayPal, Venmo or however you're used to paying. Send me a message here, on Facebook or email terry at alrioart.com\nI set the DELIVERY DATE to DECEMBER 2018.

They own a gentleman's club called \"Naughty Faeries\", where they work undercover as hired assassins, honing their skills in preparation to take down a demon warlord, who is looking to destroy all the purity and innocence in the universe, through both time and space.\nA Grimdark Fantasy where the assassins are the antihero, or are they?\nIt is for mature audiences.

He has struggled with his powers since a battle with Balor, a demon god, responsible for his parents death. Liam was left severely wounded with damaged wings. His confidence and powers have suffered ever since. He is able to control and manipulate time,as well as control protective powers. He no longer is able to fly, however his wings still maintain his regenerative powers.\nLiam Brigde\nAislynn Brigde is the youngest of the family. She is sassy, smart and not afraid to speak her mind. She is rebellious and fearless with a fierce determination for revenge. She has not been able to master her powers. Although her wings are huge, she is unable to fly. However, she is able to change all matter through a partial vapor spell. Her wings have the ability to change colors with her moods and emotions, often leaving her frustrated because everyone knows whats she's feeling and she can't hide it.\nAislynn Brigde\nLittle one is the pint sized baby dragon, who is in training under Maeven. Working besides Maeven, he is learning how to use his powers of teleportation and flight.

It pays for the artists, printers, stretch goals, shipping materials/shipping, as well as taxes and fees. Kickstarter allows Comic Art Groupie to get books directly into your hands without having to hunt for them. They get directly shipped to the backer with potential goodies (by exceeding the funding goal - through stretch goals), not being offered any place else except to you the backer. This platform allows creators to thank you, the backer, for your support. It is a great way to get what you want, directly from the independent publisher and creators. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe project is already created. The book is drawn and lettered. A few covers are being finished up at the start of the Kickstarter but will be completed by the time the Kickstarter ends. It is ready to go to the printer as soon as it is funded, reducing waiting time for backers. After backing many projects, I have learned that it is important to have everything done and ready before the launch. \n\nAll the rewards have been created and the artwork is uploaded. The goal is 2 weeks after the project is funded, and the money is transferred, the project is sent to the printers. Within 6 weeks, the books and rewards will be shipped. \n\nIf unforeseen issues arise, you, the backers will be the first notified. Without you, this project could not be successful. My intention is to make this Kickstarter run as smooth as possible, and get this amazing story into your hands as soon as possible.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to message me via the comments or contact me link at the top of the page.\nThank you\nWendy\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THANKS for your support", "descp": "Thank you for your support.

Now, we're back with a new book!\nFemale Action Poses - No Boys Allowed!\n300 pages of brand-new, dynamic female action poses by Raul Moreno. Over 1600 rough images and 400 finals will make this book the most complete study of dynamic female action poses ever!\nThe book will be divided into 6 sections:\n1. Hero Poses - 70% of the book! Heroic poses that strike fear into the hearts of enemies!\n2. Sitting/Crouching Poses - If you have trouble drawing foreshortened legs and over-lapping limbs this section is for you!\n3. Flying/Jumping Poses - Raul draws almost every conceivable flying pose/angle you could ever want to draw.\n4. Dynamic Standing Poses - Poses that express action, attitude, swagger and emotion.\n5. Contortion - a small section dedicated to the study of the female body's maximum range of motion. This section will help you learn just how far the human body can realistically bend and twist before it breaks!\n6. Body Types - another small section showing various female body types other than young athletic bodies.\nReady to Use Roughs!\nAll 1600 rough images have been designed from the ground up to be used as a foundation for final images. There are no \"awkward\" or \"useless\" rough poses - every rough you see in the book will be good enough to build into an awesome final image!\neBook Reward\nThere is only 1 eBook reward - all 4 books will be shipped to your home via USB stick. eBooks are DRM-free and can be used on any device (desktop or mobile).\nALL EBOOKS MUST BE SHIPPED TO A PHYSICAL ADDRESS.\nThere are no download links. eBooks are only available within Canada, US, Europe, UK, Australia and New Zealand.

They talk about the process, tips, tricks and art in general.\nReal World Assignments\nWe challenge our artists with assignments that reflect their real world workloads. Our videos focus on large projects like animated feature films or graphic novels. We want to provide you with something close to \u201con the job training\u201d. The images below were designed by Dane Romley for an animated series titled \"The Invincible Sherlock & Watson\". The entire cast took months to get \"right\". That's the kind of quality that goes into our videos!\n Good Isn't Good Enough!\nWhen our artists give us good designs - we push them to make them great! Take a look at the Dane Romley\u2019s design below for Moriary. His beautiful crocodile design in tailored white suit is great took a great deal of effort to get right. But, even with all the hard work and many revisions, we still felt it was too tame. We pushed Dane to reach deep inside his brain to create something more sinister, more evil and more importantly, more unique.\n   Express Yourself!\nEach one of the Design & Expressions tutorials covers the drawing of over 20 facial expressions. Five facial expressions are drawn for each of the 4 main characters!\n We Focus On Exploration!\nCreating fresh designs is hard work - a lot of sketching and dooling goes into the process before even a rough design is created. Sadly most tutorials today skip over this crucial part - all the messy work is done off-camera, before filming, so that the video looks clean, polished and easy to follow. Unfortuantely, this method discourages students who can\u2019t replicate the results in the video as flawlessly. Gone are all the mistakes, dead-ends and redoes that lead up to the first rough draft. The problem is that these early doodles and sketches are the most creative part of the process. Our videos focus on the most creative parts of the process - so you can watch and learn the most important part!\nTo ensure you\u2019re seeing the most creative part of the process we make the artists do all their sketching and doodling on video. Whenever the artist is drawing a new design you can see sure that absolutely no sketching was done off-screen. Take a look at some of the exploration Oscar J. Vargas did on his title character Edward Crow for his tutorial - an animated television show \u201cThe Crow\u2019s Nest\u201d.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe expect Female Action Poses to be completed and shipping by July 2018 with ebooks going out the same month.

I am most notably known for my work in illustration having done a string of classic computer game covers in the 1980's and 90's. You may have seen some of the covers I painted which included Might and Magic Clouds of Xeen and Darkside of Xeen and interior maps, Wing Commander, Solstice, WolfChild and Power Blade to name a few.\nRecently, my work recieved worldwide attention after I self published my book Classic Game Covers about my experiences being an artist. It is a honest and humorous read about the creative process and history behind the cover art I painted. I made the ebook available for free and the response it got was overwhelming. It was written up on websites all over the world and read in over eighty countries.\nMight and Magic, Wing Commander covers\nHere are a few of the responses my ebook received.\n\"Mike Winterbauer is the artist behind some of the most fondly remembered retro box art from gaming's golden age, including covers for classic titles such as Might & Magic, Wing Commander and Spaceward Ho!. Okay, maybe that last one doesn't count. If you ever wanted to know the process behind those classic video game covers, you can download a free .pdf from Winterbauer's website in which the man himself tells us how he did it\nMostly, it involved lots of heroic posing in his underwear. Winterbauer couldn't afford to hire models, so he had to get his friends to photograph him in the pose he wanted to draw. Enough childish giggling, though, the fact is that his work rate, particularly in the early 1990's, was astonishing.\"\nhttp://www.gamewatcher.com/news/2014-21-07-find-out-how-classic-video-game-box-art-was-created\nLand of Xeen map\n\"Veteran game artist Mike Winterbauer is a crazy person.

It was written up on websites all over the world and read in over eighty countries.\nMight and Magic, Wing Commander covers\nHere are a few of the responses my ebook recieved.\n\"Mike Winterbauer is the artist behind some of the most fondly remembered retro box art from gaming's golden age, including covers for classic titles such as Might & Magic, Wing Commander and Spaceward Ho!. Okay, maybe that last one doesn't count. If you ever wanted to know the process behind those classic video game covers, you can download a free .pdf from Winterbauer's website in which the man himself tells us how he did it\nMostly, it involved lots of heroic posing in his underwear. Winterbauer couldn't afford to hire models, so he had to get his friends to photograph him in the pose he wanted to draw. Enough childish giggling, though, the fact is that his work rate, particularly in the early 1990's, was astonishing.\"\nhttp://www.gamewatcher.com/news/2014-21-07-find-out-how-classic-video-game-box-art-was-created\nLand of Xeen map\n\"Veteran game artist Mike Winterbauer is a crazy person. He\u2019s written a book showcasing (and telling the story behind) some classic examples of PC and console cover art, and instead of charging a premium for it, is giving it away for free.\nOK, so it\u2019s not exactly to the design standard we expect from publishers like Titan (he published it himself), but the art and processes we get to see here are just the best.\"\nhttp://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/07/how-awesome-old-box-art-was-made/\nWolfchild, Power Blade and Solstice covers\n\"Artist Michael Winterbauer has self-published a free book with stories about his life in the game cover art business.....You can download the complete \"Confessions of an Art Junkie\" here (90 megabyte PDF).

The incredible details throughout this architectural masterpiece secured St. Mark\u2019s as a symbol of the Republic of Venice\u2019s wealth and power. We have based the inspiration of our newly introduced Venice series of timepieces on this illustrious Basilica. \nA masterwork of urban planning, the Piazza del Campidoglio reshaped the Capitoline Hill of Rome into a monumental civic plaza. Designed by Renaissance artist Michelangelo, the sacred ancient site organized Roman government buildings into a dynamic piazza. The bold geometric rosette which unifies the inspiring landscape of the elliptical courtyard captivated us, as evidenced in the compelling design of the dial pattern for our new Rome series of timepieces.\n  Designed in 1861 and built by Giuseppe Mengoni, the soaring Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is Milan\u2019s glorious edifice to bravura architecture. One of the oldest shopping malls in the world, this impressive architectural wonder was affectionately dubbed, \u201cIl Salotto di Milano\u201d \u2013 the living room of Milan.

The iconic online community is growing fast and now comprises more than 125,000 highly active fantasy art fans.\nFollowing a popular request from the community, over the past months our team has set itself the herculean task of securing the participation of 43 world renowned fantasy art illustrators. We are passionate about their art and just can\u2019t get enough!\n\u2018Visions of a Thousand Eyes\u2019 will include exclusive insights about each artist\u2019s background, inspirations and advices.

This means you will have an art print that no one else will be able to get :-)\n A Little Background Info\nJeff Miracola has been working in the fantasy art industry for more than 23 years, most notably on Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: the Gathering. A few years ago, he and his videographer wife created a YouTube channel to share videos of his drawing and painting techniques. The channel has since grown to nearly 30,000 subscribers and more than 1.3 million views.  The short videos on his channel have proven popular, but Jeff and Silvia sensed a growing thirst for more in-depth instruction. So, in 2015, they created a Kickstarter for the creation of Jeff Miracola's Fantasy Art Workshop Acrylic Painting Techniques Video. Our wonderful backers turned out and made it a great success.\nAnd now it's time to do it again - this time for the creation of an Oil Painting DVD/Digital Download.\nJeff's first set of serious paints were oil paints, which he purchased as a high school sophomore. He's since been painting in oils: decades of experimenting, making mistakes (and learning from them), and perfecting his oil painting techniques. With this new Oil Painting DVD, he will finally be able to share all of his knowledge with you.\nWe hope you will consider backing this project. Thank you!\nJust a few of the many videos found on Jeff's YouTube channel:\n   VERY IMPORTANT: Jeff has not yet created the artwork that will be featured in this oil painting techniques video. The oil painting you see on the DVD mockup above (Tiger warrior) is only used to show you an example of what the packaging will look like. This is not the final image. \nOur planned delivery date for this Oil Painting DVD and all other rewards is April 2017.\nThe content of this video will benefit beginners to professionals at any stage of their careers. Our goal is to not only give you the most detailed look at Jeff's oil painting process but also to answer your many questions about creating an oil painting from start to finish. Jeff will focus heavily on creating a professional fantasy painting for a paying client. This video won't just cover the \"how;\" it will also cover the \"why.\"\nHere are some of the topics and techniques that will be demonstrated in this video:\nBrainstorming/Conceptualization \nAnatomy (Creature and Human) \nUsing and Creating Reference Photos\nDrawing from the Imagination\nTools for Sketching (Types and Use)\nThumbnail Sketching\nComposition\nFinal Sketch\nColor Roughs\nColor Theory\nPainting Surfaces (Preparation, Materials, and Tools)\nTransferring the Final Drawing to its Painting Surface\nPlanning the Stages of Painting\nWork Area\nLighting\nPalettes (Types and Use)\nPaints (Types and Use)\nBrushes (Types and Use)\nKnives (Types and Use)\nEasels (types and Use)\nSolvents (Types and Use)\nOils (Types and Use)\nMediums (Types and Use)\nCreating a Colored Ground\nUnderpainting (Process and Purpose)\nGlazing and Scumbling\nWet-on-Wet or Alla Prima\nDry Brushing\nImpasto\nControlling Edges\nUnderstanding the Fat over Lean Rule\nWorking with a Limited Color Palette\nMixing and Blending Colors\nPainting Problematic Subjects (Glass, Metal, Skin Tones)\nPainting Effects (Splatters, Textures, etc.)\nCleaning Brushes and Other Tools\nVarnish (Types and Use)\nVarnishing The Final Painting\nGeneral Safety (Tools and Materials)\nThis Oil Painting video will be packed with a lot of information. It will follow the same format as the Acrylic Painting video we created last year, i.e., a 4-disc DVD set. The Main Feature will be split between the first two DVDs. The other two DVDs will contain Extras featuring more detailed information and demonstrations of any techniques not demonstrated in the Main Feature.\nTechnical Specs for the Oil Painting DVDs:\nNumber of Discs: 4\nFormat: NTSC\nLanguage: English\nRegions: All Regions\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nAge Range: 14 and up\nClosed Captioning: Yes\nTechnical Specs for the Oil Painting Digital Downloads:\nResolution: 1920x1080\nFormat: MP4\nLanguage: English\n  Let's be clear, this current Kickstarter campaign is not to raise money for an Acrylic Painting DVD. We already ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for the Acrylic Painting DVD last year. But for those of you who are just learning about our Fantasy Art Workshop series, here's your chance to get the Acrylic Painting Techniques DVD or Digital Download at lower than retail prices while also supporting and receiving the upcoming Oil Painting DVD.\nThis four-disc DVD set, with over 6.5 hours of content, gives you the most detailed look at Jeff Miracola\u2019s acrylic painting process and will answer your many questions about creating a fantasy art acrylic painting from start to finish. The focus of the video is on creating a professional fantasy painting.\nDiscs 1 and 2 contain the Main Feature (3hrs, 19mins), where Jeff takes you along as he creates a forest angel painting from the thumbnail sketch stage to the final painting.\nDiscs 3 and 4 (3hrs, 17mins) contain this Extras content:\n20 Questions with Jeff (Jeff answers many common and not-so common questions about acrylic painting techniques and more.)\nAdditional Acrylic Painting Techniques (Jeff shows various techniques that are not featured on disc one content.)\nStudio Walkthrough (Jeff gives you a tour of his painting studio.)\nBuilding an Art Portfolio (Jeff gives you advice on how to build your art portfolio.)\nPainting a Dragon Demo Video (Never before seen video of Jeff painting a dragon)\nColor Mixing Exercise\nOuttakes and Bloopers (You all know Jeff can never say his lines correctly the first time, but it\u2019s always fun seeing him try.)\nYou can view more information about the Acrylic Painting Techniques video, including a full chapter list, here.\n  Something Wicked Volume 2 will be a collection of six signed 5\"x7\" monstrously illustrated, full-color art prints in a folded portfolio by Jeff Miracola.\nRight now, Jeff has sketches completed for all six prints. The final art will be fully painted in oils. The original oil paintings are also available as rewards for you to own (See THE REWARDS section below).\nEvery backer of a physical reward will receive this portfolio for FREE. \"Digital Download Only\" backers will not receive the Something Wicked Volume 2 Portfolio.\nHere's a short one minute snippet of me working on one of the Something Wicked - Volume 2 oil paintings:\nPLAY\n\nThe Something Wicked Volume 1 portfolio is available as an Add-On in this campaign (See ADD-ONS section below).\n  Once our Kickstarter campaign reaches the following stretch goals, backers will be rewarded with FREE STUFF!\nThe Kickstarter campaign has reached it's stretch goal. That means that every backer will now receive a bonus video with additional oil painting demos or other videos I decide to create. It will be filled with all new content never before seen :-)\nPhysical reward backers will receive the bonus video content in the form of a DVD, as well as a hi-definition digital download.\nDigital Download Only backers will receive the bonus video in the form of a hi-definition digital download.\nIn addition to the Rewards, you can also increase your Pledge to purchase the following Add-ons.\nTo include Add-ons in your Pledge, simply select the Reward Level that you desire and then manually increase your Pledge by the cost of your selected Add-ons.

He's illustrated for properties such as Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft, Mars Attacks, Star Wars, Planescape, Earthdawn, Shadowrun, and Magic: the Gathering, for which he created more than 110 paintings.\nHe's also done conceptual toy and video game design, editorial illustrations, and picture books, as well as various activity books for Klutz/Scholastic.\nFor a few years now, Jeff has been sharing his oil painting, acrylic painting, inking, and drawing techniques through his YouTube channel, which has grown to nearly 30,000 subscribers and over 1.3 million views.\nVisit Jeff's website at www.jeffmiracola.com\nSilvia Acevedo is an author, media personality, and former journalist. Her 20 years in TV news taught her how to tell a story through great video, which she does as videographer of the Fantasy Art Workshop DVDs and Jeff\u2019s YouTube channel.\nWhen she\u2019s not shooting close ups of Jeff\u2019s art or posing for him or asking him snarky questions in the background, Silvia\u2019s working on her own writing, including her God Awful Series of books for teens and adults.\nFind out more about her at silviaacevedo.com\nThe email you have listed on Kickstarter MUST be a valid email that you check frequently. We will send occasional updates and a final backer survey to the email address you've listed.\nPlease be prompt in answering your backer survey. The longer it takes you to respond to your survey at campaign's end, the longer it takes for you to receive your reward. \nThe physical address that you provide for delivery must be valid and accurate. We will copy and paste this address exactly as written in your backer survey, so your address must be correctly spelled and laid out. If your rewards are returned to us due to a bad address, we will contact you and you must pay again for shipping if you wish to receive your rewards. If your address changes after you have completed your backer survey but before your rewards have shipped, please update your address in your backer survey and send us a message!\nPlease make sure that your credit card information is correct. If it is not, your pledge will be declined once the campaign has ended and you will be dropped as a backer. (Though if this happens accidentally, you can contact us and we can provide alternate payment options.)\nPlease be sure to read and understand all of the information on our Kickstarter campaign page before pledging. We want you to be a happy backer :-)\nTo a U.S. address: from $5 to $15 depending on reward level.\nTo a Canadian address: from $20 to $30 depending on reward level.\nTo an address everywhere else: from $25 to $50 depending on reward level.\nThe success of any crowdfunding campaign relies on people sharing it with others. Please help spread the word by sharing our Kickstarter campaign on your social media sites. Thank you.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've already successfully delivered two Kickstarter projects, one of which was the Acrylic Painting Techniques DVD project. Because we've gone through this before, we know what to expect. Producing this oil painting DVD should be easier. We are using the same manufacturers that made the Acrylic Painting DVD and rewards, so, if you backed our Acrylic DVD project, you're aware of the quality that you can expect for the Oil Painting DVD and its rewards. Read what others had to say in the Reviews section above. \n\nThat being said, any project can experience production delays. However, our suppliers and manufacturers of the DVDs and other rewards are based here in the United States. We expect no delivery delays. Filming and editing of content is nothing new to us. We've done it many, many times. In fact, we've already started filming :-)\n\nOur goal is to deliver all rewards, including digital downloads, in April 2017. \n\nWe will keep you updated at every step of the process.

Bigger pixels = better picture.\nChoosing a 5MP camera allows bigger pixels within the same sensor size, and is enough megapixels to print at 14\"x11\" full resolution.\nSee sample images here.\nMicro-Adhesive Sticky Pad\nPodo sticks with a quick press, then peels right off. It physically \"grips\" the wall so it doesn't wear out, and you can clean it with water. Think gecko's feet...but on a camera.\nNo other stands, clips, or mounts required. Just slip Podo in your pocket and you're good to go.\nSound like magic? It feels like it too! Just wait until you try it yourself.\nFor a short video on how it works, click here.\nThe Podo App\nOur camera may be tiny, but it becomes powerful by partnering with your phone. Bluetooth technology lets your phone act as a complete wireless controller.\n\n1. Wake Podo up and start the preview, all from within the app\n2.

Choose your favorite shots and transfer them to your phone\nWhen you're done, just stick Podo in your pocket and it will return to sleep automatically. \nThe Podo App is free for iOS and Android.

We got tired of someone always getting left out of group photos and needing cables to transfer photos from Jae's DSLR. We wanted something much more versatile and easy to use, so we made it!\nWe raised $427,000 last year from over 3,600 amazing backers. Podo shipped worldwide, won global design awards, and starred on TV, magazines, and even a music video.\nPodo represents our passion, our team\u2019s grit, and our conviction that technology should be fun and simple. Thank you to every fan and supporter who\u2019s shown us love along the way.\nHOW TO ORDER\n1. Back this Project: Click \"Back This Project\" at the top of this page, or click here. You may choose a maximum of one reward level.\n\n2. Add accessories: Add $5 extra to your total pledge amount per accessory you would like to order. There is no limit to how many or which combination you can order, and there is no additional shipping cost required. See above for accessory choices.\n\n3. Finish payment, and that's it: Your credit card will not be charged until the campaign is completely over. Once it is charged, we will ask you for your shipping address and which accessories you chose, if any.\n\nNote: We do not handle VAT or other import duties for shipments, and we do not charge for this upfront. We are not professional agents in this regard and cannot give you estimates or tax advice. Backers may face additional customs costs upon delivery of their Podo. To avoid regulatory problems, we will put the reward level value (sans shipping) on the declaration. We cannot promise to do otherwise. Thank you!\n\nHOW TO ADD ACCESSORIES\nClick \"Manage My Pledge\", then \"Change your pledge\". Do not change your choice of reward.\n\nAs seen in the video below, you must manually add to your total pledge amount to reserve your accessories.\n\nWe will confirm your choice of accessories via survey once the campaign is over.\nPLAY\n\nREFERRAL PROGRAM RULES\n\nProcedure\nFind your backer number. To find it, visit https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/backings and find us under \"Active pledges.\" Scroll down.\nAffix your backer number to the beginning of podolabs.com followed by a period (no commas). \nFor example, backer number 9,999 would use 9999.podolabs.com\nShare your unique link with friends and family. \nIf they use it to order, you will automatically get credit!\nRules:\nYou must pledge for your own Podo(s) first.\nReferral credits are calculated after the campaign is over.\nWe cannot respond to individual requests for referral count status. \nCancelled orders or failed payments do not count. \nYour referral must use your link to pledge in one session or the referral will not register. \nPlease do not try to game the system (we'll know) or you will forfeit any and all rewards. \nThe Really Big Pack counts as ten referrals. \nIf someone has already pledged once, they cannot re-pledge using your link.\n3 days before the campaign concludes, we will post referral totals for all backers so you can get an idea. However, the official count will only come after the campaign concludes, as some referrals may cancel their pledge.\nThank you and good luck!\nEXTRAS\nVisit www.youtube.com/c/podolabs for fun and informational Podo videos!\n\nTake your camera and stick it:\n   Cher Lloyd - Activated Music Video\n    How Podo Works:\n                       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is no longer our first rodeo, and there are many reasons why we expect to deliver faster than last time. For one, this version is much improved but similar enough that we can reuse much of what we learned.\nSecond, we're further along in the manufacturing process; we've already down-paid for the early bird units and tooling has already begun.

We will deliver to the  high quality standards you would expect! (Note: Kickstarter will not bill you until the Campaign end on Oct 1 so we would ship after that). Countless hours of design and development, prototypes, samples and testing of all the components and the complete product are all behind us.  So FaceCradle is much more than a great idea!\nWe are opening the oven door and smelling the great aroma of what we have made!  Our friends and family are now enjoying the sleep they have longed for each time they travel and now, so can you!\nWe have realized that people all over the world desperately want to sleep on planes, trains, buses and in the back seat of cars.  Some also want to take a power nap in the gate lounge or at work, or while studying.  So we want to take FaceCradle to the world as fast as we can!\nOur factories require up to 50% deposit up front for our orders, we have to pay for distribution, warehousing costs etc, a huge investment.  We also have to present the product to distribution partners and retailers to open up the channels. This involves making connections, attending trade shows, sending out samples, making quotations and in some cases visiting potential customers in their global offices. We have to produce a lot more marketing information like point of sale merchandising, brochures and materials that help explain to the masses, the benefits of buying a FaceCradle.\nOur initial teaser video post on our Facebook page showed incredible support for FaceCadle in many countries.  You can read the comments about the video on www.facebook.com/facecradle.  What was really amazing is we spent less than $100 to boost it and received around 500,000 views!  So with your help, we hope it won't be long before we achieve our Kickstarter goal.\nThe big Retailers today, rarely buy a product if they can't see the demand immediately, so we want to reach as many people world-wide as we can, to let them know about this great product.  Your support will ensure that hundreds of thousands of people get to learn about the benefits of FaceCradle, so they will then immediately start asking about the product in those Retail stores.  It is so crucial that products sell from day one, when a Retailer stocks it, otherwise they could mark it down just weeks after receiving it, killing the product instantly.\nOf course any great idea is bound to be copied, right?  We have already invested a lot to establish our patent protection which we understand to be very strong and these costs will start to escalate.  \nFaceCradle is too good not to launch it professionally, so please lock arms with us in unity, to make the initial production quantities, put the distribution and marketing in place and to make this work together!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven the product design, development and testing is complete, we have reduced many risks already regarding product quality and reliability. \n\nOur next challenge is to ensure our new born leaves the nest and survives it's predators in the global market place and that our intellectual property (Patent, Trademark etc) ensures FaceCradle's design isn't copied. \n\nFaceCradle's inventor has designed, developed and marketed over 30 products globally so the path of pitfalls has been traveled before. \n\nResistance is expected to be met in the market place from existing travel goods companies who have representatives by the thousands, ready to put FaceCradle down to protect their products. So we must reach the Retailers and Consumers to gain their confidence beforehand. \n\nWe have experienced some people commenting that the Deep Sleep Mode looks odd and they would be embarrassed to use the product. \n\nLogic says that when the lights are out on a long haul flight for example, who cares what you look like! No sleep makes you look much worse! We think those comments come from people who haven't traveled because those that have, would think sleep is far more important.\n\nFaceCradle has 5 comfort modes, one of them is the same as a regular neck pillow, so the worst result is you get one of those! Deep Sleep Mode just happens to be one of the most comfortable! \n\nWe therefore have to re-assure people and give them confidence to buy FaceCradle. As we all know, the consumer masses are followers, who gain comfort from those who are brave enough to adopt great new products early.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 5 or more", "title": "80 Ways by Itchee Feet.", "descp": "We will post you a copy of the fantastic travel book \"Around the World in 80 Ways\" by the creator of Itchee Feet, Jane Tara.

We may need to make a few changes or change plastic material, but again, the securing clips are not a very challenging part of the project.\n\nOur first campaign was successful and we delivered our Zubits closures to more than 7,300 backers. The manufacturing took a couple extra months to complete, but a quality product was delivered and almost all Zubits backers were very satisfied.\n\nWe do not perceive significant challenges to delivering this product, but even if we do have major challenges, our existing Zubits closure inventory and formerly used clips could be used to satisfy backers. So even in a worst case scenario backers would not be left empty handed. Nevertheless, we are confident we can deliver new Zubits with new clips.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "1 Pair Zubits\u00ae", "descp": "1 pair of Zubits\u00ae for 1 pair of shoes.

Think Curious George with superpowers. If you enjoy Pixar movies like the Incredibles then you will like THUNDER MONKEY. The downside of having exploding skin is constantly having everything blowing up in your face! THUNDER MONKEY lives in Summercity with his adopted family. Doc Phazer - the worrisome and distracted scientist who discovered THUNDER MONKEY, Addison - his trouble seeking daughter and Widget, the robot make up the family cast. The story hops right into an adventure featuring a young THUNDER MONKEY. Events are set into motion that will haunt THUNDER MONKEY'S future. One of THUNDER MONKEY'S unfavorable abilities is to create powerful enemies.

He appeared as a bootleg comic that I printed myself, came along as a college newspaper strip at the Savannah College of Art and Design and has appeared in published comics.  \nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nPublishing comics involves many hurdles. Unless tens of thousands of people order your unknown book from the get go, it will not survive. Kickstarter, however, only requires hundreds of backers instead of tens of thousands. In essence and here's the beauty of it that I love, you - the backer - become the publisher! The people decide themselves to help make a project come to life. You, like the big publishers give me the green light by pre-ordering. And just like a publisher your job is also to help spread the word. I only have one voice, but together the sky is the limit.\nSHARE\nMy goal is for every backer to share the link to this Kickstarter on their Facebook and or Twitter. If you can do more, then you my friend are awesome! Don't hesitate to reach out to me, I'd be happy to have you on my team. That's what it's really about, building a community of people who want to see THUNDER MONKEY. Go to the THUNDER MONKEY Facebook page and share.\nGOAL\nWhy is the goal so low? I am the writer and the artist, so production costs aren't as high. I'm not going to lose money because the rewards are built to cover the costs associated with each reward. I have quotes from $2.17 per book to $3.00 per book based on how many I print. Postage to ship one book costs around $2.60. And then there are envelopes, bags, etc... $5 per book barely covers those costs, that's why I rely on the other items to fund the project. Posters cost the least to produce, so if you're not sure what to order, know that posters will help a lot. I'm looking at 2 to 3 months of work when all is said and done. Above $2,000 and I will start to get \"paid\" for the work with about 10% going to the Kickstarter fees.\nThunder Monkey Poster and Variant Cover\nSTRETCH GOALS \nIf the $4,000 Stretch goal is reached I will reveal the uber secret THUNDER MONKEY HANDSHAKE. This grants entrance to an exclusive elite secret society of fandom. I will also send out a How to Draw THUNDER MONKEY PDF.\nIf the $6,000 Stretch goal is hit I will add an additional comic to all the US rewards at or above the \"Banana Split\" level. International backers will get one also, if it does not increase their shipping amount otherwise they will receive a collector's card.\nIf $9,000 is hit, an additional BRAND NEW second issue of THUNDER MONKEY will be funded and ALL backers will receive the entire second issue in digital form.\nTimeline\nThe script is written, the layouts are done and five of the 24 pages are colored and lettered. The colored sketches are also already in production. I have gathered quotes from printers and prices for shipping materials. Everything is ready to go. I expect to have the book printed by the end of July, but I gave myself a two month cushion.\nSample of Production Art - Layouts\nThis is a Kickstarter exclusive. As of now there are no plans to distribute the book by other means. I'm not going to order hundreds of extra copies.  \nI really wanted to have a local aspect so I have partnered with the following stores located in my area, and will be printing the books locally. If you let me know in the notes WHERE you will be picking up your rewards I will personalize your copy of the book!

Go back to your roots and make your bloody film. You're really good at it.\"  -- Mike Hill\n\"After months of thinking about how to relaunch this campaign and get this movie made, it was fellow artist and friend Mike Hill, who nailed the idea home for me. Many had suggested doing this film as a short, in the hopes of a producer or studio seeing it and perhaps wanting to fund the entire film, which does actually happen from time to time, but in my mind, I was over making short films, felt I'd made enough and wanted to move forward. At that time, making more shorts was a step backwards to me...\"\n\"Batman Dead End\" One of Sandy's first shorts, shot in 2003, which remains to this day, one of the most downloaded and controversial short films ever made.\nBut then Mike continued-- \"You've written so many scripts, Sandy. You have all these designs around your studio from these films that you haven't been able to make yet. If you make shorts of just a few of them, you can make an anthology. There's your feature, mate...\"\nSo, I got to thinking-- The two things I'm most known for, are a short film and a series of creature design books. Ya know what, he's right. It makes perfect sense...\n\"The Circle\", \"Cybertribe\", \"Guardians of Atlantis\" and \"Pollywog Bog\"-- more possible shorts for the anthology.\nThis film was originally written as a feature. Now, it's a smaller part of a much bigger picture, that I'm WAY more excited about!!!\n\"Heavy Metal magazine and the subsequent animated anthology film, were VERY influential and inspirational to me as an artist in my younger years. Using that format as a model, it's my goal over the next year and half, to create separate campaigns for each different short film, raising the funds to create my own anthology feature over time, as opposed to trying to raise all the money at once for a singular feature film.\"\nThe internet pretty much killed the magazine indusrty, but why don't they make movies like this anymore?\n\"Shallow Water\" is an intense, horror film, which will be the first short in this Horror/Science Fiction/Fantasy anthology from Sandy Collora, a longtime special effects artist, designer, sculptor, creature creator, and award winning commercial director and filmmaker.\nThe TIBURONERA-- he who hunts sharks. Our monster!\nIt combines the best of the two worlds with which Collora is so familiar. It is physical horror and psychological horror. It is eerie and intense. With a strong story and script, believable characters, and top flight performances, it strives for quality as a FILM, not just as a horror film. It's the perfect project to open the anthology with.\n\"This project combines so many things that I'm passionate about: classic horror, borne of mood and suspense; a memorable iconic creature; and the ocean environment. \"Shallow Water\" is a perfect storm of sorts, allowing me to combine my love of all these things into one film.\"\nThe SET-UP of the film --\nAn innocent adventure: a fishing trip to a remote and mythical fishing hole goes awry and becomes a terrifying predicament that keeps getting worse. Nestled deep in the Sea of Cortez is a tiny island you won't find on any map. Six fishermen scour the Baja peninsula to find this magical place, but when they finally reach their destination, they encounter some sea life that they did not expect. This puts them all at odds and it quickly becomes every man for himself. Which will prevail, Mother Nature or Human Nature?\nWhat happened to CLASSIC horror movies?\n\"Many horror films today rely on gimmicks. Found footage, shaky camera nonsense and of course, the whole \"Is it real?\" thing. The original masters of horror; F.W. Murnau, James Whale and Tod Browning, never needed those things and paved the way for Hitchcock, Kubrick and others who created true horror through mood and suspense. The 70's and 80's exploded with a whole new crop of scary, iconic horror films like \"The Exorcist\", \"ALIEN\", \"Halloween\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Predator\". That was 30-40 years ago! Where did films like that go? Why has the horror genre taken such a turn? I'm going to make films that are gritty, real, moody and suspenseful, with new, original creatures. Throwbacks. No shaky cam, no gimmicks...\"\nThe meaning of \"SHALLOW WATER\" --\nSo much of the unique life that comes out of the ocean, dwells in the darkness of the deep. The abyssal plain. Depths of 500 feet or more. There's life in the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of our seas, that is yet undiscovered. Hydrothermal vents over a mile deep, contain life almost alien to our human eyes, but what about the shallows? How hard would it be for something that lives in the deep to swim up into the shallow water? Especially if it was hungry. It's a chilling thought what dangers lurk right under our feet in the murky shallow waters of our shores.\nAbout PRACTICAL EFFECTS --\nPractical Effects are special effects that are produced physically, without the use of post-production techniques like photographic manipulation and computer generation. These effects involve the use of sculpture, prosthetic makeup, animatronics, puppetry, body suits and other techniques that most realistically create the appearance of organic, living creatures. Especially for a film that has a creature with a human form, this is the best and most realistic way to achieve the desired effect.\nThe creature suit on location.\n\"Shallow Water\" will feature Practical Effects of the highest order, designed by Sandy Collora and created by Magee FX and an All-star team of makeup and special effects artists, all with experience on big budget FX films.\nThe TEAM --\n\"I'm incredibly fortunate to have a group around me who are not only enormously talented, but understand me as a creative person and support my vision. Most of them have been with me for quite some time and have worked on several commercial, music video and film projects with me. They are a very special group who have contributed so much.\"\nThe crew on location in Baja.\nClark Bartram-- Not only is he America's most trusted fitness professional, he's an inspiration to such a vast spectrum of people, all over the world. Clark played the titular role in the 2003 short film \"Batman Dead End\" directed by Sandy, that swept San Diego Comic Con. His work ethic and positive attitude is inspirational to the entire cast and crew. Sandy has said he simply could not imagine a production without him on the team.\nEric S. Dow-- An accomplished editor who brings his experience to the team from reality television on shows like Pawn Stars, Counting Cars and American Restoration. Last year, Eric wrote, directed and edited the popular documentary \"Behind the Mask: The Batman Dead End Story\". He was an assistant editor on \"Hunter Prey\" and will cut \"Shallow Water\". He is currently an editor for worldwide creative content at SONY Pictures.\nDale Pearson-- Co-producer, dive master, extreme location specialist and underwater cinematographer, Dale Pearson has been on many dive trips and adventures on the Baja Peninsula and worked on many projects with Sandy. Dale was instrumental in getting the \"Hunter Prey\" production team set up in Mexico. His experience on shows with the History Channel and National Geographic makes him a perfect, hands on producer, especially in extreme shooting locations.\nFelipe Perez Burchard-- One of Mexico's most talented, up and coming cinematographers, Felipe did a phenomenal job as camera operator on \"Hunter Prey\" which earned him the job of cinematographer on \"Shallow Water\". He has worked on many feature films, the most notable being \"Apocalypto\", in the camera department.\nWHY Kickstarter?\n\"Simple. Kickstarter is collaboration and creative freedom. It affords me flexibility I would not have with a publisher or a studio. By funding a project on Kickstarter, it can be collaborative yet still allow me to execute my vision. It really is a wonderful model. I love engaging with my backers, and I enjoy delivering what I've promised. Kickstarter has been a welcome change to the way I do business, and my life.\"\nAbout the REWARDS --\nDELIVERY DATE: The delivery date of November 2016 reflects the outside date when the short film will be available. Looking ahead, I'm hoping to fund and shoot the other shorts to complete the anthology in the next year and a half.\n\nCHOICES: All \"choices\" involved in any Reward tiers (t-shirt style and size, DVD or Blu-Ray, etc.) will be made after the campaign, on the Kickstarter survey form. All designs subject to change.\nCOMBOS: If there are Rewards you'd like that are not available in quite the exact combo you prefer-- send an email to Sandy and team by clicking \"contact me\" on the upper right. We'll be glad to work it out.\nThe Kenner style action figure!\n\"Besides having a really cool project, the rewards are the backbone of any campaign. I know when I back a project, they're the first thing I look at after the video...\"\nThe custom Mego action figure-- in progress.\n  T-shirts! Pick your favorite one!\nWith a film campaign, you've gotta have the basic stuff everyone expects; posters, T-shirts, and course the film itself-- DVDs and Blu-rays, etc... It kinda goes with the territory. But what we've done is come up with some really special rewards that are unique to this campaign. Check out the Art of Shallow Water book, which will have all the storyboards, poster designs and production art!\nThe book, unpainted resin bust and original storyboard!\nThis full figure, painted, resin production maquette (below) was used as reference to create the full body creature suits for the film. It was sculpted by writer/director Sandy Collora and renowned creature creator Jordu Schell. This absolutely stunning piece stands approximately 12 inches tall and will be offered painted, unpainted and unbuilt as well, for all the model kit enthusiasts who want to build and paint it themselves.\nFor the ULTIMATE reward-- a screen used creature head or full suit from the film! There will be a VERY limited number of these available after we finish shooting the movie. This is your chance to own an original screen used piece from \"Shallow Water\". Hey, you never know... if this film becomes a cult classic, you'll own a piece of horror movie history!\nScreen used creature suits and stunt masks.\nA prototype of our poster (below). Sent to you signed by Sandy and the cast and crew (subject to availability) How cool is that?!\nA little bit of that old school graphic design style...\nA FINAL thought --\nEighty five thousand dollars may seem like a lot for a short film, but it really isn't. Every cent will be on the screen. After all the rewards are made, shipped and the fees are paid, this is the bare minimum needed to make this ambitious short film-- if we're fortunate enough to go past the goal, the better we can make the film!\nI grew up on the original Star Wars, Alien and Predator films. I love them, but where are the NEW iconic creatures and characters? How long has it been since we've seen something truly unique and powerful in a genre film? Too long.

But this isn't my first barbecue. I've been in and around the industry for almost 30 years and have learned from some of the best in the business.\n\nWe've got a great idea, an excellent script and I've already created the primary creature. A significant portion of the crew is already aboard and they are accomplished veterans, many of whom have worked with me before on my previous films and commercials. The locations for the shoot have been determined and negotiated, and there are a limited number of sets. All these variables increase efficiency and ensure that upon funding, everything promised will be delivered. I understand the film making process; developing a realistic schedule, a scope of work, and a budget. I know how to adhere staunchly and when to adjust. I've asked for the amount of money needed to deliver a supremely high quality product, on schedule.\n\nFinally, I am a veteran project creator on Kickstarter. Backer rewards from my earlier campaigns were not just delivered on time, many were delivered early. For all these reasons, if this Kickstarter campaign succeeds, the film will be made, all rewards will be delivered fully and on a timely basis, and I believe you will be proud to have backed it.\n\nThank you. -- SC\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "All I can really say here that would mean anything...", "update_content": "is THANK YOU...\nAs I ship off the remaining few boxes and envelopes to everyone, I feel blessed and so very fortunate to have not only your support, but your incredible patience.

It works with board games, card games, dice games and various other game types. Our system is perfect for game nights with friends, traveling with your games, gaming conventions or tournaments, as well as taking care of your games while at home.\nThis is THE essential tabletop game bag solution and its custom, purpose built design allows it to do things other bags can't. There is no other system like it. Your gaming experience will never be the same!\nWe\u2019ve spent 2 years conceptualizing, designing, redesigning, prototyping and getting this project ready. We are putting the finishing touches on the prototype and are ready for our first production run but need your help to make it a reality and bring the Gamefolio System to life!\nOur Gamefolio bags and cases are made of quality materials that are strong, durable, lightweight, flexible and water resistant. We\u2019ve combined that with additional padding and high quality hardware so that the Gamefolio System takes care of your games like a boss.\nPLAY\n\n  The Vault bag holds up to five Gamefolio cases in the main compartment.\n  Its great with your game boxes too!\n  Each Gamefolio case can hold 1-3 games depending on the size and configuration of each game.\n    The Gamefolio System is totally unique. It\u2019s got that special \u201cone of a kind\u201d quality that makes people take notice. It adapts to your games and your gaming lifestyle.\nGames are different. They use various combinations of boards, tiles, cards, dice, tokens, coins, and other components.\nAdditionally, game play situations are different. They can include game nights at home, out with friends, hanging out with your local guild or hitting up gaming conventions and tournaments. They can also include traveling across town or around the globe.\nThe Gamefolio System has got your back! So Keep Calm and Game On!\n    The Vault bag is versatile. Use it with your Game Boxes and our custom Gamefolios. The side pouches have extra room for more games, snacks and whatever else you need while gaming on the go!\nThe Vault bag can be used in conjunction with Gamefolio cases or directly with your games and boxes. Up to five Gamefolio cases can fit inside the main Vault compartment and 1-3 games can fit inside each Gamefolio case, depending on the size and structure of each game. \nThe side compartments can each hold several smaller games or one standard game box, while the main compartment can hold five standard size game boxes without Gamefolio cases. You can also mix it up and carry Gamefolios and game boxes at the same time.\nAs shown in the renderings on the right, our production model has more open access to the main compartment.\nIt adapts to your carry style and needs. Carry it with the included shoulder strap, the handles or use it like a backpack.\nRemovable shoulder strap included with each Vault bag.\nThe side pouches give you plenty of extra room for additional games, snacks, drinks, a laptop, a tablet, pens, paper or anything else you might need while gaming on the go!\n    The Vault bag and Gamefolio cases are very protective and water resistant by themselves but the Rain Cover add-on is for those who want to add another layer of protection to the system, making it extremely weather proof.\n  Gamefolio cases are your tabletop games new best friend. They allow you to instantly customize your game carrying, organization and storage. The custom design maximizes the number of games and gear you carry in a minimized amount of space. With a variety of pockets, pouches and slots, there is a place for everything!\nA place for all your gaming gear and all your gaming gear is in its place! Game boards fit inside a special protective pocket within each Gamefolio and hold boards that fold down to fit within dimensions measuring about 13.5\" x 11.5\" x 1.25\".\nBy carrying, organizing and storing your games with Gamefolios you get the added benefit of protecting your game boxes and the artwork thereon by leaving them safely at home. \nGamefolio cases keep this from happening to your boxes.\nKeep in mind our Vault bag is designed for use with your game boxes directly as well, with ample protection, should you choose to go that route.\nGamefolio cases are easier and lighter to carry compared to lugging around heavier game boxes and inserts. They also keep your game pieces from getting jumbled like a tossed salad or falling all over the place should you accidentally drop, bump or knock over a Gamefolio case or the bag they are in. Game boxes aren\u2019t so forgiving.\nUp to five Gamefolios fit inside the main Vault compartment. One, two or three games can fit inside each Gamefolio depending on the size and structure of each game. More Gamefolios equals more options for managing your game collection.\nOnly need a game or two for gaming on the go? No problem, just grab the Gamefolio case(s) containing the games you want to bring and you\u2019re out the door! (Either with or without the Vault bag.)\nGamefolios are great for organizing and storing your games at home as well as taking them on the go.\n  To back the Gamefolio System, choose a reward level that contains the specific reward you want in the right side column toward the top of this page. It's that simple! Once you have pledged, sit back and relax... But, only after you've told all your friends. We'll collect your shipping/fulfillment info when this project is complete.\nOnce you pledge, you're in for a fun ride.

How about extra Gamefolio cases or another Vault bag? Adding stuff to your reward is easy:\n1. Choose a reward level: Everybody must choose one (and only one) reward level to back this project. You cannot choose 2 reward levels. You will get all items in that reward level.\n2. Want to add-on something?

If it's in the Add-On Menu you can add it to your reward by increasing your pledge by the amount specified in the menu. You can only add things to your reward that are in the Add-On Menu.\nIf you want to add a product that is not in the Add-On menu, don't worry.

Relax, you're done for now: All details like shipping information and add-on specifics will be collected via our Pledge Manager after this campaign has ended.\n  PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n  Nearly two years ago we (Curtis and Josh) were hanging out with our friends at TMG (Tasty Minstrel Games), no stranger to the tabletop gaming world and Kickstarter.\nWe, like you, love our games and want to make sure they are taken care of and protected. We want them easy to organize and to transport. We were tired of subpar non-solutions and thought it absurd that our beloved games were stuck being carried around from place to place in big blue shopping bags, or plastic tote bins, continually scuffing, scratching and damaging the beautiful box art along the way. That's not to mention the inevitable tossed salad effect on the game inside.\nSeriously, that\u2019s just not a solution. It's settling for something that's subpar. None of us should have to settle for subpar when we are so passionate about tabletop gaming.\nAs we discussed our frustrations with one another, we decided something needed to be done and a better solution needed to be created. Curtis and Josh set out to do just that. Over the next two years, with continual feedback, testing and design ideas from the TMG team, Curtis and Josh developed the Gamefolio System to make playing, transporting, storing and protecting your games simple and safe.\nWe are excited to make this dream a reality and for the chance we have to make a small contribution to the amazing world of tabletop gaming that we love so much. We\u2019ve got several additional KeepGear Vault bags, Gamefolio cases and accessories in the works and our Kickstarter backers will always be the first to know about them. Please back this project and join us for an incredible journey. Thanks for your help.\n  We love games and are obsessive about creating systems for organizing, protecting and streamlining the tabletop gaming experience.\nCurtis is a serial entrepreneur and inventor. He has built several successful companies. He knows how to efficiently manage resources and money to make a business or product successful, and deliver quality results to customers. He is continually looking at things from a different perspective, always striving to create something new or improve that which exists. One of his favorite games is Settlers of Catan, although he rarely wins.\nJosh is a highly skilled graphic designer and artist. The incredible artwork, sketches and graphic renderings of The Vault Gamefolio System, bags and cases throughout our Kickstarter campaign are his work. He\u2019s also got several years of experience working with manufacturers, taking ideas from concept, to design, to a finished product produced in high volume. One of his favorite games is Pandemic.\nThis dynamic duo is also backed up by a number of successful Kickstarter creators, other mentors, advisors, family, friends and supporters like you.\nWe understand the critical importance of taking care of our backers. Without you our project would not come to life. We are committed to using our skills, experience, connections, blood, sweat and tears to make sure that your pledges are used wisely to bring The Vault Gamefolio System to life.\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\n  All details like shipping information and add-on specifics will be collected via our Pledge Manager after this campaign has ended.\nUS shipping is shown on each pledge level and collected when you submit your pledge. The Vault bag is $15 shipping. The complete Vault Gamefolio System including the Vault bag with 4 Gamefolios will be $20 shipping. Depending on the additional add-ons you choose there may be other related shipping fees. We work hard to ensure the best pricing and care for your shipments.\nWe will be looking to do the same in other regions as we get a high enough number of backers in each region to make it viable.\nInternational shipping will be managed and collected through our pledge manager after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nWhere possible we will be shipping your rewards from within your country or region. This is true for the EU, Australia, Canada, China and the US. If you are outside of those areas we will be shipping to you from a fulfillment center as near you as possible to keep shipping as low as possible.\nBelow are estimated international shipping costs. If you don\u2019t see your country below then look for a nearby country and your rates will be similar. If you would like more specifics on your country please message us directly so we can take care of you. These are estimates so if there is opportunity for additional savings we will make that happen for each country/region.\nPlease note that the estimates are for the specific reward listed at the top of each column. Any rewards that you Add-On to your pledge will add to the cost of shipping, but they will be bundled with the overall package so the total shipping will be much less than if the items were to be shipped separately.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve got a ton of business success in our DNA and have teamed up with experienced manufacturers to make this dream a reality.

Should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers.\n\nForecasting Risk \nIf all goes well during our funding campaign, we'll finish up with a lot of backers and demand. Of course we're trying our hardest to predict our future demand and plan accordingly, but it's not an exact science. \n\nSupply Chain Risk \nWe have two separate manufacturing supply chains setup to make sure we can take care of our backers and bring our product to life.

Building on what we learned in testing, we began drafting plans and specifications for the consumer-ready device, which brings us to where we are today.\nWe\u2019ve already done a lot of the legwork. The critical next steps are to finish work on the components and printed circuits for the final prototype, and begin testing the consumer version hardware. We\u2019re packing a lot of technology into HUB\u2019s compact form factor, and getting everything ready for primetime on schedule will require the combined efforts of our entire team. Now we\u2019re turning to Kickstarter to raise the funds needed to finish our consumer-ready prototype and bring HUB to the world.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWhen we first started developing HUB, we quickly realized that we had something that people were going to love. The Kickstarter community has been responsible for supporting some amazing projects by creators like us, and we felt that they would be equally as excited about HUB. Today, we\u2019re proud to be sharing these exciting next steps with our backers and supporters.\nNext Steps\nBacker Rewards\nAbout the ekko Audio Team\nWe are a small but skilled group of creators and designers with a passion for all things technology + audio. Our diverse backgrounds include experience in project management, finance, various aspects of product design and development, shipping and logistics, UX/UI design, and more. After working together professionally on numerous projects over the last several years, we eventually teamed up to form our own product development startup and selected HUB as our pilot project.\nThe idea for HUB first came about when, over a few cups of coffee, we lamented the quality and selection of wireless audio devices, and resolved to do better. We brainstormed about a user-friendly wireless listening system that could meet the needs of the most discerning high-tech audiophile, while keeping things simple enough for anyone to enjoy. After a few hundred more cups of coffee, HUB began to take shape, and we enlisted the expertise of several other colleagues including product designers, developers and engineers to help us make HUB a reality.\nGet Your Project Funded Today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many challenges when it comes to designing and manufacturing a product like HUB.

We\u2019ve got two new volumes here that we think you\u2019ll enjoy. First\u2014and a big thank you for all those who have been waiting so patiently\u2014we offer the oversized Storms at Sea signed deluxe edition, featuring all of Mark\u2019s illustrations displayed exactly as the uncropped, full-board originals, and at a much larger size than the trade edition.\nAnd then we have something completely new\u2014the deluxe edition of Mark\u2019s Carbon2, a collection of his latest works, most of them published here for the first time, in the grand tradition of 2013\u2019s Carbon.\nThis is John\u2019s fifth Kickstarter campaign, and his second with Mark. You know by now the excellent quality you can expect from these two old campaigners, but please take a look below for examples of what you can expect within the covers, and for awards.\nAs always, we appreciate your consideration!\nMark Schultz: Carbon, New Art Book:\nCover to Carbon 2 by Mark Schultz\nCarbon 2 Book Details:\n56 pages for the paperback and 58 pages for the deluxe, 9 x 12 inches. Comes in a paperback trade edition, as well as a Flesk exclusive: a deluxe signed edition, hardcover with jacket, limited to 600 copies.\nSample book spread for Carbon 2\nThe first thing you can count on in any collection from Mark Schultz is a kind of subject matter, featuring outr\u00e9 situations involving daring men and women, and, often, fearsome beasts. The second thing you can count on is his allegiance to certain graphic medium\u2014generally brush and ink, and graphite and charcoal, but sometimes watercolor too. The third thing you can count on is that, although the subject matter and media stay consistent, his design, draftsmanship and control of his presentation are always evolving and growing, Here, in Carbon 2, his work has become noticeably bolder\u2014more viscerally engaging.\nSample book spread for Carbon 2\nCarbon 2 follows its predecessor by three years, and in those years Mark\u2019s work has become something more solid, and at times almost sculptural, as he continues to refine his attempts to put to paper the visions he sees in his head. Featuring conceptual studies as well as finishes, Carbon 2 gives us a look into that process.\nSample book spread for Carbon 2\nOf course there are plenty of lovely warrior women, including more in the Pulpette series, as well as portraits of his Xenozoic characters, Hannah Dundee and Jack Tenrec, negotiating dire straits. There is also sword and sorcery, ancient mythic tableaus, and otherworldly science fiction to satisfy the most diverse tastes. And there are preliminaries and rejected pieces from Storms at Sea, and, (spoiler alert) design work and character studies from Mark\u2019s new in-progress Xenozoic graphic novel.

What a perfect opportunity to produce the special projects that would never have seen the light of day in the world of traditional publication and distribution. This is all about the hardcore readers and collectors who want an extraordinary experience. With Kickstarter we have the proven path for getting that experience produced and in their hands.\nJohn Fleskes: It's the community aspect that I enjoy the most. Your support allows us to improve upon the quality of the books as we receive more pledges. We conceive of our grandest ideas and with our supporters have a chance to achieve them through stretch goals. It's all a very exciting process.\nMark's thoughts on working with John and Flesk Publications\nWhat more can I say about working with Flesk Publications that hasn\u2019t already been said? I\u2019ll let my 12-year association with them as my primary publisher stand as my testament. They are, simply put, the best at what they do\u2014which is to produce the highest-quality publications in concert with the goals of the artist. It comes down to integrity and the willingness to share a vision. I\u2019m smart enough to know that I\u2019m not going to find better.\nJohn's thoughts on Mark:\nWith Mark, it's like working with family. Here's a guy who I've had the good fortune to become friends with and whose artwork completely captivates me. As I make and publish his books it's my goal to create a lasting quality art object to share with others and to make Mark feel proud.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy you should trust Flesk Publications? John answers:\n\"I pride myself on having a 14 year record of delivering over seventy books on time and of the highest quality. Of course, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over seventy books, filled thousands of Kickstarter orders and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would. Bottom line, I would not have been around this long without an excellent track record.\"\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "New Mark Schultz Carbon 3 Kickstarter Campaign Launched Today!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Carbon 3 by Mark Schultz Coming Soon!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "The Latest in Schultz News!

Or claim victory by destroying all your mad scientist rivals and be the last Lab standing!\nIt's ALIVE!\nCreated by Liam McIntyre (from TVs Spartacus and The Flash) and illustrated by Cris Olansamuelle (Draw Them All), Monster Lab is a card game about channeling your inner Mad Scientist to create incredible, wild and crazy creatures out of Spare Parts, and use them to battle your way past rival Labs to victory. It's part Munchkin, part Exploding Kittens and part Epic Spell Wars, but with a Madcap Monster Method all of its own. It's perfect for 2-6 players, and each game lasts about an hour.\nTo play, you draw cards to collect Spare Parts that you then fit together to make one of thousands of weird and wonderful Monster combinations that help you protect your Lab and battle your rivals. You can also draw Lab Cards that give you special bonuses like the Pig O' Nine Tails, a Bat to the Face or a Shiny Monster Butt that help you and hurt your opponents. You attack your Rivals to steal their Monsters and destroy their Defenses, while trying to protect your Lab to make sure you don't get Run Out Of Town (and out of the game) by Monster hating Monster Hunters hiding in the deck or your opponents out for revenge. The game keeps heating up Monster Hunters keep returning to the deck, so the longer you play, the more they'll appear and the more damage they'll do. \nIt looks a bit like this. A LOT like this.\nWe think the combination of trying to build up your army of Monsters, whilst trying to avoid destruction from both Monster Hunters and your Rivals creates an exciting balance between attack and defense, while the huge range of special Lab Card abilities allows you to stay in the game and cause an upset no matter how far behind you think you are. This makes each game of Monster Lab tense and fun, and always different from the last. Add to that our personal favorite - the almost endless combinations of funny and fearsome Monsters you can make and we think you'll find it's a blast for adults and kids alike.\nSo welcome to the Lab! We really want our backers to feel part of the creative process, so we welcome ideas for cards and monsters, and anything else you guys can think of! We hope you're excited as we are and can help us realize our dream of building Fire Breathing Catzillas that can Time Travel in a Hot Tub.\nWith green tubs of ooze and Monstery Love\nLiam and Cris, the Monster Lab Team.\nA Guide!\n OR Watch us play a round on SMOSH GAMES (sorry about Liam's giant head there)...\nStuff You Get.\nThe Team.\nLiam and Cris, working in the Lab.\nMonster Lab was created by Liam McIntyre (from TVs Spartacus and The Flash) and illustrated by Cris Olansamuelle (Draw Them All). Liam has dreamed of making a game since he was about 5 years old, and Cris is an exceptional artist that has worked at conventions and a fantastic online cartoon called 'Draw Them All', among other things.\nThey've collaborated on this project for over 6 months, changing the game from a bare bones idea about making Monsters out of parts to the fun and frantic game you see today.\nIn The Beginning...\nThe origins of Monster Lab start off with Liam sitting next to Nathan Fillion in a Comic Con in Australia. There was a lull in the crowd, and Liam went off to buy yet more board games - his favorite convention past time - as he was sitting at his table looking through some of his new acquisitions, he thought... WAIT! I SHOULD MAKE A CARD GAME!\nHe promptly started making a card game. It was about sword fighting (of course) and he wrote it on the back of card sleeves with a marker. Weeks later, he realized this was a very, very hard card game to make. He's still making it (maybe it'll be the next game he releases!). Then, whilst playing a card game on his computer, he had another Eureka moment. I SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENT GAME! And so he did.\nHe thought about games that he liked, that were fun and accessible. One that stood out was a card game his wife and her family played in Australia called '31'. Basically you have three cards, the aim of that game is to draw and discard cards until you're close to a total of 31, all in the same suit. Then you knock on the table, everyone has one more go, reveals their cards, and whoever has the highest total, wins. It's bluffing, it's trying not to give the other players good cards to steal, it's simple, it's fun. It seemed like a great place to start. He liked the three card element, so started there - except in this version, the challenge was going to be to build a monster that's broken into three parts. Each monster got a points value, and to simulate the suits, the monsters were of 4 different 'families', Elemental, Mutant, Robotic and Alien. It was pretty cool. But it wasn't...well... Fun. And fun seemed to be important. So with the help of some long suffering friends, he began trialing different approaches. It briefly became about killer penguins (rated high on the wife's 'cute scale') before returning to more cartoon-y monsters.\nRules were changed so the monsters had to fit together in different sizes, because early tests showed that, with good art, this could look endlessly hilarious. Then we worked out there should be some 'Munchkin' style abilities to sabotage your opponents' plans, cause who doesn't like messing up your friends best laid plans!? We also figured you should have to build 5 Monsters, after which everyone counted their score. Shortly after this, we started play testing it.\nThere were...quite a lot of test versions of Monster Lab.\nThere was one infamous game that lasted about 6 hours where no one could build enough monsters to end the game. So we added in the Monster Hunters element which meant there was an added threat to drawing cards, which seemed fun, and, ultimately, a ticking clock on the game that added some urgency to playing and give the game an increasing tension (and an actual ending). Next we figured that the constant 'why can't the Monsters fight each other?' question we'd been asked by, oh, EVERYONE... should be addressed, so completely redesigned it again so that the Monsters could fight - which proved to be AWESOME! Lastly we decided to change the game from being a 'score as many points as you can' system,which was complicated and unwieldy, to a game with a definite goal to reach. It made more sense that the scientists were out to create something phenomenal to beat each other, so we changed it to be about collecting Monsters, where players battled to obtain a certain amount of points in order to win. This proved a good idea as it gave another level of tension - and by including 'Lab Defenses' as a sort of 'Lives' component for players, now we had something that had was feeling like a really engaging game. The Monster Hunters were also a great mechanic as they start appearing more and more frequently and, at some point, it means the game can become a choice between going for the win, and trying to survive longest to win by being the Last Lab Standing, which added a host of great tactical choices to the game play.\nAfter that hard work, there was just the fun part - the naming of the creatures. That's something we're still doing, and really want your feedback on! During the campaign will be asking you to nominate options, and also vote on your favorites.\nFor Liam, the last, and in many ways most important, piece of the puzzle was finding an incredible artist to do the complicated and challenging art for the game. Since the cards were both wild and wacky, but also had to fit together in some interesting, coherent and fun way across three cards, the technical side was very challenging. Also, since the visual side was such a big component to making the monster combinations and the character of the game, you wanted the art to really sell that sense of fun and that 'mad scientist' flavor. So it was with incredibly good fortune that Cris agreed to come on board to help out. Her art is truly out of this world, and the game wouldn't be ANYTHING without it. So with all the pieces in place, all that was left was to plan the Kickstarter campaign and see what you all thought of this crazy game!\nThanks for the support, can't wait to hear from you and answer your questions, and hear your response to our crazy little game!\nSome places to CHECK IT OUT!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe long and the short of it is - it's a card game, not brain surgery (unless for some reason brain surgery gets included as a Monster Lab stretch goal. It probably won't). The game is basically done - we're currently tweaking the rules and finishing the huge amount of art required, and we just want help with the finishing touches, and knowing how many we should be making and making sure the quality is as good as it can be. To that end, there may be changes to cards or to rules that we discover are required as we further balance the game - don't be sad if something changes, we're making the game better, promise!\n\nAll we're interested in doing is getting you the best possible game, as quickly as possible. For that reason, the Rewards are tailored around being simple, satisfying and easy to deliver.

However, the charging tech still lags far behind. \nUsBidi is created as a charger that is reliable, battery saving, time saving, mess/tangle free, and worthy of our beloved phones and tablets. \nA charger with a mix of great intelligence and beautiful art, will make our daily charging task easier, faster and happier.\nCharging Has Evolved, for Android and iOS Devices\nUsBidi is the most intelligent charger that not only doubles the charging speed on computer USB, but also automatically shuts off power completely once fully charged so you don't have to unplug. It spares your device from battery killers like heat and mini-charging-cycles, extending battery life with healthier battery and longer-lasting charges.\nIt has additional awesome features - LED indicator showing you at-a-glance the charging status, magnetic ends for tidy hold, durable and colorful braided exterior with a variety of lengths (1, 3 or 6 Feet / 0.3, 0.9 or 1.8 Meters) to choose from. \nUsBidi charger is designed to work with both your phones and tablets. It is available in two versions - MFi certified Lightening version for Apple devices and Micro USB version for Android devices.\nKeeps Battery Healthier and Maximizes Its Life\nHow does this work?\nA lot of us leave our phones and tablets plugged in charging for extended periods, such as overnight. When left plugged in after the battery is full, a regular charger will cause elevated temperature and mini-charging-cycles, damaging the battery capacity and shortening its life over time. \nUsBidi is created with an intelligent built-in PCB that shuts off charging circuit completely once battery is full, as though it has been unplugged. And your device will charge again next time when you plug it in. \nThe auto. power shut-off feature is comparable to an \"auto-unplug\" function. No more stressing your precious battery for 8 hours every night, wearing down its capacity.\nThere are billions of devices left plugged in every night wasting a little energy and generating heat. UsBidi's \"auto-unplug\" feature could save considerable energy, if we are lucky enough to reach great number of consumers with your help.\nCharges Your Phones 2 x as Fast\nHow does this work?\nWhen your phone is plugged into a computer's USB port, the regular charger will do data syncing and charging at the same time, which is the reason why the charging speed is so slow. \nUsBidi charger gets a touch switch that stops data syncing once pressed, so that all the power available will be used to boost the charging speed.\nWhen you finish syncing, simply press the button to switch into Smart & Fast mode. UsBidi will double the charging speed and cut your charging time in half.\nMagnetic Ends for Tidy Hold\nStore UsBidi using its magnetic ends anywhere, always mess free. \nLED Indicator Shows You Charging Status at-a-Glance\nYou don't have to pick up the phone to read its charging status any more.\n UsBidi in the News\nWhy Did We Create UsBidi Charger?\nA regular charger gets messy. It breaks, wastes energy and slowly kills the battery with heat and mini-cycles.\nHow often do you have to charge your phone despite being promised 14 hours of battery? With the regular charger causing battery damages, your experience just gets worse!\nExperts warn us, \"Don't leave your fully charged phone plugged in\". It can damage and weaken your battery over time. \nBattery Care Tips\nDo You Find These Familiar?\nApple tells us, \"Remove certain cases during charging\". Samsung says, \"Unplug once fully charged\". \n But it shouldn't be this complicated. That's why we have created UsBidi.\nGreat Features You've Been Looking For\nCompared to Regular Chargers\nWhy Kickstarter - We Need Your Help\nWe've come a long way from where we began. All the obstacles are behind us now, and the top quality manufacturing partner has lined up, but we can't go any further without the support from you!\nWith your help, we will be able to meet the requirement of minimum orders to start production. \nCharging has evolved again! Pledge now and help us spread the words, together we will bring UsBidi to the consumers market and of course your hands!\nSelect Your Rewards\nPick Your Choices at the End of the Campaign\nAvailable in two versions - Micro USB version for Android devices or MFi certified Lightning version for Apple devices. \nChoose your favorite color and preferred length for any one of your charger.\nYou can pick your choices by responding to a survey at the end of the campaign. We will design the survey to be super easy for the combination of your choices. \nProject Timeline\nWe started the idea and feasibility study in May 2014 to safeguard our devices battery by re-engineering the charger. And soon we identified more improvements that can tackle people\u2019s common complaints about charging.\nFollowing over a year of intense work on concepts, detailed design, manufacturer assessment & selection, prototyping, testing and fine-tuning, now we are ready to go into mass production with your help.\nWhere Will Your Pledges Go", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrom years of engineering experience with daily cross discipline collaboration, we understand what it takes to bring an innovative product to fruition.\nWe've chosen to spend the whole last year going through all the processes, and refused to start the Kickstarter campaign until now everything was all set and ready to go.\nThe selected manufacturing partner is one of the top charger/cable manufacturers, and has been supplying mobile charging product all over the world along with the 1st-gen smartphones.

AGFA exists to preserve the legacy of genre movies through collection, conservation, and distribution.\nAGFA HQ.\nFormed in 2009, AGFA focuses on outlaw exploitation movies that were produced from the 1960s through the 1990s. From manic hicksploitation epics to bloodthirsty shoestring goreblasts, each title in AGFA's collection is a celebration of culture that should never be forgotten. Housing over six thousand 35mm film prints and trailers, our non-profit archive counts among its board members and advisors Alamo Drafthouse founders Tim and Karrie League, filmmakers Nicolas Winding Refn and Paul Thomas Anderson, and Austin area film programmers and movie fans.\nThe late Mike Vraney, founder of Something Weird.\nMike Vraney founded Something Weird Video in 1990. Sadly, he passed away in 2014 after a long, heroic battle with lung cancer. Legendary exploitation warlock David F. Friedman deemed Vraney \"the forty-first thief,\" which was the ultimate compliment to this exploiteer. Vraney dedicated his life to unearthing and preserving the most radically insane exploitation and horror movies of all time. He introduced multiple generations to the works of Herschell Gordon Lewis, Doris Wishman, David F. Friedman, Barry Mahon, Michael and Roberta Findlay, and Fredric C. Hobbs. Vraney's contribution to preserving the world's most deranged cultural milestones can never be overstated. Something Weird Video changed the way that we understand movies.\nNow it's our turn to give something back.\nAGFA has started working with Something Weird\u2019s Lisa Petrucci, Mike Vraney\u2019s widow and partner, to redistribute titles from the massive 35mm film collection.\nVraney\u2019s hard work should never be forgotten. And access is a crucial part of preservation. The movies that Something Weird unearthed are meant to be played. These movies come to life when audiences enjoy them. Each year, AGFA loans hundreds of prints to arthouse institutions, film societies, festivals, libraries, and universities. A fundamental component of our mission is to make sure that people watch these movies. But film prints have a limited lifespan. Like human beings, all prints are inevitably headed to the dumpster. However, with proper storage and care, we can prolong the lives of these prints and ensure that the movies themselves endure the ravages of time. In order to share these treasures, AGFA is undertaking a new initiative.\nOur mission is to raise completion funds for a 4K film scanner to digitally transfer original film elements from the Something Weird collection, as well as one-of-a-kind obscurities in the AGFA archive.\nAGFA will partner with Drafthouse Films -- the distribution arm of the Alamo Drafthouse -- to share these movies in theaters, on home video, and on VOD platforms. While AGFA is dedicated to 35mm preservation, we also want to make sure that these movies are accessible to as many people as possible.\nThe first title that AGFA will preserve from the Something Weird collection is Tom Hanson's THE ZODIAC KILLER. Released in 1971, the movie was made in hopes of capturing the real-life Zodiac Killer. The plan didn\u2019t work. Instead, we got the most outrageous and compelling \u201ctabloid horror\u201d vortex in the history of planet Earth. And beyond.\nDid you know that the Zodiac Killer wore Groucho glasses while stalking his victims? Did you know that the Zodiac\u2019s pet rabbits commanded him to kill during black mass rituals? Did you also know that the Zodiac might have been a man named Grover who attempted to kidnap his daughter while brandishing a hand saw? You won\u2019t get insight like this by watching a David Fincher movie.

All of the work at AGFA happens on a shoestring -- or no-shoestring -- budget. If you love movies, you love AGFA . . . even if you've never heard of it.

However, after graduating from college and picking up a 9 - 5 job, I found myself slipping away from this active lifestyle I loved and falling helplessly into a life of sitting.  \nI would sit on my commute to and from work, at the office, at lunch, at home on the couch, at dinner, and then back on the couch. My life was officially consumed by sitting. This left me feeling unfocused at work, tired throughout the day, and with pain and discomfort in my back.\nI couldn't take it anymore, so I began searching for a standing desk only to find that they were either too expensive or not easily adjustable from sitting to standing. So I decided to partner with some friends and we set out to make the ultimate sit-to-stand desk.\nAfter 8 months of designing and testing we are excited to introduce, the ERVO Sit-to-Stand desk, the most affordable and customizable sit-to-stand desk that makes switching from sitting to standing effortless. \nHow It Works\nWe added notches and handles to make adjusting the desk effortless.\nClick the links below to see what they said about the ERVO Sit-to-Stand Desk!\nGizmag, psfk, Fast Company, Krowdfund, ListHunt, TECH.CO, Tools & Toys, Geeky-Gadgets, Inhabitat, DesignTaxi, Gadgetify, The Red Ferret and Technology.org\n                                                Ships anywhere in the world for $35\nPackaging Specifications\n38\" Desk: 44\" x 28\" x 7\", Weight = 40lbs\n29\" Desk: 35\" x 28\" x 6\", Weight = 33lbs\nSplit-Level Technology\nOur split-level shelf technology allows a monitor and a laptop, or two different sized monitors, to BOTH be at eye level. (Please note that the split-level shelves are only available on the 38\" desk and not the 29\" desk.)\nOur split-level shelves are designed to hold two monitors width based on the following dimensions:\n*Note - to support two 22\" monitors it is recommended that you slightly angle your monitors inward.\nWhile most 22\" monitors will fit on the split-level shelves, we realize that all 22\" monitors do not have the same width of 18.7\".  Because of this we recommend using monitors that are no wider than 18.7\" wide.\nSide Hooks that Eliminate Wobble\nEach desk surface has a side hook that fits comfortably around the side window of the desk eliminating any chance of wobble and gives you peace of mind knowing that your desk is never going to slide off of the notches.\nEasily adjustable\nThe desk surface has subtle and easy to use handles that make adjusting your desk easy and comfortable.\nExtremely Customizable - Over a 100 ways to adjust your desk\nThe notch system gives you the ability to customize the desk to over 100 different settings.  Move each of the different desks to any of the eight notches along the inside wall of the desk and make it your own. It will fit you exactly how you want it!\nJust a few of many ways to customize your ERVO desk.\nWill the ERVO desk fit my height?\nYes, to find your perfect height on the desk, measure (while standing) the height of your elbow bent at 90 degrees to the ground.  Then simply find the height on this image to know the perfect height setting for you while standing at your ERVO desk.\nThese measurements show at what height your elbows would be for each available desk height. The measurement is taken from the ground and is based on your ERVO desk resting on a 29\u201d desk.\nA closer look at the Notch System\n Here is an image of two people next to the desk to give you a point of reference of how the desk would fit your height by comparison.\nStrong Materials = High Quality\nAfter researching multiple types of wood and talking with several furniture craftsman we selected Baltic Birch because it gives a beautiful finish, is light weight, and incredibly strong, allowing the desk to hold 280 pounds without a problem. You will not be let down by the quality of this desk.\nWindows\nWe designed the ERVO desk to have a lot of open space in the back and sides of the desk. This provides easy access when setting up your computers and cords, and also lets in plenty of light to create a more open feel.\nCord Management\nWe cut out a 2\" in x 1.5\" in rectangle on each desk to keep your desk clutter free as well as help you manage your cords and to allow them to easily flow between each desk both while using the desk and while moving the desks up and down.\nFits Any Setting\nThe ERVO desk was beautifully designed to fit any setting whether you have your own office, sit at a cubicle, or work at home. This desk is perfect for every situation.\nWide Desk (38 inches): Comes with 8 different pieces... 2 side walls, backboard, baseboard, main desk, split level desks, and the non-split upper desk.\nWide Desk 38\"\nNarrow Desk (29 inches): Comes with 6 different pieces... 2 side walls, backboard, baseboard, main desk, and the solid upper desk.\nNarrow Desk 29\"\n Desktop Surfaces\nBelow is an image that shows the actual surface area of each of the desktop surfaces.\nThe diagrams below illustrate what pieces come with each desk.\nWide Desk 38\":\nNarrow Desk 29\":\nPlease note that the smaller desk does not come with the split level monitor desks.\nEngineered with no screws or bolts it takes less than a minute to assemble.\nWe are currently projecting that the delivery date of the desks will be February of 2016.

I grew up on the original Alien and Predator films. I love them. But where are the NEW iconic creatures and characters? How long has it been since we've seen something truly unique and powerful in a genre film? Too long. If Hollywood won't do it, I will. With your help, we can raise enough independently to crowd fund a great genre film. Maybe together we can even change the paradigm a little bit in Hollywood as well as break through a glass ceiling in the horror subcategory here on Kickstarter to the benefit of all horror fans now and in the future. \"  -- Sandy Collora \n\"Shallow Water\" is an independent horror film from Sandy Collora, a longtime special effects artist, designer, sculptor and creature creator who is also an award winning commercial director, filmmaker and... a highly skilled freediver and fisherman. \n\"The Tiburonera\": he who hunts sharks...\n\"With all the time I've spent in and on the water over the past 40 years, I've seen the impact man has made on the ocean environment firsthand. I've dedicated a lot of my time to helping preserve our ocean resources and manage our fisheries, in the hopes of keeping them sustainable for generations to come. \"Shallow Water\" embodies all this and is a perfect fit for me as a filmmaker.\" \n\"Shallow Water\" combines the best of the two worlds with which Collora is so familiar. It is physical horror and psychological horror. It is eerie and intense. With a strong story and script, believable characters, and top flight performances, it strives for quality as a FILM, not just as a horror film.\nDive, fish, make art and movies... life ...\n\"This project combines so many things that I'm passionate about: great horror, borne of mood and suspense; a memorable iconic creature; the ocean and the environment. \"Shallow Water\" is a perfect storm of sorts, allowing me to combine my love of all these things into one film. This is why I'm so excited about this project...\" \nThe PLOT of the film --\nAn innocent adventure: a fishing trip to a remote and mythical fishing hole goes awry and becomes a terrifying predicament that keeps getting worse. Nestled deep in the Sea of Cortez is a tiny island you won't find on any map. Six fishermen scour the Baja peninsula to find this magical place, but when they finally reach their destination, they encounter some sea life that they did not expect. This puts them all at odds and it quickly becomes every man for himself. Which will prevail, Mother Nature or Human Nature?\nWhat happened to CLASSIC horror movies?\n\"So many horror films these days rely on gimmicks. Found footage, shaky camera nonsense to seem more \"real\" and of course, the whole \"based on true events\" thing. The original masters of horror, like F.W. Murnau, James Whale and Tod Browning, never needed those things and paved the way for great directors like Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and many others who created true horror through mood and suspense. Then the 70's and 80's exploded with a whole new crop of amazing, iconic horror films like \"The Exorcist\", \"ALIEN\", \"Halloween\", \"The Terminator\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Predator\". That was 30-40 years ago! Where did films like that go? Why has the horror genre taken such a turn? Well, I have my own opinions, but what I will tell you here, is that I'm going to make a film that IS a gritty, real, moody, suspenseful film, with a new, striking, original creature. No shaky cam, no gimmicks, no teenagers with cell phones or video cameras and no pale school girls with stringy black hair and white eyes.\" \nAlien, Predator, Frankenstein's Monster, & Creature from The Black Lagoon. True icons. (Rights owned by 20th Cent. Fox; Universal.)\nBELOW: SANDY COLLORA ADDRESSES \"THE SIZE OF THE RAISE\" AND \"THE CREATURE\" IN A TWO MINUTE VIDEO ...\nPLAY\n\nThe meaning of \"SHALLOW WATER\" --\nSo much of the unique and odd life that we see come out of the ocean, dwells in the darkness of the deep. The abyssal plain. Depths of 500 feet or more. There's life in the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of our seas, that is yet undiscovered. Hydrothermal vents over a mile deep, contain life almost alien to our human eyes, but what about the shallows? How hard would it be for something that lives in the deep to swim up into the shallow water? Especially if it was hungry. It's a chilling thought what dangers lurk right under our feet in the murky shallow waters of our shores.\nThe BAJA Peninsula --\nThe Baja Peninsula is a long narrow strip of land South of California and West of mainland Mexico. Its Eastern border is the Gulf of California and its Western border is the Pacific Ocean. The peninsula formed when it split apart from Mexico 12 to 15 million years ago; it is laden with rifts, faults and seismic zones, as well as volcanic activity. The land is remote, largely unspoiled and pristine. It is home to migrating gray whales, and a great many other species which serves to lure tourists who enjoy sport fishing. This makes it the perfect setting for \"Shallow Water\".\nSunrise on the Sea of Cortez - from our location scout.\nAbout PRACTICAL EFFECTS --\nPractical Effects are special effects that are produced physically, without the use of post-production techniques like photographic manipulation and computer generation. These effects involve the use of sculpture, prosthetic makeup, animatronics, puppetry, body suits and other techniques that most realistically create the appearance of organic, living creatures. Especially for a film that has a creature with a human form, this is the best and most realistic way to achieve the desired effect.\nThe suit on location.\nOther Practical Effects include scale models (Miniature Effects), aerial rigging (Mechanical Effects), pyrotechnics (for fire and explosions), and squibs (for gunshot wounds). \"Shallow Water\" will feature many Practical Effects of the highest order, designed by Sandy Collora and created by Magee FX and an All-star team of makeup and special effects artists, all with experience on big budget FX films.\nPatrick Magee with Sandy: sculpting the suit.\nThe TEAM --\n\"As most of you know, it takes a LOT of people to make a movie. I'm incredibly fortunate to have a group around me who are not only enormously talented, but understand me as a creative person and support my vision. Most of them have been with me for quite some time and have worked on several commercial, music video and film projects with me. They are a very special group who have contributed so much.\" \nHere are just some of the people that will help make \"Shallow Water\" a reality:\nThe crew on location in Baja.\nClark Bartram\nNot only is he America's most trusted fitness professional, he's an inspiration to such a vast spectrum of people, all over the world. Clark was Batman in the 2003 short film by Sandy that swept San Diego Comic Con that same year. His commitment to excellence, work ethic and excitement is inspirational to all - the other actors and the entire crew as well. Sandy has said he simply could not imagine a production without him on the team. \nClark on the set of \"Hunter Prey\".\nEric S. Dow\nAn accomplished editor who brings his experience to the team from reality television on shows like Pawn Stars, Counting Cars and American Restoration. Last year, Eric wrote, directed and edited the popular documentary \"Behind the Mask: The Batman Dead End Story\". He was an assistant editor on \"Hunter Prey\" and will cut \"Shallow Water\". He is currently an editor for worldwide creative content at SONY Pictures. \nEric cutting the trailer for \"Shallow Water\".\nDale Pearson\nCo-producer, dive master, extreme location specialist and underwater cinematographer, Dale Pearson met Sandy in 2006, when he wanted to charter a dive expedition to the Islas Encantadas in the Sea of Cortez. Since then, they have been on many dive trips and adventures on the Baja Peninsula and worked on many projects together. Dale was instrumental in getting the \"Hunter Prey\" production team set up in Mexico, and was a major player in the trailer for \"Shallow Water'. His experience on shows with the History Channel and National Geographic makes him a perfect, hands on producer and expedition team leader, especially in extreme shooting locations.\nUnderwater cinematographer Pearson, up close & personal with a giant humboldt squid in the Sea of Cortez.\nFelipe Perez Burchard\nOne of Mexico's most talented, up and coming cinematographers, Felipe did a phenomenal job as camera operator on \"Hunter Prey\" which earned him the job of cinematographer on \"Shallow Water\". He has worked on many feature films, the most notable being \"Apocalypto\", in the camera department.\nFelipe on the trailer shoot; Sandy (in character) to his left.\nTimeline, budget and USE OF PROCEEDS --\nPRE-PRODUCTION: Oct, 2015\nSHOOTING: Mar, 2016 (Est)\nPOST-PRODUCTION: June, 2016 - Nov, 2016\nPROJECTED RELEASE: 2017, TBD\nAfter Kickstarter fees, credit card processing fees, and the fulfillment of all Rewards, the balance of the budget will be spent as follows:  \n35% on Pre-Production: props, costumes, set building, and special makeup and other practical effects.  \n35% on Shooting: cast and crew (talent and staff); camera and lighting and sound; and misc (location fees, food & amenities, etc. ). \n15% on Post-Production: mostly (sound and video) editing.  \n15% on Pre-Marketing and Pre-Distribution efforts\nWHY Kickstarter?\n\"Simple. Kickstarter is collaboration and creative freedom. It affords me flexibility I would not have with a publisher or a studio. By funding a project on Kickstarter, it can be collaborative yet still allow me to execute my vision. It really is a wonderful model. I love engaging with my backers, and I enjoy delivering what I've promised.

There will be a VERY limited number of these available after we finish shooting the movie. This is your chance to own an original screen used piece from \"Shallow Water\". Hey, you never know... if this film becomes a cult classic, you'll own a piece of horror movie history!\nScreen used creature suits and stunt masks.\n9/28 NEW REWARD ADDED!!!\nWell, here it is, the ReAction style action figure of THE TIBURONERA! Check out the two new reward tiers or add it to any existing tier or pledge, for 45 dollars (plus 6.00 shipping on the $6-$70 tiers) Just adjust your pledge accordingly and send us a message so we know to include the figure in your package!!!\nYou wanted it. Now you got it...\nPLAY\n\nA prototype of our poster (below).

Every single cent will be on the screen, I promise you. This money, after all the rewards are made, shipped and the fees paid, is the bare minimum needed to make this ambitious film.

I've been in and around the industry almost 30 years and learned from some of the best in the business. \n\nWe've got a great story, and an excellent script, and I've already created the primary creature. A significant portion of the crew is already aboard and they are accomplished veterans, many of whom have worked with me before on my previous films and commercials. The locations for the shoot have been determined and negotiated, and there are a limited number of sets. All these variables increase efficiency and ensure that upon funding, everything promised will be delivered.\n\nI understand the film making process; developing a realistic schedule, a scope of work, and a budget. I know how to adhere staunchly, and when to adjust.

The advent of smart devices, music streaming services and digital music files has made it more convenient to access limitless library of music everywhere we go.\nLeft behind in this transformation are the traditional Hi-Fi sound systems, legacy stereo receivers and music docks that can be found in virtually every home.\nEven though the traditional audio systems deliver far superior sound quality, they don\u2019t allow access to the full range of music streaming options. \nWell\u2026not anymore!!!\nauris bluMe has been designed to transform your audio experience, seamlessly blending your current digital music technology with your classic audio equipment.\nIt's a true high fidelity Bluetooth music receiver that streams high quality audio wirelessly from any Bluetooth enabled smartphone, computer or tablet to any music system or powered speakers. bluMe allows you to enjoy all of your high definition digital music with all the clarity, crispness and full emotional impact your legacy Hi-Fi audio system can deliver.\nIt's a super high fidelity component that brings out the full sound quality potential that is hidden inside the Bluetooth protocol.\nWith a reputation for poor sound quality and limited operating range, why would we chose Bluetooth over various other wireless audio options such as Airplay, Sonos, etc.? The answer is access and compatibility.\nEvery modern smartphone, tablet and laptop comes Bluetooth equipped, providing instant compatibility for all. It doesn\u2019t need additional drivers, software, apps, or to be within the range of a wireless router. Bluetooth is a familiar technology to everyone and its ease of use and convenience is proven by the surging popularity of portable Bluetooth speakers today.\nbluMe is more than a Bluetooth music receiver; it\u2019s also a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC). Digital tracks are simple sequences of code. To turn this code into a signal that speakers can recognize, you need digital-to-analogue converters (DACs for short).\nPoor quality DACs can lose detail in the conversion process. We tested countless DACs over many months and in the end decided to work with the world-renowned 'Miracle DAC' AK4396 by AKM, a top of the line high fidelity DAC usually found only in top shelf audiophile home audio and home theater systems.\nIt\u2019s a true 192kHz 24-bit upsampling DAC sporting a high SNR of 120dB and is well regarded for its impressive low noise and low distortion characteristics. in short, this means that the sound you hear is crystal clear, rich and retains a wonderfully full dynamic range.\nbluMe applies the latest in Bluetooth technology, the Bluetooth 4.1 to stream any format of music from your smart device, laptop or PC.\nMost devices use the basic SBC Bluetooth music codec. While this may be okay for some, but if you want great quality, it's simply not good enough.\nbluMe uses Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) and aptX\u00ae, a superior performance digital audio codec. This combination of advanced hardware and firmware preserves all the musical detail, dynamic range and full bandwidth response, bringing out the best possible sound from your digital sources, for a sound that is far superior to standard Bluetooth streamed music.\nThe delay between your TV and speakers is a common problem within many wireless audio solutions. With bluMe, enjoy great movies knowing that picture and sound will always sync perfectly.\nbluMe features the latest aptX\u00ae Low Latency technology that reduces this latency down to less than 40 ms, eliminating lip-sync issues to give you the smoothest audio/visual experience available.\nLimited range and signal dropouts have traditionally plagued Bluetooth audio systems.\nTo combat this issue, bluMe employs special circuitry and a precision-tuned external high gain antenna to extend the wireless range, ensuring consistent, stable, strong, and glitch-free performance for 30 meters (100 feet), providing much more versatility than other Bluetooth receivers.\nbluMe's cutting edge technology maintains a robust and balanced wireless sound experience that is unaffected by interference from surrounding wireless networks.\nThis results in superior 24-bit, upsampled audio that will completely redefine your perception of wireless sound.\nbluMe has two high quality gold-plated RCA jacks that operate as analog outputs. Any audio system with a standard analog audio input can connect to bluMe with the supplied RCA-RCA signal cable.\nFor systems that have 3.5mm \u201cmini\u201d jack input, use the supplied RCA-mini cable.\nbluMe also features a Digital Optical (SPIDF) Out so that you can connect to an outboard DAC or the digital input of a surround receiver, giving you a 100% pure high-res digital signal through to your sound system.\nPairing any smart device to bluMe is a breeze. Simply push the control button on the front of the unit briefly and it automatically goes into pairing mode. Activate Bluetooth in your smart device, select \"auris bluMe\" from the list of available devices and you\u2019re ready to rock!\nbluMe can connect to one smart device at a time, but is capable of remembering up to 8 devices. When more than one device needs to stream through bluMe, just turn Bluetooth off in the first device, turn Bluetooth on in the second, and select \"auris bluMe\" as the device. There is no need to reset bluMe and press its control button a second time once the device is stored.\nEven powering bluMe is easy. Draw power from a wall socket, or from the included USB cable, which means you can power it directly from your PC, Laptop, and more recent TVs and sound systems.\nResult of an elaborate manufacturing process, the chassis is extruded out of aerospace grade aluminum and high quality anodizing provides optimum protection and finish.\nbluMe is a premium product in every sense which completely blends while sitting next to even the costliest and most attractive home audio components.\nVast majority of us tend to hard wire our smart devices to an audio system by either using a dock that pulls analog out of the device or by hooking up to the headphone output jack. In both cases the digital signal is processed by cheap low fidelity DAC used in all smart devices.\nWith bluMe the digital signal is processed by its high-end DAC and audio decoders. No wonder bluMe sounds better than wired hookups!\nbluMe can play any audio source a Bluetooth enabled device can access, opening up a virtually unlimited universe of music to enjoy through your Hi-Fi audio system.\nSo you\u2019re always in control not just of the music that\u2019s stored on your device but also access music streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify, internet radio stations, podcasts and even music libraries connected to a wireless home network...all instantly, wirelessly in Hi-Fi quality.\nWith a choice of either Black, Gold or Silver you\u2019re sure to find a bluMe that matches your stereo system.\nbluMe ships with a specially designed drawstring microfiber bag. You can now put bluMe in it's little microfiber bag, stick it in your coat pocket and take it with you anywhere there is power, a stereo amp or powered speakers and a Bluetooth device to provide the music.\nMade out of high quality microfiber, this pouch will protect bluMe from dust, scratches and is the perfect fabric for eliminating pesky fingerprints.\nWith every Auris product, you receive our 1-year Limited Warranty.

Not to mention your waistline fluctuates during the day... shouldn't your belt, too?\nThe Kemer Belt brings together premium materials, strong design elements, and versatility to provide all-day comfort, unique styling, and simple transitions from the office, to the outdoors, to the couch.\nWe want to keep this very simple... we love these belts, and we think you will, too. We started wearing our first belt samples over 12 months ago, and we have been wearing them ever since.\nKemer Belts are simple, versatile, comfortable, stylish, reversible, travel-friendly, water-friendly, and adult and kid approved. Choose from among 6 adult/youth belt designs and 2 kids belt designs as shown below:\n                We are working with one of the top manufacturers of elastic jacquard to ensure the highest quality materials and the best weave. We have tested the materials with all kinds of clothing, in multiple weather conditions, and in various work, play, and chill environments \u2013 and they are ready for prime time.\n\nSome of our favorite features of the belt include:\nWe doubled the wardrobe options by making each belt reversible. In most cases, the reverse design is a solid color for ultimate flexibility. However, our crowning jewel is the Brooklyn belt crafted in \u201cHerringtooth\u201d design - you get Herringbone on one side and Houndstooth on the other.\nThe belts transition perfectly from work to play. Choose a conservative design for work attire, and then flip, untuck, and head out for some after-work sport or fun.\nThe belts really do make every pair of pants feel like your favorite pair of sweatpants. The elastic jacquard expands and contracts with your waist throughout the day and flexes with you no matter which way you bend, stretch, stoop, jump, or flip.\nOur belts have traveled thousands of miles and have racked up a lot of frequent flyer miles. You may have to take off your shoes for airport security, but these belts stay on and breeze right through metal detectors and security scanners.\nThe belts are the perfect companion for advanced quick-dry shorts and other beachwear. And, don\u2019t worry if you accidentally leave your belt in your favorite pair of jeans when you throw them in the wash.\nThe simple high-strength polymer buckle makes it easy for kids to open and close the belt for easy access (in case of emergencies!). Kids love the fun designs, too.\nKemer Belts are completely adjustable, but come in two general sizes \u2013 Adult/Youth size and Kids size. In both cases, the belts are one-size-fits-most where the Adult/Youth belts fit up to a 38-40 inch waist, while the Kids belts fit . . . . well, they fit kids!\n             We have enjoyed watching the design community simplify the accessories we use everyday, and we want to participate. We love simplicity, we love design, and we love to create. We had the idea for the Kemer Belt during one of our brainstorming sessions on the potential uses of elastic webbing. Our thoughts quickly took us to one of the accessories we use every day \u2013 the belt. We sourced jacquard elastic from a local supplier and simulated the reversibility by sewing two different designs together back-to-back.\nWithin a couple of days \u2013 and with the help of a great seamstress (thanks Aimee) \u2013 we had a working sample. From there, we kicked into design and material sourcing mode. It has taken much longer than we thought to find the right factory, but we are pleased to have ended up with premier manufacturing and product development partners.\nWe have come a long way since our first working sample, and we are excited about the finished product.

With close to 1 million views on my channel, I am humbled at the world-wide reach and interest in my videos. My wife, who does the camera work for most of my videos, and I have been touched by all the praise for our production quality and useful information I share in my videos. I love creating these videos because it feels good to pass on the knowledge of the traditional painting techniques that I've honed over the years. If you haven't seen my YouTube channel, you should go visit it to see what all the fuss is about :-)\nBut as much as I share about painting processes in my YouTube videos, there is only so much I can squeeze into a 15- or 30-minute video, so I have decided to create the most comprehensive acrylic painting technique video I can possibly imagine.\nThis is where I need your help. Because my wife and I create our videos all by ourselves, it takes a lot of planning, filming, and editing to make even the simplest of videos for my YouTube channel. But now I want to create a four-hour long video. It's a monster of a project that we look forward to tackling. By pledging to my project, you are not only helping me to cover the cost of manufacturing the DVDs, you're giving me the most important thing I need: Time. To create this full length video, I will have to free up at least three months of time to make it happen. That means I won't be able to take on my usual freelance work, which is how I make my income.\nSo please look over the details of this project below. I hope you will consider pledging. I thank you so very much for any support you can give.\nVERY IMPORTANT: I have not yet created the artwork that will be featured in this technique video. The imagery you see on this page (grey and green monster with blue tongue) is only used to give you an example of what the packaging will look like. This is not the final image. I hope to share sketches of the final art during the course of this Kickstarter campaign.\n\nThe content of this video will benefit beginners to professionals at any stage of their careers. My goal is to not only give you the most detailed look at my acrylic painting process but also to answer your many questions about creating an acrylic painting from start to finish. I will focus heavily on creating a professional fantasy painting for a paying client. This video won't just cover the \"how;\" it will also cover the \"why.\"\n\nHere are some of the topics and techniques that will be demonstrated in this video:\nBrainstorming/Conceptualization \nAnatomy (Creature and Human) \nUsing Reference Photos\nDrawing from the Imagination\nTools for Sketching (Types, Care, and Use)\nThumbnail Sketching\nComposition\nFinal Sketch\nColor Roughs\nColor Theory and Composition\nPainting Surfaces (Preparation, Materials, and Tools)\nTransferring the Final Drawing to its Painting Surface\nPlanning the Stages of Painting\nPalettes (Types, Care, and Use)\nPaints (Types, Care, and Use)\nBrushes (Types, Care, and Use)\nSolvents (Types, Care, and Use)\nMediums (Types, Care, and Use)\nUnderpainting (Process and Purpose)\nGlazing and Scumbling\nBuilding Form through Layering\nOpaque versus Transparent Color\nMixing and Blending Colors\nPainting Problematic Subjects (Glass, Metal, Skin Tones)\nPainting Effects (Splatters, Textures, etc.)\nAirbrush (Care and Use)\nWork Area (Easel, Drawing Table, Dining Room Table)\nSealing The Final Painting (Materials and Use)\nGeneral Safety (Tools and Materials)\nAs you can see, this video will be packed with information.

And your neck? Probably not too great. Or you\u2019re already in so much pain that someone sent you here (hugs). BetterBack allows you to effortlessly sit in perfect posture, easing back pain.\nHighlights\nBetterBack makes every chair ergonomic \u2013 Instead of spending hundreds of dollars on one chair, you can make every chair ergonomic. Lightweight and portable, you can throw BetterBack in your purse or backpack.\nNext gen back support \u2013  The keystone to good posture is the pelvis. Traditional back supports only focus on your lumbar spine. BetterBack stabilizes your pelvis, restoring your spine's natural curvature, and provides lumbar support. \n15 minutes a day \u2013 Like dumbbells at a gym, BetterBack helps you build up your posture muscles. Wear it for as little as 15 minutes a day to achieve great posture when you stand or sit on your own.\n                                      BetterBack allows you to effortlessly sit in perfect posture, easing back pain. Even if you don\u2019t have back pain, wearing it for just 15 minutes a day can retrain your default posture, so when you stand or sit without BetterBack, your posture is greatly improved. Good posture boosts your mood, confidence, motivation and overall health. \nTake a few seconds to re-posture yourself right now. If you\u2019re sitting, chances are your back isn\u2019t touching your chair at all. That\u2019s because most chairs aren\u2019t ergonomic, and many actually encourage bad posture. BetterBack makes every chair ergonomic. Sit effortlessly in perfect posture at your desk. Or on a plane. Or at a game. You get the idea.\nYou get fast results and long term comfort. Put BetterBack on in 5 seconds flat!\n                                    Sit in perfect posture for minutes or hours. We took sizing into account from the 1 percentile woman all the way up to the 99 percentile man, so BetterBack can be adjusted to fit just about every body.\nImagine going to 50 of the best doctors, therapists and trainers around the world and asking them for their #1 posture tip. Well we did, and we put them together into an eBook for you.\nOr get the Better Posture eBook FOR FREE!\nIf you\u2019re not in a place to financially contribute to our campaign, we still care about your posture and your health!

Be the first to try them during prototyping and the first to own them after production. Plus, grab a flight to San Francisco and we'll get you set up with a custom training program, including three personalized workouts with Vint. We'll also roll out the red carpet for you and a friend to enjoy a chef-prepared dinner at my apartment with the amazing people who helped bring this project to life.

Please note that if you live outside of those regions, you may be responsible for local duties, fees and taxes.\nA few years ago, in the lovely year of 2012, I was the co-founder of a startup, Everest, that was building technology to help people live their dreams and achieve personal goals. I was mostly in front of a computer 12+ hours a day, but we also put on the Dream Series, which were meaningful events to help kickstart people's dreams. A few hours after an amazing obstacle course run through Golden Gate Park, my sciatica pain began. The pain and discomfort made it hard to concentrate, do great work and enjoy life.\nPost-race wearing the trophy (the Golden Shoes) a few hours before sciatica pain would forever change my life. #NotWorthIt\nI tried dozens of products, therapies and techniques to help with my back pain. Many of them had great features, but weren't full solutions for me. The Neo G Posture Brace: helped with alignment, but it was difficult to breathe and really bulky under my clothes; Easy Posture Lumbar Support: I still managed to wiggle and slump in my chair, and it only helped when I sat at my desk; the Nada Chair: brilliant knee form and pelvic stabilization, but gave me knee pain after just a few minutes of wear; LF Ultrasound: provided short-term pain relief, but it was fleeting; Memory Foam Knee Pillow: provided better alignment when I started sleep, but would end up in the bottom of my bed; and on and on.\nA friend and I spent weeks tinkering with anything we could find to help get back support. There are still taped together take-out soup containers for lumbar support floating around my apartment. The first version of the BetterBack knees? A cut out from the top of a mega-sized protein bottle. \nMaking the latest knee prototypes. So many iterations in between!\nI had no idea how many people were suffering from back pain when this all began. I felt way too young to have back pain, personally. Friends or colleagues would see me wearing the early versions of BetterBack and ask to try it. As soon as they did, I would get messages all the time: \"Oh hey, I'm flying to New York on Tuesday, any chance I can borrow that thing you wear?\" Or \"My back is acting up, any chance I can just borrow it until Friday?\" I had no idea so many people were suffering. I began to do more research and was blown away by what I found.  I decided to make more -- and invest time and money into making it better. \nSix prototypes later, I began working with manufacturers to build a high quality, well crafted and incredibly comfortable posture strap I would be proud to see my mom wear. And your mom too, if she doesn't have an awesome back.\nI'm on Kickstarter for two reasons. One, I'm hoping 500 people will pledge so I can hit the minimum order quantity and produce the very first run of BetterBacks. Even more importantly, I'm hoping to find people who will go on the journey with me to get a better back. I want to hear your story, what has worked and hasn't worked for you in the past, understand how BetterBack helps you and how it can help you better.  Please join me.\nGood posture affects your health, your mood and your motivation. Most people only begin to understand the importance of posture after their body is so damaged from slumping that sitting aches become chronic pain. I know because I am one of them.\nMy mission is to help people be their best selves and unlock their full potential. Without health, that is impossible; it is the foundation for everything else.\nI have spent the last few years learning about back pain, trying a huge range of products and therapies, and developing BetterBack with dozens on dozens of bad backs and amazing souls.\nThe relief and support people feel while wearing BetterBack\u2014and even after\u2014is truly amazing. No matter how many times or tools you\u2019ve tried to sit pain free, BetterBack is like posture training wheels so you can experience and integrate good posture into your life for good.\nI have self funded the design, development and sampling for BetterBack. Our final prototype has been well tested and our manufacturers are ready to go. Every dollar pledged will go towards manufacturing, quality assurance, packaging and shipping. \nBetterBack was my first Kickstarter campaign. It has been some of the most amazing and challenging few weeks of my life. If you are thinking of running a crowdfunding campaign, I encourage you to take the leap and go for it. You will connect with the most incredible global community of supporters and get to bring a part of yourself to life. I wanted to share some of the amazingly talented people who contributed to my campaign; maybe one day they will help you with your campaign too.\nIndustrial Design // I had the chance to work with three amazing industrial designers on the development of BetterBack.\nAndy Storms is a softgoods and SolidWorks pro.

He is also a super talented designer. Check him out at instagram.com/julianbialowas\nMarketing // I had an extensive marketing plan developed before I launched my Kickstarter campaign and will be writing about what worked and what didn't on my website katherinekrug.com. The soma creators have a great post and Stonemaier Games has a series of helpful posts on KS marketing.\nI wasn't expecting so many marketing companies to reach out after I launched my campaign (be ready for it!) and I decided to try out a handful of them. By far these were the best:\nFunded Today - These guys brought a wealth of experience and expertise to my campaign. I just wish I had known about them earlier.  I'm certain I would not have reached $1M without their help. Find them at http://bit.ly/1EMP9eC\nBackerClub - These guys have a strong community of engaged Kickstarter backers and a fun rewards club. BackerClub.co \nSpecial thanks to Dr. Ryan Lawlor for his tremendous help (www.drlawlor.com), Ramon and Renato for helping me test new marketing channels (GrowthHack.com.br), Josh Krigman as a hugely talented writer (joshkrigman.com), Collin Hughes for photography in my video (http://collin-hughes.com/), and Jonathan Swanson, Pam Krug and Peter Dering for their endless support. \nBear hug to every single one of the backers who supported bringing BetterBack to life! \nVisit us at www.getbetterback.com\nHow much should I wear it?\nSit in perfect posture for minutes or hours. It is comfortable to wear all day long, but even 15 minutes a day can greatly improve the quality of your life.\nWill I look stupid wearing it?\nIt's hard to believe, but most people don't even notice when you're wearing it. I sit through meals, meetings and flights with BetterBack on and it's only when I'm taking it off that people tend to notice it, with a \"you've been wearing that this whole time?!!\" The thing that tends to happen next is someone shares their story of back pain and asks to try it on. \nHow comfortable are the knee straps?\nI have absolutely terrible knees (at one point I was put in two leg casts because of feet and knee injuries, later having surgery on my right knee). We spent a lot of time designing the knee cushions so that the force was widely distributed and comfortable for people who have knee problems *and* back problems.\nCan I wear BetterBack while I drive?\nUnfortunately, no. BetterBack is not safe to wear driving, or when you need quick leg mobility. It is great for sitting at your desk, eating, meeting, going to a movie, sitting on an airplane, meditating, etc. Note: you can wear BetterBack cross-legged! \nHow is this different than the Nada Chair?\nLet me start by pouring heaps of praise and adoration on Dr. Toso who came up the knee form to help people with their posture. I have tried the Nada Chair and while I loved the stabilization it offered, it unfortunately hurt my knees very badly to wear after just a few minutes. It wasn\u2019t a solution for me as a result.\nBetterBack uses the same knee form as the Nada Chair, but the design and construction of the knee pads, back support and straps are new, incorporating six rounds of prototyping with two amazing Industrial Designers and the feedback of 62 wonderful backs who beta tested it last year and this year. Here are some of the ways BetterBack is different:\nKnees, knees, knees!\nWe use PE (polyethylene) to disperse force and foam to provide cushiony comfort on the knees, so even people with bad knees can wear BetterBack. Because of backer support, everyone\u2019s knee pads will now include thicker compression molded foam for even more durability and comfort. :)\nBack pad\nBetterBack is worn outside of clothing, but it can still get hot on an airplane, at a game or when things heat up at work. BetterBack combines a perforated foam and spacer mesh for maximum back breathability, without sacrificing lumbar support.\nStraps & Adjustability\nStrap adjusters are placed where your hands naturally rest, for easy tightening and loosening. Quick slip keepers keep the straps flush against BetterBack for a clean and minimalist look.\nUsability\nWe\u2019ve developed two ways to make sure people can put BetterBack on quickly and correctly. The first is using a poly cotton fabric for the outside materials and a spacer mesh for the inside materials that touch your body. On inside surfaces, we\u2019ve also included easy to read icons so you know exactly which way is up without any guessing.\nMaterials\nWe want people to feel good and confident wearing BetterBack, so we\u2019ve sourced high quality, durable materials similar to what you\u2019d find in fashion, rather than in the medical section.\nThis all started in my kitchen, trying to make something to help me with my excruciating sciatica pain. My friends and people I\u2019d meet all around San Francisco turned out to need it too. Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would be such a success on Kickstarter! I believe Dr. Toso was a visionary and I hope to see much more attention and innovation on the knee form/pelvis stabilization in the years to come, just as innovation on lumbar support products mean people looking can find something just right for them.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have extensive manufacturing and operational experience (I used to manufacture interiors to large condominium buildings and hotels), plus two manufacturers capable of delivering BetterBack. One thing I know for sure: something unexpected always comes up. I\u2019ve buffered my timeline to account for unexpected curveballs that may impact the schedule, so I can deliver BetterBack to you on time. These things could also impact the delivery schedule:\n\nVolume - sometimes Kickstarter campaigns wildly exceed a project creator\u2019s expectation. If we hit huge volume, it may push the timeline back, likely to the tune of 14 days. \n\nReally awesome ideas - I know I will receive some amazing ideas and insights from the Kickstarter community. I don't want to lose out on the ability to deliver you a superior product, if it can be reasonably done.\n\nFreight - Port closures and customs delays happen. It\u2019s impossible to know when and for how long. The buffer calculated into the timeline should cover this, but it is an unknown.\n\nMy goal is to deliver the highest quality, most effective posture strap on the market. I will work my back off for you and deliver transparency all the way through. Feel free to reach out to me personally anytime you have a thought, idea or a question at kk@getbetterback.com.\n\nLast but not least: any pledge amount brings us closer to our goal -- both of hitting our first production run and of building awareness around good posture.

They will cover everything from prosthetic makeup, puppets, and stop motion as well as some of the cutting edge work being done with CGI these days. I feel this is yet another way to explore and share my passion for creatures, monsters, makeup, film and toys, by bringing you the best quality books possible, at an affordable price.\nAuthor Sandy Collora sculpts a maquette for his film; \"Shallow Water\".\nThis second installment, appropriately titled The Art of Creature and Character Design Volume 2, will focus mostly on maquettes, models and miniatures. This volume will be a little bit more of a \"how to\" book, showing the techniques of making armatures, sculpting in different mediums and painting for the film industry, toys, models and miniature gaming pieces.\nCollaborations by the author with Jose Fernandez and Jordu Schell.\nIt will feature some awesome collaborations done over the years by myself, Jordu Schell and a few other artists returning from the first book, as well as showcasing the art of some of the most revered and widely respected names in the collectible sculpture and model kit industry. The Shiflett Brothers; Brandon and Jarod, Tony Cipriano, Tim Bruckner, Shawn Nagle and Mike Hill are just a few of the amazing artists that will be featured in this stunning volume.\nThe Shifletts, Shawn Nagle and Brandt Peters.\nOne of the greatest things that happened over the course of compiling the first book, was getting introduced to some astounding artists that I'd never heard of before, who will be included in Volume 2. These European artisans simply made my jaw drop, with some astonishing miniature and model kit sculpture work. Patrick Masson, Giorgos Tsougkouzidis, Jason Monkman and Apikit Mechan, will be joining Brandt Peters, Damon Bard, Chris Gabrish, Mark Newman and others, to round out the roster of simply brilliant artists in The Art of Creature and Character Design Volume 2.\nThe brilliant miniature work of Patrick Masson.\nDamon Bard, Giorgos Tsougkouzidis, and Apikit Mechan\nAnd if you missed the opportunity to grab the first book, don't worry... There's two reward tiers that feature BOTH copies! The first book is almost sold out, so there will be a limited number of rewards in these tiers.\nStay tuned for more news, imagery and stretch goals in this exciting new chapter in The Art of Creature and Character Design. Thanks again for all your love and support on book one. It was truly a collaborative effort, that I couldn't have done without all my colleagues and most importantly, all of YOU.\nHere is the T shirt that has been added to ALL the reward tiers. Basically, I've created a new reward tier for each one available and added 13 dollars for the shirt. If you've already pledged, and would like the shirt, just look for the same tier you backed, with the 13 dollars added on and adjust your pledge! It's that simple. The other REALLY cool and exciting thing about this, is that it's opened up a new reward tier for the early bird, giving you another chance to get the softcover for 30 dollars AND the T shirt. This is reward tier #7 and it gives people 50 more chances to get the early bird price on the book if you want the Tee! Shirts will available from Small to 5X. (2x and above sizes will require a few more dollars that will be invoiced when I send out the surveys.)\nC'mon, who doesn't love to make monsters?\nThanks again from the bottom of my heart,\nSC\n\nHere are some reviews from the first book;", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA book is always a difficult undertaking. Good printing to do a book of this quality is not cheap, and it's a lot of work. I've had to wrangle the help of a lot of different artists, to contribute to the book. Shipping to foreign countries also presents challenges, but it simply comes down to whether backers outside the US are willing to pay extra for the shipping of the actual book. It makes it more expensive, and that's why I'm offering a digital download as well, for my foreign backers. Printing also has a tendency to run a bit behind schedule, especially to a perfectionist like me. In the event that situation arises, I will keep everyone appraised of the situation with constant updates, just like I did on my last very successful KICKSTARTER campaign for The Art of Creature and Character Design Volume 1, where I kept everyone updated along the way and had a great time doing it.

I am very happy with how that book turned out, and have heard from many very happy backers about its quality. Now, I want to make available, through this project, the sister book to that one.\nI have found more than 600 drawings I\u2019d like to include in this book, from rough sketches to finished drawings. Some are pencil, some are ink, and some are a combination. These span my full 40 year career, from my TSR days through last week! Some are sketches and drawings used as the basis for some of my more famous paintings, but many you've probably never seen before.\nThis book, being the sister book to that first one, will be the same 9\" x 12\" size and encompass 256 pages. Depending on your pledge amount, you can own this book as a standard coffee-table hardback edition, or a deluxe leather-bound limited edition; as well as other bonuses, such as special prints, a Complete Elmore slipcase for both books, or even the original drawing used for the cover itself.\nI want to make it clear that this book is being published by me, Larry Elmore, and is being assembled, packaged and shipped by only three people: my wife, Betty, my friend, Gary Triplett, and myself. Betty is an unbelievably hard worker when it comes to packaging and shipping these books. She\u2019s a morning person, so she\u2019s constantly pushing us to get an earlier start on each day and get done before midnight! Gary has been a special help with the editing and order fulfillment on my first Kickstarter project, the full-color Complete Elmore. He also helped me on my SnarfQuest New Adventure Kickstarter: The Plains of Sashaar, with editing, coloring, layout and order fulfillment. He is continuing to help me in all aspects of this project as well. Gary not only has a Master\u2019s degree in IT, he also taught English as a professor at a Korean University for ten years and is currently writing his own series of fantasy books\u2026 all of which makes him a great editor.\nThe leatherback edition of this book is limited to 500 and is only going to be available through this Kickstarter. The standard hardcover edition of the book is being made available at a special Kickstarter price, but after the Kickstarter will be made available through my website (larryelmore.com) and conventions for the retail price of $75.\nI want to say one more thing, and this is very important to me. YOU are helping me realize my dream of bringing this collection of almost all my artwork, throughout my career, to you, my fans. You guys have been instrumental in my long successful career as an illustrator. Without your appreciation and support I probably couldn\u2019t hold a job as a Wal-Mart greeter\u2026 \u2018cause I\u2019d be drawing all the time! J\nThank you in advance for your pledge!\nCover Drawing \"Rough\"\n This is the \"rough\" (sketch) drawing of the front cover for this book. The final, finished drawing will appear on both the standard and leatherback versions of the book. High-quality offset prints of this drawing at full, one-to-one ratio size are available with certain packages.\n What does the book contain?\n336 pages of EVERYTHING ink or pencil that I can still reproduce, from my TSR days through last week! Here's some \"layout spread\" sample pages. We're busily putting the book together to be ready to print as soon as funding comes in. The guidelines that you see in these images will not be in the printed book.\nIf we achieve a funding level in excess of $40K, I want to give all backer levels a set of five 8\" x 10\" black and white prints selected from among my favorite drawings.\nIf we achieve a funding level in excess of $75K, I can expand the book to the same size as the Complete Elmore color book, 336 pages! All books, both standard and leatherback editions, will be expanded to this larger size.\n If we achieve a funding level in excess of $90K, I will add an ADDITIONAL set of five prints (for a total of 10) to all backer tiers. Included will be the rarely-seen preliminary sketch for my very popular \"Avalyne the Life-Giver\" painting.\nIf we achieve a funding level in excess of $110K, I will invite all backers to come visit my studio in Leitchfield, KY, on a day TBA in 2016.\n If we achieve a funding level in excess of $125K, I will add an ADDITIONAL set of five prints (for a total of 15!) to all backer tiers, selected from among my favorite drawings. One drawing TBA if we near the goal!\nALL Original Drawing Packages include \"The Works\"--Leatherbound B&W book, standard edition B&W book, slipcase and print.\n\"LIGHTLY-COMMISSIONED\" ORIGINAL DRAWING\"\nFor these five packages (only) Larry will accept a simple fantasy or sci-fi suggestion from the backer, such as \"sexy elf girl\" or \"dragon in flight\" or \"plate-armored cleric guy\" or \"Shadowrun guy with dual pistols\" but not complex character descriptions, specific or especially copyrighted characters. For example, he will not accept \"Everquest girl\" or \"Sturm from Dragonlance\" or \"Zelda\". As these will be a large part of his new work into next year, Larry wants these to be drawings he can make prints of to sell at conventions. The lighter the suggestion the better. Ideally, tell him, \"Do something cool.\"\nIMPORTANT!!! --THIS DRAWING WILL NOT BE STARTED UNTIL 2016--\nThe other package rewards will ship in October like everyone else's, but the drawing will be completed and shipped separately sometime next year. International backers at this level will not be asked to pay additional postage for this separate 2016 mailing of the drawing, only the amount for shipping the books and print.\nSMALL \"NON-COMMISSION\" DRAWING PACKAGE\nThese ten packages include \"pot-luck\" original Elmore drawing. It will be whatever comes out of Larry's brain when he sits down to do it. It may be pencil, ink or a combination. It may be a girl, a guy, a dragon head, a critter, etc. Some samples of drawings Larry did as part of the color art book campaign are included below. Larry intends to include the drawing with the book shipped in October, but as October is on the tail end of convention season he may have to mail it separate if they don't get done in time.\nSAMPLES from first project--these are not the drawings included\nOTHER ORIGINAL DRAWING PACKAGES\nNOTE: Many of these drawings are completed on tracing paper (or vellum, a thick, high-quality tracing paper) as part of Larry's creative process.

For a time, I decided that I really should try being a responsible adult, and went to school for non-art, adult things, and began a far more \u201cresponsible\u201d career. Soon, however, I found that I couldn\u2019t stop doodling, and creating. Art just kept calling to me. So I went back to school to learn more about my true passion, and began allowing myself to do that which I really loved. I graduated from art school in 2009, and have been working toward my artistic goals ever since. These goals include original art, fan art, concept art, commissions, and the creation of my own independent comic book.\n I have been very fortunate to have lots of support along my journey, and now I want to share with you some of the memories, and works I\u2019ve collected along the way. Thanks for being a part of my dream!\nHere are some more examples of what you will find in this art book.\nPinups!\nPinup interior example\n Heroes\nHeroes interior example\nComic book pages, layouts and notes.\nComic book sample page\n Sketches\nSketch sample\n and so much more! Over 100 images as well as notes on how I work.\nSo why should you support this art book? Well, first of all, supporting this art book means that I can share more of my artistic adventures with more people, and lets face it we all need to see people who have had similar struggles, and dreams. They are very inspiring. \nSecond, have you ever wanted to look more sophisticated, and have a fancy coffee table book, but wanted art that was a bit more fun than the typical gallery stuff? Then this is the book for you. It looks great, and the art is dynamic, fun and satisfies the more discerning palate of the comic geek. \nIf you don\u2019t love the book, or get too bored with it after a while, it can always serve to support the coffee table that may be a little wobbly, or it can serve in the capacity of paper weight, paper flattener, beverage coaster, and many other creative uses. Clearly, you can\u2019t go wrong getting this book.\n Lastly supporting my art book, regardless of the amount of your pledge, helps me to further my dream, which in turn makes you my hero. Being a hero is both personally rewarding, and looks good on a resume.\nWHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR?\nThe artwork accumulated for this project covers several years, and so far everything for my art has been an out of pocket expense, from pencils, paper, and erasers, to a computer, proper programs, advertising, and marketing.\nNow it's time to take it to the next level, and I need your help!\nBy supporting my art, not only do you get the benefit of a bit more beauty in your life, but you help me to become better known, which in turn helps me to help more people that may be in need of feedback for their work, beginning artists who may be interested in learning a few things to help them hone their skills, and in producing more art and beauty in the world.\nThe money will be used to pay for the printing of the art books, as well as the cost of delivering them to your door.\n(Remember, you will not be charged until the end of the campaign on April 2nd and ONLY if the goal is met. )\nThe rewards:\nUpdate (3/4/15) New Reward added.

The story art gorgeously illustrated  by FABRIZIO FIORENTINO, whom we collaborated with on ALL STAR WESTERN and this is complimented by the lush digital painting of  ALESSIA NOCERA. Also featured is a dynamic and beautiful cover by award winning illustrator TIM BRADSTREET , with special reward catagories featuring a special limited edition mystery cover by multiple Eisner and Shuster Award winner DARWYN COOKE and another special cover by award winning and fan favorite artist  AMANDA CONNER. We are happy to also announce our new partnership with  the awesome crew at ADAPTIVE  STUDIOS . \nThis entire square bound SOFTCOVER book will be a total of 72 pages plus material printed on the best paper stock available and printed in the USA. We need to raise the amount featured to cover production handling and distribution costs involved in producing an original graphic novel this big and beautiful. \nThe inspiration for this project comes from our love of mature westerns, murder mysteries and the horror genre as well as the original unpublished screenplay it is based on. This was a project we fell in love with immediately. \n\nTHE STORY:\n\n\u201cIn the distance the silhouette of a sprawling boomtown rises ominously from the earth like a gravestone risen from Hell.\u201d\n  Set in the late 1880\u2019s American West, Abbadon is a city steeped in sin, where anything is possible if you have the money, influence and power to obtain it. Poised to become the next boomtown, Abbadon is plagued by a series of murders heralding the arrival of U.S. Marshall Wes Garrett. A legendary lawman, Garrett\u2019s claim to fame is that he killed a notorious murderer, who cut a bloody swath across the country and left scores of mutilated men, women and children in his wake. Garrett\u2019s arrival exposes the secret that Abbadon\u2019s sheriff Colt Dixon has desperately been trying to conceal \u2013 the victims have all been mutilated the same way they were by the killer Garret stopped \u2013 a man some called a monster, but the papers called him Bloody Bill. Garrett and Dixon join forces to uncover the killer\u2019s identity in a town so full of corruption that everyone is a suspect.

It's not too late to become part of the campaign\u2014check below for our stretch goals, the first two of which have been unlocked!\nBest known for his instrumental contributions to the making of the original Star Wars trilogy, Ralph McQuarrie has inspired several generations of film fans and artists. While much of his Star Wars artwork has been reproduced in numerous volumes over the years, his non-Star Wars work has previously only been available in The Art of Ralph McQuarrie, a limited edition that we (Dreams and Visions Press) published in 2007. That book is long out of print and now commands high prices on the secondary market. \nWith The Art of Ralph McQuarrie: ARCHIVES, we will bring back into print a career-spanning retrospective of Ralph McQuarrie\u2019s non-Star Wars artwork. At 13\u201d x 9.5\u201d, this 432-page volume is not only offered at a more affordable price point than our original 2007 release, one third of the content is original to this edition. That's hundreds of Ralph McQuarrie illustrations spanning all aspects of his body of work.\nTRADE EDITION COVER DESIGN - NOT FINAL\nWe've been hard at work on the book for the past several months. Our efforts have not just been focused on assembling new art, but upgrading source materials where possible, and doing additional research to provide more details on many of the pieces within, both new and old. We are on track to finalize the book this summer, after which we will hand it off to the printer to meet our target release date.\nThe book will be available in two states: 1) a hardcover version with printed covers and 2) a deluxe clothbound individually numbered limited edition housed in a clothbound presentation traycase. Each copy will be smyth-sewn with head and tail bands to provide a sturdy binding that will last for years to come.\nDELUXE EDITION CONCEPT (BOOK WILL BE BOUND ON THE LEFT)\nThe Art of Ralph McQuarrie: ARCHIVES contains examples of Ralph's work in each of the following areas: Early technical illustration, movie posters, book covers, film and television production, other commercial illustration and a selection of personal pieces. In many cases we have examples of work that demonstrate Ralph's process, from his tiniest thumbnails to larger sketches, color comps and ultimately his finished paintings. \nHere are a handful of two-page spreads from the book (the actual size of these spreads will be 26\" x 9.5\"):\nTechnical Illustration\nMovie Posters\nBook Covers\nFilm Concept Art\nCommercial Illustration\nPersonal Work\nBackers at the $75 level and above including the regular hardcover edition of ARCHIVES will receive a 10\" x 8\" bookplate signed by the authors with the cleaned up version of Ralph's 'Power of God' illustration.\nKickstarter exclusive bookplate concept for regular hardcover\nBackers at the $150 level and above including the deluxe hardcover edition of ARCHIVES will also receive an 8\" x 10\" bookplate signed by the authors featuring a drawing to painting rendition of Ralph's first paperback cover for Ballantine Books.\nKickstarter exclusive bookplate concept for deluxe hardcover\nWhile ARCHIVES will be an essential volume in its own right, this book will also be a perfect companion to the previous books of Ralph's art that we've published through the years (which are available in some of the reward packages offered):\nThe Art of Ralph McQuarrie\nOur first book.

The text is in Japanese, but that doesn't prevent one from enjoying page after page of Ralph's glorious contributions to the Star Wars saga. We provide an English language translation of the text as a PDF via email.\nA Gallery of Imagination\nA 48-page 8.5\" x 11\" fully illustrated trade paperback guide to a 2010 gallery exhibit of dozens of Ralph's rare Star Wars illustrations.\nRemembering Ralph McQuarrie\nA 48-page 8.5\" x 11\" trade paperback celebrating the life and work of Ralph McQuarrie. Profusely illustrated with previously unseen images, with remembrances from Ralph's colleagues, friends, and fans, including: Hal Barwood, Phil Tippett, Jon Berg, Harrison Ellenshaw, Doug Chiang, Kevin J.

Read on\u2026\nWrap around cover by Pier Brito\nPREMISE: After a rogue meteor impacts our moon, forcing it off its regular orbit, the oceans rise dramatically, consuming most of the planet\u2019s surface. The United States is under water, with the exception of its last major metropolis: Denver, Colorado. This is not the horrible post-apocalypse world we are used to. It is a showcase of mankind\u2019s greatest achievements and ability to survive, but as always, there needs to be control and regulation in a city that can only house and feed a specific number of citizens. There are those outside this great city who would do just about anything to get in. That is where our main character MAX FLYNN comes in.\nMax is one of many armed Coast Border Guards [CBG] who protects and processes everything coming into and leaving DENVER. He lives with his new wife, Betty, and his teenage daughter from a previous marriage, Trinity. On the job, Max has command of his two partners, Jimmy DePaul and Jane Nelson. Their job is to route everything and everyone that enters the city from the waterways, inclusive of new citizens seeking refuge in DENVER. In this futuristic world, masses of people are wandering the earth\u2019s waterways in hopes of gaining admission to some of the few cities left, and DENVER is no different. They keep a constant population count by monitoring every time a citizen of DENVER dies; an open space is available for either a birth or granting an outsider citizenship in DENVER. This person would have to be sponsored by an active resident.\nUnfortunately there are those who would do just about anything to gain entry into DENVER. The burden of stopping this falls upon Max and the CBG. Our story is about a group that goes to such extremes, and Max is forced to go against everything he has ever learned and been trained for.\nDENVER is a story about extortion, betrayal, and the lengths a person will go to, to protect the ones they love. DENVER was born out of a love for adult sci-fi stories, drawing its inspiration from films like BLADE RUNNER, SOYLENT GREEN, and ROAD WARRIOR, and a lifetime of reading HEAVY METAL MAGAZINE\u2014as well as being brought up having hope in mankind.\n             THE SOUNDTRACK : \nThe soundtrack. Yes, we have added an actual soundtrack to complete the experience of the graphic novel, written and composed by Hans Karl. A sample runs with the video above and this soundtrack was written based on the Denver graphic novel.\nTo listen to a track from the Denver soundtrack, go to: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdEpiQGfd7w\n Hans Karl is a film and multimedia composer. His music can be heard in documentaries, animated shorts, indie film, commercial jingles and various other creative media projects. In addition to his scoring work, he has also released several albums in various music genres. Currently, he has been creating a collection of original music library tracks. He resides in Los Angeles. You can find out more about Hans at his website:  http://www.hanskarlmusic.com\n Also featured on the soundtrack is the ending credit song: \u201c You Do\u201d, written and performed by Carrie Johnson. Carrie is a professional songwriter and performer who spends time writing and recording in Hartford, CT and Nashville, TN. The Carrie Johnson Band performs regularly in the New England area.

We will be using Print-On-Demand structure to create an exclusive limited and signed editions of the book based solely on the amount of orders we receive, which will be printed in the U.S.A. This process uses the best quality paper and cover stock we can get. It will be the same as our past graphic novels, but with more pages. \n\nThis Kickstarter project will be the only place to get the package rewards offered. Eventually we plan to publish the book elsewhere for retailers with a different cover, but till that time in the future, it will only be available here for our Kickstarter supporters! \n\nAs you can see with the reward tier list, there are several choices on how you can get the book. We will be adding more tier rewards as the pledge drive goes along, as well as stretch goals once the original goal has been funded. Many of you are returning customers who have supported us in the past and have received your Kickstarter pledges mostly ON TIME and hopefully have appreciated our communication throughout those projects. \n\nFor those who are returning for another adventure, WE THANK YOU!

They published 36 pages before the magazine was sold to a new publisher who decided not to continue the strip. This year (2013) I was approached by Kenzer & Company to reprint the strip in the Knights of the Dinner Table Comic. I also promised to finish the story, and this is where I need your help.\n\nI really need to take two to three months to finish off the story with 24 to 36 additional pages. That will make a wonderful 64-page full color graphic novel (give or take a few pages).  \nDepending on your pledge amount you can own this book as a softbound or hardback edition, as well as other bonuses, such as special prints, or even the original drawing used for the front or back cover! Most importantly, you are helping me bring a brand new Snarf adventure to life. Thank you for backing me.\nWe wanted to offer you some of the best rewards we could, and in fact, many of the rewards that we\u2019ve put together were requested by fans! \nFrom $1.00-$100, we\u2019ve kept things pretty simple.  Above $100, the choices get a lot harder and rarer. \n\nSnarfQuest d20 Hardback \nORIGINAL SALES TEXT: Looking to add some humor to your current d20 campaign, or need to get reacquainted with the misadventures of your favorite Zeetva? This hardback book is 128 pages and packed full of d20 material; including new prestige classes, feats, skills, DM advice and comical adventure hooks. All hail the return of Snarf! \nThis 128-page 6\" x 9\" Hardback was released in 2003 for the d20 3.0 table top WOTC game system. Larry has about 150 of these left and would like to offer it to you for a mere $10 extra. They will be signed by Larry. \n\nIf you want this book, simply increase your pledge and choose the new rewards package. It's that simple.\nNote: International backers have to add an additional $10 for shipping.\nA DONATION is a $1 pledge that allows you to order certain items a la carte, although any pledge level can also do so. ADD-ONs are those items. \nFor example, if you pledged at $50 and also wanted a the Original Graphic Novel Expansion, you would add $30 to your $50 pledge for a total of $80. Or, You could make a donation of $1 and just add on the Snarf miniatures for $25 for a total of $26.    \nInstructions: When you go to pledge, put the total number you are pledging (including any ADD-ONS) into the box at the top of the page, then select your desired reward level.\nSnarf Miniatures .................................$25 US / $35 International\nOriginal Graphic Novel Expansion ..... $30\nSnarfQuest New Adventures softback... $25  / $35 International\nSnarfQuest New Adventures softback withe Original SnarfQuest graphic novel included... $55 / $65 International\nSnarf Miniatures\nOur friends at Iron Wind Metals have the original set of RAL PARTHA miniatures collecting dust. So we decided to remaster the molds and make the minis available 20 years after their original release. Now these are limited and will only be produced for Kickstart Backers!!! We have no plans to release these again.\n\nORIGINAL SALES TEXT: Miniatures from RAL PARTHA are supplied unpainted and assembly may be required. 25mm scale metal miniatures. Contains: 11 miniatures\nThe original set sold for $25 and normally sells on eBay for $35 to $40. We are going to keep the original price of $25 for the U.S. and $35 for International. Shipping is included!!!\nIf you want a set of minis, simply add $25 or $35 to your original pledge.  As soon as this Kickstart is over you will be sent a survey. Just click the box stating you bought the minis. Pretty simple!  NOTE: Original box is not included.  \n Original SnarfQuest Graphic Novel\nMany of you have asked about the original SnarfQuest Graphic Novel and pleaded to make it available in the add-ons section. I have been reluctant to do so because so many SnarfQuest books have been produced and I believe that Kickstart is a place to get unique items. So Ken and I sat down and brainstormed and came up with a compromise for you guys.\nFor $30 extra we will place the original 224 page B&W graphic novel in the front of your new hardback or soft back book making it nearly 300 pages.\nWhat makes this truly unique is that this is the only time I am going to offer this book in this format. If only twenty of you buy this double edition then only twenty will ever be made. Your book will have a special cover that may read like this... \u201cThis edition is a Kickstarter exclusive limited to X copies\u201d.\nSimply add an additional $30 to your pledge. When the Kickstart is over, you will be sent a survey.

What's nice about this app is that you guys, my loyal fans, will get to give actual input into how the game is developed.\nHow could I say no?

Each game uses the same basic mechanics \u2014 vignettes, interrogations, interludes, and ensembles \u2014 to tell non-derivative stories. Every player has all the tools he or she needs to create interesting characters and environments for their favorite stories.\nEvery game stands alone. Every game shares a commonality.\nEssentially what I've done with Toolcards, I am now doing with roleplaying games. Inspiration and new ideas mixed with something you already know how to do. The Protocol game series uses a simple method of shared storytelling with charts, motivations, character interaction, and plot.\nIn the Protocol game series, each story explores disparate characters dealing with adversity in a dramatic fashion.There are 15 games in the series \u2014 13 of them are already completed and backers will have an opportunity to vote on the last 2 games.\nEach game is 10-15 pages long, including charts, and rules.\nA single game is only $3.\n\"Protocol game series looks interesting and it has everything players could want in a series of games for an evening or two (maybe more).\"\n\"It offers mystery, intrigue, science fiction, fantasy, spies, mercenaries and other genre. Having played a session of Home, the game was easy to set up and fun to partake in with just two players setting up the story, interludes, and vignettes. It's simply that good of an idea. I like it.\"\n\u2013 Tim Bisaillon\nAll of the Protocol Games use the same basic mechanic, but with very different results. Games can be played with or without a gamemaster, though without is the best method. Players only need paper, pencil, and a deck of cards. No dice are necessary. Some kind of token for drama point can help, but aren't necessary.\nAn example of Protocol game play appears in the first update.\nThere are 15 games in the Protocol series, but backers can choose any number of games to support. Merely pick a level and when the project is over, you'll be sent a survey asking you which games you want and if you want to add anything else to your order. If you're doing add-ons, it's easier if you do that before the Kickstarter ends.\nSince all of the games in the Protocol game series use the same rules, consider mixing and matching the charts for a universe-bending story.\nHome is a story roleplaying game about soldiers in a fantasy world returning home from a long and costly war. With only a few coins in their pockets, they must start the long trek back to their homeland. Being on the losing side of the war, the characters must overcome adversity, national tension, and a lack of resources as they navigate the lands separating them from their homeland.\nBlack Site is a story roleplaying game about rendition and torture. Players take on the roles of people trapped in rendition, arrested without warrant, and held for an indeterminate amount of time. As the characters work to fend off their accusers, the story explores menacing sides of the human psyche.

Starting from the planet\u2019s surface, the team has limited time to get to the station, climb inside, and repair the damaged station. The clock is ticking as problem after problem besets the team members who have limited resources to battle the ravaged reactor core.\nPower Station is a story roleplaying game in which players take on the roles of world leaders with access to unfathomable fuel sources, while neighboring nations covet their power. Set in a near-future world, Power Station asks questions of responsibility and power. Will hubris be your nation's undoing? Or will you use the power responsibly and usher in a new era of human achievement?\nPerdition is a story roleplaying game about frontier settlers dealing with the fears of the unknown. Players take on the role of a family or pair of families staking their claim on the new land. Though it is designed with an American West focus, the game can easily be adapted to any frontier, including a colony on a faraway planet awaiting resupply.\n Chebyshev Function is a story roleplaying game about teenagers with psionic powers \u2014known as primes \u2014 who are chased by the government. Forced to live outside the convenience of modern life, the characters must \u201cgo underground\u201d to protect themselves from those who would do them harm. As the story progresses, the teenagers find themselves face to face with very real dangers that will test them, their friendships, and their will to live.\nDevil's Highway is a story roleplaying game in which players take on the roles of bikers in a \u201cmotorcycle club.\u201d Living just beyond the reach of the law, the bikers are involved in drugs, gun running, theft, and generally lawless behavior. Recently there has been a change in leadership that has caused some concerns for the club, both internally and externally.\nCoyote is a story roleplaying game about immigrants being smuggled into a new nation of opportunity. This game deals with themes of prejudice and segregation, while shining a light on work ethics and cultural division. Though the game is designed to take place in an industrialized society, it also has flexibility for fantasy or science fiction settings.\nCalendar Man is a story roleplaying game about a serial killer who cannot be caught. Mimicking films like Zodiac, Suspect Zero, and Silence of the Lambs, the murders are dark and ghastly, challenging everyone, police and journalists alike. In the end, can anyone solve the murders or does the Calendar Man walk away free?\nEons is a story roleplaying game about horrific evil beyond the realms of man. Or the stars. Not your father's mythos.\nNeed I say more?\nDinner Guests is a story roleplaying game about a dinner party that turns to murder. Done in the style of Agatha Christie, Murder by Death, and Clue, the Dinner Guest is a funny romp through a dinner, murder, and resolution. Will you be the aging British Lord with too much time on his hands, looking for excitement? Are you the spoiled niece who wants the inheritance all to herself? Or perhaps you'll play the confused house guest, way over your head in someone else's scheme?\nMurder all you like\u2026 without getting your hands dirty.\nFive Broken Swords is a story roleplaying game about a group of adventurers on an impossible quest that has been dragging on for years. The adventurers are old, tired, and ready to give up. But maybe the fabled relic lies in the next dungeon up ahead. Is it possible?\n\nEach adventurer has a secret reason for being on the quest, which could usurp the journey. In the end, will you fail together? Succeed alone?\nNacht Engel is a story roleplaying game about 1960s East German authors trying to pass for artists while creating manifestos for the state. Meeting in secret and discussing the challenges of their lives under an oppressive state, the characters attempt to create meaning in their work, despite knowing the lies they must write. In the end, the players will decide if their subversive ways attract the state police or not.\nThe Protocol Game Series utilizes a regular deck of poker cards.

I was impressed with Dragons of Elanthia.\"\nTotalBiscuit, The Cynical Brit\nTen tons of angry, fire-breathing dragon, and you are in control! \nDragons of Elanthia is a new, free-to-play, multiplayer aerial combat shooter unlike any other: Choose a dragon, pick a rider and soar into team-based battle! It's exactly the kind of game we've always wanted to play but had never seen before - certainly not like this. And with your help we can make it happen!\nThe game has already been in development for over ten months; we've made a lot of progress, and it shows. You can see exactly where we are heading, and more importantly, kick in your ideas on how to take it the rest of the way. Beta signups are already online, and be sure to vote for us on Steam Greenlight right now! \nThese guys want your votes. That or they're just lining up a shot.\nSo let's start with the basics: Dragons are awesome, and flying is also awesome. Therefore, flying dragons around inside an active volcano is even more awesome. In fact, if we could sum up our approach to making this game, it would simply be \"make it as cool as possible.\" Every decision our team makes pushes the game to be bigger, better, and more badass.\nEmphasis on \"bigger\"...\nThe whole team loves shooters, but we're also big fans of strategy games. Because we make games we love playing, we've put a layer of strategic depth into Dragons of Elanthia. Our core mechanic is matching dragons with riders, so any given battle is just as much about finding the right combination of skills as it is about laying down some hurt on your enemies. But that's enough general talk; let's get into the actual gameplay!\n\"There's this neat little indie title called Dragons of Elanthia, and it's all about online multiplayer warfare between dragons and the daredevil jockeys who ride them.\"\nLandon Robinson, Machinima's Inside Gaming Daily\nWhen you join a match, you choose a dragon and a rider. Each one has three unique abilities, so every combination nets you six abilities total. Then it's all about wrecking the other team's day, whether that means capturing a strategic spot for your team, supporting your allies with healing and buffing, or just straight-up annihilating enemy dragon riders. When you inevitably get shot down, you can swap to a different dragon and/or rider, and jump right back into the fight.\nThe Lich riding a thematically appropriate Bone Drake into battle.\nThe really fun part is figuring out how to build the right combination of abilities, both for your own play style and for what's going on in the match right now. Every rider and every dragon has the same breakdown of abilities: two active and one passive. Usually that means one attack, one utility skill, and then something unique to that character for the passive.\nThe Shaman riding a Faerie Dragon, and deploying the dragon's Sprite Cloud countermeasures.\nMost attacks require you to lock onto an enemy by keeping them in your crosshairs, so that your rider/dragon can properly aim the shot. Others will let you fire without a specific target, since massive fireballs and area-of-effect shockwaves don\u2019t need to be quite as precisely aimed. And let's face it: The bigger the explosion, the better.\nMany projectiles, like these missiles, will try to home in on enemies.\nUtility skills vary widely from character to character, and largely define that rider or dragon\u2019s role. You might have a healing ability, a team buff, a defensive shield ... it could be anything. But regardless of what your loadout is, there's always a way to contribute to the action.\n\"In addition to the generally amazing dragon-based aerial combat, there's an experience-based progression system to help you power up your dragon and rider, which impacts each independently.\"\nJosh Vanderwall, The Escapist\nSince Dragons of Elanthia is all about adapting your strategies on the fly, the real meat of the game is in our roster of riders and dragons. Currently we've got six dragons and six riders, giving you 36 combinations to pick from. And those numbers are only going to go up from here!\nThe Pirate riding a Lightning Drake through some lava-filled caves.\nIt's absolutely vital for you to feel the difference in every dragon and rider, and luckily we have a very talented team of artists to make sure these guys shine (in some cases literally). We nail the look, hand off the abilities to our brilliant gameplay programmers, and then rigorously test those abilities until they feel right. For some characters it's easy to strike this balance, but for others it can take weeks of fine-tuning.\nLet's look at some of the specific riders and dragons we've created so far.\nYou can read more about our dragons and riders over at our site!\n\"Dragons of Elanthia adds a fantasy twist to a multiplayer shooter.\"\nMegan Farokhmanesh, Polygon\nDragons of Elanthia is free-to-play, which means we don't charge you any money to play the full game with all dragons and riders. If you choose, you can support the game by buying cool customizations and boosts. We've had the unfortunate experience of playing games that turn out to be pay-to-win, and we don't intend to ruin the spirit of our game by giving an unfair advantage to a select few.\nHow can you put a price on this kind of maneuver?\nIf you do want to help support our server costs and the ongoing creation of maps, riders, and dragons you can spend your money on the following:\nBoosting experience gains\nUnlocking skins and other cosmetic items\nAcquiring packs of random artifacts\nAs you can see, spending a ton of cash won't make you suddenly become good at the game. You can gain experience faster than normal, and get a better chance of obtaining the right artifact to boost your favorite dragon's attack. But you get all of these things by just playing the game longer. At the end of the day, Dragons of Elanthia is all about skill, strategy, action, and - most of all- fun.\nIt's all about vision. We haven\u2019t seen anything out there like Dragons of Elanthia, and it's something we've always wanted to play. In fact, we've wanted to make this game for a long time, and it's only now that the technology has caught up with our concept. As game developers, we did what comes naturally and simply started making it on our own.\nWe think this game is special, and we want to keep it that way. And Kickstarter is the best way for us to do that. Not only do we avoid the headaches of working with a publisher who might not share our vision, but we get to reach out directly to all of you fine folks. And of course bringing you guys along with us on the journey is a nice bonus.\nThe journey will probably involve barrel rolls. Just a fair warning.\nWe've already produced tons of content, and spent a lot of time refining our gameplay, but we need your help to finish the game. And because we respect your time and money, all the money we collect goes directly into our ongoing development. The more we get, the more we can add:\nMore support for major platforms\nMore international infrastructure\nMore maps\nMore dragons\nMore riders\nMore skins\nCan't contribute to our Kickstarter campaign but still want to help? Sign up for our beta and we'll get you in as soon as we can. And please vote for us on Steam Greenlight!\nToday, Simutronics is made up of over 30 passionate gamers (and a few pets), working out of St. Louis, Missouri. Like most good things, the company started in the 80s. We\u2019ve been making online multiplayer games since 1987, when our CEO David Whatley first released GemStone onto GEnie. Funny thing, the game is still up and running today, so you could say we know a thing or two about keeping online games running. And we also made one of the first online 3D shooters, CyberStrike, so there\u2019s that. More recently, we've released a couple of mobile titles,Tiny Heroes and One Epic Knight.

We also love the feel of a pen travelling on a sheet of paper. But nothing existed that combined the power of the iPad with the comfort of writing on paper. So, we invented iSketchnote! \nNone of the existing technologies provide the real experience of a pen and paper. So keep your habits and use the only technology that allows you to digitize your sketches and notes in real time.\nNo specific paper. No electronic pen. Just iSketchnote!\nMIKE ROHDE IS SUPPORTING THE PROJECT!\nHow can we speak about Sketchnote without mentioning Mike Rohde?\nHis book fueled our interest in Sketchnote and sparked the idea for iSketchnote as well. If you want to learn more about Sketchnote, try the Sketchnote handbook and back the project!\nThe Sketchnoters community seems to appreciate iSketchnote on Twitter as well!\nDoug Neil, Author of The Graphic Recorder\nSketchnoters and iPad enthusiasts, check this out! http://www.isketchnote.com/ Excited to see more. Well done @iSketchnote!\nRebecca Welch, founding director of no.41 consulting\nBest of luck to @isketchnote on their @kickstarter journey with what looks like an incredible #sketchnote tool #iamin #visualcommunication \nVisualNotetaking.net, A curated blog covering the creative world of visual notes, visual recording, graphic facilitation, graphic recording and sketchnotes.  \n@iSketchnote please let us know when your kickstarter campaign goes live. We'll post about it :)\nA DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY\niSketchnote is a smart iPad cover that integrates a new digitizing technology with the convenience of a notebook: We call it ISKN Technology.\nIt\u2019s a sensor matrix that recognizes and tracks our pens in real time. We also have eight patents pending and several others are in progress. Here are some of the various electronics prototypes we have experimented with.\n1st electronics prototype\n2nd electronics prototype\nOur latest version\nNATURAL PEN DESIGNED FOR ALL PEN AND PAPER LOVERS!\nIt's not \"like a real pen\" it is a real pen!\nNo battery, no electronics! Just a simple permanent magnet ring that is embedded into these classic pens.\nFor our Kickstarter campaign, we created a contemporary range of designs with a smart and trendy spirit. \nEarly sketches\nWe used premium material with a special ABS soft touch. Today, the range is composed of three pens: one black ballpoint, one orange felt and one black felt.\nWe are currently establishing partnerships with LARGE pen companies so a full range of pens will be available soon!\nOur electronics matrix recognizes the colour and tip of each iSketchnote pen thanks to the magnetic ring. But, we can associate individual pens to any of the colours in the app!\nInitially, each pen is recognized for its real colour: you are drawing in orange so the colour will be orange on the app. But, under software control you can change the tip and colour of the pen so, for example, you can make an orange and black Sketchnote in your notebook but it will look blue and yellow on the app!\nFirst real prototypes (ballpoint)\nA USER-FRIENDLY FOLDABLE COVER ...\nOPEN MODE\nYou can digitize your sketches and notes in real time!\nMake some notes on your iPad and sketchnotes on your notebook at the same time. Watch a video on your iPad, take some notes, stop the video and your notes are already stored on your iPad.\nOpen Mode enables real-time sharing of your sketchnotes. Imagine you are drawing in your notebook in Paris and a friend of yours in London can see the result in live streaming thanks to the iPad!\nMOBILE MODE\nImagine you're at a conference or in class, standing room only, no table, but need to take some notes\u2026You have an idea while you are seated outside and you want to capture it on your knee\u2026\nThis mode allows you to use the cover in a user-friendly position, directly on your knee or standing, without a screen.\niPADLESS MODE\nYour iSketchnote cover works even without the iPad! Simply create all your sketchnotes on your iSketchnote cover and they will be automatically transferred to your iPad the next time you connect to it.\nInitially, the iPadless mode only works with an iPad. We will provide a free Windows and Mac OS update to our backers as soon as it becomes available.\nWhile an SD card isn\u2019t provided, with a 4GB one you can store at least 100 pages \u2013 actually it\u2019s more than 300 drawing hours. \n...WITH A CHIC FRENCH TOUCH\n\"I can't live or work without drawing \u2013 and I can't live or work without my computer and iPad. When the innovative engineers at iSketchnote asked me to join their team I thought it was my dream job come true! I just couldn't believe iSketchnote was that close to a reality.\nWith my team of designers, we brought our 25 years of product design experience, our network of top companies, added a touch of French styling, and made it all happen.\nHey designers, we need the iSketchnote!

How? Back the project and take part in the development process. We will contact all our backers as soon as the Kickstarter campaign is finished.\nWe have the basics and all the technical features...\nWe've got a STAR feature called \"Instant replay\" (showed by Stephen on the Kickstarter video). Unlike your Smartphone photos, you'll be able to share the construction of your sketchnotes and not just the results!\nEnhance your work on your iPad, back it up in your Gallery, and share it immediately on your favourite media sites.\nFirst list of features:\nPlayback/Instant replay\nPen colour modifications \u2013 post iSketchnote creation\nPen tip modifications \u2013 post iSketchnote creation\nLayers\nExport formats\n\u2026\nWe have listed a set of possible features, but we are really open to your ideas and this is why we need your help during the co-design session to finish our app!\nISKETCHNOTE FOR DEVELOPERS \nYou are a developer or a software business that wants to create or adapt an app for iSketchnote. How can I do that?\nWe are open for partnerships and we can provide the API (check out the rewards on the right)!\nC++ API for Mac OS/Linux/Windows, objective C API for iOS\nSample Code\nThe API provides magnet position and orientation, recognition data and contact detection data of the pen\nThe API uses a USB connection for desktop platforms and a BLE interface for iPad and iPhone\nAPPS WE LOVE\nEnrich the iSketchnote experience with your favourite apps. We are planning to contact Evernote, Paper, Penultimate, Vision Objects\u2026You can also follow us on Facebook, Twitter or on our Kickstarter page to suggest new partnerships or create your own application!\nCONSUMER vs KICKSTARTER BACKERS\nWe expect that the suggested retail price for an iSketchnote will be $189 beggining May 2014. For all backers, the price will be $149 but for early birds, it's only $119 - a 37 % discount!\nWe aren't earning any money with this Kickstarter project, but we will succeed in launching our project with the manufacture of 1,000 iSketchnote covers!\nMost importantly, we will give all our backers the opportunity to co-design the iSketchnote app!\nTODAY\nWe have been working very hard for the last two years and have built several prototypes (electronics and app) and have even filed several patents on our technology.\nWe have already secured our components and are in discussions with several manufacturers. All we need now is your support to make this all a reality.\nOur goal: to integrate our iSketchnote electronics into a sleek and sexy iPad cover!\n$35,000? NOT MORE?\nWe are asking you to make a special effort to helps us produce the iSketchnote.\nObviously, we would like to raise more than $35,000 with your help ;). The $35,000 combined with our private money is enough for us to validate the iSketchnote concept and launch the first manufacturing round of 1,000 iSketchnote covers.\nIn addition to manufacturing the 1,000 iSketchnote covers, we will finish the latest updates to the electronics and upgrade the prototype from a USB connection to wireless.\nWe are currently working on the Bluetooth version of iSketchnote, but we need the funds from the Kickstarter campaign to finish the job.\nActually, we have already validated our Bluetooth design with a Windows prototype, but since iSketchnote is an iPad cover we still have more work to do.\nCurrently, we are working on the hardware and embedded software settings of our Bluetooth Low Energy Module to configure it as an external device able to communicate with an iOS device.\nAt the same time, as our iPad app will manage the wireless connection, we need some iPad software development using the iOS Bluetooth framework to scan, connect and share data with our electronics.\nTHE PLAN\nPRODUCTION TIMELINE\nIt\u2019s important to understand that we\u2019ll produce iSketchnote in three parts: the electronics, the cover and the pens.\nIt\u2019s easy and quick for an electronics factory to produce 1,000 devices. So we\u2019ll get the chance to have an interactive process and, if necessary, to easily produce more covers. We are still evaluating our choice for manufacturer and currently have a short list of three companies.\nTo manufacture the iSketchnote cover, we need to integrate the electronics inside the cover, perform final tests and quality controls. We already chose an international company capable of marketing a wide and varied range of laptop and tablet bags. The factory for our cover is in Guangzhou, China, and has an annual production capacity of 800,000. Our designer, Christophe Chedal Anglay, will follow all the manufacturing process and bring his 25 years of product design experience to this crucial phase.\nConcerning the pens, we already have the ballpoint pen prototype (check out the video) so we\u2019ll make our feedback soon and production will be launch as soon as we have completed evaluation of the felt pen prototype.\nJuly 2013:\nWe showed iSketchnote technology (USB prototype) and iSketchnote pens during the SIGGRAPH show in Anaheim. We enjoyed the visit of Apple, Google, Wacom, Samsung and many visitors who tested the technology and gave us important feedback.\nAugust-September 2013:\nKickstarter, Kickstarter and Kickstarter! We've been working night and day to submit our project and meet Kickstarter\u2019s guidelines and expectations. We also prepared the team to sleep a little bit less during September :) We plan to end our campaign by the end of September. As soon as we have reached our goal, we\u2019ll expedite sourcing and manufacturing.\n October 2013:\nPost crowdfunding period. Since we'll have already secured our components, we plan to launch sourcing in late October.

We are working with a French company that has significant experience in mass production both here and abroad. Product feasibility is not a problem, but holding multiple suppliers to our schedule could pose a risk. We\u2019ll do everything in our power to deliver the iSketchnote pen and cover on time, but we are dealing with multiple suppliers, which could pose a schedule risk.\n\nFinancial Forecast\nWill $35,000 really be enough to meet our goal? We think so. As we said, the $35,000 combined with our private money is enough for us to validate the iSketchnote concept and launch the first manufacturing round of 1,000 iSketchnote covers. Our operating margin for this round of manufacturing is small. Unexpected problems could cut into that margin, but we are prepared for it.\n\nElectronic Development\nElectronics is our business, but design is our passion. iSketchnote will need some additional development as we bridge the gap between our USB prototype and our Bluetooth prototype.

Over a year ago, SP! Adopted a Free-for-all PDF format, giving itself away to help small press publishers have a place they can get coverage in a market that relies more and more on either corporate controlled e-distribution or social media...which can be terribly fragmented from person to person.\nWe have, however, continued to receive requests for printed copies of the magazine, and would like to add that option back into our mix. We have decided to adopt a POD/Subscription model that will be linked to the new Self Publisher Association printing service. The service will also be part of the Cloud 9 App, making digital comics, available in print, directly from your Kindles and Ipads, anywhere. To accomplish what we want, we need to invest in some new software options, and we feel the best way to raise these funds is by getting an issue into print, to show everyone what we will be doing from then on every month.\nIssue #70 of Self Publisher! Magazine will be a feature spotlight on the newly re-designed and re-launched Cloud 9 App, so we think that will be a great issue to put into the new print option for launch. YOU can help make this all happen, by supporting this project. As an added benefit from our doing this, we plan to drop plans to start charging for SP! Magazine PDFs, and keep them freely available in digital form, for the entire year 2014 at least.\nYou can check out our latest digital issue right now! #67 is just-out, and is a great representation of our magazine. We are hard at work on #68 layouts right now, for mid-September release. That issue will have a cover feature on Miguel Guerra's Earth Dream anthology project, a bi-lingual Earth Day event. #69 will feature Drunken Cat Comics. We will post those new issues here in the Kickstarter as they are released! SP! is an all-volunteer staff, and run by the people, for the people.\nClick to get a copy of #67:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUpon success of this project, the biggest challenge will become continuing to reach new readers, because that is what most promotional things are missing these days. They rely on a book's publisher to bring their readers to their system, and then boast how many people are buying something, but, they are not a source of NEW readership. Publishers need exposure to new readers, and that is what has become so cloudy in today's market. I think we have proven that the SP! Team we have can put out new issues every month, as we have for over a year, and it is our goal to maintain that.

I am an actor, artist, occasional stand-up comedian, and a guitarist from Macon, Georgia now living in Los Angeles, Ca.  In the past few months I've had two surgeries on my brain to help me play guitar again. Maybe you saw it on the \"Today Show\" or your local news. I never knew any of that was going to happen. All I wanted was to be able to play guitar for a few years longer.  I have a disease called \"Essential Tremor\". This is a progressive neurological disease and there is no cure. My doctors think it could very well become Parkinson's in the near future. I want to make the most of the time the surgery has given me by recording an album and sharing my story with you. Thank you for becoming a part of this Kickstarter project. It means the world to me.\nScroll down to learn more about my project, see who will be part of the album, and take a look at some incredible pics from my surgery. \n\nSurprise guests announced every few days via Video Messages offering SPECIAL PERKS! Guests so far include: Tony Hawk, Lance Krall (Free Radio, The Lance Krall Show), and Gerry Bednob (40 year old Virgin, Zak and Miri Make A Porno)\nI want to do what seemed so impossible and out of reach only a few months ago: RECORD A FULL LENGTH PROFESSIONAL ALBUM!  I have been given this awesome and unexpected opportunity to tell my story and share it with the world. I want to record an album and tell you my story through my music.\nSome of my favorite artists and friends have agreed to pitch in on the album. I'm very excited to have:\n\nSEAN WATKINS \n(Nickel Creek, Fiction Family, Watkins Family Hour) \nTOM BROSSEAU\n  JESSE THOMAS\nMary Elizabeth Winstead will provide backup vocals on a couple of tracks.\nSO WHERE DOES YOUR MONEY GO? I have spoken with an amazing producer and friend of mine Jim Roach. Jim broke it down for me to a minimum of $45,000.00 This includes prep, recording, studio time, producer time, studio musicians, guest musicians, mixing, mastering, packaging, and artwork to support the album. \nHere is how the $45,000 breaks down:\nProducer fee - $2500 x 10 Songs = $25,000\nStudio Time- $300 per day x 20 days = $6,000\nMixing - $500 per song = $5,000\nMastering= $1,200\nCD Production= $1,100\nRecording Total = Approximately $38,500\n\nThen we add in:  Kickstarter Fees (5%)\nAmazon Fees (5%)\nand team support, editor of my KS vids, PR and Publicist expenses, shipping of the rewards, and TAX. Yes that's right I get taxed on this.\nWe're looking at a minimum Goal = $45,000\nFor 7 years I have struggled with losing control of my hands to a disease called \"Essential Tremor\", making it more and more difficult to play and perform. Having played music for many years, losing the ability to do the thing I love the most has been quite difficult and heartbreaking. I have run the gamut of emotions with this and sometimes the depression has been overwhelming. I've done my best to adapt to my tremor in order to keep working as an actor. \nOn May 23rd of this year I was given a chance to fight back and prolong my skills through a medical procedure called \"DBS\" (Deep Brain Stimulation). This is a procedure that involves the placing of electrodes in my brain and a control in my chest. By using electrical stimulation to a tiny spot in my thalamus, my doctors hope to improve my condition and to be able to manage it. The surgery took about 7 hours and I was awake for 6 hours of it, and YES it was SCARY as HELL! \nPrepping for the \"Halo\"\nNot fun\nYou have to be awake so that you can respond to your doctors and find just the right spot to place the electrode. It is incredibly complicated. The thalamus also controls speech and there were times when I completely lost my ability to speak. It is the most surreal thing I have ever experienced in my life. \nThe worst thing I ever felt in my life. Let's just say I picked the wrong day to stop cussing.\nHolding my hand through some painful moments.\nBecause I was the 500th patient at UCLA to have this procedure done, the hospital asked to film the surgery, and honestly I thought it would be really cool to have it. I mean how often do you get a video of your own brain surgery? \nI played my guitar during the surgery and it was tweeted live and suddenly it became world news! It was viewed over 30 million times on just the first day. Before long it was on every news channel in the world. Hong Kong, Australia, Iran, you name it. Weird. \nLive on Twitter and Vine.\nMy one-of-a-kind handmade Kurt Schoen Guitar. Made from a 1930's shotgun shell crate.\nDrawing Spirals to track the tremor intensity.\nWorking to find the best possible placement of the electrode by displaying my tremor.\nDr. Bordelon.\nYou can see the massive difference in spirals. Pretty cool right?\nAfter 7 hours, Dr. Pouratian assuring me we had done well.\nI even had the opportunity to share my story on The Today Show. \nHere's the Today Show clip.\nUCLA PRESS CONFERENCE AND UPDATE ON MY RECOVERY\nStretch Goal #1: $55,000 MUSIC VIDEO\nOf course I hope to overshoot our goal and be able to afford to do more, including a MUSIC VIDEO (because you can't have an album without a music video).We need a minimum of $10,000 for our Music Video. I have an amazing concept for my first single called \"Drunk Again\" and have some AMAZING guest cameo's in the works.\n\nMy good friend Sean Bridgers (Deadwood) has agreed to direct the video!

I realize it has been a long long time now, but again I want to stress how difficult it has been to figure out this elusive industry and afford to try and clean up mistakes made by myself and the original producer of the initial recordings. I admit that if I knew how hard that would be I would have started from scratch a long time ago. Here's what's been happening: \n As I can afford it I have traveled to Asheville NC three times within the last 4 months to try and wrap this up and get this ready to be remixed, remastered and in the can. It has cost thousands more than I ever dreamt and at this point I cannot and will not accept anything other than greatness both on behalf of you all and myself. It turns out there's a steep price to pay for being unaccepting of mediocrity and to figure out where the right combo of relationships and affordable skills lay. To be frank I am at the mercy of my finances and of certain peoples availability to lend an affordable hand."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #71", "update_userinfo": "Hello everyone!

Build to begin January 10, 2014\nTHE STORY BEGINS WITH OUR END GOAL\nOur end goal is to make these motorcycles available to everyone. We intend to offer people the ability to truly custom design their own electric motorcycles through a combination of collaboration with our team of motorcycle design consultants and through mass customization manufacturing processes. We want to create a set of basic configurations that can then be further modified by you.\nBACKGROUND\nValetta Motorcycles and the creation of our initial prototype \"A\" came about as a result of my thesis focus while at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena back in 2012. The thesis was about understanding the future of motorcycling and what it could become as we entered the 21st century. In 2010, electric motorcycles were relatively new, and it seemed it was having a rough beginning here in the U.S.,  so I wanted to investigate what motorcycling has been about in the past and what I found in the history of motorcycling seemed to be everything that was not yet found in electric motorcycling.\nThe Chopper\nThe original idea of the chopper was about removing every unnecessary component so that the bike was down to it's bare essentials. \nThe Rebel\nIn the early 50's, he was the guy you would never let your daughter date. He wore the bomber or leather jacket, he smoked, he drank, he cussed, he slicked his hair back and of course he rode a very loud and menacing looking motorcycle or hot rod that was a piece of rolling counter culture.  Today, he/she is very much that person. It's all a bit more sophisticated though. Technology drives today's rebel.\nThe Custom Element\nEvery motorcycle owned by nearly every owner goes through some kind of personalization activity. Harley owners are notorious for this. The Harley Sportster is the most customized motorcycle in history. The custom components industry for motorcycles is huge. It generates about 4 billion annually. It's a very important element in ownership. The option to customize one's ride.\nTHE BIG IDEA( A Future Vision)\nDepiction of a Valetta in the future\nImagine one day in the not too distant future, you are in the market for a new motorcycle, You're looking for a new statement. Something with character, something almost brutally beautiful, a moving statement of your aesthetic desires and preferences. You want something that feels powerful, traditional and yet unique. You are thinking it needs to be a custom motorcycle, but you also want it to be a hybrid or an electric machine. So you go online and you search and you find Valetta Motorcycles. You visit the configurator page and run through a few combinations to set up the motorcycle the way you want it. Bobber style, Cafe style, Sport bike.\nA Valetta with drop-in canister batteries\nOnce you're done, you submit your choices. Valetta will then contact you and invite you to come into our studio. You soon learn that Valetta is a custom motorcycle design consultancy and builder. So the Valetta design consultant is given the go ahead and he/she begins the build process. The chassis design is modified 10-15 % in configuration thanks to an algorithm that cycles through minute cut changes that won't affect structural integrity of the chassis. There is no painting at Valetta. All parts are anodized in color. Graphics are anodized or laser etched on surface or through panels. After a month, you take delivery of your very unique Valetta Motorcycle.\nSketch of a custom Valetta in the future\nThat's the vision of Valetta. We can give the world that reality, but it needs you to help make it so.  That's what we hope to achieve one day by moving towards this second prototype.\n\nWe need to build prototype \"B\"\nWe need to create a more robust and road worthy vehicle. We intend to create all major structural components from the ground up. We  can make that happen with the proper funding support. Based on the build cost of the first motorcycle, we are certain that $24,000 will allow to develop a better vehicle.\nValetta Today\nSo far, I have created an \"A\" prototype which has been used for a thesis presentation and it serves as a discussion concept platform when visiting motorcycle shows.\nThe first vehicle prototype was designed with the intent of arousing conversation and to communicate aesthetic direction. It will continue to be used that way until it's purpose is complete. It is being used for that very purpose during the campaign.\nWhat we are trying to create is a new kind of motorcycle for a new generation of young rebels. The rebel image is perpetual and resilient and everlasting as long as there is youth and people interested in image.\nValetta's Future: Mass Customizable Custom Hybrid & Electric Motorcycles\nThe Valetta project is focused on demonstrating how we might achieve the goal of mass customization. We envision a process where we create motorcycles that have a strong consistent identity but are each, unique renditions of our brand character. Every vehicle will be informed and affected by input from the consumer.\nValetta motorcycles will be built in such a way so that no two Valettas are identical and yet they may each share parts with ease. We plan to develop an algorithm that cycle forward a design profile so that when a machine cuts or laser etches our components, they will be slightly different from the last cut or etching. We are embracing the idea of customization and individual expression so that every motorcycle we create is truly as unique as a person's fingerprint.\nOur motorcycles will be limited in production and as we build the vehicles, clients can be involved in the build as much as they desire. You can think of Valetta Motorcycles as more of a design and build consultancy.  There was a great deal of research and interviews with traditional motorcyclists, electric motorcyclists and motorcycle business owners in Hollywood and San Francisco that helped steer this vision. Because of this, I came to believe that the form language of electric motorcycles should be as honest of the technology it housed rather than borrow from gasoline powered machines. That's just not what they are.\nSo, I began to imagine the electric motorcycle as something that connoted status and grace, technical, brutal and even dangerous in character of appearance. It's what a rebel would want.  It needed to represent the current values of our modern rebellious youth and the new century we live in.\nThe image above is a rendering depicting a possible Valetta kit configuration as we envision it to be in the future.\nIt's still part of what will drive the character of our products.  It is intended that Valetta will also come to be recognized as a creation of strength, beauty and will hold the greatest sentimental value for those who own these amazing machines. \nThe vehicle you see here is the best example we could create on the budget we had. It cost about $12,000 to build this  example. \nHOW YOU CAN HELP\nBy pledging funding support at any level, you move us one step closer towards our goal of helping to make electric and alternative powered vehicles that are perceived as attainable aspirational products that can be offered to a new generation of riders and collectors.\nTHE REWARDS\nFirst, EVERYONE who backs this project will have their names etched onto the beta motorcycle to honor you as a supporter of this project. It's because of your generosity, whether you give a dollar or a thousand, you are the people who will give life to something new.\nWe offer great rewards at all levels of support. It all starts at the $1 level. You will receive a letter of gratitude personally signed by the creator of Valetta Motorcycles. This might be a very collectable item someday. It could be part of an amazing historical change for American society. Protect it. Your contribution at any level is extremely important to us. You could be the difference between success and failure.\n$10 PLEDGE LEVEL\nAt the $10 level, You will receive a beautiful high quality print of an original Valetta development sketch rendering measuring 11 X 17 inches and a signed letter of gratitude. \n$10 Reward\n$25 PLEDGE LEVEL\nWe offer the Valetta t-shirt printed with our logo and logotype front and back. Shirts are offered in three colors, grey,red and black and we have shirts for both men and women. \n$50 PLEDGE LEVEL\n We will send you the Valetta metal and rubber bangle bracelet, laser etched with the Valetta logotype, as shown below. Show the world you made Valetta a reality. Take pride in knowing it really came down to you! You will be reminded of this every time you see the Name Valetta.\nImage is for descriptive purposes only. Depiction is accurate. Actual bracelet to be produced upon campaign completion.\n$100 PLEDGE LEVEL\nWe offer a cool binary watch laser etched with the Valetta logo. It's unlike any watch any of your friends are wearing. It uses a series of dots which are counted to give the correct time. It symbolizes how we will do things differently. May be etched on band or case, it's your choice!\nPlease note, this image is for descriptive purposes only. Actual watch to be produced upon completion of successful campaign.\n$150 PLEDGE LEVEL\n You will receive a portfolio of all of the Valetta design artwork created to this point. It's hard bound and filled with lots of inspiration. You also will receive a t-shirt and the watch.\n$500 PLEDGE LEVEL\nAt the $500 pledge level,we offer the hard bound 13 x 11 inch Compendium of Valetta. It's a comprehensive book containing the full story of Valetta's inception and development. It contains over 200 pages of fascinating text and images. It's like following the Wright Brothers as the build their first airplane! \n$1000 Pledge Level\nAt $1000, I offer a rider's experience package!! We offer you a chance to ride the original prototype and also the \"Beta\" model on an enclosed course. To remember the experience, you will receive a Valetta t-shirt and a signed copy of the Valetta Compendium. You will experience the bikse and hopefully it will validate your decision to have funded this endeavor. Hurry though, only ten opportunities for this one!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are significant obstacles involved with the creation of these vehicles and I can't do it alone. I know this after building one by myself. It took six months of a great deal of trial and error and I am still no expert by any means. There are a small number of risks involved with this project, but they are manageable.\nRisk no.1 \nWe want to make the next prototype capable of achieving freeway speed. To do this, we require a more powerful motor called an AGNI motor. It's a 9 kw 60 Volt motor that runs extremely efficiently. The motor that is being sourced by other electric motorcycle manufacturers. They are expensive and they are scarce at the moment. We risk exceeding the completion date simply because we can't source the proper motor quick enough. We may have to source another manufacturer. \nRisk no. 2\nWe may lose team members. I rely on assistance in order to achieve success. Without it and the completion time of these vehicles really extends very far out. We may need eight months instead of six to complete the project. \nRisk no 3.\nWe may run out of funding and have to regroup and seek additional monetary assistance to complete all of our goals. \nChallenges\nI feel one of the first hurdles has been overcome by simply creating the initial prototype. I've built it to understand it and to gauge response to the concept. It is not a production motorcycle and I do recognize that I am not a manufacturer, but after building this with my own bare hands, I am very confident I, along with a very resourceful team, could build ten in a year or more. Currently, there are three individuals involved with this project. What we are is two very experienced industrial designers, both of whom have inventive streaks. We know how to uncover and discover opportunity. We are also skilled at ideation, envisioning what could be and creating mock ups, models and prototypes. We know how to design on engineering software such as Solidworks, Alias and Rhino. Our team members are familiar with planning efforts and working with other disciplines such as engineering and modeling personnel. Our team must grow if we want to create something tangible and accessible for more people than just ourselves. Our vehicles need to truly be advanced products, so we need to enlist the expertise of individuals who have very strong technical backgrounds. We must uncover the alternative solutions for suspension, braking systems, safety and propulsion in order to truly earn the distinction as a company that truly creates the most advanced products possible. We need engineering support and volunteers. We need to have our vehicles validated and approved by the Department of Transportation, The National Traffic and Highway Safety Administration. It is our hope that soon, we will produce a vehicle that will pass the certification process so that we can obtain our own Vehicle Identification Numbers. We hope to soon become a licensed manufacturer of a product that is very unique in a number of ways.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Roman S.
