[{"backer": "Ben Willis", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HAS BACKED THIS PROJECT! The minimum goal has been reached - and now it's time to stretch!\nThe actual budget for this project is significantly higher than what I've asked for here in this campaign - so, if you want to support Studio Te, or claim one of the rewards, now is a great time to become a part of making this happen!\nI've added a new reward for this final week of the campaign - this T shirt! \nAvailable in all sizes, in limited quantities. \nLimited Edition Contact T-shirt, by Emma Kohlmann\nto contact Greg Fox: ggddffxx@gmail.com\nto contact RVNG: phil@igetrvng.com\nPLAY\n\nHELLO\nI am turning my semi-professional home studio into an entirely professional and public-facing actual music studio operation, and I am asking you to help me make that happen. \nI'm offering all kinds of rewards in exchange for your financial contributions. Some examples include drum lessons, session work, and time at the studio itself (once it opens to the public). I'm also offering vinyl preorder and digital downloads of my new album Contact, which comes out on RVNG records in May. \nThank you for your consideration and support.\nMoving in\n-THE STORY-\nFor the past three years, amid maintaining my parallel careers as a professional musician, teacher, and coach, I have been investing time and money into building a music studio in Brooklyn, NY. The space, while fully functional for recording, rehearsing, and education, is also the place where I live. I have always dreamed of establishing a fully professional studio that I could operate publicly, to help realize other musicians' creative goals as well as my own. \nIn early 2020, the space adjacent to mine suddenly became available. The possibility of separating my living and working spaces, shifting the studio to an entirely professional, public-facing operation, became achievable. I did my research, made plans for a build-out, got the security deposit together, and took over the rent on March 1st.\nthe raw space\nMy initial plan for 2020 was relatively simple: make the necessary construction and equipment upgrades so that, when finished, the space would cater easily to all kinds of folks in various realms of music and sound - from bands looking to record albums, to voice-over artists who need a clean take, to soundtrack composers, and everything in between. \nAfter having numerous conversations with other musicians, engineers, and friends, I arrived at the notion that doing a Kickstarter could really help me get things off the ground. I put together a budget and a plan, with the intention to launch this campaign, and get things up and running while at home in between periods of international touring that I had planned for March through May. \nThen the coronavirus happened and, to say the least, everything became uncertain.\n\n  Now we suddenly find ourselves in the grips of a global pandemic, and I've had to change course significantly. My touring year as of now is completely cancelled and/or postponed, it is still unclear. I was expecting, over the course of multiple rounds of international touring in 2020, to make almost all of my income from performance fees, merchandise sales, and teaching workshops. This would provide enough to cover both my home and studio rent and basic living expenses while I made the upgrades to the space and got it running. Once finished, the thought was that I would start bringing in clients, and the studio business would basically support itself. Now that all of my projected income as a working musician has pretty much evaporated, the plan to get this studio off the ground is somewhat in question, along to a certain degree with my livelihood in general. \nLiterally every other musician, producer, engineer, and composer I know is in the exact same situation as far as this is concerned right now. \nPLAY\n\nWhy Now?\nI believe that digging in and investing now in making this space a reality is the correct way forward. Not even a global pandemic will fully end the practice of recording music, and we will need spaces to facilitate that - especially ones where the day rate is not exorbitant, where there is a good, comfortable vibe, and where you can work with people who have weathered all kinds of storms that go along with living as professional musicians.\nIt is obviously a very strange time. I have reservations about doing anything right now that calls attention to myself, during this time of great global need and precariousness. While I am definitely struggling to figure out how to proceed, how to make money after having all my touring cancel suddenly, how to live among the daily multitudinous existential crises that we are all dealing with, I am also very hopeful. \nI wholeheartedly believe in the future of music. I believe in music's ability to bring us through and beyond crisis. I believe that we will find a way to get through this current one. I believe that many broken aspects of our society, which are currently coming to bear, will change for the better as a result of our overcoming such terrible and challenging events. \nCancelling the plan for a new studio, backing down, feels like it would be the wrong move now.  I'd rather try to make this happen, in the face of... who knows? I'm choosing to be hopeful and optimistic, rather than accept defeat before even trying.\nFor all of these reasons, I am building this studio. I am asking you to help support me in this endeavor, to lay the foundation for something new, something hopeful. It is called Studio Te.\nJonah Rosenberg and Daniel Carter at Studio Te in 2019\nWhat is Te ? \nTe (/d\u0259/; Chinese: \u5fb7, pronounced \"duh\"), is a key concept in Taoist philosophy, usually translated as \"inherent character, inner power, integrity, moral character, virtue, morality, quality, virtue, merit, virtuous deeds.\" I've been a lay scholar of the Taoist cannon since I was 16, and when I started ever having to refer to this space by name, besides just calling it \"my studio,\" the name \"Te\" always came to mind. \n\nThe Functions of Studio Te\nStudio Te will offer very competitive prices for tracking day rates in NYC. I have consulted with some of my favorite engineers and producers in the city to ensure that I can meet and exceed the needs of any type of recording situation, without needing to ask prohibitive day rates of my clients. \nStudio Te will also serve as the hub for my teaching practice and coaching work, where students and clients will come to find and dig more deeply into rhythms both internal and external. For now and the foreseeable future, these practices will be maintained in virtual space - but once this period of social distancing is finally behind us, I plan to have music makers, students, and clients from all walks at Studio Te on a daily basis - creating, exchanging ideas, learning, and expanding, sometimes outwardly, and sometimes towards the center.\n\n Contact \u2013 My New Solo Album\nmy new solo album, Contact, with art by Emma Kohlmann\nTiming being what it is, I also have a new solo record coming out in May on the record label RVNG INTL - As of the time of writing this, the plan is still to release this music as originally scheduled and planned. Because of the alignment, we decided that it made sense to pair these initiatives - so, we are simultaneously announcing both this fundraiser and my new album, \"Contact\" (I swear I gave it this title over six months ago, without any idea that it would now take on very much added significance). The pre-sale for the album will be conducted here, directly, as one of the reward tiers. Some of the music on that album was recorded at Studio Te. The first single is below, the video animation is by Michael Flanagan, and the artwork comes from the inimitable Emma Kohlmann:\nPLAY\n\nRVNG Intl. will produce a limited edition color vinyl (blue!) exclusively for my campaign backers. We're aiming to make 200, but the pressing is scalable by demand. I just learned that the plant making this record is closed until April 19th \u2013 an unfortunate reality for vinyl pressing currently \u2013 so this LP product will not ship until June if we're lucky, July if we're being real.\nMy Story (As Told By Sasha Frere-Jones)\nAny sound, repeated quickly, becomes a sustained tone. Any sound, slowed down, starts to beat. Music is the line between these two points, the wave that lives between the terminal ends of voice and drum. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll find Greg Fox. He moves through musical stages as both listener and player, a transformative rather than performative force. If you don\u2019t know his work, start here: Fox is well-known in the lesser-known, a drummer with hundreds of credits on obscure records. His reputation is that of the elevated beast, that guy, the one who plays fast and loud and expresses himself at the extremes and in the extremes. That\u2019s not wrong. Fox is also a slow theorist, a musician aware of those who came before him, and a teacher of drumming, with students all over the world.\nPLAY\n\nHe remains a student himself, open-minded, honest, and willing. He has worked with drummers like Thurman Barker (Mighty Joe Young, Marvin Gaye, Cecil Taylor), Guy Licata (Drummers Collective, Jojo Mayer, Jim Chapin), Marvin \u201cBugalu\u201d Smith (James Brown, Sun Ra, Chet Baker, Charles Mingus) and Milford Graves (Milford Graves). Fox has a practice that goes beyond drumming\u2014he is a certified professional coach who focuses on transformational life changes. He helps people find their rhythms, in behavior, mind, and spirit. All of this experience draws to a point and that\u2019s where you can find Contact.\nContact is built largely from the work of one person alone in a room, using his body to make sense of the surfaces around him. That was the reality when it was recorded in November of 2018 at Figure 8 Studios in Brooklyn. For obvious reasons, it is even more that now. Created in close unison with producer Randall Dunn, Contact makes the acoustic drum set talk and sing and see.\nFox uses sensory percussion to control and manipulate software instruments and samples. You\u2019ll hear that on Contact in the washes of keyboards and bells and synthetic tonalities, all of it following the lead of the drums. It\u2019s a record of rhythms that isn\u2019t a beat record. Fox\u2019s drumming is full and considered, like an enormous stone arm pushing slowly through a forest.\nContact occupies a space of energized meditation, neither mellow nor aggressive. It rolls the way Fox rolls. All of his musical experience flows into this record. If you know his past, you\u2019ll understand his present. Fox has played with Liturgy, Zs, Ex Eye, Guardian Alien, Ben Frost, Colin Stetson, and dozens of other people. \u201cI\u2019m exploring collaborations now and using different guiding principles. I\u2019m changing how I arrive at working with who I work with,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI\u2019m engineering, teaching, and coaching. I\u2019ve been operating and running a studio for myself, and it will be a for-hire studio very soon.\u201d\nPLAY\n\nThank you!\nThanks for taking the time to check this out. Wishing you good health, peace, happiness, and liberation, whoever and wherever you are.\nXO\nGreg Fox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe major challenge of this project is that, to get Studio Te off the ground, I am doubling my monthly rent expenditure. Also, amid this global pandemic, keeping the rent covered while I get things up to speed here poses a formidable challenge. \n\nIt's not just money issues that are a challenge now in light of the pandemic, but also time. It will take time to assemble all the materials and equipment, assuming there are no delays due to social distancing and businesses being shut down. It will take time and labor before the studio can be up and running according to my vision \u2013 and it will take time before people can physically and safely re-enter the world beyond their own spaces. Some delays may also occur around the production of some of the rewards I am offering.

A pivotal text exchange with my friend and colleague talking about the possibility of crowdfunding to help support the project changed that assumption, and the idea started to grow. People kept telling me, if I did this, that folks would want to support it. And then, at the beginning of March, all certainty bottomed out. Everything got cancelled, and all of a sudden we entered what is likely the strangest period of time in most of our lives so far.

In addition to Re:Sound, CUSP also runs a year-round concert series and CoLab, an education initiative focused on cultivating the talents of local young composers who are nonbinary, gender nonconforming, or women. You can read more about the small but mighty team behind CUSP here. \nLeo Suarez performs at Re:Sound 2019\nThis is an artist-centered festival. Good music comes from happy musicians. As performers ourselves, we know how it feels to be taken care of. We book venues based on how they will showcase the artists we select. We are personally there every step of the way in soundchecks, and provide homestays for musicians coming from out of town.\nWe select performers through a call-for-performances that closed on October 1. Artists were asked to propose a set of 20-30 minutes of music that is either improvised or composed after 2000. This year, we had more applicants than ever before--almost 120! We will be making selections in late November, and booking venues soon after that. Past venues have included the Bop Stop (a jazz club), Praxis Fiber Arts Gallery, The Magalen (a DIY space in a century-old storefront), CODA Live Music Venue, and SPACES Gallery.\nElizabeth A. Baker performs at Re:Sound 2018\nWe are dedicated to building a community with Re:Sound, creating connections between artists from near and far and local audiences. The schedule includes plenty of group hangs throughout the weekend, and each concert presents at least two acts so that artists get to know each others' work. \nWe also strive to make this festival open to as many audience members as possible. All of the venues at Re:Sound 2020 will be handicap accessible. And while we do charge admission, our prices have remained modest and consistent over the past two years. We charge $12 per concert and sell festival passes for $35. Discounts for students and seniors are available, at $8 for a ticket or $25 for a festival pass. No one is turned away for lack of funds.\nFestival Timeline\nWe\u2019ve already been hard at work organizing this year\u2019s festival. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far, and what\u2019s coming up for us:\n Aug 15-Oct 1: Our call-for-performers was open to artists.\n Early Dec: The Re:Sound Committee meets and selects the  performers for the festival. Trust us, this is is SUPER HARD. There are always many more worthy ensembles than there are slots.\n Dec-Jan: We book venues and secure performer agreements.\n Feb: We announce the lineup and schedule.\n Feb-June: Preparations! Planning our advertising strategy, shoring up our budget, and fulfilling your Kickstarter rewards are among our activities in this busy time.\n June 4-7: The festival!\nPopebama performs at Re:Sound 2018\nWe need your help! \nThis year, we're hoping to grow in some pretty exciting ways. We'll be investing in things like increased performer payments, more advertising to grow our audience, and bigger venues to accommodate larger crowds.\nOur total budget for the festival is just under $16,000, most of which goes to covering performer fees. We've already raised most of these funds through grants, individual donations, and ticket sales. About $1,000 of our Kickstarter goal of $6,000 will go towards fulfilling rewards and platform/credit card fees. Also, a note which may be important for some: while CUSP is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and donations are tax-deductible, these Kickstarter donations will not be, due to the rewards we offer as a part of this campaign. For more information, please contact us.\nThrough Re:Sound, we're showcasing everything our city has to offer: enthusiastic fans, compelling spaces, and artists at the top of their craft who are passionate about sharing their work.

WOWZA! \nAfter 4 years of rebranding, we're very excited to announce the release of our first EP, Backpack of Snacks. This record represents years of work \u2014 writing workshops, tours, demo recordings, scrapping everything, more writing workshops, recording again. We've really given this project our all, and we're excited to get something physical into your hands. In order to make this dream a reality, we are hoping to raise $7,000. However, we set the goal at $1 because we need all the help we can get!\n\n\nWRITING WORKSHOP - COLOR THEORY:\nThis EP is the result of our experimentation in color. Back in January of 2018, we decided that we wanted to see how our art would be transformed if we perpetually saw the world in different colors. Using this logic, we each wore various color-lensed glasses from the moment we woke up, the the moment we went to sleep. To create a catalogue of songs to choose from, we both demoed out 1 song per color. Once a song was drafted to a point of completion, we would move on to another color. We did this with 6 different colors: pink, yellow, blue, green, red, and orange. The result - Backpack of Snacks. \nAll the glasses worn during color theory workshop!\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE EP?\nThis small collection of songs was inspired by colors (as previously mentioned) and music created by industry giants that we respect and admire. Each track offers you a different vibe, though, all of them should get your butt moving. We married our love of 80's synthesizer sounds and melodies with our love of hip hop and r&b.  We took those inspirations and sprinkled them with a splash of new life experiences such as starting our music over from scratch, getting married and moving to a new city. \nThis record is a depiction of how we see the world and our attempts to to find peace, truth, and sustainability without diluting our creative spirits. Each song tackles issues like, proving your self-worth, experiencing failure, technological progression and resistance, and love (duh y'all, we're married - you knew we'd hit this topic). We hope that our sonic narratives help you as much as they've helped us. \n\nLIMITED EDITION BACKPACK OF SNACKS T-SHIRT\nFRONT\nBACK\n\nFINKEL IS EINHORN - 5 PANEL HAT (Mock Image)\nOur dear friend Sam started a company called Branded Bills a few years back. They create quality products that represent the people that wear them. Just like life, their hats change and get better with time and experience.

Set in place by the 2016 project Rushing Past Willow (successfully funded here by you), Enter Branch is the next step building upon its message and visceral sound world. While Rushing Past Willow was the culmination of years of artistry, there was still more to explore.  Pieces that were once impossible to perform due to their sheer physicality and virtuosity necessary are now fully realized in Enter Branch.\nKickstarter functions on an all-or-nothing model.  Either we raise the full amount of this campaign, or I get nothing.  While this might seem like a HUGE gamble, I think it conveys just how passionate I am about the project. I'm already all-in with this one, and if you read on, you'll see why.\nCollaboration\nThe project comprises my own compositions, but this time, I'm not alone. Enter Branch combines my solo performance with inspirational artists who believe in the same message of vulnerability and community. Enter Branch includes collaborations from:\nSean Carey (S. Carey, Bon Iver) co-composing/vocals\nNathalie Joachim (Eighth Blackbird, Flutronix) co-composing/vocals\nBrian F. Joseph (mix engineer for artists including Bon Iver, Sufjan Stevens, S. Carey, Paul Simon, and many more) mixing\nCasey Foubert (Sufjan Stevens, mix engineer, multi-instrumentalist, song-writer) mixing and co-composing\n ~nois saxophone quartet, collaborating musicians\nDevin Drobka (Field Report, Lesser Lakes Trio, Yins) percussionist, collaborating musician\nTontine Ensemble improvising string quartet, collaborating musicians\nAmy Petrongelli soprano, collaborating musician \nGalen Bundy (Project 206, Groove Plexus, pianist) collaborating musician\nAleks Tengesdal cellist, collaborating musician\nThe collaborators communicate not only through their artistry, but also through community engagement. This strikes a chord with me. This project extends far beyond an album, creating branches between different communities. These musicians have dedicated so much of themselves to this project. I\u2019m truly humbled by their belief in Enter Branch. This campaign will fund a wide release that does their artistry justice.\nRecording\nAll tracks have already been recorded and mixing is about to begin! Excerpts of the compositions are even included in the Kickstarter video. While recording has been a long process (almost 18 months!), it is just the beginning of the journey. Mixing and mastering  is next, which is a long (and expensive!) process.  Following that, the Enter Branch project will include an album release and video productions. I need your help in order to fully realize this endeavor.\nThankfully, I've worked as a recording engineer for the past 10 years, and much of my research as a doctoral student focused on experimental microphone techniques for saxophone.  This covered a potentially HUGE chunk of funding that would otherwise be necessary. But, mixing and mastering are different art forms. I'm seeking the help of mix engineers to fully realize the compositions on Enter Branch. I'm positive that their artistry will bring the compositions to a level that I wouldn't be able to imagine on my own.\nVideos\nSimilar to Rushing Past Willow, the compositions of Enter Branch unfold as a narrative, not so different from cinema. Already, I've learned so much about pairing video with my music (you can see examples here). Enter Branch will continue in this multimedia endeavor. In the end, at least of half of Enter Branch's compositions with have a visual counterpart. \nHowever, video productions are an INCREDIBLY expensive pursuit!\nEven when I'm serving as the director of photography, financial support is needed for equipment costs, venue rental, props, actors, and financial support for crew members. But, that's just one part of the puzzle. \nEnter Branch will build upon visual collaborations found in Rushing Past Willow. While the former project mainly concentrated on dance film, I plan to commission films, animations, and potentially virtual reality endeavors that expand the narrative. Additionally, I will use my own skills in film-making in this endeavor. These visuals will be released online throughout the year after the album release, free of charge for all to enjoy on their own terms. Similar to Rushing Past Willow, I intend to perform with many of the videos in live concerts.\nRelease\nRushing Past Willow was a fantastic success, reaching audiences around the world, garnering accolades from major press (Wall Street Journal, Huffington Post, Pop Matters, and many more, along with national and international awards for film). \nThe previous project was limited by one thing; financial resources. The printing of albums, label fees, production, and PR are some of the most costly aspects of releasing an album. While I\u2019m immensely proud of the work that Rushing Past Willow put into the world (especially considering the bare-bones budget), I\u2019ve learned a great deal from the experience. While this was new during RPW's release, I now have a much stronger understanding of how the process works.  Now I need the means to do it.\nYour financial support will directly allow Enter Branch to reach audiences of all kinds, connecting us through a common message and musical experience.\n\nWhat you are funding\nIn order to fully realize this project, I need to raise $20,000. These funds will cover:\n$7000 covers initial PR costs\n$4500 label fees\n$4000 towards mixing/mastering\n$500 towards the creation of cover art\n$4000 video production and collaboration\nIn past decades, when the record industry was at its peak, a major label would cover these essential costs and aid with publicity pursuits. But, the nature of the business has shifted. I'm excited and eager to pursue this project on a much larger level. Your donation will help Enter Branch reach new ears, connecting people through an experience of grown, vulnerability, and community.\nExciting Reward Tiers!\nOver the past few years, I have used my work as a media artist to fund many of my projects. Enter Branch is going to create this same dynamic!  Your donation at many of the \"Media Level\" tiers will both help YOU acquire some excellent media by yours truly, while also making this project a reality. KEEP AN EYE OPEN FOR SOME SPECIAL POP-UP DEALS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN!\n\nWe Can Do This!\nThere has been an unparalleled amount of love, time, and financial resources invested into this project. The pieces have already touched the lives of audiences in live concerts, and it is time to share them on an even wider scale. Rushing Past Willow exceeded the reach and expectations of everyone involved. Functioning on a skeleton budget, the project changed lives.  This time, we\u2019ll do it right. I can only imagine the impact that your contribution will have.\nStretch Goal\nThis is dreaming big...but I would love to pursue another part of this project.  I recorded these tracks and engineered them, but the thing is...as soon as the music is out in the world, it's not mine anymore.  It's ours.  I'd like to investigate that further with a sort of \"remix commissioning\" project.\nIf we get past the $20,000 goal, the funds will be split two ways.  First, additional proceeds would go to additional visual projects.  Second, I will look for mix artists, DJ's, EA composers, etc, and commission remixes from them, giving them free reign over the audio from the tracks of Enter Branch.  I would LOVE to hear your feedback on this!  Do you have people who you want to remix this music?  If we get into the stretch goal, let's talk!\nIf we made it to the stretch goal, I would commission these remixes and put out an Enter Branch Remix album as a digital-only release.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor the past 18 months, I have been recording these compositions. These pieces are the culmination of years of composition and practice. At this point, the compositions feel communicative, authentic, and ready to be shared. Though it was no simple task to align schedules and find times and places to record, all guest artists have already recorded their parts, and mixing has already begun. The rest of the process lies in post-production and the creation of the visual component. To ensure the completion of the project, I\u2019ll be confirming the commitment of a solid team for the release (label management, PR personnel, etc). One thing that I\u2019ve learned from Rushing Past Willow was the sheer amount of time and planning needed in order to have a successful release. If delays occur, it will only be in order to carefully plan this project\u2019s trajectory. I\u2019m working to create the absolute best product possible, and we will go through revisions until the composition is resonating with all parties. But at this point, the necessary foundation is already in place for Enter Branch to succeed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital download", "descp": "Get a digital download of the new album upon release.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Download", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["53 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "The real deal: physical album + download", "descp": "Here it is!

Plenty of zines/prints/tickets are still available!\nVisions for the End of the World is a solo theatrical performance developed by me, Scott Crandall.\nIn 2015, I began writing the first poems that over the next two years would be developed into the performance. In 2017, the piece premiered with the support of Monty Etzcorn as a co-designer and technician. Now, we're gearing up to take the next step: a tour around the Midwest and the East Coast, a series of original linoleum block prints, and a zine that includes text written for the project. \nImage from early (2016) work-in-progress performance\nThe Zines and Prints\nFrom the earliest writings, \"Visions for the End of the World\" was always meant to include visual/written material as well as a performance. Through my collaboration with Monty, that's finally going to happen. \nWe're releasing a zine that includes text that is either in the performance or was written as a part of the development of the show digitally overlaid on eco-prints that Monty developed.   \nAlongside the zines, we're producing a series of three original linoleum block prints inspired by images from the show. These visual materials will help to make subsequent productions of \"Visions\" financially feasible by selling them at performances. Here are the three relief print designs:\nThe Tour\nSo far, \"Visions\" has been performed about 15 times in full, and always in Michigan. This tour will include roughly 20 performances across 10 states, and show the work to hundreds of people. Over the course of two 14-day trips between May and July, we will show the piece at about sixteen unique venues. \nThe tour will kickoff with two weekends of performances in Detroit - the first weekend will be May 17th and 18th at Spread Art in Woodbridge, and the second on May 24th and 25th at ANDY on Fenkell. Tickets to these performances are available in the rewards.\nThe Midwest Loop!\n\nThe Budget\n$1800 gets the project into the air, and helps to cover the up-front costs of getting everything together. Here's the line items we need to cover to make this thing happen:\n- Raw Materials for Zines & Prints:       $675\n- Gas:                                                           $350\n- Space Rental:                                         $300 \n- Sound Equipment:                                 $225   \n- Lighting Equipment:                              $100\n- Kickstarter Fees:                                    $150", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough we have lots of experience producing and self-producing performances, and with putting up \"Visions\" in a short amount of time or in unconventional spaces, we don't have any experience with touring.

He's a Master Engineer and Acoustic Sorcerer; his expertise, ears, knowledge, and flexibility have made the process joyful and the music sound so good.\nThe album circulates around melodies, structures, thorough-composed sections, and open improvisation.  Some of the tracks are jazz tunes I wrote in college.  Some of them are more recent compositions.  Some are based on traditional Shaker music making.  All of them express tidbits of the rhythms and songs that go through my head all day.  I'm happy to be able to share them.\nI landed on the concept of micro-liths because it expresses fragmentation, diminution, and solidity.  Microliths are prehistoric tools: tiny, sharp, intentionally carved pieces of stone.  Their specific functions aren't known, other than that they were probably useful for small household tasks, and they were sometimes glued into bunches to make nasty spears.  I hope this music is in some small way enjoyable to you and that a few rhythmic or melodic ideas stick with you.  This album captures some of my musical fragments, in a few of their many iterations through time.\nIn addition to time, effort, rehearsals, coordination, and listening, creating this album takes money, which is where you come in!  I hope you will consider donating.  I'd like to make Microliths available in CD format and on Bandcamp.  I've made other things for you that you can have if you donate more, too!

In 2012 we released our debut album as a larger ensemble with all traditional songs. Since then, we developed our sound, stripping down to the bare essentials and blending the spacious combination of three live horns and drums & bass with electronic effects and vocals. We continued our exploration of music from the Balkans and, most excitingly, spent countless hours writing and rehearsing new compositions that we are ready to record and share with the world! Our current lineup consists of the visionary Drew Schmieding on drums, the lively Ben Rolston on bass, the experimental Derek Worthington on trumpet, the improvisatory Eric Schweizer on reeds, and the intuitive Bethanni Grecynski on trombone, kaval (Bulgarian shepherd's flute), and vocals. \nTHE PROJECT: About This Campaign \nWe cannot wait to share this music with you. We are extremely proud of the unique compositions we've been working up and the distinct sound we've developed as a band. But there are many costs involved in producing a record, which is why we're asking for your support. The money we raise here will go directly to pay for the costs of this project:\nstudio expenses \nengineering\nmixing\nmastering \nartwork \ndesign \nmanufacturing\nYour support will bring our vision of this music to life! The album and all the rewards offered in this campaign are original - including CDs, vinyl, drawstring backpacks, aprons, and more - and we know you'll enjoy them. Certain items will require a decision of color or design so we'll get in touch after we've been sucessfully funded (fingers crossed). Bethanni and Ben are in the process of creating amazing artwork which will be featured on the album and the rewards. \nThroughout this process we've been working with some truly inspiring recording engineers, Rishi Daftuar and Don Godwin. Their dedication and craft are showcased in each of the songs you'll hear on the record.\n THE MUSIC: Hear Examples From the Album Setlist \nThe following tracks are demo rough versions of songs we intend to record on this exciting second release. They represent the basic structure of each song to offer perspective on what you can expect, but the final versions will be much more warm, full, and sonorous.\nBalkan Space Camp\n Kromanica\n Hedcek\nOUR PREVIOUS RECORD:\nITEM MOCK UPS:\nLaptop Bag Mockup\n                             ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the first time we've released an album on vinyl, which offers its own unique challenges in terms of mixing, mastering, and printing.

Organized by Ann Arbor bassist, composer and band leader Dave Sharp and a committee of dedicated volunteers, (http://www.davesharp.com) the A2 JAZZ FEST grew out of the weekly jazz series at the Old Town Tavern in downtown Ann Arbor, which began in November of 2014.\n\nNestled in the heart of the Water Hill neighborhood of Ann Arbor, the A2 JAZZ FEST will light up the Ann Arbor Distilling Company on Friday September 8th and 9th, with an eclectic line-up of some of Ann Arbor\u2019s most exciting Jazz performers, representing a multi-generational commitment to the art of Jazz music. Our FREE community festival will showcase a phenomenal line up of artists that includes both established musicians and students from middle school right through to University level. This is in keeping with the A2 Jazz Fest\u2019s commitment to provide spaces and opportunities that organically foster musical mentoring relationships between musicians. Festival supporters can expect music for every taste, from traditional well-loved standards to original compositions and explorations of important life themes. \nWe hope that you will partner with us through making a financial contribution, sharing the Kickstarter with others and attending the festival with friends and family.

Otherwise I will not see your name until after the deadline. \nThe Album\nThe song playing in the video above is Oh, What A Morning (it fades out before the final verse). It is just one of ten songs that will be featured on this album. I've been performing these songs locally over the last two years and now I'm so excited to get them out there for the rest of the world to hear!\nThe album was home-recorded by myself and has been mixed by Adam Krinsky of Bellows Studio in St. Paul, MN. The next steps in the process will be to get the album mastered, design the artwork, and send it off for replication.\nThe Cost of Producing this album\nThe true cost of producing this album is far more than my goal of $6000. I am seeking funds to pay only for the mixing, mastering, and replication of 1000 CDs. Here is a breakdown of the costs for which I'm seeking support through this Kickstarter: \nMixing $3000\nMastering $1000\nGraphic Design $500\nManufacturing of CDs $1500\nCosts I am covering myself are: Recording gear ($3500 including computer, software, interface, microphones), the sourcing and assembling of rewards ($1000 for zine copying, T-shirts, prints, etc.), and Kickstarter fees (approx. 8%-10% of total pledged amount so at least $480). \nSome notes about the Rewards: \nThe Art Zine (pronounced 'zeen') is a small photocopied booklet (mini-magazine) of original sketches, musings, photos, & text. For this Kickstarter project I will be making a special new zine available only to backers. Each one will be signed. Here are some pics of the cover and inside pages of a previous zine I made: \nCover and pages from my first Ingeborg von Agassiz zine, 2015\nAbout the 8x10 Art Prints: I am also a painter and these prints are of a few of my favorite acrylic paintings I've made in the last few years. Prints will be unmatted and unframed. \nBeard Party\n  Charlie Party\n  Rose Bush\nAbout the T-Shirts: I'm super excited I will be working with Duluth Screen Printing for the creation of my first-ever run of T-shirts! I will post updates on what the actual T-shirt design will look like as soon as I know. In the meantime, check out their website and feast your eyes on the video that runs in the background. I could watch it on repeat all day.\nhttp://www.duluthscreenprinting.com\nOriginal 8x10 Watercolor and Typewriter Text Artwork: Each watercolor artwork will include text printed from an antique Underwood No. 5 typewriter (you see me typing on it in the video!). The text will be derived from Ingeborg von Agassiz song lyrics. No two watercolor artworks will be the same. Here are some prototypes of what this artwork might look like (these images are just to give you an idea - it's going to be a fun surprise to see what you'll get!): \nWatercolor & text prototypes\n Wanna hear more right now? \nCheck out: www.youtube.com/c/ingeborgvonagassiz\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt's possible that the project timeline could delay because of last minute-changes being made to the album or because of technical difficulties - but I will update as the project goes along.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Download", "descp": "Digital Download of entire album ahead of the release date.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Signed Copy of CD", "descp": "A signed copy of the CD shipped to your door.

Thanks for visiting our Kickstarter.\nMarateck is an instrumental rock band that deals in opposites and contradictions: minimalist vs. maximalist, consonance vs. dissonance, mechanistic vs. humanistic. The result is intense, emotional music played with obsessive, virtuosic precision.\n\"New York-based math-minimalist quartet channels more than any reasonable listener can handle, but in the most efficient way possible. On a self-titled EP released this summer, Marateck's stripped-down, articulate take on math-rock yields a sense of pointillistic perfection. They're adept at both creating a feeling of space and filling it up, shifting between atmospheric passages and bursts of brutal upheaval.\" - Emili Earhart, Tone Madison\nThe band is named after guitarist Jesse Kranzler's great-grandfather, Jacob Marateck, who was sentenced to death four times. In his life, Jacob stirred the pot and created dissonance in times of consonance and sought to create consonance in times of dissonance. \nAbout Time Is Over:\nTime Is Over is the result of over 2 years of writing, rewriting, rehearsing, and honing in on our sound as a band. It was commissioned, in part, by Roulette Intermedium and the Jerome Fund for New Music. This is our first cohesive statement as a band, but it is also a summary of everything this band has done up until this point.\nThe album was co-composed by guitarists Jesse Kranzler & Brendon Randall-Myers and features additional arrangements from bassist Tristan Kasten-Krause and drummer Mark Utley. The album includes the four songs from our trio EP reworked and re-imagined in a grander quartet setting plus four new songs that show where the band is moving.\nThe album was recorded, mixed and mastered by Colin Marston (Gorguts, Krallice, Behold The Arctopus) at Menegroth: The Thousand Caves and features synth and keyboard performances from Jeremy Malvin (aka Chrome Sparks.) Album art and design will be done by John Robert Moore.\nNow that's a Big Gibby if I've ever seen one\nWhere You Come In:\nWe recorded the album in the Summer of 2016, but need your help to put finishing touches on the album, the artwork, and manufacture a physical product for you to hang on your shelf.\nWhere Your Money Will Go\nWe've put together a set of juicy rewards that we hope will whet your appetite and put you in the giving mood.

I\u2019m excited to share this music with you - but to see this project through, I need your help.\nSince childhood I\u2019ve had a deep love for music, and in recent years I\u2019ve been inspired to write and produce my own. Being closely involved with friends on their original music has played a large role in that interest, and watching them put all the parts together has given me examples of how to complete a project. Another influence has always been the deep history of creative music that\u2019s come from Detroit. I feel fortunate to have grown up in such an inspiring culture of artists dedicated to creating and collaborating. As I prepare to relocate to New York City in the fall, making this album feels both like the closing of one chapter and the beginning of another, and this music feels like connective tissue between the two. And even though we come from different places, making this music with musicians I met in Michigan felt appropriate: Andrew Bishop (tenor saxophone, bass clarinet), Molly Jones (tenor and soprano saxophones), Ben Rolston (bass), and Kirsten Carey (guitar).\nIn an essay on dream analysis, Carl Jung wisely wrote, \u201cIt is the way of dreams to give us more than we ask.\" I thought this was a perfect description of the project: it encapsulated the idea of having plenty of material inside of ourselves to work with and develop if only we were to pay attention to it. Writing this music, then, became a way of paying attention to and drawing from the material already inside myself, whether that meant memories from childhood or a current favorite song. This thinking influenced everything from decisions about balancing improvised and composed material to moods of songs (or sections of songs) to titles. In a larger sense, I believe continuing to use this philosophy as a starting point for creating will help to make future projects more personal and - hopefully - relatable.\nEach contribution deserves a BIG thank you, and I\u2019m deeply grateful for any amount. My hope is that the rewards I\u2019m offering say that and then some. Thank you for supporting music for today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s listeners.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy biggest challenge with this project will be staying on schedule to have the album in hand by May of 2017.

Very simply put, we at Hopskeller Brewing Company want to engage our fans and community in the creation of a beer garden for our new brewpub in downtown Waterloo, Illinois. Our 7-bbl brewery, which is slated to open early this spring, will be situated in a historic home on the courthouse square and has a sizable backyard that's just begging for landscaping. We've gotten to the point where we can start thinking about how our outdoor area will look; with your help, this will become a beautiful fixture of downtown Waterloo, built by our fans and for our fans!\nOur Background...\nWhile Hopskeller Brewing Company may have started out as the flight of fancy of Matt Schweizer, that dream came closer than ever to becoming a reality at Monroe County's annual \"Taste of the Region\" festival in February of 2014. Matt, at that time a 29-year old history teacher and a homebrewer with 7 years of experience, had presented beers at contests, taught beer history and brewing lessons to enraptured (inebriated?) audiences, and served his beers at more private gatherings and parties than anyone would care to count. Matt's sampling booth at the Taste of the Region seemed to get everyone thinking and, even better, talking: Why can't I buy your beers? You should really look into starting something here in town. We've been dying to get something like that here in Waterloo.\nA few hours (and many gallons of beer) later, and before anyone knew it Matt -- along with a group of business and civic leaders put together at the behest of the city of Waterloo -- was drawing up business plans with the Waterloo residents who wanted to see this thing happen... all the while, sharing, sharing, and sharing loads of beer with anyone who could drink.\nBefore long, Matt and his partners began to attract community members who wanted to volunteer their time and expertise to the project; together with these locals and with well-wishers throughout the Saint Louis area and beyond, Hopskeller is set to become a major staple of the downtown Waterloo experience by the spring of 2016!\nThe Brews...\nOur brewers have won over 15 awards at sanctioned homebrewing competitions across the country since the summer of 2015 alone, so we're confident that you'll leave our new brewery feeling like your donation was worth it! \nCreating and evaluating our Blonde Ale at the \"pilot plant\"\nOur specialties are English-style ales and Northwest Coast American ales. The choice of beers has some sentimental importance; Matt has lived in northern England and Oregon, and both places were instrumental in helping develop his style and brewing philosophy. Many of Hopskeller's beers come from recipes that Matt created to relive the greatest moments of traveling in Europe and the American Northwest, and we hope that these beers will create memories for you, too! \nMatt and our partners at Alpha Brewing Operations (Lincoln, NE) designing the 7-bbl brewery\nWe will, of course, offer a wide array of seasonal ales and lagers that test the artistry of our brewing team and will hopefully intrigue even the most experienced beer nerd!\nThe Money...\nTake it in, folks: the rest of this yard will be your beer garden!\nLet's get down to the nitty-gritty; you want to know what your money will help build, and we're more than happy to tell you. We are well into the process of construction and we're set to open in the spring of this year. Your donation will largely go to providing a community-driven beer garden worthy of its name. Be on the lookout if we go over our target; we can't wait to show you specifically how your money will make Hopskeller a truly unique place!\nThank you for looking at our campaign, and we want to especially thank everyone who donates. With your help, we'll leave a permanent mark on Waterloo that all of us can be proud of!\nHow to Follow Us...\nWhile we've been featured in local media outlets and publications, follow our story from the beginning -- and stay up-to-date on all of our new projects -- by following us on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.

We worked with an excellent engineer to turn the Stone into a pristine, pop-up recording studio. So in addition to collaborating with many friends and premiering new projects, the band recorded a set of our newest quartet music each night. We began touring with this music in February 2014, so it was road-tested, well-rehearsed - and is some of our most challenging and ferocious music to date. It's also our first recording with bassist Pat Swoboda, who joined the band in late 2012. We're really excited about the music and bringing it to the world.\n\nFor numerous reasons, we've decided to release this one on our own imprint, Gut Records, which is the in-house label that started it all for us back in 2001 with our debut, InsomniacsDream. As you probably know, the record industry has changed dramatically since 2001, so a self-release these days is much more common, but it also requires that we pay for our sound engineer, the mixing, mastering, manufacturing, design, artwork, publicity, and all of that stuff which brings CDs or even digital downloads to good people like you who still like to buy things from musicians, because you believe in supporting their work. \n\nSo we're asking for your help in the final stages of production, publicity and tour support. Plus, we're doing something really fun with this - a first for us - we're making a music video! Wow, hello 1980's. We've enlisted our pal, the multitalented composer and video artist Florent Ghys (www.florentghys.com) to make a video for \"Luton\" the first tune on \"Dance.\" It'll involve some choreography, some improvisation, and we expect it to be a thing of beauty. \n\nWe're really excited about this project and bringing this music to you!

We've worked with a handful of labels in the past, but doing this one on our own label made the most sense. We were smart shoppers when we set up our recording project at the Stone, but we also hired an engineer with excellent gear and wonderful ears, and that costs money. After making the record sound its best, we hoped that by releasing the CD ourselves and keeping our other productions cost sensible, we can funnel all of our money back into covering our expenses. We decided to print eco-wallets instead of jewel case CDs so that shipping is less expensive and the materials that go into the actual physical product have a gentler carbon footprint. \n\nWe also recognize that spending money on publicity is risky - we plan to tour the US and Europe as we've always done to have the most direct interaction with our fans and support our efforts to bring \"Dance\" to lots of people, but touring is challenging, and it can be expensive and financially risky.

I'm Joel Hodgson. \nOnce upon a time, a television series called MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 was born. We debuted on Minneapolis' KTMA, local television, on Thanksgiving Day 1988, as the world was in the final throes of Teddy Ruxpin-mania. That was almost thirty years ago, but for some reason, people still seem to like the show \u2013 it\u2019s a mitzvah!\nOur show has had a long, strange run. Across a UHF channel, a cable network, cancellation, a feature film, then another cable network, the show lasted for 12 years, two generations of hosts and puppeteers, 2 Emmy nominations and a total of 197 episodes before we got canceled again for good in 1999. Sadly, it was just as Prince predicted.\nBut maybe that's not where it all ends.\nStarting today, we finally get a chance to bring back MST3K.\nWith your help, we can create a new season of MST3K, prove there's still an audience, and maybe even convince a network to bring us back for more.\nGreat question.\nThe simplest answer is that there are a lot of cheesy movies left to riff, and a lot of people who would still enjoy watching them with us.\nPlus, I think there's a place for us. Nowadays, riffing is everywhere! Many people claim that MST3K created a shift in the way people watch TV shows, and that now, as a result, the fields of entertainment have been plowed and readied for a riffing renaissance.\nI mean, look at the influence it\u2019s had... Everyone riffs on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Hell, there are ten to twelve people who are still, unironically, riffing on MySpace and Friendster.\nIn a world where riffing has become as common as our national pastime, baseball, it makes sense: like baseball, everyone knows how to play, but sometimes it feels good to just sit back and watch the original movie riffing team take a whack at it. And if we came back, imagine all the riffs we could make about things like Uber or Cards Against Humanity!\nAlso, there\u2019s a pile of scriptural evidence in whichever sacred text that you hold dear to prove that we need more seasons of MST3K\u2026 so when you share on social media, you know you\u2019re not going to offend anybody.\nYou know, I just read that last sentence... and actually, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re going to offend everybody. But at least you can rest assured that you\u2019ll offend everyone equally.\nWe do, and here's why: I think it's because MST3K is more than just movie riffing. It's a stranger and denser recipe than just saying smart aleck things to a forgotten movie, but I think this is the secret ingredient: we believed that it's easiest to survive the cheesy movie that we're living in with friends who keep us from taking it all too seriously.\nNow, I don\u2019t want to get too maudlin about it, because being too serious is the enemy of comedy. We weren't trying to send a message: job #1 was always to make a funny show. But while we were doing that, I hope we also helped show the kids that society, and the stupid things we say and do to each other, are \"just a show, and you should really just relax.\u201d\nYeah, this is what I was afraid of. Now I\u2019m starting to sound like the Dr. Bronner's label. Next question?\nThe simplest answer is: until now, we couldn't bring MST3K back.\nI've been thinking about ways to re-animate MST3K for over a decade... and over the last 15 years, I've met thousands of you who said that you wanted MST3K back too. But two things have finally changed that make this the right time. And I'm not talking about the legalization of marijuana or the proliferation of water jet pack use.\n1. Crowdfunding gives fans the power to get what they want.\nIn less than two years, I've watched fans use crowdfunding to bring back Veronica Mars, Reading Rainbow and Super Troopers \u2013 all cult favorites, like us \u2013 and it made me wonder how MSTies would respond if we had the chance to return. Now we're going to find out\u2026 and then maybe LeVar Burton can finally stop acting like he\u2019s so much better than us.\n2. We had to work through some complicated legal issues.\nEven though we've always wanted to bring MST3K back, it wasn't that easy. Thanks to the Last Will and Testament of one eccentric old heiress, the rights were tied up for years. It took time to work those issues out, but with the help of my friends at Shout Factory, a special chokehold I perfected in WuDang that I like to call \u201cThe Persuader,\u201d and a night I had to spend in a haunted house as a term of the the old lady\u2019s will, we succeeded.\nThis summer, we finally got all of the rights cleared up\u2026 and now, like Orpheus, we can now descend into hell to hang out with a couple of wisecracking robots.\nNow we're talking!\nOur Kickstarter campaign has two really important goals.\nAs soon as we reach our minimum goal of $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three new feature length episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But then, for each additional $1.1 million we raise, we can make three more... up to a full season of 12 episodes!\n(If you're wondering why new episodes cost so much \u2013 especially the first three \u2013 keep going down the page to \"HOW WE'LL USE YOUR MONEY,\" or take a look at the Backer Update where I explained the budget in detail.)\nHere's a simple diagram to help you remember our goals:\nIf we can raise even more than that, I'd love to shoot some (or all) of the new season LIVE in front of an audience \u2013 and maybe even stream the show live on the internet! (Oh yeah: I just saw your eyes light up.)\nFinally, if we raise $1 BILLION \u2013 stay with me on this one \u2013 we\u2019re going to adopt a real live teenage boy and \u201cTruman Show\u201d him into believing he is the Pumaman!\nHear us out, because this goal is just as important: we're not just crowdfunding because we need funding. \nWe're also doing it because we need the crowd!\nIf we want a lot more MST3K, we need to work together to prove that there's still an audience out there that wants MST3K \u2013 and that this isn't all some pitiable delusion \u2013 so that we can find a network or online platform who will agree to pick up the show and keep it going\u2026 hopefully for another 200+ episodes.\nEven if you can only spare $5 or $10, every extra backer helps us send a message to the networks: it's time to #BringBackMST3K.\n____\nOkay. It's time for me to put away the grease gun and give you your marching orders.\nIf any of this rings true to you, we need your help now to spread the word. Back in the day, every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged fans to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes.\u201d And you guys did.\nThose grassroots efforts helped MST3K find friends and fans at a time when the rest of show business didn\u2019t quite know what to make of us. It was social media in its most primitive form... and because of you, it worked.\nToday's, it's time to update that phrase for the internet age. If you're with us, this is your call to action, MSTies.\nAnd while you're at it, you can help out even more by taking a minute to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. (Apparently those matter more than Nielsen ratings, now!)\nListen, I know this Kickstarter idea isn\u2019t for everyone. Neither was Mystery Science Theater 3000. But just like MST3K itself, I know the right people will get it.\nThanks for reading. I hope you'll join us. \nJoel\nDear People of the Internet,\nWelcome to my first-ever Official Crow-Funding Campaign. Tee Hee!\nAs #1 Golden Shiny Boy Champion, I need a place to shine bright and inspire. I want to be a part of your life again, serving in both a wind-beneath-your-wings and an ASRM capacity. You know you still want me, baby, but allow me to tell you why.\nFirst, I like POP! Figures. I intend to roll most of the money into Funko stock. Plus a few hat parties.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to open up a long-overdue public dialogue on Cee-Lo Green and his fashion choices.\n\nThen, I plan on turning at least a thousand dollars\u2019 worth of funds into pennies, which I will press into elongated souvenir coins at theme parks and fairs.\n\nFinally, if you are still undecided, I ask you to consider this: after years of waiting, I will finally get to decide who lives and who dies. You don\u2019t want to be on the wrong list, do you?\nI look forward to your loyal service in the many years of the New Golden Age to come.\nYour Future Supreme Being,\nCrow T. Robot\nHello, Ladies.\nI'm pleased to be with you again. It's been too long. Now that we're about to be a huge crowdfunding hit, I've got a few things I'd like to discuss with you.\nIt turns out that the last 15 years have been kind to our legacy: we're famous now. And not internet famous, either. Real famous. I have lots of female fans.\nAngelina, Scarlett, and many women named Madison: I've got parts in the new show with your names on them. You can come over and we can run lines in my bungalow, and I\u2019ll make us a curry. Then if things get \u201cconsensual,\u201d so be it.\nI\u2019ll also pretty much be the \u201ctroubleshooter\u201d on this Kickstarter campaign, because I understand how you think and I\u2019m a master of social media. My god: you do realize that I\u2019m the uncredited creator of both memes and avatars?\nI\u2019M ALSO THE FIRST SENTIENT BEING TO TYPE A MESSAGE IN ALL CAPS.\nWhat are you waiting for? Get out to the Kickstarter polls and start voting.\nYours,\nTom Servo\nHey everyone. It's Joel again.\nLook, I know what you're wondering, so go ahead\u2026 just say it.\nBelieve me, man. I get it. If it cost $2 million just to make three episodes, we'd be spending almost $700K per show! And you're right: by itself, an episode of MST3K doesn't cost nearly that much. \nThe real explanation is pretty simple.\n1. We don't get to keep all of the money we raise on Kickstarter! \nCAMPAIGN FEES: Out of the first $2,000,000, we have to pay about 8% \u2013 that's $160,000 \u2013 in fees to Kickstarter and the credit card processor.\n\nREWARD & SHIPPING COSTS: Then, we have to design, produce, print, sort and ship all of the rewards we're offering in exchange for your pledge. (Those t-shirts aren't free, you know!) That costs about 27%, so that's another $540,000.\n(We're not charging you twice for shipping, I promise. Even though Kickstarter asks you to add more for shipping, they count that money toward the total we've raised, even though we still have to spend it on, you know\u2026 shipping!)\nSo, out of the first $2,000,000 we raise, we have to spend $700,000 just on the costs of this Kickstarter campaign!\n2. Then, we have to spend a lot on startup costs just to get the show going. \nTo shoot new episodes, there's a lot we'll need to do: creating concept art and designs, building sets, making models, creating costumes, adding new features to upgrade the robots, and all sorts of other things. All of that work costs money, which is why our first $2,000,000 includes $550,000 for startup costs. The good part is that every penny of that ends up on screen where you can see it.\n3. But... the more episodes we make, the less each episode costs! \nWe have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we make. If we only make 3 episodes, these costs increase the budget for each episode by $183K\u2026 but if we make a full 12, they only increase it by $46K each!\nAnyway, once you take out the CAMPAIGN, REWARD and STARTUP COSTS, there's a lot less than $2,000,000 left. In fact, that leaves just $750K for three episodes, which \u2013 I hope \u2013 sounds a lot more reasonable than $2,000,000!\nAt the end of the day, our goal is to make each episode for around $250K.\nTo put that in perspective, that means we're spending less to create 90 minutes of MST3K than even the low-end reality shows spend to make 22 minutes! (Really makes ya think, don't it?) \nNow, if you're as tired of reading as I am of writing, here are some wicked cool graphics that explain all of this:\nI know not everyone will want this much explanation, but if I'm asking you to trust me with your money, I think it's important to be crystal clear about how we're using it. \nPlus, $750K for each set of three episodes feels a lot better than $2,000,000. \n(But man, I'd hate to try to sell a car to you people. Tough crowd!)\nHopefully by now, you're already on board. Maybe you're not even reading this. Maybe you've already made your contribution, selected your rewards, and are now rushing around the internet helping spread the good word to all of your MST3K-deprived friends!\nBut if you're still on the fence, maybe I can make it easier for you.\nPersonally, I think the most compelling reason to help out is that you want to see new episodes of MST3K\u2026 and not just for you. Think of the friends and family who you can finally introduce to the new MST3K: the one with a fresh new cast, fresh new riffs, and zesty new cheesy movies!\nOn the other hand, let\u2019s not any of us forget: this is Kickstarter. I know that you know that that\u2019s gonna mean some cool rewards for helping us out. And for a show that\u2019s never really been about cool merch...I think we\u2019ve finally got some!\nUPDATE! We've gotten a lot of questions asking exactly what's included with each package, so we've put together another helpful little chart:\nYou can see all of the rewards on the right side of the page, but here are a few highlights:\nBecome... Part of MYSTERY SCIENCE HISTORY!\nAll backers \u2013 no matter what you pledge \u2013 will be invited to join the new MST3K Information Club. (It's like the old MST3K Info Club, only better. And modern. And more exclusive. And wider in the hips.) Over the next year, we'll invite you to help us rediscover MST3K and get it oiled up and running smoothly. You'll be part of the process!\nRead... Our Page-Turning Insider Updates \nWe don't just want to take your cash and walk away: we want to take your cash and talk away! Most Kickstarter projects promise \"exclusive behind-the-scenes updates,\" but this time, I mean it: I've already started planning things I want to share with you. It'll be like getting email from me, Crow and Servo for at least a year.\nPossess... Amazing, Terrifying, Heart-Warming New MST3K Swag\nBefore the end of the campaign, we'll start sharing the designs we're planning for some of the #BringBackMST3K swag you can get, including the OFFICIAL T-SHIRT ($50+), OFFICIAL MUG ($75+), OFFICIAL KEYCHAIN ($100+), OFFICIAL POSTER ($150), and many more. We've got several amazing artists working on this stuff. I can't wait for you to see it.\nTake Control.... of the New Episodes!Bringing back MST3K isn't enough power for you? Great! For real high-rollers, we're offering all sorts of ways to be part of the episodes themselves. You can\u2026\nSteal the hearts of millions when you... APPEAR IN AN EPISODE! \nThrow your weight around and\u2026 BECOME A PRODUCER! \nKickstart your new riffing career and\u2026 HELP WRITE AN EPISODE!\nImmortalize your favorite inside joke with\u2026 A PERSONAL RIFF!\nOwn and Command... Your OWN Robot Friend!\nThis one is difficult for me, but I want to make sure this Kickstarter succeeds, so I'm willing to make the sacrifice: a very limited number of you can KEEP THE ACTUAL CROW and/or SERVO FEATURED IN A NEW EPISODE! They'll record a personalized video for you, and then we'll ship them off to your doorstep. When we're done shooting.\n1. FOLLOW \"@MST3K\" ON ALL OF OUR SOCIAL CHANNELS.Be sure to follow our official accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Ask your fellow MSTies to follow them too! Tell them that those numbers have a really big impact when we start asking networks to #BringBackMST3K for more new seasons.\n2. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGES AT THE END OF EACH UPDATE. At the end of each Backer Update, Crow or Servo will share a message or image that you can copy and paste to share with your friends, to help spread the word.\n3. KEEP CIRCULATING THE FACTS\u2026 NICELY! I know there are still some fans out there who are skeptical about this Kickstarter, about why MST3K costs so much money and how we'll spend it, about bringing in a third cast, about who is and isn't going to be involved\u2026 So, like they say on the subway, \"If you see something, say something!\" If you hear fans insisting that $2MM is more than we need to make three episodes, or that the old team isn't invited back, I hope you'll share the facts with them. (Please be nice, though! The internet needs a lot more of that.)\n4. JOIN (OR START) A LOCAL MST3K MEETUP GROUP.\nThe internet is great, but sometimes riffing is even better when you can meet old (and new) friends in person! There are already a lot of MST3K groups on meetup.com, but if there's not one near you, start one now and invite your friends! We've got some events planned for this month, and we'll be calling on all the local groups to be part of them.\nAs long as we have the funds we need, we'll be able to produce new episodes. That part is easy! But over the last month, I've had lots of time to think about all the possible risks and challenges MST3K could face...\nMAYBE THE WORLD HAS CHANGED!\nMST3K has been away for a long time. YouTube didn't even exist when we shot the last episode of MST3K. (Yes, Virginia, there was a world before YouTube. People laughed more back then. Colors were brighter. There were concerts in the park.)\nI've imagined many hypothetical risks:\nWhat if no one enjoys watching B-movies anymore? \n What if you don't want us talking while you do? \n What if there is an unknown virus that has killed mankind's ability to enjoy a good solid ironic viewing? \nWhat if kids playing in \u201cGarry\u2019s Mod\u201d on Twitch have made the whole thing meaningless? \nWhat if robot-shaped puppets don\u2019t have the overwhelming cultural significance they once did? \nWhat if our collective consciousness can\u2019t take the excitement, and the entire world becomes a flash mob, and we all steal our own TVs?\nWhat if all eight billion people on the planet become a single \u201cImprov Everywhere\u201d troupe, but don\u2019t have anyone left to surprise?!?\nAs you can see, this whole endeavor is fraught with risks.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been over this!

We recorded this album at our favorite hall in the United States: New England Conservatory's landmark Jordan Hall. Now, we're raising funds to release this album and build a new platform for our music and our message.\nAbout Our Duo\nThe first time we played together, a decade ago, we knew something special was in the air. Part of it is our 'string story'. We both play the viola, the unsung hero of the string world, and each of us charted our own path as improvisers at a time when 'jazz viola' was still an oxymoron. \n\nThen: Mat at NEC and Tanya in her Juilliard dorm room, circa 1988.\nBut really, it\u2019s because we share the same basic beliefs about music. For each of us, improvisation is not about letting go \u2014 it's about digging in. It's a discipline; a ritual space that binds us to the moment and trains us to be be present to every possibility. When we play, we listen with more than just our ears: we listen with all the parts of our experience. \n\nWe play out of our belief that every one of us has a personal voice\u2014a secret melody\u2014that sings the essential quality of the self. That voice treats tension, uncertainty and difference as literal and figurative counterpoint. It's empathy made audible. And whenever we play this way, we create a space for others to do the same.\n\nNow: Mat and Tanya after a masterclass in North Carolina, and outside NEC (2015)\nAbout Magic Mountain\n\nMagic Mountain is a suite of nine pieces. We started with a simple set-up: two violas, two chairs, and a few microphones. And what unfolded from that was everything.\n\nWe borrowed our album\u2019s name from Der Zauberberg (The Magic Mountain), the 1924 book by Thomas Mann. On the surface, Mann's story is about a young man whose three-week visit to a Swiss sanitarium mysteriously turns into seven years. Dig deeper, though, and the story is an exploration of the nature of time: its illusions and distortions, and the ambiguous quality of memory. \n\nSome people say The Magic Mountain is a challenging read. Maybe it\u2019s because Mann doesn\u2019t serve up narrative in a straightforward fashion. He narrates time the way his hero experiences it: unraveling, expanding, and merging into the present. \n\nSome people say that our music is a challenging listen. If it's so, then perhaps it's because we don\u2019t serve up our musical stories in a straightforward fashion, either. Are we improvising, or composing on the spot? Are we playing chamber music or jazz? \n\nAs string players, we came of age in a time that asked us to choose between the musical languages we loved. Today, we play music the way we experience, and not how it's categorized. To us, Milton Babbitt is as essential as the Blues, and a Johnny Hodges tone can be played with a Morton Feldman touch.\n\nMuch of what we do blurs the lines around musical things. Tonality? From one note to the next, we might find six microtones to play. Self and other? It can be hard at times\u2014even for us\u2014to tell our voices apart. Time? At any moment, we might feel three meters at play. Sound and silence? To us, the music lives in both. With each performance, we create new chamber music that will never be heard before and will never be heard again.\n\nWe play what we love\n\nMagic Mountain is full of our personal and musical histories. The track titles form a second narrative, rich with clues to who we are and where we've been. Some of the track titles are borrowed from Der Zauberberg, and others allude to figures whose voices speak to us: pianist Paul Bley, actor Paul Muni, the fictional composer Adrian Leverk\u00fchn, and Mat's father, Joe Maneri.\n\nThe Dance of Death, the album's third track, shows the connection we feel between Bach's solo instrumental works and Eliot Carter's first String Quartet. We hear an off-kilter swing in both composers' works. Their downbeats aren't landings, but lifts. Their sense of metric weight is dynamic and kinetic. Our opening notes are a gesture that reveals music already in motion. \n\nForeword, the album's opening track, is a concise summary of our approach to music-making. Earlier this year, Mat transcribed this piece. (A concert score is one of our perks - see the sidebar.) It was a labour of love that allowed him to examine a compositional process that unfolds outside of the sphere of thoughts and words. \n\n\nThe album's opening track is a concise illustration of a compositional process that unfolds outside the sphere of thought or words. In music theory terms, it's a three-part sonata form based on a six-note motif carried through extended harmonic and rhythmic development. In human terms, this track reveals a seamless exchange of roles. Tensions and resolutions shift rapidly between us. Long notes become short ones; loud notes become soft ones; one voice's harmony becomes the other's melody.\n\nThe title of the album's last track, Paul Muni's Boat refers to a favorite saying of Mat\u2019s father, the saxophonist/composer Joe Maneri.

But this music is so close to us that we wanted to be able to retain its personality by releasing it ourselves.\nWe intend Magic Mountain to serve a key role in establishing our presence as a new kind of chamber music ensemble. It will help us to tour more, to record more, and to catalyze new partnerships with presenters, educators, and audiences in every direction.\nOur album is mixed and ready to go. Your pledges will help pay for photography, mastering, graphic design, manufacturing CDs and limited-edition double LPs, and the setup costs to distribute the album through our website. \nReleasing this record helps us to tell our story, and to invite everyone into our conversation.

Imagine sharing those personal memories, and reflecting on the deeply rooted emotions that are attached\u2026\u201d\nRushing Past Willow is the culmination of introspection, research, improvisation, and composition. It is a project that will result in my debut album, which will comprise original compositions that reflect on cultural values and stem from authentic and compassionate experiences, repetitive thought patterns, and meditation.\nI have performed some of these compositions on programs over the past few years, and there has been an overwhelming amount of support! This has conjured the courage to ask for help with the one essential resource that I cannot provide on my own: funding. Every contribution counts, and I wish I could convey more of my awesome gratitude for your help!\nYour financial contribution will help: \ncomplete the recording, mixing, mastering, and distribution process\nfund collaborative opportunities with diverse and talented artists \ncreate repertoire to share with the musical community\ncreate the CD release event\nI aim to release the album by March 2016\nThe Music\n\u201c\u2026sounds radiate from the instrument in all directions, and each one is unique. Your individual experiences further dictate a unique paradigm. Ask yourself, if you captured those individual paradigms, what kind of beautiful product could you create by mixing them together? We\u2019re attempting to combine and enhance individual paradigms for a greater product.\u201d\n\nThe saxophone is simply a tool for musical communication. With any instrumental performance, the emotion invested and the resulting ideas that are communicated transcend the instrument itself. On this album, the diverse sounds of the saxophone will be recorded using an array of 13 microphones. Composer and sound artist Jason Charney will then mix these sounds artistically, creating a composite acoustic image of the solo saxophone's diverse sound.\nAlready, eight tracks have been recorded in conjunction with Bowling Green State University\u2019s recording studio, with four more pieces ready to be recorded. All of these compositions are inspired by friends, family, deep love, crippling heartbreak, numbing recovery, experience, learning, cherished memories; all experienced in the modern world of discovery, chaos, and advancement.\nThe works included on this album were composed through the saxophone, channeling deep, heartfelt connections in audiences, with hopes of inspiring introspection and compassion. These visceral pieces have grown with me over many years, and they are ready to share. You can help share these pieces with the world. \nCollaboration\n\u201cIt's an age of connectivity, and collaboration is crucial.\u201d\n\nRushing Past Willow extends past the recording of an album. In fact, it is just the beginning of a much larger project. Cross-disciplinary collaboration is the next step, and its already happening. By combining these compositions with the endeavors of other talented artist. With your help, we\u2019ll create a product far greater than our individual pursuits. Imagine how much more this project can grow! \nHere's a list of the collaborations already in motion:\nA dance film by cinematographer Cody Laplant, featuring the movement of Mauriah Kraker.\nA 3D animation  by composer and animator Josh Simmons.\nIn collaboration with Jason Charney, we modified Erwin Redl's 25-foot-LED installation, \u201cBenchmark,\u201d creating a responsive sound installation that responds to the live performance of compositions featured on this album. Additional film of the project will be captured and produced by videographer and pianist Michiko Saiki. \nVisual artist Tim Zoulek will be creating the album artwork for the project. Digital documentation of the work will then be carried out by photographer and graphic designer Andrew Von Haden.\nSharing the Music\n\u201cfinding ways to share our innermost emotions and inspiring compassion\u2026\u201d\nNotation of these works is underway; attempting to capture the improvisatory spirit of the pieces and affect the meditative thought process that inspired them. The goal is to share these works, giving others a chance to perform the pieces and express themselves.\nTraditions\n\u201c\u2026presenting views and values of our culture; a catalyst of thought and emotion, employing saxophone sound to communicate in a universal language.\u201d \nThese pieces exhibit repetitive, spectral, and minimalistic qualities. They reflect on the views and values of our culture, including network connectivity and advances in science. At their core, however, they are meditations on some of my most sincere memories that spin with the gamut of my deepest, heartfelt emotions.\nThe vocabulary in these pieces stems from the idiomatic use of the saxophone, and uses sound that has resonated with me for over a decade. The compositions elaborate on traditions established by artists including Anthony Braxton, Evan Parker, John Zorn, Mats Gustaffson, Ned Rothenberg, composers such as Fran\u00e7ois Ross\u00e9, Christian Lauba, G\u00e9rard Grisey, and an array of saxophonists in the contemporary classical tradition.\nRecording\nThe goal is to complete a 12-track album. The experimental recording process has developed over months of research, during which I investigated the placement of the unique microphone array and a methodology for creating a unique sound image. Recording continues to take place at Bowling Green State University recording studios, with engineering by Jason Charney and myself. The editing process will involve the abstraction of the saxophone\u2019s sound, which will be a collaborative process between Jason Charney and I.\nTimeline\nIt is my goal to finish the recording and mixing by November, leaving time for detailed mixing and mastering.

We combine an omnivorous stylistic palate with virtuosic physicality, incorporating elements from classical, jazz, experimental rock, performance art and theater. Our inaugural show Body Parts dismembered, manipulated, and reanimated bodies in performance \u2013 creating a chattering chorus of woodblock teeth, wearing pop songs as a mask, and placing screaming eyes on floating TV screens. After our 2015 debut concerts in New York City, we were invited to China for three performances, including a featured solo show at the Beijing Modern Music Festival.\nOur new show, Dissections, works with a visual and thematic vocabulary that includes dismantling instruments as they\u2019re played and manipulating live video of the group while we perform. We intend to develop a set of six interconnected pieces that function as a single dramatic whole, building the conceptual framework of the show collectively from the ground up with director Dustin Wills and lighting designer Solomon Weisbard.\nInvisible Anatomy\u2019s members\u2014Samuel Adams (bass), Ian Gottlieb (cello), Paul Kerekes (keyboards), Brendon Randall-Myers (guitar), Daniel Schlosberg (keyboards), Ben Wallace (percussion), and Fay Wang (voice)\u2014are graduates of the Yale School of Music. Their music has been performed by the Bang on a Can All-Stars, Dover Quartet, guitarist David Tanenbaum, the Cabrillo Festival Orchestra, Musical Theater Southwest, and the Chicago, New World, St. Louis, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and San Francisco Symphonies, and their music has received praise from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and San Francisco Chronicle.

Now that the venue and date of the premiere are confirmed, our primary challenges include promotion and dissemination of the show. To take advantage of our outreach potential, we have set aside a percentage of the budget for a publicist, and we are currently pursuing a few options and will determine which is the best fit. We also have a videographer lined up for the National Sawdust concert, who will help us create exciting media to publicize our future performances. We had an incredible experience performing in China in May and we are finalizing other mini-tours this winter and spring, a more extended tour in China, as well as other festivals early next summer.\n\nA professional studio recording, set to commence in April, is a complex undertaking with the biggest risk being a potential delay in the projected completion date.

I\u2019m Anna Vogelzang. In April I made a new record with producer Todd Sickafoose, and it is the best thing I\u2019ve ever done, and I can\u2019t wait to share it with you. I need your help launching this album into the world; the only way I can finish it is with your support! Thank you for being here with me.\nI\u2019m a full-time-music-maker. I\u2019ve been writing songs for a long time. I believe in songs. I spend most of my time driving those songs around the country and playing them for good people. I also make albums of those songs! Like these:\nIn the final months of 2013, I went on a self-imposed writing and recording retreat, and left with a gaggle of new songs. Then in 2014, I wrote 52 songs! I totaled more than 70 songs in those 15 months. (Whoa!)\nFast forward to April of 2015: I traveled to the beautiful hills of Oregon to make a new album with bassist/producer/wizard Todd Sickafoose (Anais Mitchell, Ani DiFranco, Andrew Bird) and percussionist/drummer/multi-instrumentalist Shane Leonard (Field Report). Of those 70 songs, Todd hand-picked twelve that we recorded live as a trio in one week. Together, we created a lush, full landscape - a collection entitled Hiker. \nThere are veins running through this album, a cohesiveness that comes from the songs being captured in a live setting, and an intimacy of a trio's performance uncluttered by superfluous players. It is a collection about the animal nature of being a human, the existence of being a human in nature, the search for home. It's about traveling onward and self-sufficiency and love and family and fear and grit. It is without a doubt the best thing I have ever made.\nHiker will have the longest gestation period of any thing I've ever released - some of the songs are from 2013 - far before Driftless, even; working with Todd producing has been in the works since 2012; it will be over a year, maybe even 15 months from when we tracked it all the way to public consumption. It is the longest I have ever let something percolate. I used to spend my babysitting money immediately on Starbucks mochas and as many CD singles as I could afford. Waiting is a very hard process for me.\nIt's worth it, though. I know that this is the album I've been working towards for the last 10 years. Every mile, every song, every show led to here. This album sounds most like myself, most like the thing I\u2019ve been striving for. It is the project that makes me feel like I am stepping over a threshold. Making this album was the first time I\u2019ve had a producer fully take the reins - a move that allowed the record to flourish beautifully. The whole session felt like an exercise in letting go, in listening for the purest form of the song, in getting out of the song\u2019s way. It was an amazing and transformative process, and I promise it will be worth the wait.\nSamples from Hiker:\nBear\nGarden\nHiker\nI want to take every possible step I can to ensure this record is birthed into the world joyfully and fully, so I\u2019ve decided to return to Kickstarter. I want Hiker to be released to its full potential - heard by as many people as possible, with an excited community around it. That means preparing for the final phase of the project, which is just around the corner - mastering, artwork, manufacturing, publicity, and paying my team.\nThis is an All or Nothing campaign. If we don't reach the goal by the deadline, no credit cards will be charged, no rewards fulfilled.\nAs a first wave supporter of this album, you\u2019ll be on the ground floor to hear the songs before anyone else; you\u2019ll also have my deep-hearted gratitude for giving this record a shot. Beyond that, there are many goodies to choose from, including but not limited to:\nthe BESTIES package is the best bang for your buck: it includes a signed Hiker CD & signed 7\u201d Hiker Vinyl, a mix CD (or digital playlist for the futurists, whichever you prefer) of some of my dear friends and heroes, 4 buttons, a sticker, a THANK YOU polaroid, & a super surprise Hiker-inspired trinket!

(I promise it won't be dirt.)\nfor 12 kind folks, I\u2019ll write a postcard every month in 2016 from wherever I happen to be.

I will send you the original page of the song of your choice, signed just for you!\nA private concert, instrument lesson, songwriting workshop, or coffee date in the privacy of your own home! Not gonna lie, these Concert Window shows are a blast (Oscar made an appearance during the last one) and I would love to create an online experience just for you - and whoever you choose to invite over!\nI will happily Vogelzang-ize the song of your choice. Or better yet, we can work out an original song just for you - something from your personal or family history, a song you can use as a gift to woo someone special, or a song based on the topic of your choice, 100% unique. All songs will be at least one instrument & voice, delivered to you as a WAV, Mp3 or on a disc.

I promise to keep you posted.)\ndue to popular request: the one, the only, THE CHART! you will receive the sharpie-adorned chart I made to track our progress in the studio - plus! a cover song of your choice, the patron, and besties packages. I don't want to let it go, but I will, just for you.\nThe cream of the crop: I will come and play a concert for you and your friends as soon as I can within my touring schedule! I made it to both coasts & the south this year, and am planning to do the same again in 2016. House shows are amazing, and my favorite way to interact with an audience.

If I\u2019m already heading your way, even better.\nSo far, this project has been possible because of my own savings, which covered travel, paying the musicians, feeding the band, studio rentals, instrument rentals, production, and mixing - that totaled a little over 16K.\nNow, I\u2019m hoping that you\u2019ll believe in this project as much as I do - and will come on board to get it finished and out into the world. \nAs you can see, half of the budget covers the mechanics of finishing the album, and the other half will cover getting it launched into the world with a good shove behind it - hence the largest piece of the pie going towards a killer publicist. I can only bang on so many pots and pans by myself, and the team is just one of the things that will give this album legs.\nThere are other things I would love to include if we surpass the goal - this budget doesn\u2019t include bringing the band on tour (6K!), hiring a radio agent (6K!), making a music video (5K!), new website design (2K!), making badass merch (2K!), and further expanding my team (6K!). First, I just want to get it into the hands of the people. YOU people. With your help, this record has a fighting chance.\nI can\u2019t thank you enough for being here, for believing in songs, & for supporting these songs. I am so proud of this work and I am so lucky to call this calling my job. I am beyond grateful for you, my community of friends and family and cheerleaders.

All of the rewards are feasible given the time allowed, and I\u2019ve made sure that I don\u2019t burn myself out in trying to fulfill them. Scheduling the house shows and one-on-one sessions will probably be the most challenging rewards to fulfill, simply because of logistics. The album is on its way to being done, and I have scheduled enough time for it to be finished and printed before the promised ship date of late February. I vow to keep all backers posted about any logistical challenges that arise.\n\nAsking for such a number is daunting and I don\u2019t take it lightly. If the funds aren\u2019t raised, the album will linger and struggle to be released, probably around the end of 2016 or early 2017 - and most likely without a team behind it. This funding will launch Hiker out in the first half of next year with a team of pros and a community surrounding it.\n\nThe most exciting challenge is what next year is going to look like. I plan to tour, to try to get these songs in the hands of as many people as possible, and hope that they reach folks who can help me take steps towards a bigger and brighter future.

(for solo piano) and restless (for cello and piano). \nWith two pieces of approximately 20 minutes in length each, we decided to go a different way with this recording, and plan to release it on vinyl, with one piece on each side of the LP.  In addition, the music will be distributed digitally.  This is a project we have been rehearsing for and preparing for for years, and we are very excited to finally get to this stage where we are ready for everyone to hear it.\nAbout the composer:\nKen Thomson, a longtime staple of New York City\u2019s contemporary music and jazz communities, is widely regarded for his ability to blend a rich variety of influences and styles into his own musical language while maintaining a voice unmistakably his own. Embracing the combination of complexity in harmony, rhythm, and form while adding a punk-rock aesthetic, Thomson stands alone in his unique corner of today\u2019s multifaceted musical world.\nAbout the music:\nMe Vs. (2012) and restless (2013-4) are two of Thomson\u2019s most recent and substantial chamber works. Both pieces consist of multiple movements, last approximately 20 minutes, and are substantial additions to the solo piano and cello/piano duo traditions. While the form and instrumentation of Me Vs. and restless are a clear nod to traditional idioms, Thomson\u2019s signature blend of jazz, punk, and modern art music is still boiling at the surface. These works highlight the composer\u2019s masterful manipulation of tension and energy. In both Me Vs. and restless, the music churns, building in a wave of dissonance and density while never leaving traditional harmony behind. \nThomson\u2019s music is notoriously difficult, consistently demanding the height of virtuosity from each performer, and neither Me Vs. nor restless are exceptions. Akin to his writing for his jazz groups Slow/Fast and collaborative group Gutbucket, Thomson achieves heightened energy through aggressively dense and blisteringly fast passage work; he uses the entire range of both instruments, pushing the performers to explore new connections between far-flung notes. In a true Lisztian effort, the performers must precisely navigate lengthy passages while maintaining the steady increase of tension and density, pushing the large-scale form to dramatic climaxes.\nAbout the performers:\nAshley Bathgate and Karl Larson are the ideal performers to record these challenging compositions. Both musicians are widely regarded as expert interpreters of contemporary music. They actively commission and perform new works as soloists and chamber musicians, advocating for composers of contemporary music around the United States and the world. Both performers frequently collaborate with Thomson (both as a composer and performer) and are sensitive to his creative goals.\n---------\nAbout the project:\nOur expenses for the project total over $10,000 and include renting the recording studio, paying for the recording engineer and mixing engineer, mastering the project to vinyl, vinyl pressing ($3K+ alone), and publicity.  This Kickstarter won't pay for everything, and paying ourselves is not part of the picture -- but we will have enough if successful here to record and press records and get them to you; we will work to find further sources to make sure the world knows about this music.\nWe are so grateful for your support; this recording will not be possible without your help.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndependently recording and releasing a record has some inherent risks. Without the aid of a record label, the creative and promotional work falls directly on us, the artists. However, while this does present a challenge, it also gives us the freedom to produce a product that is of our highest standards of quality alone.\n\nWe have already have already partnered with Paul Coleman, a fantastic recording engineer who has previously worked with Ensemble Signal, Irvine Arditti and many others.

Thank you for visiting this Kickstarter page. I'm raising funds in support of the release of my debut album. This album will feature my original compositions, and will be released this July. But I need your help to pull it off.\nThese two clips, featuring Ben Rolston on upright bass and Stephen Boegehold on drums, are a sample of some of the music that will be featured on this recording.\nSympathet:\nParentheses:\n-------------------------------\nFor those of you that know me, you know that music is and has always been a huge part of my life. I started playing piano at the age of 5, and started writing music shortly after that. I've been immersed in it since then, and have never looked back. I honestly don't remember a time in my life where music wasn't at the central core of my identity.\nI've been blessed to have incredible mentors and collaborators over the years. In particular, some of the paragons of the Detroit jazz community really set a young me on the path to becoming a professional musician. As a high schooler, I was able to work with Detroit's prize gem, trumpeter Marcus Belgrave -- someone who I work with now as a professional. When I went off to college, I studied with Geri Allen, one of Marcus' students and one of Detroit's most prized exports. Currently, I'm humbled and honored to call myself a member of that community of Detroit musicians -- a community of hard working and talented musical artists who I continue to learn from on a daily basis.\nThis is the album I've been waiting my whole life to make. This music feels like my native tongue; my home base and natural habitat. All of the work, training, practice, experimentation, failure, and ultimately resilience that has gone into shaping who I am as a musician is manifest in this project. I've finally worked up the courage to share this process with the world, and I want you all to be a part of the experience of making it a reality.\nThe seeds of this project were planted almost two years ago -- in fact, the earliest composition in this collection dates back to May of 2013. As I've grown and developed over that period of time, so has this music. This particular moment in my life feels like a crossroads between my musical past as a student and my musical future as an artist. As such, this project feels special, brimming with life and potential.\n-------------------------------\nThankfully, we've already cleared some major hurdles, which will ensure that this project will become a reality. For starters, all the music is already recorded. Thanks to the incredible talents of Ben Rolston and Stephen Boegehold, this music has come to life in a richer, fuller, and more potent way than I could have ever imagined. Having them as collaborators on this project has been an exciting and fulfilling experience.\nEven though the music is already recorded, the process of bringing this project to completion is far from over. I'm raising money to cover post-production expenses. These expenses include mixing and mastering the music, hiring a professional artist (in this case, the incredibly talented Collin McRae Leix) to create album artwork for the physical CD, and printing and duplicating the actual CD's. \n$4000 seems like a lot of money to me, but with lots of people involved, I know we can all make this happen together. Whether you give $1 or $1000, I'm incredibly thankful for your support!\nBest,\nMichael", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThankfully, since we've already completed tracking (the process of actually recording the music), many of the risks and challenges of completing this project have already been avoided.\n\nAs we move forward, the biggest risk and challenge of this project will be schedule related; the mixing, mastering, and production of artwork will have to happen in a timely manner to ensure that the discs can be printed with enough lead time to have them ready for our July release date.\n\nI'm already in touch with mixing and mastering engineers, as well as the artist, and everyone is aware of the stated timetable.

While all of these descriptors are technically on point, none quite gets to the bones of who she is as an artist. Meredith seamlessly blends these media into arresting performance pieces that feel like rites from another dimension. Through her 50-year career, she has maintained her bright, singular perspective, crafting dozens of surprising, whimsical, profound theatrical works.\nPreview a few minutes from our episode on Meredith Monk:\nNico Muhly :: An expert technician, insatiable collaborator and thoroughly joyful musician, Nico Muhly writes for a vivid community of musicians around the world, crafting pieces of all sizes and shapes. Nico\u2019s love of language and syntax finds an analogue in his music, where he delights in cadences' inherent quirks and prods at them until they come out beautifully crooked.\nKaija Saariaho :: An exacting Finnish manipulator of electronic and acoustic sounds, Kaija Saariaho was in the first wave of composers at IRCAM in Paris, working on the bleeding edge of interactive and concrete electronics. Whether writing on the grand scale of an opera or intimate scale of a solo work, Kaija weaves detailed tapestries of sound, honing and re-defining the boundaries of acoustic environments with unexpected textures and color.\nIngram Marshall :: Creator of immersive, expressivist sound worlds, Ingram Marshall\u2019s musical curiosity took him all over the world, from California to Bali, Japan, Sweden and Iceland before he alit, as a pedagogue, back to his homeland in the Northeast US. Ingram superimposes seemingly remembered and misremembered strains with introspective, often electronic landscapes to create music that evokes, nudges and flexes.\nAnna Thorvaldsdottir :: Anna Thorvaldsdottir sculpts timbre into large-scale, powerful works. Anna didn\u2019t find composition until she was 19, but once she started writing, she discovered she could not live without it. Taking inspiration from the dangerous, dynamic landscape of her home country, Anna writes bold, toothsome scores with emotionally satisfying forms and sharp, unexpected timbres.\nAt Meredith Monk's home/studio recording a vocal workshop.\nIf we blow past our goal we can do even more.

Are you hipsters?\" No, we are not hipsters... but those old records had one important advantage: they're big! They give you something to hold, look at, and read while you listen.

Ashland, Chicago, IL 60622, to house our training center, performance space, clubhouse, and offices.  We have already found a location, made an offer that was accepted, passed attorney review, and we are now obtaining financing. This Kickstarter is raising funds to cover the closing costs and part of the redesign of the space.\nOne Group Mind is an improv comedy organization that offers training and performance opportunities to professional improvisers in Chicago and operates the Titanic Players, which provides free comedy education to collegiate improvisers at five major universities in the Midwest.  Together, the two organizations have existed for 20 years, won awards, and have had alumni continue successful careers on such shows as The Office, Saturday Night Live, Community, Arrested Development, the Jimmy Kimmel Show, and the Mindy Project, to name just a few.\nOne Group Mind is a membership-based organization attempting to bring improvisers together in order to leverage the size of our community in order to forward our careers.  We negotiate discounts and obtain benefits on behalf of our members in an effort to reduce the costs of studying improvisation.\nWe focus on team and time for good training.  It is our belief that any team constructed, if given consistency of cast and training, can become a great team.  Only with great teams can we elevate improvisation from a hobby to a professional art.  Our teams are left for up to 4 years with the same original cast at the time of audition.  \nWe can benefit greatly with your help:\nFinancial Security.  For 20 years, the Titanic Players and One Group Mind have survived with volunteer financial considerations and contributions of time from its members, friends, and family.  By purchasing and owning our own building, our expenses will be considerably less, allowing us to not only survive, but thrive. With our savings, we can support One Group Mind and The Titanic Players as well as offer additional services like a robust membership discount program, promotional support for our teams, sound and video editing equipment, resources to forward careers, the Titanic Winter Tour, and much, much more.  Once the building has been paid for, estimated at 7 years on our current trajectory, we will one of the first institutions to offer compensation to long form improvisers.\nPermanency.  We need a permanent home.  One Group Mind has had to move 7 times in its history, and one event had us closed for 7 years.  The permanency will not only be a boon for our members, who will no longer have to deal with location changes, but also for our marketing efforts, the hallmark of which is consistency of locale.  We will also be able to design the exterior and interior of the space to suit our specific needs.\nArtistic Home.  Alongside establishing a home for our own brand of comedy, One Group Mind is planning to expand our slate of performances, presenting shows 7 nights a week while adding sketch (both filmed and theatrical), stand-up, and music to our offerings.  We also plan to engage the neighborhood through participation in philanthropy, street festivals and other community outreach endeavors.\nCommunal Home. Our planned design of the space has a performance space and rehearsal rooms, but also a self-serve bar and lounge for our guests and a den/hangout space for our members.  It is our hope that this purchase and build out creates an atmosphere of community for those in the immediate neighborhood and for those improvisers and friends who are, or have been, a part of our organization.  \nCareer Services. Our long term redesign also includes plans to provide a green screen for filming, recording equipment for members podcasts or voiceover reels, a projection screen to show member films and sketches, and a resource center that includes a computer lab.\nAlumni Benefits. Since the space will be our own, we plan to use it to trace and record the organization's history from 1994 until today and highlight the members who helped shepherd the organization throughout the years.  The planned space also includes a residential area that could be used to house any visiting alumni traveling through The Windy City (or Titanic Player team!)\nOnce the property is secured, we will update the Kickstarter with details on location, site plans, pictures, et al.

I had no idea how long it would last, but I decided it was the thing I loved doing most, and so I would keep touring until I didn't love it anymore, or until I couldn't make it work. Here I am 6 years and 7 months later, and somehow I'm still going. The vehicle I had for the first 5 years or so was a key factor in me making it work for so long. The Jambulance, as it came to be called, was a re-purposed ambulance that ran on veggie oil. In this topsy-turvy world of weirdo music and pass-the-hat gigs, the ONLY way I was able to keep afloat was having a van that (a) didn't require gasoline, (b) was large enough to sleep in when necessary.\nSad to say I had to put that noble steed out to pasture about a year ago, and now I need a new vehicle to continue my Infini-Tour. Here's where you come in (if you're so inclined). My next vehicle will follow in the Jam's footsteps in some ways, and be different in some ways. Like its predecessor, it needs to be something reliable and large enough for me (and my upright bass and other musical equipment) to live out of. And most importantly, it needs to run on vegetable oil. I want to avoid burning petroleum for ecological as well as economical reasons, since a tour of this length would leave an awful carbon footprint if fueled by gasoline, and since this massive a tour would simply not be financially feasible given the wages I tend to make playing house shows, galleries, and whatnot.\nAdapted to my intinerant, musical lifestyle, this machine is to be a work of art in itself\u2014a tool in my continued striving to live exactly the life I want, with music and travel at its center. There are things I want to do in the new van that I don't feel I did enough of in my last one. First among these things is I want to educate more folks on vegetable oil as a fuel source. I pledge to do what I can to host workshops and classes on veggie oil collection, filtration, and operation. For that reason, I\u2019ve even made one of the rewards here on Kickstarter focus on doing just that. And more generally, I want to use my travels to make whatever contributions I can to the political struggles I think are important. For the last year or so, I've been involved in creative projects to bring more attention to the need for reproductive rights in the US, releasing a compilation of Kate Bush covers that has benefited clinics and reproductive justice groups around the country. I'm ready to take that project on the road by organizing benefit concerts for the same cause. One great social benefit of us nomadic types is that we can be involved in communities spanning continents, and can sometimes offer perspective on social issues. When Occupy first got off the ground, I spent time at encampments in Washington DC, Berlin, London, and many smaller towns, and was able to tell folks there what things were like at other places I\u2019d visited.\nIn the year since the Jam met its demise, I\u2019ve continued to tour without a van of my own, and let me tell you, it was rough at times. I toured on buses, trains, planes, ferries, and toured with other folks all I could. The touring with other people was generally pretty great. But as you can imagine, I sorely miss having my own means of transportation and the independence of movement that affords. The greyhounds and megabuses\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say I shan\u2019t be doing that again any time soon. But I did this ridiculous stuff because touring is what I love to do, and it\u2019s my life\u2019s adventure. I am undyingly grateful to all those who have helped me continue on this journey for so long, and I\u2019m already indebted to all of the folks who will chose to help in this crowd-funding project. I only hope that it represents some kind of investment for all of you out there\u2014that by helping get me back behind the wheel, you\u2019ll be glad to see me in your town playing music sooner than later.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBuying a used vehicle always carries some risk. I am asking for $5000 to complete this project, knowing full well that the conversion to run on veggie oil will cost at least $2000, and that $3000 might not buy me a van in great condition. I have been scouring Craigslist and asking friends to keep an eye out, but the nature of buying a used vehicle is that I'll have to see what is available when I am ready to buy, and get the best thing I can at that time. Years on the road will help me to be prudent in my choice, regardless of the amount of money I raise here. Obviously, the more I can raise, the more confident I'll be in the vehicle I choose for this project. I trust that with supporters who have already reached out to me from all over the world, I should be able to accomplish this goal, and choose the best vehicle for my needs. \n\nAnother challenge concerns the conversion to veggie oil. It is not a widely used or understood fuel source. I even once had a professional mechanic in Michigan tell me that running a vehicle on vegetable oil was, in fact, \"a myth.\" I could only walk away, telling him I'd been living that myth for a few years now. Fortunately, I have already selected a mechanic that worked on my previous vehicle to do this conversion, and he has always been happy to advise me on any maintenance I should need. I know from the 6 years since he did my first conversion that he is reliable, trust-worthy, and very competent. He will work with me, as he has done already, to make sure I understand the modifications he makes on the vehicle so that I can maintain and use it properly.\n \nIf I hadn't already been on tour since 2008, I would say that a major challenge of this project would be the lifestyle itself--having only 4 wheels for a home, and usually changing locations every day or two. But having done it for so long, it has become my way of life, and this no longer troubles me in the least.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Success!", "update_content": "Hey friends. \nI'm pretty overjoyed at the moment.

An hour ago marked exactly one week until the end of my fund-raising campaign to buy a new van. As many of you know, I set the goal fairly low because Kickstarter is all-or-nothing, and I didn't want to risk the possibility of losing it all if I didn't raise enough. As I continue to scour the webernets for decent used vans, I'm not finding much below the $5000 range. To get a van for that much, and still be able to convert it run on veggie oil, and pay the fees that Kickstarter and Amazon take, I really need to raise something closer to $7500."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Massive amounts of grattitude and a little stress, 1 week into the campaign.", "update_content": "Hey there friends.  I wanted to give a little update on the crowd-funding campaign, since a number of folks have been asking how it's going. For the most part, it's already been amazing. The fact that anyone at all is helping me realize the continuation of my dream is in itself, incredibly humbling and it embiggens my soul in ways I can't relate. That said, I'm still a little stressed about it. As is probably typical with these sort of things, there was a big surge on the first couple days, but now that it's a week into the campaign, things have tapered off a bit. A number of folks have assured me that they plan to pledge later, and I appreciate that greatly. But probably until the thing is successful, I'm going to stress a wee bit. The thing that's maybe the most stressful is that I low-balled the amount needed, because I didn't think I could confidently raise more than $5000. But I've been searching the craigslist ads for weeks, and there are very few vans in that range. And since I know that having the van converted to run on veggie oil will cost around $2000, that means that if I make $5000, Kickstarter and Amazon take their cut (which will be a little over $400), and then with the $4600 left, I'll only have $2600 to buy a van. The vans that $2600 will buy (from what I'm finding so far) are old buggers with serious issues. So I'm really crossing my fingers that not only will the campaign be successful, but that I'll somehow manage to raise a couple extra thousand dollars to be able to actually buy a van that is roadworthy for $5000 or more and still have money for the conversion. Is that too much to hope for? I honestly don't know, and I fluctuate between extreme optimism and extreme pessimism. But just like my grandma used to say, \"Fuck it, let's go bowling.\" Love you guys. Thanks for all the awesome support. Fingers double-crossed. Thumbs held.

The Ulysses Project is my debut album - it's a suite of ten songs that are the product of my obsession with the novel Ulysses by James Joyce. And the best part is that I somehow roped in a ridiculously awesome group of people to play with me and indulge my tangents on (for example) evil racist dogs, how-Stephen-is-depressed-but-really-just-like-you-and-me, masochistic gender swaps, etc.\nThese amazing personages are none other than: Derek Worthington, trumpet; Patrick Booth, tenor and soprano saxophones; Ben Willis, bass; Jon Taylor, drums; and Kirsten Carey, guitar (that's me!). Featuring: Corey Smith, wordsmith/keyboards and Heidi Madagame, male tenor impersonator extraordinare\n(We are releasing one video a week for the duration of the campaign - stay tuned!)\nWith this collection of songs, I hope to reach a much larger audience than those who normally listen to free jazz, or those who have geeked out over Ulysses, or the even smaller circle of the common ground between those groups. I hope to create an album where the reference work creates a palette of tones, ideas, and (hopefully) emotions that are accessible to everyone. I'm still humbled by remembering the people (who hadn't read Ulysses) that came up to me after the first performance of the suite and said the last song made them cry...\nAnd though I am marketing the album as \"free jazz\", I rather despise labeling like that, since a lot of stylings of rock, funk, soul, etc. have crept into the music. \"Boyaboy\" in particular does with music genres what Joyce does with the English language in \"Oxen of the Sun\": it travels through as comprehensive and long a list of musical styles as one sextet can muster, including monk chants, turn-of-the-century Irish bar songs, metal, bebop, funk, disco, blues... and on and on and on.\nThe live version of the suite contains text in between songs, to provide context for the proceeding song, as well as to add a dramatic element that makes the live experience different than the album. Here is the track listing, as well as the chapters of the excerpts that accompany them:\n(Sirens) Seaside Girls/Who Goes With Fergus\n(Proteus) Dedalus\n(Lotus Eaters) Imagined Promenade for Mr. Flower\n(Wandering Rocks) Shamefaced Peaches\n(Circe) Musksweat\n(Oxen of the Sun) Boyaboy\n(Nausicaa) Gerty\u2019s Lament\n(Cyclops) Beware of Garryowen\n(Ithaca) Laughinglike (Unconquered Hero)\n(Penelope) O\nAlso check out for more geek-specific explanations and tangents:\nwww.kirstencareymusic.com/ulysses\nwww.theulyssesproject.tumblr.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn order to make this ultimate geek-dream a reality, there is unfortunately the Money Factor.

This meant, however, sacrificing any time to promote or do fancy packaging.\nSince then, we've had a whole year to listen back, and realized one other thing: we think maybe the record is a little too short. \nThis year, we want to re-release the album REMIXED and REMASTERED with MORE SONGS, NEW AND EXTENDED VERSIONS OF SONGS, DELUXE PACKAGING (with MORE ARTWORK), and an MUSIC VIDEO by animation director TRISHA GUM (Robot Chicken).\nWe've been working around the clock on the new recordings and putting finishing touches on the album and are really proud of what it has finally become. \nNow we need to raise funds in order to do a proper release of this product. \nIf you want to contribute to this project, please be aware that we do not just want donations.

Along with a detailed timeline and plan of action for completing the video, we have the utmost confidence that we will succeed in producing the film in a timely manner.\n\nAs far as producing and distributing the album and prizes to contributors, we don't feel there is much of a risk involved with that. We have already completed the album and are having the copies pressed now.

This music would require special players to execute, and the right situation to bring them together...\nMy Opportunity\nI have been selected by the Madison Music Collective (MMC) to appear on their Fall Jazz Series at the Brink Lounge in Madison, WI on Sunday November 4th. This entails a workshop on improvisation, and a public concert which will be broadcast live on the web and through Madison's WORT FM. The funding for this concert is enabling me to bring together what I have long considered a \"dream band,\" and is a perfect opportunity to compose a set of entirely new music for them. Opportunities like this rarely present themselves to me, so I feel like I would be a FOOL to miss recording this special band in a professional studio.\nTime in a pro recording studio is expensive!, and producing a finished product requires working in stages (recording, mixing, mastering). Your contribution will help me to record and mix this record, and you will be taking part in a major milestone in my life as a creative musician. This would be my debut jazz recording involving my compositions, and I am hoping it will raise my profile in the larger jazz and improvised music scene and lead to better opportunities for in the future.\nThe Budget\nKickstarter goal: $2200                                                                              -Tracking time: $800                                                                                     -Mixing time: $1000                                                                                     -Kickstarter and Amazon fees (10% total): $200                                         -Materials fees for rewards: (Cassettes: $80; Score books: $120)\nThe Players\nMIKE PRIDE (drums/percussion) Based in New York for the past decade, Mike Pride currently leads the quartet, From Bacteria To Boys, who record for AUM Fidelity Records.

Brandon studied music at Indiana University and then moved to New York to listen and practice for 6 years while trying to forget everything he learned at college. Brandon was once in a German rock band and lived in Berlin Germany for seven months trying to pay off his student loans playing rock shows. That didn't work but Brandon had a great time in Berlin. Brandon then moved to Shanghai China to play jazz in clubs and hotels where he got to sample many fine cigars through second hand smoke. Brandon has lived and worked in Minneapolis since 2006 and hopes to continue playing music forever.\nADAM LINZ (bass) is a well-known bass player in the Twin Cities jazz scene.

Once everyone goes home, that's it, and the mixing process begins. This limited time-frame does not worry me because the level of the talent I am working with is unparalleled; these three players are incredible readers, improvisors, and listeners. I am also taking our limited time frame into account with the writing - making sure I'm not composing anything that would require more than a few hours of group rehearsal, and getting charts and scratch demos to the players well ahead of time. We are also playing a performance at Elastic Arts in Chicago before we enter the studio, which will be an ideal \"trial by fire\" opportunity to test and temper the music.
