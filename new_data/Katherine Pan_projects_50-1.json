I've been traveling and photographing some of the best restaurants around this amazing country for the past 10+ years.

I have a publisher in place and my goal is to get as many copies of the book out as I can, to inspire people to always support the American Restaurant. \nThe book will be approximately 180 pages and 12.2 x 10.2 inches in landscape format, hardcover and ready to ship next summer. It's going to be a gorgeous collection of color and black & white photographs that you'll be proud to have in your home.\nCheck out https://americanrestaurantbook.com/ for more information and images, also my instagram page http://instagram.com/danielkrieger for more of my photography. \nAll the reward options that include a print, would be a print of your choice.\nThank you!\nBrennan & Carr - Brooklyn, NY\nLe Bernardin - New York City\nKrekel's Custard - Springfield, IL\nThe Varsity - Atlanta, GA\nStroud's Oak Ridge Manor - Kansas City, MO\nLanger's Deli - Los Angeles, CA\nPeter Luger Steakhouse - Brooklyn, NY\nTeo's Hot Dogs - Pittsfield, MA\nTasty Dip - Heflin, AL\nMatt's Bar & Grill - Minneapolis, MN\nDefonte's - Brooklyn, NY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith my publisher in place and the book layout almost complete, my main challenge will be getting this project to go a bit viral so we can get the Kickstarter funded.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Daniel Krieger\nFirst created \u00b7 6 backed\nDaniel Krieger is a professional photographer who has been freelancing for the New York Times for the past 10 years.

Ashley Connor (who is one of the best cinematographers in the biz) shot Ada on s16mm film!  The footage looks beautiful and the cut is something I'm really proud of!  I can't stop using exclamation points because I'm that excited.  I just picture locked, which means I finished the edit.  But there's still a lot left to do.  And we need some good old-fashioned money to get it done!  The money raised on this project will go directly to help finish this film.  \nBecause Ada is basically a silent film, I'm working with Brian Mcomber who will compose a score for the film.  And we'll work with a sound engineer to interweave the music and the audio from what we shot to bring this film to completion.  \nWe are also working with Goldcrest in NYC to color grade the final edit.  This means they are matching all the clips of the film to make sure the color from shot to shot is equal in saturation so the film feels cohesive and looks STELLAR.  \nOnce we have the color correction done and the music is composed and placed, we can start submitting Ada to film festivals both nationally and internationally.  \nMuch love, \nEleanore\nPREVIOUS WORK\n   GRACIAS\n   SCREEN\n   1+1 = COCOON\nAWARDS\nAs an actor, Eleanore has garnered many awards in the independent film world.\n2013 - Indie Memphis - Special Jury Award for Outstanding Performance, See You Next Tuesday  \n2015 - Sidewalk Film Festival - Clint Howard Character Actor Award, 7 CHINESE BROTHERS\n2017 - SXSW - Special Jury Prize for Best Ensemble Acting, A Bad Idea Gone Wrong\nREVIEWS and INTERVIEWS\n10 UNDERRATED FEMALE PERFORMANCES OF 2014 - ROGEREBERT.COM\nON CREATING WITH SUNITA MANI AND TALLIE MEDEL AS COCOON CENTRAL DANCE TEAM - HUFFINGTON POST\nALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE - FRANK 151\nBIOS\nASHLEY CONNOR (cinematographer) is a New York based director of photography. Her work on Josephine Decker's BUTTER ON THE LATCH and THOU WAST MILD AND LOVELY, which both premiered at the 2014 Berlin Film Festival, prompted New Yorker film critic Richard Brody to name her alongside Darius Khonji and Fabrice Aragno, as one of the year's best cinematographers. Her breadth of style can be seen in work as diverse as Dustin Guy Defa's PERSON TO PERSON (Sundance '17) and Adam Leon's TRAMPS (TIFF '16), as well as in popular music videos for artists including Jenny Lewis, Angel Olsen and Mykki Blanco. Most recently Connor lensed Desiree Akhavan's second feature THE MISEDUCATION OF CAMERON POST starring Chloe Moretz.\nBRIAN McOMBER (composer) is a drummer and composer based on the east coast of the United States. His formal education and laboratory research work in the biological sciences deeply influenced his approach towards music composition, which emphasizes experimentation, improvisation and collaboration. In the past, he has worked with an array of artists and acts including Alarm Will Sound, Bjork, David Byrne, Dirty Projectors (whom he toured with extensively from 2006-2012), Doudou N'Diaye Rose, Juana Molina, Mira Calix, The Roots, and St. Vincent. Since shifting his main focus to film scoring in 2013 McOmber has gone on to write music for narrative and documentary films that have premiered at festivals such as Cannes, Sundance, Berlin, Rotterdam, Venice, Tribeca, New Directors/New Films and SXSW.\nRACHEL WOLTHER (producer/guardian angel) is a director and producer.  She became the go-to producer in the New York independent film scene back in 2012, producing films such as Josephine Decker's Thou Wast Mild and Lovely, Nathan Silver's Stinking Heaven, Drew Tobia's See You Next Tuesday, and most recently, Sarah Salovaara's TV series Let Me Die a Nun which is nominated for a Gotham Award this year.  She has seamlessly moved into directing, collaborating as a team of two with Alex H. Fischer.  They have been touring the film festival circuit with their film Snowy Bing Bongs.  The duo was named 25 New Faces Of Independent Cinema by Filmmaker magazine.  Wolther and Fischer are currently writing a feature film. \nELEANORE PIENTA (director/writer/editor) is an actor, video-artist, dancer and director.

Melt, freeze or bake your favorite food or candy to create some yummy, spinny fun!\n    After you make a Lickety Spin with your favorite hard candy, use your imagination and give other food and candy a try. Here are some of our favorites: Jolly Ranchers, Life Savers, Werther's Original, Hershey Kisses, Starbursts, and string cheese...yes cheese. We've also baked a chocolate chip cookie and froze Fruit Punch Gatorade in the mold. The possibilities are endless!\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for weekly episodes of \"Will it Spin?\" as we explore other fun ideas throughout the campaign. \n    Lickety Spin is the brainchild of Lexi and her Uncle Timmy. It was just a regular day at Lexi\u2019s house hanging out with her Uncle Timmy when she showed him how she made her own candy fidget spinner by making a spinner-shaped impression in molding compound, filling it with candy and following it up with a quick trip to the microwave.\nLexi held up her super sweet spinner and Uncle Timmy was, understandably, impressed. And kinda hungry.\nTogether, they started talking about how to bring this kind of yummy fun to kids (and grownups with a sweet tooth) everywhere. Now Lickety Spin is here!\n    Lexi is a 4th grader living in Denver, CO. She loves her stuffed animals, playing piano and skiing with her parents. Lexi is a dinosaur enthusiast and hopes to work with animals someday. When not making candy fidget spinners, she\u2019s usually chasing her three dogs around the house or playing Minecraft.\nHer uncle Tim Swindle is a creator of the smash hit, Utter Nonsense, a board game that launched right here on Kickstarter and now has two editions sold at every Target in America. Tim lives in Chicago with his fianc\u00e9e Puja. He believes in good ideas and the power of having fun to bring people together.\n    Once we reach our funding goals and Kickstarter ends, Lickety Spin will be available in 3 different exciting colors \u2013 red, green and blue!\nIn order to make the candy spin, we had our engineers create our own, custom finger pads with an integrated axle to ensure optimum spinning!\n             ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBringing a product from the drawing board to reality is not an easy task.

Problems like a cursed dating app or industrial espionage conducted by ghosts. As often is the case with consultants, he does unpleasant work for unpleasant people.\nHardboiled Magic is a genre bender, blending contemporary fantasy, horror and hardboiled detective fiction. Think The Night Stalker by way of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and Art Buchwald.  \nThe first sequence of these stories was Kickstarted 6 months ago under the title \u201cLegal Termination of a Warlock\u2026 and Other Tales.\u201d (You can get a print compilation of the first 8 stories in the series as a reward.) It\u2019s time for a new round and it\u2019s slightly different this time.  \nIn order to open up Hardboiled Magic to a wider audience, I\u2019d like to start making the stories available at MagicDetective.com two months AFTER crowdfunding backers get the stories. Go over there and read a few stories.  \nThe idea here is to produce a monthly short form contemporary fantasy/horror series. Long short stories or short novelettes, depending on your definition and the individual piece. It\u2019s like getting your issue of Batman or Amazing Spider-Man each month, except it's prose and a complete story (as opposed to being a chapter in a larger serial).  \nThe theme for the next cycle of stories is \u201cMemes From Hell.\u201d Each story will be inspired by or satire of a well-known Internet meme. Here\u2019s the story lineup. (Subject to change if a better idea pops up)  \n Red Hair Instead of a Soul\nIt seemed like the only people in Miller\u2019s Glen not dying were the redheads. Why was hair color part of a killing profile and who had blood on their hands? Mister Lewis must crack a riddle of demographic proportions if he wants to get out of town alive.  \nThe Ghost of Joseph Ducreux\nThis time, the painting captured the subject\u2019s spirit \u2013 literally. Now that he\u2019s finally free of captivity, the Ghost of Joseph Ducreux is offering unsolicited advice to all comers. Can Mister Lewis help Ducreux move on to eternal rest\u2026 or at least get him to shut up?  \n 2 Succubi 1 Cup \nThe CEO of a pharmaceutical company is having vivid dreams of strange women competing for his affections, requiring building of a very special cup. Mister Lewis must stop the dreams from becoming a living nightmare as a demonic feud threatens to create an unholy Grail  \nShit Necromancers Say \nThe Slang Slinger website has a problem. Their user generated scheme to get free content worked too well and they unwittingly published the trade jargon of a particular dark sect of magicians. Can Mister Lewis soothe ruffled feather if the feathers have been reanimated and thirst for living flesh?  \nDelete Your Karma\nWhat if you could clear out your Karma like deleting a social media account? An executive tried and it didn\u2019t go well. Mister Lewis has been contracted to balance the wheel before too many things are crushed underneath as karma, like nature, abhors a vacuum.  \nTransmigrate And Chill\nWhen a curse is placed on a dating app, love connections are still being made, but matches trigger a body swap. Mister Lewis must fix the bug in the system before the divorce courts need to sort out who was inhabiting the groom at the time of the marriage and legal liability is assigned.  \n  Stuff Dead People Like\nThe museum\u2019s new exhibit was getting a lot of new visitors. Unfortunately, they were paying visitors. The new exhibit was attracting ghosts. Mister Lewis must figure out what dead people like or the museum will be stuck with a secondary instillation of a mass haunting.  \n  Leave Cthulhu Alone\nA video has gone viral of deranged man begging the world to leave Cthulhu alone. Could the social media spotlight wake a sleeping god? Mister Lewis must stop Internet trolls from bringing about the apocalypse. \nHow would I be receiving these stories?\nWith a download code for a .PDF or .ePub file. You\u2019ll get them 2 months ahead of them going on the website and a month ahead of major eBook sites like Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Kobo. \nWhat's the timing on this?\nThe stories should start shortly after Kickstarter gives me the all-clear in late November.  I'd like to have the book shipped in December, but sometimes the holiday printing queue gets backed up, so it's possible that will be January.\nWhat are the Rewards?\n$16 \u2013 I Prefer Print A copy of Hardboiled Magic: The Children of Loki, the trade paperback book collecting the first 8 Hardboiled Magic Stories, including the initial 2 stories that weren't part of the first Kickstarter package. No digital here, just good old fashioned paper. \n$24 \u2013 Pure Digital: 8 Months of Stories\nEach month, you get a download code for a new story. \n$40 \u2013 The Combo: Print _and_ Digital\n8 months of new stories in digital and a print copy of Hardboiled Magic: The Children of Loki \n$50 \u2013 The Combo, Signed\n8 months of new stories in digital and a signed print copy of Hardboiled Magic: The Children of Loki\n$75 \u2013 Dignitary Signatory\nYou're a person of distinction and a patron of the arts.

Plus 8 months of new stories in digital and a signed print copy of Hardboiled Magic: The Children of Loki \n$2000 - Make It So\nNo mess, no fuss, I'll get back to writing and you'll get 8 months of new stories in digital and a signed print copy of Hardboiled Magic: The Children of Loki, and each month your name will appear on each story\u2019s dedication/patron page\nHave I done this writing thing before?\nI haven\u2019t missed a deadline on the first Kickstarter. I'm also a member of Mystery Writers of America, best known on the fiction side of things for writing a webcomic for the Chicago Tribune Media Group. Over on the journalism side, I was a contributing editor to one TIME's Top 25 Blogs of 2012 and written for Chicago Tribune, New York Resident, Publishers Weekly, Startup Grind, The Next Web, The Beat and Comic Book Resources. I get around a little. \nHow did you arrive at that number for the goal?\nI need to redirect time from other projects to adhere to a monthly schedule. It's not that big a deal to reallocate my time, but those student loan people want their money! So I'm essentially calculating that minimum as a percentage of my grad school loans. (Education being the gift that keeps on giving... you a bill each month.) ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYou've seen the topics. You've seen the covers.

There you are, in a family gathering, and suddenly someone reveals a story about a cousin that you've never heard of before, and suddenly the table gets real quiet?\nSit, Eat and Chew \u4e94\u5473\u6742\u9648 is a dance performance about those kinds of amazing, conversation-stopping stories that were never intended to be public.\nMy Story\nI lived in Chinatown for ten years before I was priced out of the neighborhood. For me, Chinatown was, is, and will always be a mystical place. Years ago, when renovating my apartment, I found an urn of ashes, possible bullet holes, and hand painted wallpaper hidden behind layers of sheetrock. Across from my apartment, an ancient older man kept watch on a hallway lined with envelopes, and he would never tell me how all of this mail came to be there.\nThese kinds of unspoken narratives led me to create this project. Even though I am Chinese, and speak both Cantonese and Mandarin, Chinatown residents don\u2019t share private stories easily. To begin the work, I ran story-sharing workshops at several Chinatown Senior and Youth Centers, and also found other funny, outrageous, adventurous, and traumatic stories from talking to local residents, going through Chinatown archives, and eavesdropping on conversations in tea houses and local bakeries.\nThere is a Chinese proverb - W\u01d4 W\u00e8i Z\u00e1 Ch\u00e9n \u4e94\u5473\u6742\u9648 - that uses the five tastes of cooking (sour, sweet, bitter, spicy and salty) to describe the complex emotions in life\u2019s ups and downs. In Sit, Eat and Chew, this proverb connects to personal stories that have become the creative and emotional inspiration for dance theater performances in unusual local spots.  Small groups are guided in their explorations of the works as they\u2019re performed in five public and private locations throughout Chinatown.\n What are the next steps What have you done already for this project, and what still needs to be done? Where are you in the process? When/where will it premiere? \nThe story telling workshops are completed, and I\u2019ve started rehearsing with company dancers. I will also be incorporating local amateur dancers into the final project as we work towards its 2017 premiere: Oct 14 & 15, 21 & 22 (two weekends) at various locations in Chinatown including: a local hair salon, private apartment, public park, restaurant, and the Museum of Chinese in America.\nWhy is this important? What is the point of entry to this project for a global audience? What\u2019s the most important or exciting thing for them to connect with? \nStories featuring local experiences of Chinatown residents and performances incorporating professional and locals offer insights into a mix of public and private sites. By bringing together Chinese residents and engaging with non-Chinese spectators, this project aims to dissolve stereotypes, create bridges, and celebrate Chinese culture and histories. A creative archive of stories, social practice, and performance, I was moved to create Sit, Eat and Chew to re-connect with and support the community that so beautifully embraced me when I first arrived in NYC.\nPlus enjoy an \u201cinsider's\u201d perspective into Chinatown from a guided introduction to performances in unique, local sites.\nWe need your help! \nThere are 32 local seniors from Chinatown who will be participating in the performances as local community dancers in the project.\nThese seniors shared many stories of their life experiences with me, and they are very, very serious about their dance practice. Most of them never had opportunities to perform when they were younger, due to work or other difficulties, and they bring powerful gusto to their dancing. It\u2019s their way of celebrating life.\nI do not have the budget to pay them. Your contribution offers them a stipend for their time and energy.\nYour contribution will also help support lower cost tickets to local Chinatown residents, seniors, and students so they are fully incorporated into the project that is happening in their neighborhoods.\nSeveral local businesses and residents opened their doors to allow us to use their space for these unconventional experiences. Your contribution will help us pay them something in acknowledgement of their welcoming of this project and audiences into their spaces.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSit, Eat and Chew \u4e94\u5473\u6742\u9648 is an unconventional performance that is not possible to replicate in a theater, and for this reason, I am self-producing the work to be able to realize its unique potential to transform the Chinatown we think we know. The site and stories are equally important in bringing the project to life, and I have already overcome the challenges of connecting the work to private and public sites in Chinatown plus the involvement of the local community. This took an amazing amount of legwork and time spent getting to know people and explaining the work. Trust developed over time, and residents began to share their stories with me. Now the locals I've met are opening up their own spaces as sites for these \"pop-up\" performances with local stories. \n\nThis is a special opportunity to connect with the \"real\" Chinatown though the eyes of the people who live there. \n\nWhile a conventional performance space has large capacities for audiences. Sit, Eat and Chew \u4e94\u5473\u6742\u9648 aims to provide a more intimate experience for smaller groups of audience. To accommodate audiences, we will perform 12-16 times during the course of two weekends (3-4 performances each day) to be able to share the performances with the same amount of audience as in a regular theater setting. Having these additional performances also makes the production more costly. At the same time, we want to keep the price reasonable for general audiences, and also very affordable to local residents. Having locals there is also an important aspect to the work.\n\nEven with all this research and advance planning accomplished, there are always extra costs that can pop up (transportation, emergency purchases, etc). We know we have a good network of people interested in helping to support this unique project in Chinatown. We hope you will join us and help back this project to make it as successful as possible.\n\nThank you! \u8c22\u8c22\uff01\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Personal Tale or Recipe", "descp": "Receive a personal story or food recipe from the community participants.

Designed from the ground up, ELF is a new way to build affordable large-scale telescopes for exoplanetary research. Highly specialized to see exoplanets up to 120 trillion miles (24 light years) away from Earth, ELF is designed for detecting the energy signature of life or life\u2019s likely chemical fingerprints in the atmosphere from water (H\u2082O), oxygen (O), methane (CH\u2084), and ozone (O\u2083), or on the surface from photosynthetic biopigments. \nThe first target will be Proxima b. In only a few months after ELF is completed, we will know if there is life on this nearest exoplanet! We will also learn whether there are Earth-like planets around Alpha Centauri A and B and all other nearby stars within a few dozen light years from the Sun. We will learn if we have neighbors, small or big.\nAchieving this requires an innovative design that allows us to both reduce the cost and increase the targeted sensitivity by a factor of 10x, making ELF the most realistic plan to find and characterize life on nearby exoplanets. For an in-depth overview of the ExoLife Finder, scroll down to the section below titled, \"ExoLife Finder Telescope\".\nWhat will the $35k bw used for?\nThe $35,000 will be used to build a fully working prototype of our advanced metamaterial mirror that combines slumped telescope glass and 3D printed electroactive polymers. This is a crucial step in helping us build large mirrors that have an overall thickness of 2cm. For more information scroll down to the section titled \"NEW METAMATERIAL\".\nELF Proposed Location: Atacama Desert, Chile\nThe PLANETS Telescope\nCurrently being built atop Haleakala on Maui, the PLANETS Telescope is an essential step in the development of the ambitious ExoLife Finder Telescope. Earlier this year we launched a Kickstarter for the PLANETS Telescope and were met with incredible support from backers from all over the world who helped fund the polishing of the PLANETS Telescope secondary mirror. Now that the PLANETS Telescope is underway, it's time to start on the next evolution of our thin mirror technology with ELF.\nDr. Svetlana Berdyugina at the Maui HNu staging, testing, and polishing facility for precision optics.\n    Exclusively on Kickstarter September 5th, 2017 - October 8th, 2017\nCosmic Lights\nCreated by the PLANETS Foundation, Cosmic Lights are beautiful limited-edition LED science gifts featuring images of our ELF telescope, and some of the extreme examples of life found on Earth - lifeforms that might even exist under extreme exoplanetary conditions. They make the perfect addition to a nightstand, desk, office cubicle, or bookshelf. Each Cosmic Light comes with a remote control and can cycle between a variety of colors and modes.\nAll pledges come with a guaranteed delivery by December 25, 2017.\n  Voyager Message\nThe Voyager Golden Records are phonograph records that were included aboard both Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977. The records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form, or for future humans, who may find them. Those records are considered as a sort of a time capsule.\n  Pioneer Plaque\nThe Pioneer plaques are a pair of gold-anodized aluminium plaques which were placed on board the 1972 Pioneer 10 and 1973 Pioneer 11 spacecraft, featuring a pictorial message, in case either Pioneer 10 or 11 is intercepted by extraterrestrial life. The plaques show the nude figures of a human male and female along with several symbols that are designed to provide information about the origin of the spacecraft.\n  Tardigrade\nTardigrades are adorable water-dwelling, eight-legged, segmented micro-animals also known as water bears, space bears, and moss piglets.  First discovered by the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1773 they have been found everywhere: from mountain tops to the deep sea and mud volcanoes; from tropical rain forests to the Antarctic. They can literally survive the conditions of space.\n    Polychaete \nA Polychaete, also known as a bristle worm is a handsome water creature and class of annelid worms. Each body segment of a polychaete has a pair of fleshy protrusions called parapodia that bear many bristles, which is why they are sometimes referred to as bristle worms. Astonishingly, there are more than 10,000 species of bristle worms on Earth. They can also survive \u201cotherworldly\u201d environmental conditions.\n  Prototype Design\nVoyager Cosmic Clock\nDesigned specifically to commemorate the 40th Anniversary of the Voyager space mission, Voyager Cosmic Clock is a one-of-a-kind 24-hour clock which displays the Voyager 1 Space Probe and the distances of potentially habitable exoplanets within 24 light years of Earth.\n  ExoLife Finder \nThe ExoLife Finder Telescope is the world's first dedicated telescope capable of imaging, oceans, continents, and life on nearby exoplanets. Show your support by getting a limited edition scale model of the ExoLife Finder Telescope.\n  Both shirts were created specifically for this Kickstarter.\nT-Shirts      \nThese high-quality t-shirts are printed with dye sublimation, a  full color, full-coverage printing technique that creates a beautiful result. With dye sublimation, dye particles convert into gas \u2014 known as sublimation \u2014 where they bond to the polyester fibers.

With a total diameter of about 25meters (82 feet), ELF is large enough to begin a dedicated program of imaging dozens of exoplanets within 25 light years of Earth and will enable a new field of exoplanetary and exolife research.\n  Tensegrity Design\nThe overall design of ELF is very unique compared to other large-scale telescopes. To reduce the mass and weight of the telescope, we use a structural principle called tensegrity. This is the same reason bicycle wheels can support a huge amount of weight but are incredibly light and strong. Tensegrity utilizes tension and compression and is often used in bridge designs.\n  Independent Off-Axis Mirrors\nEach ELF mirror will have its own dedicated secondary mirror and will be \u201coff-axis\u201d. Off-Axis telescopes are often used in radio dish receivers but now, with modern fabrication technology, we can use them for optics. They are much better for our needs because they reduce the amount of scattered light that might interfere with the photons we get from the exoplanets. Exoplanets can be 1 million or even 1 billion times fainter than their host Star so it\u2019s important that we have a sensitive system.\n  Slumped Telescope Glass\nTypical telescope mirrors are many centimeters thick and take a long time to polish. We have been developing a new way to make very large telescope mirrors by taking thin, inexpensive, fire-polished window glass and slumping it in a specialized kiln that allows us to make very accurately shaped paraboloids. Surprisingly, the fire-polishing process to create typical window glass makes it incredibly smooth. When we combine this with electronic \"muscle\" Electroactive Polymers, we can create mirrors that are never abrasively polished that are orders of magnitude smoother and lighter-weight than traditional large scale telescope mirrors.\n\n3D Printed Electroactive Polymers\nWe are miniaturizing the actuators that perfect the paraboloidal mirror shape needed to separate the light of an exoplanet from its star. Electroactive Polymers, or EAP for short, are incredibly strong synthetic muscles. By 3D printing 1,000\u2019s of polymers on the back of the mirror we will be able to make incredibly small and accurate adjustments to the mirror to yield optical-quality off-axis paraboloids and to maintain their shape as the telescope environment changes. EAP's will be a great improvement over typical mirror actuators that are now sometimes used, because they will be much smaller and cheaper.\n  Algorithms/Software\nOur team lead by Dr. Svetlana Berdyugina and Dr. Jeff Kuhn have created a unique algorithm that will be able to image these exoplanets and see things like continents, oceans, and life. Assuming we are looking at exoplanets similar to Earth, we will see in their atmospheres molecules like water (H\u2082O), oxygen (O), methane (CH\u2084), carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), and ozone (O\u2083), and on the surfaces - colonies of photosynthetic organisms or even thermal waste from civilizations not much more advanced than humans.\n  $40,000 - Locked\nFunding goal will be unlocked once we reach $35,000.\n$35,000 - Live Mirror Actuator Prototype\nHelp us reach this goal we will be able to build a fully working prototype of our advanced polymer actuator system. This is a crucial step in helping us build mirrors that have an overall thickness of 2cm including the electronics.   \n    Voyager Missions \nLaunched in 1977, the Voyager Space Mission was designed to take advantage of a favorable alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and are now exploring the outer boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space. The Voyager program is a continuing American scientific program that employs two robotic probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, to study the outer Solar System. \nAlthough their original mission was to study only the planetary systems of Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 2 continued on to Uranus and Neptune, and both Voyagers are now tasked with exploring interstellar space. Their mission has been extended three times, and both probes continue to collect and relay useful scientific data. Neither Uranus nor Neptune has been visited by any probe other than Voyager 2.\nThe Voyager Golden Records are phonograph records aboard both Voyager spacecrafts. The records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form, or for future humans, who may find them. The Voyager Golden Records records are considered as a time capsule for humanity.\n       The PLANETS Foundation\nThe PLANETS Foundation is 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization of professors, astrophysicists, engineers, entrepreneurs and scientists from around the globe.

Email us at info@kohlhaussen.com\nVideo track ID: Eden - Ben Khan \nA year ago I made the first prototype of an analog medium format panoramic camera. I 3D printed the parts, painted it mustard yellow and added it to my design portfolio. It worked much better than expected and garnered attention from the likes of DPREVIEW, PetaPixel, The Phoblographer and Designboom (press links at the end).\nTogether, with your help, I\u2019d like to take this project to the next step by making it available to other photographers as a kit. This campaign will fund a small production run of cameras, mostly in kit-form but also as 10 limited edition pre-finished units. If successful, the business will be properly launched and production will be further developed. \nThe K-Pan is a precision tool for photographers who appreciate versatility, reliability, utterly gigantic negatives and the craft of shooting on film. Most importantly, it is a camera that you can truly make your own. The K-Pan, designed to be as small and light as possible, is perfect for the traveling photographer. Your 4x5 lens + this kit can result in cinematic images like this:\nThis includes more than just the camera itself - our vision is to use this modular system as a foundation on which to build an open-source platform for expansion parts and accessories. These will be designed by and for end users, including myself. 3D printing is more accessible now than ever and offers nearly limitless possibilities for augmenting, improving and customizing this camera. Don't believe me? Check out 3D Hubs. \nNeed spare parts? Download and print them. Want a grip for it? Print it. Want to attach your phone to it? Print a mount. Alternatively, order the parts from our website and have them printed for you. These are just some of the things in the works - seeing that I\u2019ve gotten plenty of use out of this camera so far, I invite you to join me in further developing this system.\nA gallery of photographs taken on the K-Pan can be viewed here.\nFeldsee, Southern Germany, shot on Kodak Ektar\n  Oslo, Norway, shot on Kodak Ektar\n  CAMERA DETAILS\nThe idea is that you combine the kit with your own 4x5 lens. The camera you see in the video and pictures is a prototype developed around a Schneider Super Angulon 90mm f8 that has since seen several upgrades. These include a revised film winding system, a future-proofed design with higher tolerances and compatibility for more lens types. \nAfter publishing the initial project, we received many requests for the CAD files, the raw printed components and also for fully completed cameras. As much as we admire the notion of localized 3D printing, we realized that it will be necessary to manufacture the core hardware ourselves in order to ensure consistently high quality and functionality. Therefor we are presenting a flexible solution - the components work out of the box, however they can also be further finished to the end user's preference. \nHow it works:\nIt shoots five 6x14cm frames per roll of 120 film\nThe kit comes in two main parts; the lens cone and the camera body\nThe body contains a removable pressure plate, dark slide and lid. The lid plate is outfitted with the film winding knobs, fastening screws and two universal cold shoe mounts. \nLoading the film is done by removing said lid plate, similar to removing the bottom plate on a Leica M. \nFocus is set to infinity by default; it can be drawn closer by inserting dedicated spacer brackets between the lens cone and body (10mm bracket included in the kit). Hyperfocal distance is your friend. \nFrank in Hyde Park, shot with a 10mm focus bracket on Kodak Portra 800\nThe hardware: \nComponents are made of lightproof, highly robust grey SLS nylon (see picture below). Yes, the raw components are white in the video and other pictures. We've stopped using that material because it is too translucent. \nTotals to only ~350 grams without a lens\nThe body is 22cm wide and 9cm tall\nEmbedded steel screw threads \nStandard \u00bc-20 UNC tripod mount \nLens mount (the \u201clens board\u201d) is 2mm thick with a 33mm diameter hole (fits a wide variety of Copal 0 shutter lenses)\nFirst generation production prototype of Fujinon lens cone\nWhat\u2019s left for you to do? \nYou receive the grey nylon components with the metal threads and light seals pre-installed. The camera can be assembled with your lens and used right away, however we recommend making it your own by finishing the outer surfaces. We strongly believe in the DIY ethic and are excited to see how people put their own twist on it. If you would rather just leave it in its natural finish, that's fine too. The unfinished nylon material has a rather unique, almost stone-like texture to it. \nWe understand that most people will like to figure out their own special setup for the K-Pan, choosing combinations that best fit their creative style. Seeing that we want to make this camera system expandable in the future, we're currently designing multi-purpose mounts for all sorts of attachments, both internally and externally. Side projects we're working on include frame masks for smaller formats and a mount enabling you to use your phone as a viewfinder and light meter. Please check out the FAQ section for further information.\nThe prototype finished with yellow automotive primer\nTHE REWARDS\nBy backing the K-Pan you will ensure further innovation and development of this project.

Includes everything from the Tier 7 Bonus Bundle and Tier 1. \nWHAT'S NEXT?\nOctober: Whilst this campaign is running we will do one final round of prototyping to ensure that all of our upgrades work smoothly. Some goals we have for this include finalizing the designs for a new cone-body coupling mechanism, a dark slide that inserts from underneath and grippier knobs. We will also be preparing the designs for the tote bags and stickers.\nNovember: Prototyping and testing will continue until the final production components work just as we want them to. This could take less time than expected, however we're leaving some leeway because we know there can be minor hickups along the way. In this time we will also take care of the tote bags and stickers.\nDecember: Time to get things made. This includes the K-Pan kit bodies, standard lens cones and packaging. During this time we will also design the custom lens cones.\nJanuary 2018: Printing of the standard components will be completed and the custom cones will be manufactured. Whilst this is happening, in-house assembly will be going strong. Tote bags and stickers will be shipped whilst the limited edition photographs are printed.\nFebruary 2018: Limited edition K-Pans will be painted and finished. Manufacturing and assembly will wrap up and orders will be prepared for shipping. Website will be prepared for launch.\nMarch 2018: Shipping. In an ideal world we would have the rewards shipped by mid-February, however we realize that the logistics of everything will most likely push back the shipping dates to this time frame. We will also launch the K-Pan website for downloading/ordering replacement and expansion parts.\nMarch/April 2018: A photographic adventure! I'm tentatively scheduling a trip across several countries to really put the K-Pan through its paces. The intent is to then have prints made and possibly also a book. \n  WHO ARE YOU?!\nPaul Kohlhaussen (me!) is a German photographer and designer based in London. I have a long history with photographic equipment, having bought, sold and tinkered with more cameras than I can keep track of. Being an absolute 3D printing nut as well it was only a matter of time until I found a way to combine these two obsessions. A couple months ago I graduated with a degree in economics and am now studying architecture. You can check out my work on my website and instagrams @paulhausen & @pelsnaps. To get this show on the road I have sought out the help of many friends, designers, photographers and business consultants to help me along the way.\nDESIGN PROCESS\nFrom the beginning the system was designed to be a simple, reliable and long-lasting solution to medium format photography, qualities that are often lacking in many modern cameras on the market. Overall, one could say that this camera is pretty low-tech. It doesn't have a lot of moving components and is completely analog - but that's just how we wanted it to be.\nEarly prototypes\nThe components are all modeled in CAD with respect to the dimensions of the fixed input variables - the lens and the film. The flange distance and image circle of the specific lens are modeled as a three-dimensional volume around which the parts are then constructed. Details are prototyped on FDM printers and tested, allowing for the final components to be printed perfectly out of nylon powder via selective laser sintering. The resulting precision and quality in relation to the tools used and time invested is unique to such additive manufacturing. \nThis process is streamlined to minimize wasted resources and environmental impact. The parts are only physically made upon ordering and don't rely on mass production and warehouse storage. Replacement and expansion parts are stocked digitally for anyone to print locally, thereby eliminating the need for long-haul shipping. \nLens Sourcing Guide\nThe K-Pan doesn't come with a lens so you will need to find your own. Large format lenses are plentiful and many photographers already own them, so finding them second hand is often the way to go. Sites such as eBay, MrCad, KEH and Second Hand Dark Room work great for sourcing 4x5 lenses, it's also worth checking the various film photography Facebook groups. These lenses don't have to cost much, however there are several things to look out for.\nMake sure the shutter mechanism doesn't stick and has accurate speeds.\nEnsure that the glass is clean with no fungus or haze. \nCheck that the components aren't dented and fit together snugly on a lens board with a 34.6mm hole (Copal #0). \nA list of newer lenses can be found here, however older lenses work just as well (e.g. the excellent Schneider Angulon 90mm f6.8).\nLens Compatibility\nThe main important specifications are that the lens uses a Copal #0 size shutter and has a rear element that fits within the parameters for the lens cone. This usually means that anything with a rear element diameter of more than 65mm is out of the question because it won't fit through the cone mount opening. Lenses with larger rear elements (e.g. the Schneider SA 90mm f5.6 with a 77mm \u00d8 rear barrel) will require a two-part lens cone or an XL body, both of which are in further research and development. Not all large format lenses will work with this camera and we reserve the right to reject custom cone requests if we find them to be incompatible. \nPress\nPetaPixel, The Phoblographer, DPREVIEW, designboom, Core77, GQ Portugal, 3D Printing Industry, Australian Photography, Yanko Design, 3D Hubs, 3D Druck, DIY Photography, Konbini Cheese, Hypeness, Albedomedia, 3D Focus, DesignTAXI, Popular Mechanics\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA certain level of risk is unavoidable with any project like this, however for the K-Pan it's quite minimal. The camera has already been made, tested, refined and will go through another round of final testing before production begins. I've established a solid support network and have sufficient experience in design and business operations to know what I'm doing (we're going on an adventure!). \n\nThe main issue we could encounter is delays in manufacturing, however the nature of 3D printing means we can be flexible and responsive to such a situation. Minor design details may change (knobs, markings, etc.) but the camera kit will nevertheless remain a beautiful tool that stays true to our vision and commitment.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Paul Kohlhaussen\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\n\"That guy with the 3D printed camera.\" Designer and photographer based in London.

In a simulated drive-in setting, cars and audience surround a group of dancers who remix and reinterpret iconic female characters from the last four decades of Hollywood and cult films.\nBuilding off a style developed in our signature dance-party-show ONTHEFLOOR, we\u2019re bringing the Cartel spirit to a brand-new setting, obliterating the wall between viewer and participant with a high-energy performance style that communicates as much to the body as to the brain. The show culminates with a live DJ set by our long-time collaborator DJ Average Jo - by the end of a Cartel show, everyone is dancing.\nONTHEFLOOR (photo by Maddy Talias)\n  PLAY\n\nWHY WET CLUTCH \nThe Cartel\u2019s radically diverse dancers explore a variety of Hollywood role models (ranging from badass to idiotic) in order to break apart traditional ideas of leading women and reach a layered, multiple expression of what a heroine can be. Pulling from both cult favorites like Pam Anderson\u2019s \u201cBarb Wire\u201d to Angela Bassett in \u201cStrange Days,\u201d to more mainstream staples like Ripley in \u201cAlien,\u201d choreographic reinterpretations of movie tropes are designed to open up a dialogue about the cultural mythology Hollywood provides. Original video content inspired by these icons will complement, surround and offset choreography, recontextualizing those images for a modern audience.\nUPCOMING WIDE RELEASE\nAfter the Seaport premiere on September 8th, the Cartel will adapt WET CLUTCH to a host of venues, indoor and outdoor, inviting audience vehicles wherever possible. Whether on foot or in cars, audiences will automatically become part of the architecture of the live choreography, collectively rendering and reimagining a cinematic world through dance.\nGOING PLACES - WET CLUTCH TOUR (photo by Maddy Talias)\nHELP BRING WET CLUTCH TO STAGE AND SCREEN \nGiven the massive scope of the project, even with terrific institutional support we\u2019ve only secured about \u00bc of our budget. We\u2019re looking to our beloved audience to bring this great labor of love life at the high production value it deserves.\nDonations will help support: * modular and adaptable projection design + screens and tech at our range of venues * artist fees for intensive workshops and high-endurance, sweaty rehearsals * the genesis of complex original video content * new technology to keep that video running * designing quality costumes that conjure the cinematic world of the show * the moving set pieces (TDC vehicles) that bring the drive-in to life * the tourability and future of this show across America\nThe Cartel is ready to launch WET CLUTCH and bring it to a drive-in near you.

Without sacrificing technical rigor or artistic ambition as a dance company, we endeavor to employ the social nature of dance, the charge of a party, and the sharpness of a music video to a fresh dance vocabulary that any Joe can get down with.\nSince launching in 2012, the Cartel has performed at a radically diverse array of spaces - select highlights include: Ace Hotel NY, MoMA / PS 1, BAM, The High Line, OBERON/ART, The Brooklyn Museum, Summer on the Hudson, Le Poisson Rouge, Velocity Dance Center (Seattle, WA), Philadelphia Museum of Art, Bootleg Theater (Los Angeles, CA), Edward Sharpe\u2019s Big Top, Espaco Xisto (Salvador da Bahia, Brazil), IAC Building, La MaMa Moves!, Red Hook Festival, Space Gallery (Portland, ME). The Cartel has been featured in music videos for Yoko Ono, Vic Mensa, Reggie Watts, and The Sway Machinery.

Each season will have six episodes, with each episode featuring one friend on a shenanigan-filled adventure in a city that gives \u201cno fucks\u201d about an earnest heart or a living wage.

Her life gets more complicated when she loses her job and her college crush, Gil, rejoins her circle of friends.\nA no-nonsense, career-driven, former valedictorian, who works at an investment-banking firm while studying for her GMATs. A beacon of style and taste -- she's only willing to date women and men who are socialites. She's got her whole life figured out -- but with her high standards, can she find someone to share it with?\nHis natural charisma, humor and deep spirituality make everyone \u2013 even strangers \u2013 want to be his best friend. Travis has found a successful, church-going, God-loving man. He has the perfect life...or does he?\nA free-spirit who's been taking random jobs and turning couch-surfing into an art form, with the hopes of one day becoming a restaurateur. And although he won\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d to a crazy night out or a one-night stand, he\u2019s a romantic at heart and is looking for the right woman to settle down with. But will his wild ways get in the way of love?\nA weed-smoking middle school guidance counselor who's a peacemaker among her friends. With her easy-going demeanor, Jess is everyone\u2019s confidante. Although the ladies love her, she has a problem letting women in \u2014 afraid that they might mess with her Zen-like way of life.\nA geek-chic, sci-fi fantasy connoisseur who's not afraid to let his Blerd flag fly.

Join us as we become the first artist-museum team to launch a sculptural satellite into space.\nA couple of years ago, contemporary artist Trevor Paglen approached the Nevada Museum of Art with a bold idea: launch the first satellite into space that would exist purely as an artistic gesture. The Museum knew that his radical vision -- Orbital Reflector -- could help to change the way we see our place in the world. Orbital Reflector is a satellite that will have no commercial, military, or scientific purpose. Instead, it will be a public sculpture, visible from the ground without a telescope -- a satellite that belongs to everyone.\nDesign concept rendering for Trevor Paglen: Orbital Reflector, co-produced and presented by the Nevada Museum of Art, 2017\nWhy does it matter?\nArt gives us a reason -- gives us permission -- to look at something deeply. An artwork that pushes the boundaries of what we traditionally think of as \"art\" challenges the way we engage with the world. Orbital Reflector encourages all of us to look up at the night sky with a renewed sense of wonder, to consider our place in the universe, and to re-imagine how we live together on this planet. It prompts us to ask the big questions. Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going? What are we doing to the shared world in which we live? \nTrevor Paglen, LACROSSE/ONYX V near Cepheus (Synthetic Aperture Radar Reconnaissance Satellite; USA 182), 2008\nHow will it work?\nOrbital Reflector is packed inside of a small (3U) satellite called a CubeSat that will be launched into space aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, anticipated for early 2018. Once in low Earth orbit, at approximately 350 miles (575 km) from Earth's surface, a 100-foot-long diamond-shaped balloon will deploy from the CubeSat. The balloon will reflect sunlight back to Earth, making the satellite visible to the naked eye. It will remain in space for approximately two months.\nHow can I find it?\nWe are partnering with the sky-watching app Star Walk 2 to ping you when Orbital Reflector passes your location (it will orbit the planet several times a day). You can also see the satellite's flight data from our website, orbitalreflector.com.\nWhy a diamond shape?\nOrbital Reflector is a neo-minimalist sculpture, inspired by an alternative history of spaceflight that includes early Russian avant-gardists and forgotten NASA experiments. It is a work of aerospace engineering for aerospace engineering's sake.\nThe design has shifted from a sphere to a diamond throughout the course of development. Once we started working with aerospace engineers to build a flight-worthy spacecraft, physics played a pivotal role. The diamond shape Paglen created will be bigger, brighter, and better in flight than a sphere. \nAbout Trevor Paglen\nTrevor Paglen is an American artist whose work deliberately blurs lines between science, contemporary art, journalism, geography, and other disciplines to construct unfamiliar yet meticulously researched ways to see and interpret the world. Best known for his documentation and critique of surveillance in the twenty-\ufb01rst century, his current work with artificial intelligence and machine vision -- and his push into outer space -- is redefining the future of art practice.\nTrevor Paglen, Five Classified Aircraft, 2007, 5 fabric patches, framed\nThe artist has long contemplated and engaged with the history and geography of satellites -- and the politics surrounding them. He has spent significant time photographing classified satellites and other objects in orbit. \nTrevor Paglen, Nine Reconnaissance Satellites over the Sonora Pass, 2008\n  Trevor Paglen, KEYHOLE IMPROVED CRYSTAL from Glacier Point (Optical Reconnaissance Satellite; USA 224), 2011\nIn 2012, Paglen launched The Last Pictures, an ultra-archival disc of human history told through one-hundred images the artist curated. The disc is mounted to a communications satellite that is in geosynchronous orbit as we speak. While working on The Last Pictures with MIT scientists, Paglen imagined building his own satellite, one with no other function or purpose beyond being the art object itself.\nTrevor Paglen, The Last Pictures, 2012, commissioned and presented by Creative Time\nTrevor Paglen\u2019s work is included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Smithsonian American Art Museum; the Whitney Museum of American Art; Berkeley Art Museum; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; and the Nevada Museum of Art. \nAbout the Nevada Museum of Art\nThe Nevada Museum of Art is not your typical art museum. While we organize exhibitions and have a permanent collection like many museums, we also work directly with living artists to push contemporary art in new directions. Remember Ugo Rondinone's Seven Magic Mountains? That was us, in partnership with our friends at Art Production Fund.\nNevada Museum of Art in Reno, Nevada.\nThe Nevada Museum of Art is the only art museum in Nevada accredited by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM). It is a private, non-profit institution founded in 1931. \nThe Museum's Center for Art + Environment is an internationally-recognized research center dedicated to supporting the practice, study, and awareness of creative interactions between people and their environments. The Center houses unique archive materials from more than 1,000 artists working on all seven continents, including Cape Farewell, Michael Heizer, Walter de Maria, Lita Albuquerque, Burning Man, Center for Land Interpretation, and Ugo Rondinone\u2019s Seven Magic Mountains. The Center will also house the official project archive for Orbital Reflector. A portion of that archive will be on display as an interpretive-center style exhibition when the satellite launches into space.\nHow can I help?\nAerospace is kind of pricey. Rocket rides aren't cheap, and neither is high-tech precision engineering. This art project requires both. The overall project budget is $1.3 million. We have already raised approximately 60% of the funds, and you can help us close the gap. \nThe goal we have set on Kickstarter is the minimum amount of money we need to pay this year to ensure we have a ticket to launch. The more we raise on Kickstarter, the easier time we will have putting the finishing touches on satellite construction, shipping the spacecraft to the launch site, and lifting off into space. \nThere are many steps involved in constructing the satellite, and over the course of this campaign, we will share \"behind-the-scenes\" photos and videos detailing the process.\nThe Rewards\nDigital Rendering of Orbital Reflector\n  Official (unlimited) Diamond Mission Sticker\n  Official (unlimited) Diamond Mission Patch\n  Mission Pin with Chrome Finish\n  Trevor Paglen, Orbital Reflector Structural Drawing, 2017\nAs we progress through the campaign, we will update you with photos of the official patches - they are in production now!\n  Limited Edition Collector's Patch Set of 5, Custom-designed by Trevor Paglen\n As of September 18, four of the five patches are complete.

So it comes as no surprise that artist Trevor Paglen approached the Center for Art + Environment at the Nevada Museum of Art to imagine the unimaginable. Together we embark upon an exploration of the most extreme environment of them all: outer space.\n\nThis is the first time any artist or museum has attempted to launch a sculpture into space. As we have learned from the aerospace engineers with whom we are engaged, space is inherently risky and challenging. We have taken all available precautions to mitigate those risks, but certain things are beyond our control. The launch date is a moving target and the rocket may fail on the first attempt. However, thanks to launch insurance, we can fly a second time. And, as far as the satellite construction goes, we've planned ahead. We have a backup satellite unit being built as a precaution.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Orbital Reports", "descp": "As a friend in flight, you will receive mission updates as we inch closer to the rocket launch.

Created in collaboration with local high schoolers, East of the River highlights the experiences of young students of color as they navigate Washington, D.C.'s overburdened public school system.\nWe launched under the Projects of Earth campaign, a group of projects that offer unique perspectives on humanity, culture, and life on Earth. East of the River reveals a day in the life of youth pushed out of the very institutions that we expect to help them flourish, and shows how, despite a disproportionate amount of obstacles placed on these young people\u2019s paths, they still find ways to educate themselves and grow amidst a glaring absence of social and economic opportunities to pursue the lives they want to lead.\nWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to make this film and need your support in bringing it to life. We made the decision to go all or nothing on a Kickstarter campaign because we believe East of the River features untold stories that deserve to be heard.

Peter Sollett (short) \nThe Florida Project (2017) dir. Sean Baker (feature) \nHeaven Knows What (2014) dir. Josh and Benny Sadie (feature)\n WHY TELL THIS STORY, NOW\nThis is a story we have not heard: East of the River takes place in parts of the nation's capital that rarely receive coverage in media, yet we believe if heard, would resonate deeply with a wide audience. We are choosing to highlight the experiences of young, black female and gender non-conforming students and to cast actual DC youth attending public schools.\nTo expand the school-to-prison pipeline dialogue: In Monique Morris' book \u201cPushout,\u201d she explains that \u201cblack girls are 16% of the student population, but nearly one-third of all girls referred to law enforcement and more than one-third of all female school-based arrests.\" East of the River offers a nuanced view of zero-tolerance school discipline practices that too often funnel students into the delinquency/criminal systems.\nFilm Should Be Inclusive: Movies belong to everyone, but not everyone\u2019s story gets featured. Low-income neighborhoods and the people who live in them are not often portrayed with dignity and instead are often represented through violence and two-dimensional characters. We wanted to make this a narrative fiction film because we believe that gives audiences a chance to share in the experience of young people pushed out of schools rather than to see them as stark statistics. \nTo make is to take action: If you\u2019ve read this far, there is a good chance we are on the same page in saying that the current political situation is really scary. Action can come in all forms, including the way we represent people, places, and circumstances in media. By contributing to this film, we entirely count you as collaborators in this effort.\nOTHER WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE\nFollow our Kickstarter | Like us on Facebook | Follow us on Twitter | Follow us on Instagram \nOne of the best ways to help us is by posting a link to this Kickstarter page [https://tinyurl.com/Eastoftheriverfilm] on Facebook, Twitter, or any of your favorite social networks and even by emailing someone you think might be interested in backing East of the River.

We decided to hit the streets of DC to find real youth to collaborate with. East of the River is about individuals whose opportunities have been taken away from them, and it was important to us to give opportunities back to DC teens. That means providing paid opportunities, giving in-depth acting workshops, and hands on experience on a professional set.\n  PLAY\n\nAyiana T. Davis will be playing Teonna.

Approximately 900 bottles will be produced in advance of the exhibition, with an additional 300 bottles reserved for on-site bottling performances during the opening and throughout the run of the show.\nWhy is this project important?\nWhen Pope.L was asked by What Pipeline to do a commission for Detroit, he felt that whatever he did it should not re-victimize the city as had been done too often in the past. What if Detroit could be the hero and come to the rescue of another midwest city in need?\nIn 2014, the city of Flint, Michigan, changed its water supply in order to save money. That decision and a host of subsequent and related decisions on local, state and federal levels created a crisis. Water quality was mismanaged, citizens were poisoned, and in the fallout of criminal charges and lawsuits many Flint residents still do not have access to reliable, safe water.\nFlint Water Project will call attention to the city\u2019s continued plight while raising funds to support Flint citizens in their struggle. Proceeds from the sales of the Flint Water art edition sold at What Pipeline will benefit the United Way of Genessee County, who will use the funds entirely for mitigating issues directly related to the water crisis.\nA portion of the proceeds will also be donated to Hydrate Detroit, a volunteer-lead non-profit group assisting in combating water shutoffs and advocating for affordable water laws in Detroit.\nAbout the Artist\nPope.L is a visual artist and educator whose multidisciplinary practice uses binaries, contraries and preconceived notions embedded within contemporary culture to create art works in various formats, for example, writing, painting, performance, installation, video and sculpture. Building upon his long history of enacting arduous, provocative, absurdist performances and interventions in public spaces, Pope.L applies some of the same social, formal and performative strategies to his interests in language, system, gender, race and community. The goals for his work are several: joy, money and uncertainty\u2014 not necessarily in that order.\nWhat related projects has he created?\nPope.L has a long history of public intervention and community interaction in his artworks.\nBlack Factory\nBetween 2004-2006, The Black Factory toured the USA stirring up discussions about class, gender, race, and democracy. Visitors to the Black Factory were asked to bring objects that represent blackness to them. These objects were added to the Black Factory through performance, pulverization and documentation. Proceeds from the Black Factory Gift Shop Twice Sold products benefitted local organizations like food pantries and shelters; when Black Factory was at the Wexner Center proceeds benefited Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Ohio.\nBlink, 2011\nFor the mobile and interactive artwork Blink, 2011, Pope.L invited residents of New Orleans to share photos of what they dreamt about or what they were thinking about when they woke up. The hundreds of photos he received became a slide show representing the hopes and dreams of a city slowly rising after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He created a film from these photographs and on the night of October 22, the film was projected on the back of an old ice cream truck as it was pulled through the streets of the city by volunteers.\nPull!, 2013\nIn 2013, Pope.L presented Pull! a durational city-wide community performance piece in which rotating teams of Cleveland locals assisted in pulling a truck by hand for 25 miles, through the neighborhoods of North Collinwood, Glenville, University Circle, Hough, AsiaTown and downtown; to West Park, Clark-Fulton and Ohio City. This act was a way to connect an otherwise divided city and a chance to stir up a city-wide conversation about work.\nThese performances show Pope.L working in a space between community organization and an artistic practice\u2014mobilizing individuals while attempting to address societal concerns through an abstraction of imposing themes such as labor, identity politics, and basic civil and fundamental rights.\nWhat will your contributions support?\nRendering of Flint Water at What Pipeline\nMuch of the work for this exhibition is already underway. Your contributions will support the purchase of materials directly related to the exhibition such as bottling and packaging materials (1200 bottles and caps, custom fitted boxes, foam insets and mailing labels) along with construction materials (shelving, brackets, paint, wall paper) and labor costs.\nAdditional Support\nFlint Water Project is supported by a matching grant from the John L. and James S. Knight Foundation as part of the Knight Arts Challenge. Donated dollars may be matched by this grant, doubling your contribution. Additional support comes from Mitchell-Innes & Nash in New York City and Susanne Vielmetter Projects Los Angeles.\nRewards\nTwo-Ply Flint Water Sticker ($15 or more), Flint Water Postcard, Signed by Pope.L ($50 or more)\nTwo-Ply Flint Water Sticker and Button Combo Pak ($25 or more)\nInside the Studio: Wonderful Studio Assistant David wearing a Flint Water Button\nHand Assembled Flint Water Prototype Water Bottle, Signed by Pope.L ($100 or more)\nVery Limited Editioned Print, Signed by Pope.L ($225 or more)\nFramed Original Sketches and Work Notes from Flint Water Project, Signed by Pope.L ($299 or more)\n Failed Wallpaper Test Print ($499 or more)\nFramed original Pope.L concept sketches and work notes ($550 or more)\nBlack Factory Pro-Pak ($799 or more)\nAll You Can Eat Taco Bash with Pope.L and Team ($999 or more)\nDinner with Pope.L in Flint ($2,500)\nDinner on Pope.L's lap in Flint ($9,999)\nWhy Kickstarter?\nEven though the physical form of the project takes place in a gallery, with the collaboration of Kickstarter, its conceptual and activist outreach can be far wider, stirring discussions about the availability and sustainability of clean water and the necessity for connectedness and community. Kickstarter can extend this project's reach, spread the word about the exhibition, and raise awareness about ongoing issues relating to water and struggle.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFlint Water Project is scheduled to take place in September. We need to reach our Kickstarter goal to create the Flint Water installation. We then face the additional task of bottling and selling 1200 bottles of Flint Water.

What Pipeline will take on additional staff for the first time to ensure production can be maintained. Shipping will take place directly after the end of the exhibition, rather than throughout, to reduce the labor involved and maintain the installation on view.\n\nWith the cooperation of three galleries located in New York, Los Angeles and Detroit, and an experienced team who have worked on many art exhibitions at major museums and events throughout the world, we are confident all goals will be exceeded, and that Flint Water Project is an important artwork to support.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Invitation", "descp": "Your name on our glorious thank you list and a personalized digital invitation to the gala What Pipeline opening on September 7.

Some are more privileged than others, but with that privilege comes a responsibility to do more.\u201d    \nWorld-renowned artist and activist, Ai Weiwei, and New York City's premier presenter of contemporary outdoor art, Public Art Fund, are working together to bring an important new art exhibition to the streets of NYC from October to February.  \nIn response to the worldwide plight of migrants and refugees, divisive immigration and border control policies, and the global rise in nationalism, the exhibition, Good Fences Make Good Neighbors, will be installed at 300 + sites spanning dozens of New York City neighborhoods in all five boroughs. \nDrawing on the artist\u2019s personal experience being detained by the Chinese government and as well as his visits with some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations at refugee camps and borders worldwide, the show will make a powerful statement about division and separation at a global, national, local, and personal level.\nAbout the Artworks\n\"Fences can be used to regulate and detain people, to segregate and to train people to accept the given conditions.\"\nInstallation concept rendering, Doris C. Freedman Plaza\nAdapting security fencing in a variety of unexpected ways, Ai Weiwei's artworks will appear at street level, rise from rooftops, emerge between buildings, be affixed to lampposts, frame bus shelters, and seemingly grow out of the urban infrastructure. \nMajor site-specific sculptures will be installed at iconic locations including Central Park, Washington Square Park, and the Unisphere, while more discrete 2-D and 3-D interventions \u2014 including posters with images collected from the artist\u2019s visits to refugee camps around the world \u2014 will be installed across New York's five boroughs.\nThis is your chance to be a part of Ai Weiwei\u2019s revolutionary work by joining a community of artists, activists, and citizens standing up against the forces that separate us.\nInstallation concept rendering, Washington Square Park\nAbout Ai Weiwei\n\"The issue with the migration crisis has been a longtime focus of my practice. And the fence has always been a tool in the vocabulary of political landscaping.\u201d\nAi Weiwei at Idomeni Refugee Camp, Greece, 2016\nGiven his remarkable life and work, Ai Weiwei stands as a unique international figure. He is both one of the most celebrated contemporary artists and one of the world\u2019s most prominent and respected human rights and social justice activists.\nThe artist has been in conversation with Public Art Fund about doing a project in New York for more than seven years, but from 2011 to 2015 his passport was confiscated, and he was arrested and detained by the Chinese authorities for his vocal political activism and criticism. We are proud to be working with him at long last to present this work, this year, in this city \u2014 a beacon for free expression and democratic ideals. \n\"When I left New York in the 80s as a student, I had nothing \u2013 I could have never dreamed of this project. All these years later, the show is like a love letter to the city and its people.\u201d\nAbout Public Art Fund\nThis year, Public Art Fund is celebrating its 40th anniversary of free access to the most important art of our time, championing the role of artistic expression in an open society by bringing dynamic contemporary art to the broadest possible audiences across New York City. \nPublic Art Fund has redefined what public art is and can be. Our more than 450 projects have demonstrated the power and potential of public art to transform the urban environment, engage audiences of all ages and backgrounds, and capture the imaginations of millions.\nWhy should I support this project?\n\u201cWhen the Berlin Wall fell, there were 11 countries with border fences and walls. By 2016, that number had increased to 70. We are witnessing a rise in nationalism, an increase in the closure of borders, and an exclusionary attitude towards migrants and refugees, the victims of war and the casualties of globalization.\u201d\nAi Weiwei and Public Art Fund share a vision that art should be freely accessible to everyone and leave a lasting impact on those who experience it. Good Fences Make Good Neighbors, which will be experienced by millions of New Yorkers and visitors from across the globe, is the embodiment of that vision. \nThis is a moment when it is crucial to stand up for projects that reflect our values.

You can read more about how Patrick created the image, here.\nIn-camera double exposure \u00a9 Patrick Hall\n New Stretch Goal and Reward announced\nIf we reach our new stretch goal of $15,000, we'll be sending everyone who has pledged $20 or more a commemorative sticker based on Andrew Studer's eclipse image.\nUPDATE 8/25: We're thrilled to announce that Andrew Studer's stunning image of a rock climber framed by the solar eclipse is now part of our project and will be featured in our book, Chasing the Great American Eclipse: Images and Essays from Totality. \nAndrew is also signing and numbering a limited number of 16 x 24 prints of his photo that will be included as rewards in our $500 reward tier, \"The Total Eclipse Package.\" (The image won't be included in any of the other reward tiers). \nIf there is any image that will be looked back upon years from now when people think of the Great American Eclipse of 2017, it may very well be Andrew's. You can read more about how he and his team created this image on FStoppers: http://bit.ly/2wGiKNI\n\u00a9 Andrew Studer in Smith Rock State Park, Oregon.\n---------\n\u00a9 2017 Dimitrios Manis in Madras, Oregon.\nOur book will document the spectrum of emotions, the crowds, the traffic jams, the street corner preachers, the revelers and the moments that will remind us what it was like the day the sun disappeared over America.\nThose who saw the total solar eclipse on Aug. 21 will tell you there's absolutely nothing that compares to watching the sun flicker to darkness in the middle of the day.\nAs the sky slowly went dark, the temperature dropped and people all around were gasping in amazement, screaming in delight or even becoming overcome with emotion. Psychologists say that watching a total solar eclipse can have an unsettling effect on people because, frankly, it's hard for our minds to cope with what is happening.\nChasing the Great American Eclipse captures the  spectacle of this total solar eclipse -- a once in a 100-year coast-to-coast event that was witnessed by tens of millions of people in the 70-mile wide swath of \"totality.\"\nIf you are a fan of documentary and street photography, we think you'll be enthralled by this study in human nature and what it reveals about our culture. The parties and festivals, the doomsayers, the curious and the entrepreneurial spirit that these types of hyped events bring out will be on display across America.\nThe book will be a mix of photojournalism, street photography, visual storytelling and stunning images of the eclipse over various landscapes and cityscapes. It's sure to be a conversation starter on your coffee table and will be an interesting piece of history that you'll be able to look back upon in the years to come. \nPhases of the eclipse \u00a9 Joseph Gruber in the Great Smoky Mountains.\nProjects of Earth\nWe're also proud to be part of Kickstarter's \"Projects of Earth\" campaign, which honors the 40th anniversary of the Voyager spacecraft, which carried the \"Golden Record\" -- a collection of images, sounds and greetings that created a snapshot of life on earth. \nThe Projects of Earth are things that might be placed on that Golden Record today as a record of our humanity in the 21st Century. We'd like to think that if an alien culture were to pick up a copy of Chasing the Great American Eclipse, they might learn a thing or two about man's fascination with the heavens.\n\u00a9 2017 Joe Newman in Jefferson City, Missouri\nHow We Are Doing It\nOur team of photographers was embedded in various locations on the day of the eclipse, including Oregon, Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina. \nThe members of our team are all experienced photographers and were all contributors to our most recent photo book, UnPresidented, which documented the protests and celebration at the Trump inauguration and was successfully funded on Kickstarter.\nWe are also running a nationwide contest for people to submit photos for consideration. You can find the contest here.\nOur jury for the contest includes veteran, award-winning photojournalists Carl Juste of the Miami Herald and Andr\u00e9 Chung, formerly of the Baltimore Sun and Jarob Ortiz, a National Park Service photographer who was once referred to as the \"next Ansel Adams,\" Heather Goss, an editor at Air & Space magazine and Sarah Gordon, who teaches the history of photography at American University and who has curated photography exhibits at the National Gallery of Art. \nMoney raised during the Kickstarter campaign will finance design and printing of the book and help defray travel expenses incurred in journeying to various locations in the path of totality.\nThe Editors\nShamila Chaudhary is an avid photographer whose work has been featured in The Washington Post as well as local media outlets and galleries in the Washington, D.C. metro area.

In the glow of inspiration following that journey I spent a year conceiving and building my masterpiece. It is completely strange and lovely. I call it an Ant Space, a thin habitat for ants and plants, backlit by a glowing nebula and designed to hang on a wall. It is living, evolving art.\nMy goal with this KickStarter campaign is to launch the Ant Space as an art piece and a product. It is a beautiful, meditative, nuanced hobby. I want to start a community around it. Backers will receive an Ant Space built by me. They will be the seeds to reach a wider audience.\nArt\nThe backdrop of each Ant Space is a unique selection from the immaculate Hubble Space Telescope image The Carina Nebula: Star Birth In The Extreme. The composition spans fifty light years, capturing the brightest stars in the sky. It is the most beautiful of astronomical observations.\nLife\nAdd life to the Ant Space. Plants live passively, fitting themselves seamlessly into the environment. Ants are just the opposite. They sculpt the world to meet their needs.\nWatch plants above and below the soil. A reminder that roots growing down are as important as leaves growing up.\nImpermanence  \nIn every moment tunnels and hills morph across an endlessly evolving scene. What it will be can never be known and what it has been will never be repeated. It is an artwork that exists only in the present.\nColor  \nTake control of the lights using a smartphone or tablet. The Ant Space becomes an instrument for the eyes. Orchestrate a show with the touch of a finger. Find intensity in the brightness, evoke a mood with the colors.\nCare\nCare for the life within the Ant Space. A drop of water and a pinch of sugar will nourish the ants for a week. Expect the ants to live for several months at which time there are options regarding what to do next. \nMost simply, the Ant Space may be left to exist in that final form as an attractive art piece and useful light.\nMore ants may be added at any time to continue digging the soil.\nPlants may be given time to establish themselves before adding more ants.\nAdd to the scene with more layers of colored sand and soil.\nThe habitat can be easily taken apart then cleaned for a fresh start. \nDeepDream Background\nGoogle's DeepDream neural network was inspired by the visual cortex. Images it produces are artifacts of a copy of a human brain. \nThe Carina Nebula DeepDream background is an option for every Ant Space. From a distance it looks like a cloudy nebula, up close it is teeming with life.\nAnt-scaping  \nEach Ant Space is an ecosystem. Play with the life inside. The narrow habitat makes the game one of subtle manipulation. Sculpt the scene only from above. Drop in seeds and water, add more ants and colored sand. Intelligently design a complex balance of creatures and plants. The Ant Space will evolve over years as a co-creation between the life within and the hand that placed it there.\nMusings \nClick the image for more musings about ants.\n  Click the image to watch the full eight month time lapse.\n    Click the image to immerse yourself.\n ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jacob Lemanski\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI am an explorer, an engineer and an artist.

Rakowitz and his mother collected and compiled recipes from the Baghdad area. These recipes are turned into dishes which are served by U.S. veterans of the Iraq War from a food truck designed by the artist.  \nThe Enemy Kitchen project began in 2003 in New York City as a way for food to spark dialogue around Iraq in new ways, ultimately taking form as a food truck.\nIn storage since its last food service in 2012, the food truck has been victim to theft, graffiti, and other damage. We want to restore and repair the truck, bring it up to code, and park it on the front plaza of the MCA Chicago, where it will serve free food for the local community during pop-up activations during the exhibition.\nEnemy Kitchen will be a key part of Michael Rakowitz: Backstroke of the West, a major exhibition and the artist\u2019s first U.S. museum survey, which will open at the MCA on September 16, 2017.\nWhy is this Important?\nSharing a meal or a recipe is something that everyone can experience, no matter where they are in the world. Likewise, art has the power to connect people across geography, language, and culture. Bringing these two elements together, Enemy Kitchen will allow people to support, access, and experience a Middle Eastern food culture that was (and is still) disrupted by the Iraq War.\nWhat will your contributions support? \nAs the MCA prepared for Michael Rakowitz: Backstroke of the West, it was clear that Enemy Kitchen was an important part of his art career and had to be a part of the exhibition. But there was a problem. After Enemy Kitchen\u2019s last food service in 2012 the truck was put into storage in the parking lot of Babylon, a restaurant in North Chicago. Despite being locked up, the truck was broken into, stolen from, and vandalized with messages of hate. Mechanically the vehicle would not start, aesthetically it was damaged, and wasn\u2019t up to preparing or serving food\u2014Enemy Kitchen\u2019s situation was dire. \nIf we work together, we can put Enemy Kitchen back on the road, bring it up to city code for working food trucks, and restore it as an artwork. This campaign will also support a full schedule of free community events where the truck will serve Iraqi cuisine to the public, for free.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nBy pairing with Kickstarter, the MCA hopes to reach a larger audience for Michael Rakowitz\u2019s art and ideas\u2014 even if you cannot visit the truck or taste the food created there, you can make a meal using the Enemy Kitchen recipe cards or while wearing the apron and support the dialogue created around some of the most pressing issues our world faces. In this way the MCA is creating a forum for the public to interact with the artwork itself, no matter where they are since preparing and eating the meals is essential to the artwork itself.\nKickstarter Rewards\nAs thanks for supporting the project, Kickstarter backers can receive a variety of rewards connected to Enemy Kitchen. Preview the rewards here; as some rewards are currently being created, not all rewards are shown but we will update as they are produced. \n Saddam Hussein Replica Paperware 5-pack: $15 or more\n Meal Ticket and Museum Admission for One: $25 or more\n \"Backstroke of the West\" Catalog: $35 or more\n \"Bless Your Hands\" Kubba Spoon: $35 or more\nSabreen: Live in Jerusalem LP: $60 or more\n Enemy Kitchen Apron and Recipes: $75 or more\n Chicago-Iraqi Flag: $2,500 or more\n Shopping Trip with Michael Rakowitz: $5,000 or more\nAbout Michael Rakowitz  \nBased in Chicago, Iraqi-American artist Michael Rakowitz (b. 1973) makes work that explores recent contested social, political, and cultural histories. Drawing on personal experiences and research on these subjects, as well as history and popular culture, Rakowitz creates illustrated objects, installations, and performances that invite viewers to contemplate their complicit relationship to the political world around them, recognizing that hospitality and hostility are interlinked.\nAbout the MCA Chicago\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (MCA) is one of Chicago\u2019s major museums and one of the nation\u2019s largest facilities devoted to the art of our time. The MCA is an artist-activated and audience-engaged contemporary art museum. We generate art, ideas, and conversation around the creative process. We are a cultural leader of local necessity and international distinction.\nThis campaign is endorsed by an independent jury selected by Art Basel.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKickstarter community support will be essential in the complete restoration of Enemy Kitchen and a full schedule of free food service events for the community on the MCA Plaza. Without the support of the Kickstarter backers, we will have to pare back the free community events to a bare minimum. \n\nMany of the rewards have been produced already and are currently in Michael Rakowitz's collection, or they can be reproduced easily since they would take the form of a work created in the past.

I myself and the people around me have experienced living with that war in Aleppo first hand.\nWith the photobook \u201eYalla Habibi \u2013 Living with War in Aleppo\u201c I want to give recognition to people in Eastern Aleppo who have continued their everyday lives with resilience and inventiveness amidst perilous circumstances. The pictures from my hometown, taken between 2013 and 2015, capture moments of the conflicting and contrasting experiences and emotions of these people. Anger, joy, grieve, fear, adventurousness, desperation, determination, solidarity, defiance, fatigue, excitement \u2013 having to live with war all of these emotions can change in an instant. The book shows people balancing the horrors of war with a sense of normalcy and trying to retain their dignity.\nThrough your backing I intend to produce a high quality photobook that not only generates empathy but also provokes a reflection on justice, responsibility, and human dignity.\n\u201cYalla Habibi\u201d \u2013 \u201cCome on my dear\u201d as people would say in Arabic!\n    Who am I? And what is my motivation?\n \u201eThe truth is the first victim of war. Hosam Katan refused to believe this, he simply did not accept it \u2013 not for the people in his hometown.\u201c (Frank-Walter Steinmeier, former Foreign Minister of Germany)\n\"Yalla Habibi\" is also part of my own story. Growing up in Aleppo I could never have imagined that one day war would break out in my country. It was when I had just turned 17 in 2011 that I experienced the beginning of the protests against the Assad regime. I saw people with a genuine believe in a Syrian revolution to establish democracy and more freedom in their country. When the regime answered protests with brute force, I decided to pick up my camera. I felt the responsibility to document what was happening around me. I started to work at the newly founded Aleppo Media Center, a network of independent local media activists. As many international news organizations were pulling out of the country for security reasons, I realized the importance to not let the events and people in Aleppo go unseen. Security has also been an issue for my work and in May 2015 I almost ran out of luck. I was shot by a sniper of the regime. After treatment in Turkey, however, I returned to Aleppo and continued my life and work there until the end of 2015.\n  More than 1200 of my photographs have been distributed by the news agency Reuters from 2013. They have been published in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Stern magazine, and numerous other media outlets. With this photobook I want to transcend the fleeting realm of daily news coverage and present a nuanced, multilayered and in-depth view on the conflict.\nI am currently studying photojournalism at Hannover University in Germany to develop my craft as a photographer. I am committed to continue my work as a photojournalist, and I hope I will be able to return to Syria in the future.\nHosam Katan. Aleppo\nWhy is this book important now?\nHasn\u2019t the fighting in Aleppo stopped since the end of 2016?\n\u201cWithout me in power you will have no safety and no life.\u201d The city of Aleppo has been divided between a Western part controlled by the regime and an Eastern part largely controlled by opposition forces between 2012 until the end of 2016. In the Eastern part of Aleppo the Assad regime made its message loud and clear by the means of snipers, incarcerations, torture, artillery shelling, bombings, as well as the deprivation of basic resources like food, medicine, electricity, or education.\nYet, men, women, and children in Eastern Aleppo refused to have their lives stripped away. That is what has impressed me the most. Most of them made the conscious decision to continue living in their home city no matter what the circumstances.\n  \u201cSo called \u201arebels\u2019\u201c, \u201cterrorists\u201c, \u201chuman shields\u201c, \u201cvictims\u201d or \u201ccivilians,\u201d many labels have been applied to people in Eastern Aleppo. But who are the human beings behind these labels? Let\u2019s put faces to these labels. Let\u2019s reveal the human beings behind it. It is true that most people who are portrayed in my photographs do not or rather cannot live in Eastern Aleppo anymore. They have not vanished from the Earth though. They have been displaced from their homes as have many other Syrians.\nThe civil war in Syria demonstrates how the line between what is just and what is unjust is too often determined by those in power. The book, therefore, aims to be a testimony for those who neither possess effective political nor military power but who nonetheless exert incredible strength and do possess agency.\nAlthough the news coverage of the conflict in Syria, and especially from Aleppo, has waned, it is important to keep up the dialogue because the conflict is far from being over. It cannot go unseen. People of Eastern Aleppo cannot go unseen.\n  The photobook & the current status\nWith 152 pages, this high quality photobook will include 85 carefully selected photographs with descriptions in English. For some photos background stories about the people portrayed or about specific living conditions and people\u2019s strategies of dealing with them will be provided. The photographs will be further contextualized by an essay of German war correspondent Carsten Stormer (author of \"Die Schatten des Morgenlandes: Die Gewalt im Nahen Osten und warum wir uns einmischen m\u00fcssen\") and an essay by myself about my life and work in Aleppo.\nMost of \u201cYalla Habibi\u201d has already been rendered into the final layout. I\u2019m happy that I could win the renowned German publishing house Kehrer for my project. If this project reaches its funding goal the book will be off to the printer for proofing, and Kehrer has agreed to publish the book in October 2017. You will, therefore, not have to wait for long to hold a copy of the book in your hands.\nYalla Habibi, book\n  I also feel lucky that the maquette of my photobook has recently been awarded the PX3 Prix de la Photographie Paris 2017 (category: Professional Book, Documentary - Silver).\nBook Details\nformat: 240 x 320 mm (9.5 x 12.6 inch)\nhardcover with printed cover\n152 pages\n85 color photographs\nlanguage: English\nretail price: 40 \u20ac\nessays: Carsten Stormer, Hosam Katan\nIf you have any questions don\u00b4t hesitate to send me a personal message to the following email-address: hosam.abo.fesal@gmail.com\nTo see more of my work you can also refer to my website: www.hosamkatan.com\nWhy crowdfunding?\nIn the last 8 months, I have spent all my energy and money to release this project. Funding the actual production of the photobook (printing, binding, distribution) unfortunately exceeded my budget. That\u00b4s why I need your backing. Your entire funding will go to the production of the photobook.

In order to also materialize my gratitude and appreciation I have crafted reward packages for you containing items and experiences of which some are pictured below. They are designed to, first of all, share the finished book that you have helped to realize as well as single prints of the photographs. Some rewards give you exclusive insights into the development of the project and into my work.\nBut most importantly, I also see this campaign as a way to engage with you. This project is about creating a dialogue about the ongoing conflict in Syria and how people are dealing with it. So let\u2019s keep up the dialogue together! \nDue to the size and the weight of the book and the size of the larger prints I had to add a contribution to the shipping costs for orders from outside of Germany. I have kept this contribution as low as possible while making sure that you will receive your copies and the prints in an impeccable condition. Shipping inside Germany will be free. \n      You need credentials?\nI am very grateful that a large number of photos that will be included in the book have been awarded several prizes, and that I had the opportunity to share and discuss my work at several exhibitions and presentations.\n        Awards\nIan Parry Special Award 2014 & the Ian Parry Award 2015 (category: highly commended)\nannual Andrei Stenin International Press Photo Contest 2015\ngrand price at the IAFOR Documentary Photography Award 2015\nNannen Preis for journalism 2016 (category: special award)\nphotography award at the University of Art and Design in Offenbach 2016\nPX3 Prix de la Photographie Paris 2017 (category: Professional Book, Documentary - Silver & Professional Press, War - Bronze)\nExhibitions (selection)\nIan Parry Exhibition, 2015 (London, England)\n\u201eGuerre en contraste\u201c, 2016 (Aix-en-Provence, France)\nMuseum of Modern Art, 2016 (Frankfurt, Germany)\n\u201eLes enfants d\u2019Alep\u201c, 2016 (Marseille, France)\n\u201eHumans of Syria: Stories of daily life and survival\u201c, 2016 (California, USA)\nOstrava Photo festival, 2017 (Ostrava, Czech Republic)\nPresentations & Workshops (selection)\nAix-Marseille University, 2016 (Aix-en-Provence, France)\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Photography Foundation, 2016 (Frankfurt, Germany)\nInstitute for Interdisciplinary Research on Conflict and Violence, 2017 (Bielefeld, Germany)\nWorld Press Photo Exhibition, 2017 (Willy-Brandt-Haus Berlin, Germany)\nWorkshop on smartphone photography, organized by the German Association for Photography, 2016 (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Photographie e.V., Mannheim, Germany)\nIn the press\n\u201egripping, vivid, personal\u201c (German Missions in the United States)\n\u201eWith his feeling for the right moment, Hosam Katan creates impressive images from the perspective of an immediate observer that go beyond the pure documentation of events.\u201c (Deutsche B\u00f6rse Photography Foundation)\n\u201eHis pictures are oppressive, full of sympathy and devoid of facile voyeurism.

This exhibition is a response to the need for engaging with the multiplicity of difference in order to highlight the fundamental fact that exclusion of ethnic difference is ignorant and a danger to all of us.\nWomen of colour often speak of feeling excluded from the discourse of feminism because western ideals of female emancipation are the ideals placed onto women around the world. The term feminism itself has become bound in these problematics when it should speak for all the varied expressions of female emancipation. The added \u201cs\u201d to feminism, accordingly, symbolises this importance of engaging with pluralities of expression akin to the practice of intersectional feminism. Women are the many, not a monolith and it is the objective of Feminisms to demonstrate this. The exhibition focuses on communication and collaboration. It is our intention to question and to open up ideas difference rather than providing absolute answers, which in the past, have only caused more issues by excluding the lived experience of actual people.\nWe have amazing female artists working in collaboration with us who through varying multidisciplinary ways, some more literal and others more abstractly explore identity formation and articulation, both as women of the 21st century and as women who identify with the Arab & Muslim diasporas.  \nFeminisms x The Arab and Muslim Diaspora will take place with your help between the 24th and 26th of August 2017 at Protein Studios in Shoreditch, London.\nThe exhibition will include a private view on Thursday evening, with free entry for all. Please note: registration is required to ensure we can fit you all in.\nProtein Studios, Shoreditch\nThe show will include film work, photography, sculpture, installation and projections. We will work to ensure all of our backers receive documentation of the event including the opening night and installation shots of the works so that those of you who are unable to attend still get a chance to see what you have supported!\nThe confirmed artists for the exhibition (with more in conversation):\nMa\u00efmouna Guerresi \nOur first confirmed artist for the show explores Islamic faith as a converted Muslim woman through multimedia works exploring the natural and the fantastic with spiritual connotations. \nMa\u00efmouna Guerressi - Montagne Nere\n Yumna Al-Arashi\nYumna, a photographer of Yemeni and Egyptian heritage, who grew up in the U.S explores identity and relationships to faith, displacement and belonging in varying ways, often with strong political undertones. We are extremely excited to have the opportunity to show her latest and first foray into film, Shedding Skin. \nYumna Al-Arashi, Northern Yemen\n  Lilian Nejatpour \nLilly Nejat, is a British Iranian artist who graduated from Goldsmiths last year. Working conceptually she is currently interested in exploring the ways in which the digital feeds into our identities. We have been in conversations about a potential installation that is a response to her own interaction with her faith and technology. \nLilian Nejatpour\nSanaa Hamid\nSanaa Hamid has in the past done a Kickstarter funded project named \"My Body is Not your Battleground\" where she explored the realities of growing up as a young woman in Pakistan. The specifics works we will be using are still being discussed, but all of her works confidently resonate with our intent to explore the personal and how it reflects in the communicative. \nSanaa Hamid, My Body is Not Your Battlefield\n  Maha Alasaker\nWith projects using the hashtag #ResistanceisFemale, Maha's work undoubtedly resonates with our insistence on the fact that resistance can come from women being stereotypically determined as passive. \nMaha Alasaker, Belonging\n                   Furthermore, we are both keen to explore art events away from the gallery circuit, given that this project underlying intentions are socially engaged, it needs to engage with wider audiences.\nIt is however costly to use such a space, and through working with artists from so many corners of the world, the shipping of art works and regular production costs from printing, to framing, and constructing items for installations, all add up very quickly.\n24th August -  Evening Private View including drinks reception\n25th August - A Panel talk which will hopefully be led by the wonderfully articulate Yumna Al-Arashi, along with other artists and thinkers within the field to further the critique we are trying to generate. \n26th August - (Not yet confirmed) Zine making workshop to promote collaborative and non-corporately structured creative processes\n27th August - Ticketed screening of 'Persepolis' at Moth Club's 'Deeper into Movies'. All proceeds will go to a charity related to our cause. \nThis project is very close to our hearts; we have been working on it to explore how we can work collaboratively in visual culture and art to diminish discrimination and stereotyping views of particular identities.\nAs aspirational curators and thinkers within the visual and academic fields, we feel the urgency to organise in a way that moves beyond party politics. \nThe visual realm can prove to be a powerful tool for activism, and we see this project as one that encourages an exploration of difference in dialogue. For us, dialogue is the essential tool for opening up the closed minds that still pervade our supposedly liberal society.\nThe space, Protein Studios in East London's Shoreditch, allows for us to engage with various audiences, from those who typically seek out art events and those who are interested in the cultures we are exploring, to those who usually attend Protein's various pop ups and culturally rich events.\nProtein has a rich history of working with great brands and hosting some incredible events including \"Signed For Syria\" and BBH's \"She Lights Up the Night\". Furthermore Protein's high profile as an innovative creative agency in the centre of London's creative hub make them a great space to be collaborating with, the location means we will gain a footfall that is outside of our projected audience but the space is also has an incredible in its size and scope, allowing us to place a large number of artists together in a group show. \nFurthermore, we are both keen to explore art events away from the gallery circuit, given that this project underlying intentions are socially engaged, it needs to engage with wider audiences.\nIt is however costly to use such a space, and through working with artists from so many corners of the world, the shipping of art works and regular production costs from printing, to framing, and constructing items for installations, all add up very quickly.\nFinancial breakdown:\n\u00a31000 agreed fee for hiring Protein Studios for the three days.\n\u00a3300 production costs for printing posters, exhibition booklets, stickers and leaflets to market the exhibition and to give back to our backers. \n\u00a3200 for organising a catering service which we're hoping is a particular chef focusing on palestinian food to essentuate the act of giving and inviting in.\n\u00a3100 for any installational material to put the exhibition up/electronic material for exhibtion \n\u00a3100 to build and create material for our reading corner to be held during the exhibition to include academia within the exhibition contex\n\u00a3300 to compensate artists for materials, production, as well as travel to the exhibition and panel talk for our London based artists.\nThis is a non-profit project, for the artists and us as curators and therefore all donations through this campaign will go to being able to actualise this and to paying for space and production costs. Because we will not sell any of the art works - to essentialise the importance of the message rather than any profit - our compensation to our amazing artists would come from you allowing us to pay for all production costs that they will encounter.\nGoing above our goal would result in being able to make the exhibition even stronger, compensating our artists more, as well as a potential starter for the next exhibition of the project.\nThey are all doing this for the importance of the cause but it's difficult being an artist and doing things for free and we want to make sure they are not left in a difficult situation.\nPlease feel free to email us any questions/ideas/critique - we are here to open up discussion and contestation and we want to make this the best it can possibly be!\nYour help would be eternally appreciated. We hope this message and the ideas that shaped this exhibition can allow us to move beyond the ways in which our society is moving away from inclusion and equality for all, which should be the fundamental values that determine humanity in our global society.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe actualisation of the exhibition is inevitably challenging in terms of organising the multidisciplinary approaches that this show is working with, for example, the careful way we need to consider the use of sound and images, in a way that invites the audience to think with and communicate with us rather than being passive spectators. This is something we are continuously working with and all the artists' work has been carefully selected to create an almost utopian landscape where all these works meet and despite differing in so many ways complement each other and produce a unique dialogue.\n\nAs with any exhibition or project with a physical event which here is the three-day exhibition, things can happen last minute that complicates things. However, we are surrounded with helpful loving people all passionate about this project and happy to jump in at any point to help us if needed. Additionally, with the support of Protein as a sponsor for the event and with both of us having gallery experience in the past we have a great network of support and individual strength and determination to take on any challenges that may arise.\n\nThe topic we are broaching with this exhibition is a complicated and sensitive one, thus we run the risk of excluding important additions to the dialogue we are trying to generate, however as aspirational curators and theorists we understand the importance of contingency and confliction, our zine which will be produced at the end of the show will be able to raise the concerns that we may find have been left out.\n\nAnother way of approaching the issue of what the exhibition actually communicates and might end up leaving out, is the focus on the continuous process of learning, seeing, communicating and collaborating. We will discuss these questions and many more in a panel talk with some of the artists and other thinkers in order to try and move beyond just the exhibition itself onto a wider context.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Thank you message", "descp": "Your \u00a35 donation will get you a personal thank you email from us, explaining why we think this project is so important and how thankful we are for your support.\nINCLUDES:\nThank you message", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Mimosa flower seeds", "descp": "For backers donating \u00a310 to the project we will arrange to have Mimosa flower seeds sent to you.

I believe community should be at the core of every product.\nWhat I'm really excited about is our future vision to create a supportive social network through features like sending encouragement and positivity.\nCommunity features (Opt-in)\nSend virtual flowers\nTend to your friends gardens\nCommunity Support Gardens (Imagine doing self-care tasks to help a virtual garden grow, but with friends!)\nAlthough it is not on our launch roadmap, if our goals are exceeded it will become a top priority.\nHi buds, I\u2019m Amber and I build online communities people love.\nI\u2019m formerly the founder of Femsplain, creative strategist for Hillary Clinton, Tumblr, and was once the social media manager for Denny\u2019s Diner... but that's another story.\nThis was the happiest, and lowest emotional point of my life.\nWhile working on the campaign, time management took a back-seat to work, and things like remembering to brush my teeth or drink water became really difficult. My emotional and physical wellness hit an all-time-low.\nAfter it ended, I took a few months to find a healthier headspace and receive support from my communities. That\u2019s when I learned the importance of keeping self-care tasks at top of mind.\nI searched the marketplace and came up with nothing but overwhelming habit tools that I inevitably lost the motivation to fulfill. What I needed were tools to reliably \u201ccheck-in\u201d with myself - ones that wouldn\u2019t shame me if I forgot, but encourage me to stay accountable with gentle notifications.\nThe only thing that seemed to be good for me was following people on social media who advocated for self-care, creating a system for myself, and holding myself accountable with reminders.\nEventually I figured if I couldn\u2019t find the perfect tools for me, I would just build them.\nFor development, I've been working with the Lickability team. It's a small iOS software studio in New York. Their team has worked on apps for The New Yorker, Grouper, Meetup, and others.\nIs wellness at work something your company cares about? Aloe can be the perfect companion in many tech forward office environments. Teams can encourage one another to keep their emotional wellbeing at top-of-mind, creating a happier more productive environment to work in.

Here you'll find all the hit trans content you crave: the weird stuff, the stuff that goes to uncomfortable places, the stuff that highlights little-known kinks and contradictions in the trans experience, and most importantly, the stories about trans people having a good, maybe sad time. \nBig talk! But what does it mean in practice? Here's a sampling of the stories in We're Still Here:\nAn evening discussing the terrors of Donald Trump at a Japanese bar for trans men\nA trans woman uses MDMA (with complex results)\nA trans woman visits her grandmother for Christmas (with complex results)\nVisual essay on sex work, trans masculinity, and testosterone \nA practical guide to using paganism to navigate workplace terror \nTrans women pilot giant robots with impeccable synch ratios \nToxic masculinity haunts a friendship between a butch lesbian and trans man \nA devotional essay about angels beyond gender or understanding \nTwo trans women named Sweetness and Lightning blow up a car, watch Akira, and live happily ever after\nIf none of these appeal to you, that's okay: we\u2019ve assembled roughly 300 pages of stories from creators both emerging and established, all of them driven by effective narrative, gorgeous art, and sardonic whimsy.

In the mainstream comics world, one of us in an anthology can too easily stand in for all of us--assuming that there's an effort to include us at all. Our hope is that this book will showcase just how diverse the body of work trans creators are doing actually is (and that it'll make it easier for future books that propose alternate, maybe better takes on what's interesting in trans comics work to exist.) \nYour pledges also help to forward the conversations between artists and their work that we need. I mean really, you guys: being trans can get lonely! And we mine some of those lonely experiences in our work, sometimes in isolation from the cis creators and friends who're working right beside us. This is why having trans friends, for a trans person, is vital. Being connected to the work of fellow creators who're hacking away at the same problems is no less vital: makes life better and proposes new possibilities and solutions all at once.\nLet us get less high-minded, though! If you back this project, we can pay each of the creators involved in this book. This is not negligible! Additionally, for those emerging trans artists we feature here, you're helping to provide needed publication credits and credentials that make it easier to build careers in the editorial gatekeeper-rich comics world. \nAdditionally: once the book is successfully financed and we've made back our production and editorial costs, we intend to donate some of the proceeds from each copy of the book sold to Trans Assistance Project (https://www.transassistance.org/) and Sylvia Rivera Law Project (https://srlp.org/). By helping to finance this book, you make it easier for us to do that effectively. \nWe've got you covered! :D Most of the money we're raising will go to cover the costs of printing the book, and to pay the artists. \nOur base page rate for finished art from contributors, at the present moment, is $25/page. At roughly 300 pages of artwork, that's going to be around $7,500 in artist payments. Obviously this is not nothing! (But it\u2019s short of what we\u2019d like to be able to pay--see the section on stretch goals below.)\nBeyond that, the money will go to covering the costs of printing the book itself, as well as shipping copies of the book to contributors everywhere. Additionally, we\u2019re raising money to pay some of the incidental costs of production (including ISBNs, printers\u2019 proofs, and a book cover.)\nHere\u2019s a full breakdown:\n$7500: Artist fees\n$6000: Printing & drop shipping (~1000 copies, 6\" x 9\" and estimated 304 pages, full-color PB)\n$2000: Shipping + Miscellaneous fees\n$1500: Kickstarter + payment processing fees\nTotal: $17000.\nWe will have more information about this once we've launched--the first priority is to get to $17,000! But at present, the rough expectation is that stretch goals will happen roughly every $2,500 to $3,000 above the initial goal, and each stretch goal will result in the artists' pay rate being increased by about $5/page across the board. This means that most of the stretch goal money will, to the extent that it's possible, go directly to the artists. We'll have more information on this as soon as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe began working on this anthology way back in summer of 2016. We spent most of that year and the early months of 2017 carefully assembling our list of contributors (both from solicitations and from an open call for submissions, to try to get as many creators as possible on board.) As we prepare this Kickstarter text, the bulk of the work on the anthology is underway, with several of the finished pieces already received and others in process, with delivery expected through July and August 2017 and a projected pub date of either very late 2017 or very early 2018. \n\nBoth editors have published professionally for some time, and it's a given--especially with fifty-six artists!--that delays will be inevitable! But we've built expected delays into our editorial and production timelines, and at present we\u2019re on track to meet all of our deadlines for finishing the editorial and production work by early Fall 2017.\n\nIn terms of the risks of the Kickstarter itself: both the editors of We're Still Here have previously published successfully Kickstarted anthologies (ALPHABET from Stacked Deck Press and Nerve Endings: The New Trans Erotic from Instar Books.) Believe me that we are both *very, very aware* of the potential challenges involved with running a successful Kickstarter and fulfilling rewards to all backers!

Pussy Riot, together with the award-winning, London-based theatre company Les Enfants Terribles, is working on a breakthrough immersive theatre project that will open in London this November.\nThis wild theatrical experience will allow the audience to become a participant, experiencing exactly what Pussy Riot went through during our imprisonment - from the original Church performance, to the court trial and prison cells. We're going to recreate Russian courtrooms, a real Russian labour colony, solitary confinement cells, priests who shout about banning abortions and many more absurd, but real-life things that exist in Russia today.\nThe audience will actually get the chance to re-live each one of these experiences themselves, learning what it means to be a political opponent in Russia today. We\u2019ll take you on a journey from the cathedral altar deep into the vaults of the Kremlin itself. Hopefully, this is a journey that you\u2019ll only have to make once in your life.\nWe're hoping that this production will be funded by regular people from around the world who are excited about the idea of political immersive theatre, and we need your help! In order to ensure its launch we need to pre-fund this high-tech production - and fast. All the money raised will be spent on renting the space, the set design, employing actors and staff for the show\u2019s 6-week run and making those rooms in London look exactly like solitary confinement cells in the Russian prison I did my time in.\nThis is an important project that has immense educational value, especially given the trying times in which we are living and an increasingly scary political world order. If we do it right, the production is set to be mind-blowing.\nWe only have four weeks, let\u2019s do this!\nPussy Riot stickers\nThe Connor Brothers print\nThe BEAUTIFUL T-shirt\nREVOLUTION series print by Amanita\nPussy Riot T-Shirt\nRussian Alphabet Colouring Book\n                              Pussy Riot print by Jonas Akerlund\nOriginal Pussy Riot print\nPrint by Amanita (click for more information)\nThe creators of the show from Les Enfants Terribles Theatre Company have this to say about the project:  \n\"Creating an immersive and detailed world is an inherently expensive proposition but something we believe is important in order to truly transport audiences into a realistic environment that fully serves the Pussy Riot story. Now is a perfect time to remind audiences what actually happened and how one\u2019s basic human rights and freedom of expression can be taken away at any point.\"\nLes Enfants Terribles Theatre company are an award-winning London based company known for their innovative productions that vividly bring exciting worlds to audiences all around the world. Their focus on immersive shows brought to us such successful shows as \"Alice's Adventures Underground\", \"Dinner at the Twits\" and \"The Games Afoot\".\nProducer of the show, Alexandrina Markvo, explains the inspiration behind the project as follows: \n\"Our goal is not just to create a breakthrough piece of theatre, but to develop something that can promote the cause of human rights protection, educate people about the problems in Russian legal and judicial processes and give audiences an idea of how fragile our seemingly safe society actually is.\" \nCreative director Alexandrina Markvo founded the London-based company Bird&Carrot, which specialises in theatre, music and visual arts. B&C works on a wide spectrum of artistic projects involving not only world-famous performers, but also those who are just starting out on their creative journeys. What the company values above all is freedom of creative expression. Markvo's previous production credits include Brodsky/Baryshnikov at the Apollo Theatre in 2017, Boris Grebenschikov concerts at the Royal Geographical Society, Zemfira at the V&A in 2008.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re going to be 100% honest. \n\nOur biggest risk is that the show will not happen if we fail to achieve our funding goal. This is a genuine possibility - it\u2019s hard to convince people that they should sponsor theatre - which is why we need as much help as we can get! So please, if you are not able to pledge money towards the project, share this page with your family, friends and instagram followers. \n\nPlease scroll down for a more detailed Q&A, answering questions about costs and the production itself.\n\n**********************************************************************************************\n\n\nQ: Why do you need this amount of money? What is it going to be spent on?\n\nA: In order to make an impact and to powerfully draw the spectator into the action, immersive theatre is usually a very high tech, high cost production. Just take a look at this trailer for Les Enfants Terribles' current show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC70wHBwuWA\n\nFunds will go towards the intricate set design, costumes, necessary licenses, lighting and special effects, virtual reality technology and other technologies used in immersive theatre.\n\nSo that more people get the chance to see and learn from our production we are aiming to secure the show at the venue for a 6-week run. This entails the longer employment of actors, technicians and other staff: employing people at proper rates is very important to us. On top of this, we are renting the space for a longer period of time. \n\nThe more money we can raise, the better and more exciting the production will be! \n\nQ: Why don't you just give the money raised to political NGOs working in Russia? Surely this is a better use of the money?\n\nA: We already run an NGO, Zona Prava http://zonaprava.com/en/ - an advocacy group which is entirely dedicated to raising awareness about the prison system and prisoners in Russian today. We also run our own media organisation, Media Zona, https://zona.media/ . I guess most of you reading this won't have heard of these organisations or the work that they do - and that's the point. We want to educate more people about the harsh realities facing Russians today (as well as other prisoners across the world), realities that given the current world political order could potentially spread to the West itself very soon. Freedom of speech is a luxury \u2014 we need to powerfully and tangibly remind people of that in a way that they are not used to.\n\nQ: What happens if you don't raise the money?\n\nA: If we don't reach our \u00a360,000 goal we won't see a single penny. Backers credit cards will never be charged - this only happens once a campaign is successful. This is why we need you to share this page and encourage your friends and family to pledge some money so that we can see this ambitious, exciting project become a reality. It would be such a great shame if this theatrical collaboration was not realised and we truly believe that people would miss out on a unique and groundbreaking experience. \n\nQ: Will Pussy Riot themselves be performing in the show?\n\nA: Yes, Nadya will be performing in a selection of shows.\n\nQ. Is the production suitable for children?\n\nYes, definitely - however, we would recommend that the production is suitable for children of 11-12 and older. We actively encourage kids to participate. We are hoping to organise school visits and to provide educational packs and brochures. The pack will include details about the most famous cases of prisoner abuse in different countries.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "BITCH!", "descp": "Become an Honorary Bitch!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["184 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "NO RIOT - NO PUSSY", "descp": "Become a part of our Facebook photo campaign.

We have been invited by Burning Man to install on the Playa our sculpture of Xochipilli to celebrate a deep cultural trip in the desert of Nevada this year.  \nWith support we will be able to take this installation for a week to Black Rock City, AUG 27\u2014SEPT 4, where it will become a temple of creativity, radical self expression, plastic arts, visual performances, music and dance. \n  PLAY\n\n 3D-scan and video by Dimensi\u00f3n N\nBased on the 3D-scanned model (by Dimensi\u00f3n N) of the real statue currently housed in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, it was designed and built at KanoShop.mx, LED lights programmed by OOSPP. \nGIF by KanoShop.mx \nBoth inside and outside, the sculpture is designed to give a new spiritual, physical and mental experience. It's our own contemporary interpretation of the cult that the sacred image of the original figure of Xochipilli carries within. \nThis piece has been conceived to become an interactive image of the God that embraces all the artistic expressions as sacred.\nAfter Burning Man we're hoping to present Xochipilli at various events and venues in Mexico and worldwide. Its elaborately processed polygonal white skin will become a canvas for new media artists. \n  mapping by Ze Effect   \nXOCHIPILLI STATUE \nphoto of the Statue of Xochipilli (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City) by @jeremycrandell\nThe original statue is of a single figure seated on a temple-like base, head tilted up, eyes open, jaw tensed, with his mouth half open and his arms opened to the heavens. Both the statue and the base upon which it sits are covered in carvings of sacred and psychoactive organisms including tobacco, mushrooms and various hallucinogenic, inebriating plants, commonly known as \u201cpower plants\u201d (plantas de poder). \ngraphic design by Rodrigo Kano \nXochipilli undoubtedly represents not simply the Prince of Flowers but more specifically the Prince of Inebriating Flowers, including the mushrooms that, in Nahuatl poetry, were called \"flowers that intoxicate\". Known as curative and sacred, these plants were used in shamanic rituals for \u201chealing the soul\u201d and making people \u201cconnect\u201d \u2014 which, we believe, is the main purpose of our artwork.  \nWHO WE ARE  \nlogo by Mocre \nCollaboration is a mode of radical self-expression. Be a part of Xochipeople crew, make your contribution today! \nAny kind of your support will:\n\u25cf Make makers make\u2026 \u25cf Provide more opportunities for interactive art and related events \u25cf Inspire new ideas and actions through art \u25cf Make the experience of Burning Man accessible to more people in Mexico \u25cf Make the experience of Mexican culture accessible to more people all over the world \u25cf Provide a nifty reward in return.\nOUR GIFTS\n\u2018The act of gift giving is one of Burning Man\u2019s ten core principles.
