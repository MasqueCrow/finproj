Hilfinger with music by Joan McMillen\nDirected by Tracy Ward\nWorld Premiere Produced by BootStrap Theater Foundation\nOctober 23 - November 15, 2015              Z Below, San Francisco, CA\nThe powerful and true story of the first climate change refugees in the United States and San Francisco lawyer Luke Cole comes to the stage in this riveting drama from award-winning team Sharmon Hilfinger and Joan McMillen. \nKivalina, Alaska is an Inupiat Eskimo village still practicing the tradition of subsistence living. Today, that tradition and the village itself are threatened by pollution, rising seas and storms due to climate change. Ignored by their own tribal corporation and betrayed by the EPA, the villagers turn to environmental justice lawyer Luke Cole. Deep and unlikely friendships evolve between Luke and the Inupiats as they stand together against greed, corruption, prejudice and pollution in an arctic environment whose transformation may be irreversible. \nHilfinger and McMillen bring their trademark mix of narrative and music to the production. Building on the success of their last two dramatizations of the lives of Georgia O'Keeffe (\"Hanging Georgia roils and twists across the stage like a Texas Lightning storm,\" San Jose Mercury News) and Emily Dickinson (\"surprising theatrical bliss,\" Palo Alto Weekly) the playwright and composer apply the tools they've honed for dramatic biography to the most urgent story of our time: the fight against climate change. Acclaimed director Tracy Ward (The Shaker Chair, Hunter Gatherers) heads up the team of Bay Area notables. The all-Equity cast includes Damon K Sperber, Michael Torres, Lynne Soffer, Cathleen Riddley, Lawrence Radecker, and Gendell Hing-Hernandez. Choreography by Christy Funsch, Musical Direction by Alva Henderson, and Dramaturgy by Brian Thorstenson.   Our top-notch designers are: Giulio Perrone, set; Jim Cave, lighting; Callie Floor and Megan LaFleur, costumes; Devon LaBelle, props.\nWe have recruited some of the most respected theater makers in the Bay Area.Your donations will go directly toward the salaries of our artists.  The play is written, but to come to life it needs actors' hearts and minds, designers' eyes and ears, and a director's guiding hand. For us, nothing is more demanding, nor more rewarding than this collaborative work. In a time when funding for the arts has been drastically cut, whatever level you can pledge toward the care and feeding of our creative team will be most appreciated.\nDonations are tax deductible.

We plan to solve this issue here on Kickstarter and allow all gamers in the world a chance to own an amazing and affordable three dimensional dungeon. Thanks to the expertise of Maki Games with plastic kits, the realistic designs of Manorhouse Workshop will be produced in high quality hard plastic at an affordable price.\n Modular Underground Project is a brand new hard plastic terrain to create three dimensional dungeons for 25-32mm games. Players will be able to quickly create a dungeon for their RPG sessions. It also works perfectly for wargamers seeking battle in different settings, since it can be assembled into a traditional dungeon, an intricate set of sewers channels or a combination of both.\nMiniatures shown for scale purpuse only!\nMiniatures shown for scale purpuse only!\nMiniatures shown for scale purpuse only!\nModular Underground Project is much more than a simple three dimensional dungeon.

For example if a stretch goal gives 2x FREE Dungeon floor the following parts will be added:\n1 OBLIVION STARTER SET: -\n2 OBLIVION STARTER SET: 4x FREE Dungeon floors\n3 OBLIVION STARTER SET: 6x FREE Dungeon floors\n5 OBLIVION STARTER SET: 10x FREE Dungeon floors\n10 OBLIVION STARTER SET: 20x FREE Dungeon floors\nUnpainted pledge levels will receive unpainted freebies while painted pledge levels will receive painted freebies!\n Maki Games has already fulfilled one Kickstarter project and has learned where are the obstacles in the whole chain from design to production and distribution. According to our plans an estimated delivery within 12-13 months after the end of the Kickstarter campaign is an achievable goal.\nThanks to our previous Kickstarter project we have already shipped hundreds of rewards to our backers and have a realistic estimate of the shipping costs to deliver the rewards.\nCUSTOM FEES:\n\nWe will cover the shipping costs to our warehouses and all customs fees for EU, US and Australia.\nBelow you can find a table of rough estimates for shipping the different pledge levels. NOTE: these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nShipping Costs Estimates\nBe aware that all rewards that are confirmed after we officially close the pledge manager will be shipped from the EU warehouse at a later date.\nWe are a small company that was created thanks to the support of our backers. Our strength lies in the quality of our products that is comparable to those of the biggest companies in the market. However to speed up our growth we need to increase our customer base rapidly and Kickstarter is the best tool to achieve this goal. Below are three good reasons for you to support our project:\n1) You will help us to bring the product to market faster!\nWe need your help to pay for the expensive steel molds necessary to create this finely detailed kit in hard plastic. Without Kickstarter it would take several mcuh longer to launch our first product.\n2) You will get new items and freebies!\nA successful Kickstarter will allow us to speed up the production and eventually unlock new items for our terrain. In addition you will get a lot of free items by unlocking our stretch goals, expanding your dungeon and saving money.\n3) You will get the product before everyone else!\nBacking this project you can be the ambassador of our new line of products!

We are prepared to face the issues and to minimize the delays.\n\nThe real challenge is to develop the product in the shortest time possible and to stay within the estimated delivery time.\n\nWe already have the CAD files of all the parts in the main box, but we might unlock new parts if we reach our stretch goals. If many parts are unlocked it might take longer than 1 month to complete the CAD files of additional parts.\n\nWe have already created the first mold to confirm the quality of the details is good enough and that all the parts fit perfectly. \nThis means the optimization process of the mold (the most time consuming task) has already started. \n\nThe Estimated Delivery Date is June 2016 but note that this is an only estimate. Note that this is the Estimated Delivery Date for most of the backers but some backers might receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nRefund Policy:\nWe expect to refund pledges if our Modular Underground Project can't be delivered for an unforeseen reason. However we don't think this is a likely scenario given our past experience.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS:\nOur terrain has not been produced yet and for this reason by pledging to this Kickstarter you acknowledge that the final design, material and content of the rewards might be subject to change.\nAlthough it is very unlikely, the final product may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active. \n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system.

So began the world of \"The Legacy of Jiraiya\".\nI focused on a small story at first, but as I considered newer characters and different agenda's, my world began to grow. I began incorporating in more than just the fantasy world I was inspired by in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Wheel of Time\" series. I began to bring on my studies in Norse Mythology, Greek Mythology, Roman Mythology, Celtic Mythology, Egyptian Mythology and even some religious inspirations from Christianity. \nI have a story to tell. Some of you may think it's clever, others may think it's involved, and a few of you may even see the deep-seeded emotions; but to me the most important thing is that you are surprised. If I can surprise you all, even if it's just once, that would be enough for me.\nThis particular kickstarter is for the Soft-cover exclusively! I'm not looking to over-complicate things on my first go. I want to make sure that you the investors know exactly what it is you are kickstarting. It's the first book in a series. It will be roughly 150 pages long, double sided. I've already written the second book, so if this does well there will be a sequel kickstarted hopefully next year!\nWe live in a world full of bright people with creativity and imagination! Well this is great for us as consumers, it makes those of us who are creating new material have to jump through hoops to find a way to get our ideas seen. I hope that this kickstarter will give me an opportunity to finally get my work out there for the world to see!\nI would like to supply you all with a small blurb from my book. So I am supplying you with the prologue to give you a feel of my writing style;\n                                                    Prologue\nA man stands, alone; four others stand across from him. The room is large, and built with white marble; the columns stand side by side like brothers, each reinforcing the others. A bright light, the brightest of light, shines through the openings, splashing across the man\u2019s face. He\u2019s much younger than the others in the room. He\u2019s tall, and well built. He has long, crisp brown hair. It falls just past his shoulders. He\u2019s wearing a strong, but light armor. A sword is down his right side, and a dagger on his left. He wears a shield on his back. A family crest is upon it, the same as that upon each of the shields of the four men before him. Their shields lain upon the table in front of them, on top of their swords. One of them is much older than the others, he steps forward to speak. \n \u201cThe king is dead! We, his sworn protectors, shall avenge this injustice. If we can no longer protect the king, we will protect his ideologies, practices and all that he stood for. Caedmon, my brother; you are the youngest of we five, and full of all the potential in the world. We know little of the impending danger to this world; its plan is far from revealed to us yet. That will not deter us though. We will stand strong, and find a way no matter the trials, to stop this war, and protect this world. You will go to Jiraiya, he was entrusted with a power that shall not be ignored. His land will fall first, of this I am sure. You will go there now, and you will wait.\u201d \n Caedmon was shocked by this startling news. \u201cFor how long brother?\u201d His brother looked down on Caedmon, who stood as exposed as a baby fawn separated from its mother. \u201cThis task will not take shape overnight, or even in the years to come. This is a plan that will take generations. Our enemy will not be hasty, so neither can we. We must be calm, and fully commit to this path. We will have to make the oath.\u201d One of the other brothers turned to them, focused on the task at hand. \u201cThe Oath! Brother that is something we cannot undo!\u201d The older brother let each word sink in. \u201cI know, but do it we must. To protect this world, we must offer ourselves to it. It is our only choice, the only way to truly protect our fallen king. He will be avenged, of this I am sure.\u201d They all nodded, and then took up their swords. They began to chant aloud, and suddenly men in white cloaks entered the room. They held large staffs, and green smoke billowed from them. They slowly circled the brothers, and the smoke filled their lungs. They chanted louder as one \u201cWe five brothers offer ourselves, in service and in gratitude, for all of eternity, to the cause of our king! Our path was his path, and shall remain the same until his path is clear of all obstacles!\u201d They repeated this over and over again. Then they slowly began to raise their swords. Finally they turned them, and each impaled themselves right through the stomach. \nThey fell to their knees, unable to breathe. And then each hit the ground, their exhales forced through their lungs as they struck the marble floor hard. The cloaked men finished circling the table, and made their way out of the room. The day passed, and the light began to fade as the sun began to set. As the last ray of light left the room, the five brother\u2019s bodies glowed a bright green. The green smoke residing in their bodies reacted, and headed straight to their swords. Suddenly Caedmon sat up in a rush, and inhaled like it was the first time he had ever felt the breathe of life on his lips. The others followed, and they each began to stand. They one by one pulled out their swords, no wounds left behind to treat, no blood to clean. Then they each laid their swords upon the table once more as Caedmon held his to his chest. \nThe eldest brother looked  on Caedmon, before speaking. \u201cMy brother, our commitment to the cause has been sealed. We shall walk this world for as many years are needed, until we have stopped this evil! Our bodies will not age nor wither; our wounds will not bleed or falter us. We will not be beaten so easily. We will use this time to train, and prepare. But you, you must set out on your journey. You will fight the first major battle, and when it ends, you will make the first stand for or against our cause. We cannot hope that we five alone will be enough to win. You will have to find heroes, warriors, armies, and scholars if you are to prepare and win this impending battle for the future of our world. I dismiss you, and will see you at the end. You have our love and respect brother. Good luck.\u201d Caedmon nodded in understanding, how highly his brother spoke sometimes was of no surprise. He had been the one entrusted with the knowledge of ceremonies and oaths. Caedmon had no intention of ever questioning him though, this was his task.

Join a faction, capture castles, and fight for supremacy on the premier battleground of the universe.\nYour world, Your rules\nAs Voxelnauts spread across the universe from Oasis, they craft new planets to be explored and conquered.\nOnce you've terraformed a new planet, it\u2019s up to you to determine the style of gameplay, as well as the items and creatures that inhabit it. You can purchase items, creatures, and even the design of the planet itself from other users at the Galaxy Bazaar, or sell your own. Other players can travel to your planet and experience it in real-time VR. Don\u2019t worry--you can decide whether other players can alter your creations to protect your hard work.\nMaking your visions a reality: Voxels and You!\nYou can design your own furniture, items, and even yourself using the building block of the universe, the High-Definition Voxel. Gather raw materials and use them to alter your appearance and that of everything around you. The Voxelnauts suit is infinitely modifiable, so your armor, clothes, and weapons can all reflect your unique style. The quality of the HD Voxels allows for high-fidelity luxury designs of everything around.\nVoxels are building blocks that allow anyone to \u201cdoodle\u201d 3D modelling, the modern advancement from 2D pixel sprites. They\u2019re easy to use, but provide gorgeous payoff. You can even directly alter 2D pixel art into 3D Voxels to use in the universe using our tools, or integrate your preferred tools like Blender, MagicaVoxel, and more.\nWe know that building a world from scratch can be a daunting task, which is why we are open sourcing Oasis for free to everyone. With a great starting code base we hope developers and modders alike will create amazing experiences for everyone to enjoy.\nHyperion PVP Planet - Stretch Goal\n400k - Fueled by his love of carnage, an Ancient Berserker forged Hyperion for the ultimate Voxelnaut-vs-Voxelnaut experience.

We are nerds.\nJambon with the Team\n*does not include travel/expenses.\n Concept Artwork\n Soundtrack Samples\n The Team\nWe are a core team of nine developers with years of experience in gaming, who have worked on projects such as Starbound, Oculus VR, Firefall, and Guitar Hero. Fusing the knowledge of the virtual property experts we have on board and 50 years of combined experience in gaming, our team is built of talented, dedicated people with the desire to bring a new era into the video game world.\nComing from the background of living and loving games, we set out to make what other sandbox games should have been. We are demolishing every boundary and making a game that transcends genre. Whether your taste is for collecting, combat, or creation, Voxelnauts will satisfy it. But we need your help.\nKickstarter Funding\nVoxelnauts was initially funded by $1M in capital from angel investors.  Most of the primary platform is complete; all screenshots and game footage were recorded live in-game, we have a functional multiplayer server and we are already using our own in-house tools to build content for the metaverse.  A number of team members are currently unpaid and we would like to be able to be able to compensate them for their contributions.  Our Kickstarter goal of $200,000 will be entirely allocated to pay developers and bring interns onto the team.  We are entering the final stretch to launching the Voxelnauts alpha and with your support we can make it happen!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs most of you probably know, game development is never a guaranteed process. There is always some sort of risk involved in this type of project. In fact, statistically only 37% of successfully funded projects deliver a finished product to backers. There is no 100% guarantee that we will be in that 37%. However, we are an experienced team and have shipped many games across many different platforms and collectively have decades of game development (including MMO development) experience. \n\nWe are building a metaverse - which hasn\u2019t been done before at this level. About half our team has made MMOs before, and so we have a good understanding of what to do and we are confident we can succeed. We have a solid plan for how a metaverse can work, however there are always technical hurdles that can get in the way and delay the development process. We are confident that any problems that crop up can be solved with the expertise of our team.\n\nWe have had strong financial backing from dedicated investors throughout the development process, which mitigates the chances that we will run out of money before completing our project, even if unexpected obstacles arise. Moreover, because this is a MMO, if time constraints necessitate removal of some features from the game in order to meet our release date and stay on budget, we would likely be able to include these in a future release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Retro Ronin\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nFounded by industry veterans from Starbound, Oculus VR, Naughty Dog, Id Software, Neversoft, and Red 5 Studios - RetroRonin is a games...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Voxelnauts Demo Update + Salamandria Swag!", "update_content": "Hello Voxelnauts!\nIt\u2019s been awhile, hasn\u2019t it? \nWe\u2019ve been super hard at work one the demo, new website, and store. \nSooo, on to the updates! \nWe just launched a our new website, with tons of new information, pictures, and screenshots from the Graveyard.

Countries stockpiling global thermonuclear warheads have entrusted the nukes to supercomputers. Two such computers, DEEP RED and BLU9000, have both had their launch sequences input. Fearing mutually assured destruction, the computers race to hack one another so they can launch unimpeded and destroy their enemy.\nRESISTOR_ is a fast and intense two-player competitive card game that relies on hidden information and tactical decision-making. Through the manipulation of double-sided cards on the table and in your hand, you create a connected line of your color that goes across the board into your enemy's base to score a point, increasing their DEFCON level. Score four times to push the enemy past DEFCON 4 to successfully launch your nukes without a counterstrike.\nEach turn, you have three different actions to change the state of the board. You must take all three before you can score a point. This means even if you have a connected line at the beginning of your turn, you must figure out how to keep it while still performing the actions.\nBut even when it's not your turn, you must pay attention. When your opponent performs their actions, you will learn more about the cards in play, which is information that can be used when your turn comes around again.\nOn top of that, there is the Resistor card, which can be used to chaotically change the entire face of the board, or to strategically heal yourself while undermining your opponent's plans. Beware, though, because whenever Resistors come into play, the board is going to shrink, speeding up the scoring and intensifying the gameplay.\nWant to watch us play the game?

The heavy duty cleated zip tie system installs quickly to get you and your passengers out of harm\u2019s way. Traditional tire chains are cumbersome to carry and difficult to install.. ZipGripGo is an excellent alternative that is easily stowed under a seat or in the trunk.\nZipGripGo Alternative Traction Aid\nA limited first run and extensive testing has proven the effectiveness of ZipGripGo and Popular Mechanics gave it their Editor\u2019s Choice Award for best new car technology.  With a full patent now secured the team manufactured a small run of version 2, which is now ready through this campaign! \nZipGripGo really is as easy as 1-2-3\nPLAY\n\n FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\nHow durable is  Zip Grip Go?\nIn one word - VERY! After 3 years of extensive research and development, we were able to produce a specially engineered grade material that performs beyond our expectations in both warm and cold climates. We know that actions can speak louder than words, so see just how durable they are here in our research and development video.\n How long does it take to install Zip Grip Go? \nThanks to its unique patented design, Zip Grip Go is not only durable, but light enough to be easily handled by anyone. It takes less than 5 minutes to install, and can easily be installed even after you get stuck, making our product the most unique on the market!\nCan Zip Grip Go be used in forward or reverse direction?\nAbsolutely! We understand that either forward or reverse could be required, so we engineered a product to tackle both situations. It is our special double tiered design that allows for both forward and backward mobility. \nHow many Zip Grip Go's should you install per tire?\nThere is no exact number to install, but we have you covered! It truly depends on your rims and your situation. Some rims accept 5 and others 6. We supply 12 per pack to play it safe! \nWhat size tires will Zip Grip Go\u2019s fit on?\nZip Grip Go was designed to fit on most cars, SUV\u2019s and trucks. The adjustable feature on Zip Grip Go will fit on rims up to 22\u201d. \nAre they reusable? \nOur goal was to develop a product that can easily allow you to use your own vehicles power to get you unstuck and back on your way. This not only avoids the need for costly towing service, but it gets you and your passengers out of harm's way without having to wait for help in a dangerous spot. We tested the product for years and found that after getting unstuck, our test market preferred a quicker method of removal for safety reason versus re usability and for that reason they recommended for a onetime use. That said we continue to appreciate feedback and we hope for great things in future products! \nCan I purchase these outside the United States? \nOur current KickStarter campaign focuses on the United States, but we will be launching to other areas of the world soon. In the meantime please contact us at kickstarter@zipgripgo.com so we can see how we might be able to help.

A fast, fun game of bluffing, deduction, and cute cat pictures!\nUncertainty didn\u2019t kill the cat, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not dead. Dr. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Werner Heisenberg taught us that. We\u2019ve all heard about the cats in boxes experiment and maybe we're even curious about the results -- but attempting such an experiment would be INSANE in real life! Now you can try your hand at challenging the uncertainty principle without risking the lives of innocent kittens or exposure to radioactive particles! Awww!\nIn Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats players run experiments, form hypotheses, and try to one-up each other\u2019s research. Players take on the role of a Cat Physicist such as Albert Felinestein, Sally Prride, or Neil deGrasse Tabby! Using their special ability to help prove their hypothesis, or at least debunk someone else\u2019s, each cat physicist tries to determine the minimum number of alive cats, dead cats, or empty boxes across all the boxes in Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s lab.\nYou may not be certain your hypothesis is valid, but if you love cats, science, and games you will be certain to love the Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats card game!\nCats are a curious lot, Cat Physicists doubly so. Their desire to discover the secrets of the universe overwhelms their shaky catnip-influenced ethics. While Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger is away the cat physicists will play\u2026 in his lab\u2026 with their colleagues.\nCheck out the video play-through below for a detailed description of game play or read the full overview below (including the current rules link and a low-res print and play version you can play right now).\nGame Play Overview\nFor the complete Game Rules < RULES LINK > For a playable low-res, b&w Print and Play < PNP LINK >\nEach Cat Physicist (i.e.Player) is dealt a hand of cards equal to the number of players (i.e.Cat Physicists). Each card in your hand represents a box in Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Experiment. In a game with 6 players, each player is dealt 6 cards, making 36 boxes in the experiment. \nPlayers are each dealt a Cat Physicist character card that they keep secret. It allows them to influence a variable in their experiment which can help to prove their hypothesis. The Cat Physicist cards add an additional layer of strategy, as only you know your special ability and it can only be used once per game.\nOn your turn, you present a hypothesis to the group by stating how many alive cats, dead cats, or empty boxes there are in the lab. If you feel that showing your findings will convince the group of the validity of your hypothesis, you may place any number of cards of the type bid face up for all to see. Meaning that you could show alive cats from your hand if your bid was alive cats, but not if your bid was dead cats or empty boxes. After you present your findings you may exchange the same number of cards as you revealed for new cards from the research deck which will (hopefully) help prove your hypothesis. \nWhen a questionable hypothesis is made the next player may choose to call the theory unfounded. In that case all players reveal their hands and a count is done to discover the truth. If a bid of 17 alive cats was made and there are at least 17 alive cats (including wild cards) then the hypothesis is deemed valid and that player is able to stay in the game. The player that called the hypothesis unfounded is now out of the game. If there were not at least 17 alive cats (including wild cards) then the player that made the 17 alive cat hypothesis would be out and the other player would stay. \nThe next round now has 1 fewer player and 1 fewer card is dealt to each player (now there are 5 players and only 25 cards/boxes). Play continues until only one Cat Physicist is left. Their research, emerging unblemished from the peer review process, is beyond refute and they are declared victorious! \nSchr\u00f6dinger's Cats also has a suggested 2 to 3 player variant in which no player is eliminated at the end of an experiment or round. Instead, the players face off until a certain number of wins or losses are reached determining the ultimate Cat Physicist!\nAs fans of James Stowe\u2019s Sidekick Quests, the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats team was super excited about the chance to work with him. James was really excited to draw pictures of cats in lab coats, and the results are amazing!  One of our primary stretch goals will be adding additional art for the Cat Physicists cards, and James might be more excited to draw them then we are to have art for them!\nThe Cards of Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats\nGet the official Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats UNCERTAIN-TEE SHIRT! \nYou won't know if it's ALIVE or DEAD until you open the box (that comes in the mail).

However she had to put that promising career on hold to meet the rigorous demands of middle school. Chris and Heather O\u2019Neill showed Heather Wilson their fledging theory and after many hours of rigorous play-testing and scientific study, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats as it is known today was born.\nOnce it was clear that \"the Heathers\" really, really wanted to make Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats a reality, discussions were had about how to make that happen. Kickstarter seemed like the natural choice to get the game produced and into the hands of players quickly. 9th Level Games (of which Chris O'Neill is a partner) realized that Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats would be a great fit for expanding their catalog of humorous, universally-accessible games. Plus, 9th Level Games had recently run a successful Kickstarter for their role-playing game KOBOLDS ATE MY BABY! IN COLOR!!!\nThe Artist\nJames Stowe is a full-time illustrator, graphic designer, father of two, and cartoonist living in the Pacific Northwest. He has produced RPG fantasy illustrations for 20 years now with more than 100 published works to his credit.

This meant making ZANO small and lightweight, yet durable enough to take with you anywhere. Intelligent enough so no piloting skills were required, and most of all, pricing ZANO at a point that makes it affordable.\" Reece Crowther, Head of Marketing\nZANO next to an iPhone 5\n\"Right out of the box you can begin capturing and sharing stunning aerial photographs and videos, with absolutely no complex flight training required.\" - Ivan Reedman, Head of Research and Development.\nA plethora of sensors work seamlessly together to allow ZANO to avoid obstacles, hold its position and know exactly where it is in conjunction with your smart device, at all times. \nThis means ZANO operates on a virtual tether connected to your smart device. Allowing for simple gesture control of ZANO. Tilt your phone or tablet left or right, forward or backward and ZANO will follow. (ZANO can also be utilised in \"Free Flight\" mode, using on-screen Joy Sticks). On screen slide bars control rotation and altitude. ZANO will hold its position unless instructed otherwise (In both \"Capture\" mode as well as \"Free Flight\" mode), which allows for maximum control and creative freedom without the burden of piloting ZANO.\nIf ZANO senses it's strayed too far from your smart device or is running low on battery, it will automatically return to your smart device. \nOperating on a virtual tether also enables \"Follow me\" capability in ZANO. Which means once you set ZANO's hold position, it will register the distance it is from your smart device. You can choose for ZANO to hold this position or enable a \"Follow me\" feature, which will instruct ZANO to constantly maintain that distance from your smart device and follow you whilst avoiding any obstacles that may get it in the way during flight. \nZANO's GUI in \"Capture\" Mode\nExample of ZANO's GUI in \"Free Flight\" Mode\n An extended view of ZANO in action!\nRevolutionary Intelligent Flight and Autonomous Operation, complete with Obstacle Avoidance - Don't fly it.

The ZANO SDK will be available upon launch if we reach our \u00a31,000,000 stretch goal.\nThe ZANO SDK will be an incredibly well documented API, that will allow developers to task ZANO in the same way the ZANO app operates. \nA forum will be available to assist developers.\nIvan Reedman began breaking ground on autonomous, intelligent, swarming Nano UAV's in 2010. Starting with a 240mm x 240mm UAV, Ivan and his team of highly skilled engineers and developers at Torquing Group worked tirelessly to continue to reduce the size of this UAV technology, without impacting on its capabilities. Initially targeting the defence, industrial and law enforcement markets, the idea for a consumer version of this Nano UAV technology was first raised in October 2013 at the weekly Torquing Group team meeting. The team felt they were finally ready for the challenge to get this technology out to the consumer and make aerial photography and video capture truly accessible to anyone with a smart device. ZANO was born and the race was on to get this sophisticated technology to market affordably. \nSince then we have been working relentlessly to bring this technology to the consumer market. We first designed the development environments (DEV Boards) in October 2013 (which is essentially all the vital components on one big PCB), so we could test that each of the electronic components would work as expected and meet the strict requirements we knew we had to meet in order to make ZANO possible.  We selected components we knew we could not only eventually fit on a board 65mm x 65mm PCB board (with some skilful PCB layout) but also were readily available and at a low enough cost to meet the tight budget we had for each unit. Once we had selected all the vital components and our DEV boards were ready, we got to writing the firmware, an assortment of digital filters, complex mathematics routines, data fusing algorithms, video handling, obstacle avoidance and signal processing to allow for these components to work seamlessly together to achieve autonomous, intelligent flight. Many a sleepless night went by developing, until we were happy that we had selected all the correct components to bring ZANO to market affordably with all the functionality we wanted it to have.\nEnter March 2014 and we have our first 65mm x 65mm ZANO prototype PCB ready to rumble. Naturally, there were a few minor issues. However, we were encouraged enough with the progress we had made, we decided to commit our resources to going full speed ahead with ZANO. Revisions were made to the PCB and sent back for prototyping and we began conceptualising the user experience and designing the graphics for the GUI.\nJune 2014, and we're finally happy with the PCB layout and that all components are working together in cohesion. We can begin to design the ZANO aesthetic. As a consumer device, Head of Design, Thomas Dietrich (12 years experience in the Royal Air Force) knew ZANO's aesthetic had to ooze sophistication. Yet on a device so small, size and weight are of the absolute essence. How do you make a device look great with such narrow design parameters? Thomas and his team set about for the next 3 months designing ZANO's aesthetic. A sleek, sophisticated shell that fuses functionality with durability. \nWith all the vital components selected and our PCB layout complete. It was now time to find an EMS (electronic manufacturing service) with premium quality manufacturing capability, yet with prices low enough to maintain affordability. As a British company it was important for us to explore all options on our home turf prior to sending the production overseas. October 2014, the search was finally over and we were able to find the EMS partner we were looking for in the UK, to handle the initial production orders.\nSo, November 2014, where are we? \nZANO's aesthetic is complete and we have selected our plastics manufacturing company. \nOur supply chain is 100% ready to go, from vital components that make ZANO fly, to the very boxes that ZANO is packaged in are all priced and sourced!\nOur in house team has begun work on the GUI and the App integration. Over the coming months the team will begin development for Android and iOS, this will continue until March 2015, at which point the App's will be tested rigorously then submitted to Android and iOS App stores for download in May 2015.\nZANO is up and flying, holding position, avoiding obstacles, streaming live video back to a smart device, capturing video and photos. However, with as much capability as we've packed into ZANO, we are continuing to refine the flight, avoidance, video and photo capturing and user interface, plus we have relentless testing and refining procedures prior to us releasing ZANO to the market. We will begin our BETA testing in March 2015. With a view to enter production in May 2015!\nIt's been a long journey, but ZANO is almost here! From everyone here at Team Torquing, we hope you are as excited as us!\n-Reece Crowther\nWe need to get the production volumes up in order to get the price down! It's as simple as that. This first Kickstarter production run will also enable us to iron out any potential issues in manufacturing as well as streamline the process with our EMS for production runs.\n\nThe profits made from the Kickstarter campaign will allow us to hire additional engineers, software developers, app developers, product developers, etc. So we can continue to innovate and deliver fantastic products with even more capability! And yes, we are looking for talented people to join our team! So if you are passionate about producing the world's most advanced UAV technology (amongst other secret projects) and you have a set of skills that you think can contribute, drop us a line hello@flyzano.com!\n\n\nWorking in the Aerospace and Defence Technology sector since 2008, Torquing Group Ltd has built a reputation as one of the most innovative and forward thinking Unmanned Aerial System research and development companies in the world.\nRegularly acknowledged in the defence sector as the primary innovator in bringing autonomy, intelligence and swarming capability to Nano UAVs, Head of Research and Development, Ivan Reedman feels it is now time to bring such innovation to the consumer at an affordable price.\n\"For me, The real joys of creating are being able to share those creations with the world. The experience of opening a product and feeling true innovation is something that once experienced, never leaves you. I got the same feeling when I opened my first iPhone as I did when I opened my very first Casio Calculator watch in 1983. I can only hope that people will feel the same and be inspired when they experience ZANO for the very first time.\"\nWith a wealth of experience in Product Design, Manufacturing, Engineering, Software and Application Development, Torquing Group Ltd is well equipped to deliver ZANO to its Kickstarter backers on time.\n                        ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough innovation and diligent research and development, We are 100% confident in delivering an Autonomous and Intelligent aerial photography and video platform.

We have conservatively estimated a June delivery, however, Our component suppliers often need to order the raw materials to manufacture their components 12 months in advance, as a brand new product, it is difficult for us to estimate initial volumes and provide an accurate forecast to our suppliers. We want everyone to be able to experience ZANO experience, that's why we have not put a cap on the amount of ZANO's we are making available for the Kickstarter campaign. We have built fantastic relationships with our component suppliers who believe in ZANO and our vision to make aerial photography and video accessible to everyone.

It takes a world you think you\u2019ve read about before and turns it into something new and totally different.\nThis is the finest time to be a tabletop roleplayer since the dawn of the industry. With so many great choices on the market, your imagination has nearly infinite paths for which to choose and expand upon. With the recent release of the newest version of Dungeons & Dragons, players are chomping at the bit to exercise their imaginations and spread their ideas wide. With the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting and future sourcebook line, you can do just that. Seventh Crown is a narrative setting and sourcebook that can be used with the rules found within many popular roleplaying game systems.\nCover of Seventh Crown Setting Book\nWelcome to Seventh Crown\nBased initially within the heavily populated continent of Kanis, Seventh Crown is a setting that places the players in the middle of an epic time of change in a world controlled by a select few. What was once a powerful dwarven empire now stands as broken racial kingdoms not defined by borders or territories, but by the ironclad magical control bestowed upon them by the crowns upon their brow.\nIn Seventh Crown, six golden artifacts of unfathomable power \u2013 the Crowns of Leadership \u2013 give almost ultimate and untested influence over those of the same race. While wearing the Crown, they cannot help but be king or queen of their people. This has led to a world of kingdoms that are not defined on maps or in war rooms, but instead by the blood that runs in a people\u2019s veins. Authority enforced by magic across countless miles creates alliances, enemies and conflicts unlike those found anywhere else. When the reason for going to war is as simple as the will of who wears the Crown and the battlefield could be as complex as anywhere its people tread, life is a complex thing.\nThese six Crowns are the most powerful and important pieces of antiquity found anywhere in this world, and are watched and sought after by most of the people in Kanis. The dealings of the Crowns and the choices made by those who wear them are the talk of every town and city, and entire lifetimes have been spent trying to place a Crown on someone\u2019s head \u2013 or remove the head currently wearing one. Territorial governments, the constabulary, organized crime and other local powerhouses rule their corners of civilization for the most part, but everyone feels the pull of the Crown bearers\u2019 schemes and machinations.\nIt is the rumored existence of a seventh Crown of Leadership, the namesake of the game setting itself, which drives some people to scour the world for the mythic artifact. There have been six ruling forces on Kanis for thousands of years, many of which changing hands (heads?) over and over again, but the fact that there have always been six has been a constant for as long as the Crowns have existed. The discovery and donning of a seventh Crown of Leadership would change the world in an instant\u2026 or the discovery that it has already been found, and by what.\nThe continent of Kanis is large and varied in respect to the peoples that inhabit it, the history they have survived, and all of the interactions in between. Depending on the where someone is from, which King or Queen they serve willingly or otherwise, and how they plan to fill their purses or bellies day to day \u2013 that is where adventure will spring from in Seventh Crown.\nThe Surface of Kanis\nWhat is Different?\nAnyone can read through the newest game system and see what each creature, species or deity means to a \u201cnormal\u201d campaign setting. Seventh Crown takes a lot of these standard ideas found in several rulebooks and turns them into brand new ideas that come together to create a new and unique world where players can portray characters like they never have before. There are plotlines and narrative hooks found within Seventh Crown that will put players in unique new roles as well as give them interactions with the world not commonly possible in other settings.\nJust to give a number of good examples, the following are all samples of what makes Seventh Crown unique, interesting and a great deal of fun in which to roleplay.\nThe current King of the Elves is a sadistic dark elf warlock with the long term plan of breeding out the surface elves by forcing hospitality between the Surface World and the Great Beneath. Over the centuries dark elves have become a much more accepted sight on the surface, and travel to the depths of the Great Beneath is more commonplace despite its inherent dangers.\nThe halfling people suffered massive losses during a horrible war that forced their people into nomadic, extended families that travel Kanis in search of joy, profit and adventure. Their stories and culinary crafts are welcomed almost universally in Kanisi civilization.\nIcon of Vimbre Po; Laughing God of Halfling Nomads\nThe dragonborn of Kanis are primarily mercenaries and seafarers, with those of chromatic heritage leaning toward life as sell swords or pirates; metallic dragonborn finding more favor as professional soldiers and trading corsairs. The two sects of dragonborn are constantly at odds, and many conflicts have begun based solely on \u201cscale color.\u201d\nOne corner of the continent is currently dealing with a large scale guerilla war between the goblinoids and the kobolds, putting some local civilizations in strange circumstances for unlikely social situations and alliances.\nThere is a militant sect within the dwarves that harken to the days when their bloodlines ruled the entire continent as a royal Dynasty. These dwarves are old-minded, somewhat racist toward certain peoples, and belligerently aimed at returning the dwarves to former glory.\nThe gnomes of Kanis are willingly subservient to dwarves and have been for thousands of years. Their acceptance of a lower station in life is a key element to a larger meta-mathematical equation that their ancient scholars believe will finalize with the gnomish people ruling the entire world. Effectively, the gnomes believe they have discovered the formula for complete domination of Kanis; it only requires a few more centuries of servitude to come to fruition.\nAnd much, much more!\nSymbol of Foeslen, God of Thieves and Muggers\nWhat will be in the Seventh Crown core book?\nThe Seventh Crown core book, the goal of this Kickstarter, when published will be a hardcover tome of roughly 150 pages written, designed, illustrated and laid out by industry professionals to create a complete sourcebook for the continent of Kanis and the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting. While it will contain some rules information specific to the Seventh Crown setting, it will NOT include a core system of rules. Instead it relies upon the player(s) to use it alongside obviously compatible rules systems.\nThe Seventh Crown Core Setting Book will include:\nA detailed History of the continent of Kanis, its many Cultures and its current Rulers\nA detailed Pantheon of Kanisi deities, including their effect upon Clerics, Paladins and Druids in Seventh Crown\nA detailed look at the Geography and Civilizations of Kanis\nNew Kanisi Backgrounds, Feats and Spells\nFull Color Unique Illustrations throughout\nFull Color Maps of the Kanis surface world and the subterranean Great Beneath\nNarrative Stories set in the world of Seventh Crown (some starring characters from higher-level Backers!)\nPlot Hooks and Adventure Ideas; including two detailed 1st-level Campaign Starters\nA Glossary of Seventh Crown terms to help with pronunciation and explanation\nWhat do you get for your backing?\nAside from being a part of the launch of a great new game setting, hopefully giving it enough fan backing to begin a full Seventh Crown line of sourcebooks and such in the near future, you faithful backers can get some really awesome rewards for helping us get off the ground!\nThe Copper Piece Level \u2013 For just $2 or more you throw in your attentions to the campaign and help keep the Kickstarter \u201cHot Picks\u201d eyes peeled on our little project here.

During these events we will be taking charitable food donations (Canned and sealed-boxed items only) from the players AND bystanders to be given to the local Food Finders Food Bank (http://food-finders.org/) to serve as points of Inspiration to modify the game in progress. The catch is that while the players can donate their food products to play as Inspiration for their own characters during the game, bystanders can donate food products to either help out the Player Characters OR give Inspiration for the rolls made by the DM! No matter who is getting the Inspiration played for them, Food Finders will be the true winners in the event.\nThe Platinum Piece Level \u2013 If you are one of the limited backers at the $100 level, you receive an electronic PDF copy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book, special thanks in the final product, access to Add-ons, all unlocked Stretch Goal Bonus Products, and a printed hardcopy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book signed and personalized by the author and lead artiste.

Should this campaign go well enough to show us a solid fan base in the works, we plan on getting Seventh Crown print runs into common distribution and hopefully into game stores all over the world.\nAdditionally, we have plans to write a series of Seventh Crown setting products that will better flesh out the world, its many plotlines and some major events that take place in the overarching story and expanding world setting.\nSome of the products we have planned are as follows:\nvarious Adventure Modules that cover specific plot arcs important to the Seventh Crown storyline\nBestiary of Kanis Sourcebook; introducing numerous native species of creatures to encounter\nFarsteader\u2019s Atlas Sourcebook; a guide to the lands beyond the primary continent of Kanis\nSeventh Crown novellas surrounding epic events within the world\nEssentially, we want this Kickstarter campaign to go well enough to warrant making Seventh Crown into a larger roleplaying setting capable of launching more products through future Kickstarters and eventually on their own merit. We need your help, support and some good old fashioned word-of-mouth advertising for that to happen!\nAdd-Ons\nThe following are all Add-on products that Seventh Crown backers may purchase using the Campaign Manager Backer Kit.\nSeventh Crown Tee Shirt ($15 and $5 shipping) \u2013 A simple, high quality black tee shirt with the Seventh Crown logo printed upon it.

Space is not only mysterious, but also at times, deadly. And in Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant, the galaxy changes each time you play, making every game a unique experience.\n Expand into new star systems. Build your base of operations on a wide variety of exotic worlds. Employ your Diplomats to make friends, sign treaties and influence alien cultures. Improve local economies by building Factories and Starbases. And defend your hard-earned gains with a Defense Base.\nExploit the weaknesses of your enemies. Improve your ship technology, and send your fleet forth to capture other worlds. Or work in the shadows with Agents, as they sow unrest, sabotage, and steal enemy events.\nWhat is Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant?\nTraveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant places you at the center of one of the most exciting periods in Traveller history. It is the dawn of the Third Age of the Imperium. The dark times of the empire are behind us, and the future is ripe with the promise of rapid expansion, untold adventures, and even danger, on the wild frontiers of the galaxy. But rewards come only to those who are bold enough to seize that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\nTraveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant is a chance to carve out your own piece of the cosmos. You have been tasked by the Emperor to move into a new sector of the galaxy: Use your newly-acquired Imperial Warrant to Explore, to Expand and to Exploit this new area for the glory of the Imperium\u2026and for your own fame and glory.\nWith the approval and support of Traveller creator Marc Miller, Traveller Ascension marks a new series of products set in the Traveller universe. The events in Traveller Ascension all take place during the first several hundred years of the Third Age of the Imperium. It is a time of rapid Imperial expansion, vast exploration, and conflict. All of which makes a terrific background for a variety of tactical and strategic science-fiction adventures, set in a unified, award-winning universe that never runs out of rich, exciting stories to tell.\nWe invite you to help us launch the first of these adventures, the Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant boardgame. By supporting this Kickstarter project, your feedback and support will help us make a better game, one worthy of joining the classic Traveller universe. Best of all, when you play Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant, the decisions you make in the game let you create your own rich, exciting story, as you help determine the fate of the Imperium in this new age. And by getting in right at the beginning of the Traveller Ascension saga, you\u2019ll have the advantage of choosing game options that best fit your style \u2013 many of which are special bonuses or exclusives especially created for our Kickstarter supporters. Thank you.\nImperial Warrant is the first release in the Traveller Ascension series, which is set in the Third Age of the Imperium\n\nDesign Your Own Faction in the Game\nTo accomplish the tasks assigned to you by the Emperor, you lead a Faction, which YOU get to design online. Some Factions have the edge when exploring, others in combat, still others in diplomacy, or movement, or science. There are even Shadow operatives that can get things accomplished\u2026without too many questions being asked.\nThe key is that your unique skills affect play in the Imperial Warrant game and the Traveller Ascension universe. It\u2019s all based on what you choose as your background, especially the Corporation and Noble House from which you come. All have strengths and weaknesses, and each is a challenge to play and to master.\nPLAY\n\nSo, when you receive your copy of Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant, you will have the usual Actions granted to all players, but you will also have additional abilities granted to your particular Faction, based on your skill set. Playing to your strengths and minimizing those of your opponent is the key to mastering the game, and carving out a new sector of space to call your own.\nIf you want to expand your capabilities in the game even further, you can go above and beyond the capabilities of the various Factions by specializing in particular genres and abilities \u2013 all taken from the core Traveller Ascension universe. You might want your Faction to be led by a Master Architect, which gives you a major advantage over your rivals when erecting buildings. Or possibly you enjoy leading fleets of spaceships into battle, as a Fleet Tactician, or running diplomatic circles around your foes.\nWe\u2019ve made these key areas of specialization available in the Special Collector\u2019s Editions. Each of these versions comes with an actual Imperial Warrant, etched with your specific Special Ability. It\u2019s a great way you can affect the outcome of a game, and make the most of your own unique style.\nA wide variety of Special Abilities are available in the Special Collector's Editions\nFor example, Asteroids are a key obstacle in the game. Generally speaking, they slow down movement through the galactic sector, and can even damage your star-faring vessels. But by choosing the Asteroid Miner Special Collector\u2019s Edition, you immediately flip Asteroids from a disadvantage into something that really benefits your Faction: You can move through them and exploit them for economic gain. Not only can advantages like this make the difference in a close game, they really add to the enjoyment and replay value \u2013 especially when your opponent chooses a different area to specialize in.\nWe\u2019ve kept the number of each Special Collector\u2019s Edition category limited, both to reward our Kickstarter supporters, and to have the greatest variety possible in the combinations. So, choose your area of Specialization, and ride your special Imperial Warrant to fame and fortune. The possibilities for replay are endless \u2013 especially since any Special Collector\u2019s Edition will add a gameplay benefit not only for Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant, but also for other games in the Traveller Ascension series.\nPlaying Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant\nIn Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant, you aren\u2019t portraying a character in a role-playing game. Instead, you are the leader of a powerful Faction, with a variety of assets at your disposal. How you utilize those assets to foil your rivals and to achieve your mandate from the Emperor \u2013 to Explore, Expand, and Exploit into a new sector of the galaxy \u2013 is the heart of the game.\nPLAY\n\nTraveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant is a card-driven strategy game. While that may mean different things to different gamers, in the universe of Traveller Ascension, it means that each card in the game may be played either for its Action, or for the Event depicted on the card.\nCards are played for either Actions or Events, depending on the strategy you choose\nDuring this time period in Traveller Ascension, communication is not faster than space travel. So, ships and assets operating on the far reaches of space are much like commanders in the Age of Sail \u2013 it\u2019s hard to manage their every move. So, players must commit cards for each half of the turn, before the Actions and Events actually take place.\nThe particular order that Actions and Events occur depends on Initiative, which varies depending on the relative importance of the Action or Event being played. This means that players must strike a balance between planning their turn, and actually playing cards, which creates a lot of welcome tension and back-and-forth between the players, as each tries to seize the Initiative.\nThe variety of Action cards available, along with the 'Any' card, which can serve as any Action you wish to partake in the game\nThe Actions available are:\nMilitary \u2013 Consolidate Power, Attack Enemy Vessels, Build Defense Bases, etc\nDiplomacy \u2013 Make Friends, use Diplomatic Solutions to get new cards, Build Embassy, etc\nShadow \u2013 Undermine Enemy Power, Create Unrest, Steal Events, etc\nScience \u2013 Explore the galaxy, Map Star Systems, Improve Ship Technology, etc\nEconomic \u2013 Trade, Repair buildings and ships, Build Starport, etc\nMovement \u2013 Move Fleets, get new assets from the Imperium, etc\nPlus the additional bonus Actions that are available to each Faction\nTraveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant contents:\n96 Action and Event cards\n2x Player Factions \u2013 Including the Faction that you design\n(Both complete with Standard and Specific Faction Player Mats)\nOver 100 precision-cut playing pieces and markers\n20 Planet cards, from near-airless rocks to lush environs\nMore than 20 Space Terrain Tiles for you to construct a new sector of the galaxy\nMore than 2 dozen additional map borders, so your galaxy can look its best\n2 Player Action Mats, professionally coated to stand up to repeated play\n20 Mysterious Obelisks\n2 Spaceship tracks, so you can develop your fleet\n1 Turn Track\nTraveller Ascension Rulebook\nTraveller Ascension Playbook\n40 wooden cubes\nTwo 6-sided dice\nOne 8-sided die\nOne 10-sided die\nWhere Your Support Goes\nBy supporting us on Kickstarter, not only do you get your copy of Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant weeks before it\u2019s available to the general public, you also get to take advantage of all the Kickstarter bonuses and exclusives.\nAs we reach each funding level with your support, we will be able to create more assets and devote more art resources to the game. That means more varied star systems to explore, more asteroids, more gas giants, more nebulas \u2013 all to make exploring the galaxy even more of an adventure. We can provide a wider range of planets for you to find, exploit and conquer. We\u2019ll even be able to ship with more Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant scenarios right out of the box.\nOnce higher levels are achieved, we\u2019ll be able to unlock special Kickstarter bonuses and exclusives, such as special Action and Event cards, which will only be available for this Kickstarter campaign. If there is enough support, we\u2019ll even be able to debut some special new units in the game \u2013 which we are really excited about! Thank you for your support.\nOur first unlocked Stretch Goal! Thanks to everyone! Now it's onward and upward to the next Stretch Goal.\nAdditional Support Options\nTraveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant has everything you need for an exciting 2-player challenge \u2013 the standard for a card-driven strategy game. But we found during testing that a lot of folks were asking how it would play with 4 or even 6 players. We are happy to report that it works quite well, thank you. To meet this demand, we are offering expansions in our Add-On section for 3&4 players and 5&6 players, to create as much multiplayer mayhem as you can manage on the edges of the Imperium.\n New Collector's Editions!\nLike us on Facebook!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TravellerAscensionGame", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame design, while certainly fulfilling, is not easy, and it does come with some inherent risk. The design for Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant is the first in a new line of Traveller boardgames. And while Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant is a new design, it does have the advantage of being a part of a well-designed, award-winning Traveller universe. The designer is a seasoned veteran, with published designs in both the video game and boardgame industries. The staff of Daring Play are also experienced in designing, developing, and producing boardgames, and are very passionate about the project.\nMoreover, the games are being manufactured in our own facility in the USA, which gives us the maximum amount of control over the quality of the game\u2019s components. This is critical as we move to fulfill the Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant for those pledging support. \nHowever, if we do have a huge success, those very strengths (internal design and manufacturing) could slow down the delivery of the project. This risk will start becoming evident if our project starts to exceed 3000 backers, at which point, we will have to add extra shifts in our factory. It is possible that the ship date could slip, by as much as 4 to 8 weeks. Alternatively, we may decide to keep the existing ship date to begin fulfillment, and continue shipping overflow product as those are completed \u2013 in which case, we would ship as close to a \u2018first-come, first served basis\u2019 as is practical.\nWe feel that we have done our best to mitigate the inherent risks involved.

Instead, we ran into some difficulties. The additional equipment we ordered, so that we could speed up the manufacturing process, took longer to get in, set up and get going than we had expected. In particular, it took more time than we planned to get everything working smoothly, and to properly scale up our production runs. Fortunately, the component quality when produced was always top notch, so that was a welcome relief."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 401, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/858784112/traveller-ascension-imperial-warrant-boardgame", "project_name": "Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant Boardgame"}}, {"backer": "Marc \"Traveller\" Miller", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "In 1995 Puppetland was a pioneer in the indie RPG movement.

(We're confirming the authors and titles now!)\nIntroduction\nThe skies are dim always since the Maker died. Once the golden lights of Puppettown were the brightest beacons in all of Puppetland but now they gutter under blood-red glass. Once the sun and the moon moved their normal courses through the heavens but now they are fixed in place, the faltering moon above and the cracked and peeling sun somewhere down below. The rise of Punch the Maker-Killer has brought all of nature to a stop, leaving it perpetually winter, perpetually night. Puppets the length and breadth of Puppetland mourn the loss of the Maker and curse the name of Punch \u2014 but not too loudly, lest the nutcrackers hear and come to call with a sharp rap-rap-rapping at the door.\nIllustrators include Raven Mimura.\nPuppetland is a diceless tabletop RPG in which the players take the roles of puppets in a fairy-tale paradise gone bloodily wrong. It's Punch & Judy taken to its logical extreme: Punch has killed the Maker of all puppets and transformed peaceful, magical Puppetland into his personal nightmare realm.\nCreated by John Scott Tynes \u2014 that's me \u2014 Puppetland trailblazed the Indie RPG movement back in 1995 when I first published it on my website. It wasn't just diceless; Puppetland sidestepped most notions of RPG game mechanics and went straight for the jugular of pure collaborative narrativism. It was reprinted in the British games magazine Arcane in 1997 and then expanded and reprinted by James Wallis's game company Hogshead in 1999.\nIt's now been out of print for about a decade. Punch & Judy and the Nutcrackers and Punch's Boys have been moldering, dusty and forgotten, in a shadowy attic.\nIt's time to bring them back to hideous life!\nCover painting by Alejandro Teran.\nA Word From the Creator\nI really love Puppetland. In all the years I worked in tabletop roleplaying games \u2014 founding and running Pagan Publishing and co-creating projects like Delta Green, The Unspeakable Oath, Call of Cthulhu D20, and Unknown Armies \u2014 none of my projects were more personal than this one. The tale of Punch, Judy, the Maker, and their friends and enemies was one I'd been destined for since I was a child, telling my own Punch & Judy stories with the finger puppets my mother patiently made at my request.\nAfter years of obscurity and escalating prices on eBay, Puppetland needs a long-term home. I don't want my freakish baby to go homeless again. It's time to spruce it up, wipe the goo from its cheeks, and send it out into the world \u2014 more beautiful and terrifying than ever. Thanks to Shane Ivey at Arc Dream Publishing and the generosity of Kickstarter gamers, that's exactly what we hope to do.\nInterior color paintings by Samuel Araya.\nWhat is Puppetland?\nPuppetland is a storytelling game with strings in a grim world of make-believe. In a land of puppets created by a benevolent Maker, the usurper puppet known as Punch has murdered the Maker and taken his face. Now Punch rules Puppetland as a violent despot, opposed only by a ragged band of freedom fighters led by Judy, who loved Punch once and now wants to see him fall. And maybe, just maybe, she can bring the Maker back to life.\nPlayers take the roles of puppets in this strange world: finger puppets, hand puppets, marionettes, and shadow puppets. With their limited abilities and boundless enthusiasm, they do their best to survive Punch, his nutcrackers, and his terrible Boys. Helping other puppets, having adventures, and maybe even overthrowing the Maker-Killer \u2014 not bad for a pack of fools in motley.\nWhen I created Puppetland in 1995, the field of experimental roleplaying games was very small. We'd seen Amber Diceless Roleplaying and Jonathan Tweet's Over the Edge and Everway. But Ron Edwards' Sorcerer wasn't out yet, nor was James Wallis's The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen \u2014 let alone the later wave of indie RPGs such as My Life With Master and Dogs in the Vineyard. And Puppetland was and still is very experimental: a diceless RPG that didn't even have a conflict resolution mechanic. I put complete trust in the GM and the players to collaborate in a simple, fun way \u2014 and then I capped playing time to one hour, knowing that this kind of rarefied improv was unlikely to sustain its momentum for very long.\nThe result was electric. Players all over the world began trying Puppetland and discovering they could tell and experience stories in a whole new way. The reviews at RPG.net are a good barometer of how the game was received; even today it's in RPG.net's top 100 roleplaying games of all time.\nPunch has his fun.\nSo What's New?\nFor this new edition I've cleaned up the manuscript and added new material. Puppetland doesn't really need a rules overhaul. Nor does it need to become a 300-page behemoth. But I knew people could use some help in constructing and playing Puppetland stories, so I sought out some of the most dedicated Puppetland GMs and players and asked their advice. Their thoughts and experiences led to new content in this edition to help a group get started, complete with an introductory adventure and specific instructions for creating your own. There's even information on running Puppetland as a LARP, based on a play style invented by one of the GMs I interviewed. I'm grateful to the community of Puppetland gamers for guiding and inspiring this new edition.\nThis new book will be gorgeous. We\u2019re making it a full-color, hardback storybook edition, like a children\u2019s book gone horribly wrong. Samuel Araya will fill it with color paintings, modeled after puppets he\u2019s scuplting just for Puppetland. The original interior artist, Raven Mimura, has agreed to let me use his black-and-white artwork from the 1999 Hogshead edition. Hannah Kennedy will provide wonderful new drawings. And Alajandro Ter\u00e1n has agreed that his beautiful cover painting from the Spanish edition will grace this one as well.\nNew illustrations by Hannah Kennedy.\nGraphic designer Jessica Hopkins will design and lay out the book. She\u2019s done great work with Arc Dream Publishing in books such as Progenitor and the Call of Cthulhu magazine I founded back in 1990, The Unspeakable Oath.\nThis color, hardback edition of Puppetland will be published by Arc Dream Publishing. That means it will be available to stores around the world. But you get the first chance at it.\nPuppetland will be available as an ebook, as a PDF, and as a full-color hardback. Or you can get it in a special edition, with a sculpted urethane resin cover wrap by Ann Koi or even a custom cover hand-bound by Simeon Cogswell.\nCan I Read It Right Now?\nSure! You don't need to listen to me talk about this. The original 1995 version of Puppetland is still available for free on my website and will stay there. Go read it. You can even print a puppet character sheet here. If you like it, come back here. I've added a lot more since then.\nExclusive Rewards\nRESIN COVER WRAP SCULPTED BY ANN KOI. Ann is a veteran sculptor and longtime friend with an eye for the intersection between the beautiful and the grotesque whose work is produced through Catalyst Studios. A few backers can get their copies of Puppetland wrapped in Ann\u2019s custom sculpt of Punch\u2019s mask of flesh and autographed by the author and artists. It's going to be . . . tasty. Reserve one of Ann\u2019s copies by choosing the \u201cNutcracker,\u201d \"Babysitter,\" \"Slapstick\" or \"Sausagemaker\" reward tier.\nHere are some samples of Ann's work.\nCUSTOM BINDING BY SIMEON COGSWELL. Simeon is a graphic designer whose first and greatest love is bookbinding. A few backers can get their copies of Puppetland bound by hand, each a custom work of art by Simeon, and autographed by the author and artists. You\u2019ll help Simeon decide what your book should look and feel like and what elements to include. Bones? Caterpillar stitching? Wood and nails? Metal and leather? Your copy of Puppetland will be totally unique. Reserve one of Simeon\u2019s copies by choosing the \u201cPunch\u2019s Boy or Girl\u201d reward tier. \nHere are some samples of Simeon's work.\nAUTOGRAPHED HOGSHEAD EDITION. A few backers can be mailed an autographed copy of the Hogshead edition of Puppetland. Reserve your copy by choosing the \"Judy's Baby\" reward tier. \nINSPIRE A BLACK-AND-WHITE ILLUSTRATION! A few backers can send their ideas for puppets to feature in Hannah Kennedy\u2019s black-and-white illustrations. You\u2019ll work with Hannah to see your favorite puppet as a part of Puppetland. Reserve a drawing of your own by choosing the \"Constable\" or \"Babysitter\" reward tier.\nINSPIRE A COLOR ILLUSTRATION! A few backers can send their ideas for puppets to feature in Samuel Araya\u2019s color illustrations. You\u2019ll work with Sam to see your favorite puppet as a part of Puppetland. Reserve a painting of your own by choosing the \"Clown\" or \"Slapstick\" reward tier. \nSAMUEL ARAYA\u2019S PUPPET-MODELS. Sam is sculpting puppets by hand as models for his Puppetland paintings. He\u2019s agreed to make a few of those sculpts available for backers! If you reserve one as part of your rewards, Sam will finish and paint the puppet and ship it to you anywhere in the world. These won\u2019t be fully functional puppets since they\u2019re built as models for paintings, but they\u2019ll be wonderful and rare keepsakes that you can hold at the table in Puppetland games. Reserve a model of your own by choosing the \"Crocodile\" or \"Sausagemaker\" reward tier.\nSally Red Buttons, partially sculpted.\nA Final Word\nPuppetland is a strange little beast. It grew directly out of my childhood obsession with puppets in general and Punch & Judy in particular. It's been used to teach kids creative writing at Rutgers Preparatory School, got bought by Hollywood for a G-rated CGI movie that never happened, was translated into French and Spanish, and kept on finding fans long after it disappeared from shelves.\nLet\u2019s bring Puppetland back one last time, in the form it deserves.

Your worst fear is that The Computer will discover that you are one of these enemies. \nParanoia: A light-hearted game of terror, death, bureaucracies, mad scientists, mutants, dangerous weapons, and insane robots, which encourages players to lie, to cheat, and backstab each other at every turn. \nIs that fun?

Let's fix that.\nWith your help we're going to produce a DRM-free ebook of each printed Unshelved collection: Unshelved, What Would Dewey Do?, Library Mascot Cage Match, Book Club, Read Responsibly, Frequently Asked Questions, Reader's Advisory, Large Print, Too Much Information, and Bibliovores. Each will contain all of the content of the original printed book (a total of almost 4000 strips!) with remastered art at Retina resolutions, in both EPUB and PDF formats.\nSample Unshelved Book Club strips\nBut that's not all. If we can sell enough we'll add an ebook of our upcoming eleventh collection and if we sell even more we'll collect all our Unshelved Book Club strips, including hundreds never before published, into a special ebook. And you have our permission to print out these high resolution book recommendations and display them in your library, school, or bookstore.\nJust for fun you'll have the option to get your ebooks on a custom 8GB USB drive shaped like a card catalog drawer. We have a small quantity of signed and numbered \"Early Edition\" drives on hand, which we will ship in November, perfect for holiday gifts. The rest of the drives will likely ship in late December, and may not arrive in time for the holidays (but we'll do our best).\nWe think Unshelved ebooks belong in libraries, so if we can meet our goals we will donate our ebooks to libraries to circulate for free!\n Finally, Gene and I have a lot to say about our work, and if we meet our most optimistic goals we will record a page-by-page audio commentary for each book. Follow along with us as we talk about strips we haven't read in years, recall the true-life stories behind them, and constantly worry that our best work is behind us.\nYou can enhance your order by adding the following items. Simply add the price shown below to the cost of your premium. After the campaign is over we'll confirm the details of your order.

Please stop by the d20E website ay www.d20entertainment.com  or Troll Lord Games for news on the Castles & Crusades  RPG at http://www.trolllord.com\n\"Beyond the River\" is a tale of Juergan of Astode, a knight of some renown. Weary and spent, seeking only the solace of quiet, he's retired to the Barren Wood, upon the banks of the Hruesen River, in the shadow of the Blacktooth Ridge. There he's built his home. and there he lives out his days in meagre comforts.\nBut now, he stands before the Baron Botkin . . . .\n\n\"My niece, Clarrisa, fell into the cold waters of the Hruesen River. The current was swift there, in the river's bend, and it pulled her down stream. It was so fast. Areth went after her, but he never came up. But she did. Clarrisa did. She crawled out of the water on the far side of the river, upon the feet of the Blacktooth Ridge. She called to me, but I could not hear her. I could not hear what she was saying. The water was too loud and my blood was rushing. That's my sister's daughter. She's only nine.\n\n\"We went to get boats, but it took us too long. By the time the fisherman had uncovered their craft and brought them down to the river bank, she was gone.\n\n\"As the light failed we found her trail. She crawled up the bank. This we know. But it was snowing already. Not much. Just enough to cover her trail. We lost her. But there's been no murder of crows, no circle of death, no wolf calling its mates to the feast. She's alive. I know she's alive. \n\n\"Juergan. You know the ridge. You know what dwells there. I charge you, as a knight of New Aenoch and servant of the Empress, to cross the Hruesen River and find my niece. Alive. Failing that. I want vengeance. But alive or dead, whatever took her, dies.\"\n\n\"Beyond the River\" is the title for episode one of d20 Entertainment's live action drama, the first of what we hope are many tales of Juergan of Astode. \n\nWritten by Stephen Chenault, the Troll Lord of Troll Lord Games, author of over 20 RPG supplements and the Codex of Aihrde, and Produced by d20 Entertainment. This is an epic moment in the history of Castles & Crusades and the World of Aihrde. Don't miss out!!! Only two days left!\n\n\nSir Juergan of Blacktooth Ridge was born the fifth son of a knight in the service of the King of Kayomar. As a young man he was farmed out by his father to the Knights of Haven who served many lords. Juergan quickly earned a reputation for his bravery on the battlefield, but more, for his skills with both lance and sword. He proved himself on many occasions and soon other knights wished to serve with him and he rose in the ranks, where he proved an even greater skill through calm deliberation and an iron determination both on the field of battle and off it. \nIn his prime he joined the Crusade called by the young Empress of New Aenoch. She called for all men of worth and courage to come to her land and drive back the vestiges of evil that ever lurked upon her borders. For two and twenty years Juergan served the Empress, as well as the many Dukes and Prelates who ruled under her. It was during one such foray for the Empress, upon the heights of the Blacktooth Ridge that Juergan unearthed a coven of witches. They served the black-hearted Unklar, the Horned God, bound to him by covenants both ancient and new. For many years he struggled with them. Some were slain, others fled, but not until he convinced one of their number, Ingrid, to cast off he Horned God, was he able to destroy the coven. It was perhaps his greatest deed. But it soured him, and he left the Knights of Haven. \nHe retired, with great renown, if little wealth, to a small plot of land near to Ludensheim beneath the shadow of the Blacktooth Ridge. There for years he has enjoyed the comfort of a simple life, but Juergan\u2019s fame carried to the many storied halls of lords and ladies and the powers of one such as he are not easily forgotten. They come to him, more often than not . . . .\nStarring: Rene LaVertu.\nProducer: Ken Whitman \nExecutive Producer: Stephen Chenault\nStudio: d20 Entertainment\n\nSimply increase your backing amount by the amount above.

Pilot)"}}, {"backer": "Marc \"Traveller\" Miller", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Introductions and Stuff\nEdge of Heaven is a d100 based Science Fiction Tabletop RPG adventure game. Set 400 years in the future, you play a character from any of 6 races doing whatever it takes to get by in the Galaxy. Rob banks, smuggle contraband, repel boarding actions. Or. Rescue trapped miners, protect politicians from potential assassination, stop dangerous criminals. Using a brand new system, because we didn't feel like the others we tested for it worked, Edge of Heaven blends simplicity, realism, and fun.\nWell, Hello there!\nWe've got the entirety of two books written, or very nearly so: The Core Rulebook and the Mission Module. The Core Rulebook explains the basics of how to play the game, as most Core Rulebooks do (or Player Handbooks as they're sometimes called). It addresses the core elements of the system (attributes, skills, combat, et cetera), provides useful information to players about the galaxy (sentient races, career options, items, pets, corporations, et cetera), and advises Game Masters on how to build games for Edge of Heaven (game types, session lengths, tips for new game masters, et cetera). The Mission Module provides a quick(ish) story to play through, centered around a bank heist. We've recorded a playtest of the Mission Module. Due to technical issues (read: flaky camera people), we were only able to set up for audio recording. It's ok, I'm sure; you didn't want to see our ugly mugs anyway. You can listen in below:\nWarning: These Audio Clips contain a fair amount of cursing and some mild innuendo. User Discretion is advised.\nPt 1.1: Introductions and Stuff\n Pt 1.2: Special Help and Stuff\n Pt 1.3: The Contract and Stuff\nRules of Engagement and Stuff\nSo, how do you play Edge of Heaven? Well, like most dice-based role-playing games, you play with dice. Like most roleplaying games, you sit around a table (or the floor) and play with a group of friends, each of you pretending to be someone else. The dice necessary for this game are 2d10, collectively referred to as percentile dice (d100 or d%). Every action you take that requires a dice roll, from building your character to gunfights to repairing your ship to Parkour, will require only the d100.\nEverything has a rate of difficulty, what we call a Hit Value (HV). Sometimes this HV is set by the difficulty of a task, other times it is set by the accuracy rating of the weapon in hand, other times it is set by an opposing check. When you roll the d100, if your roll, with all penalties added, meets or exceeds the HV, you succeed. If you roll high enough, you can epically succeed. If you don\u2019t meet or exceed the HV, you fail. If you roll low enough, you can critically fail.\nFeel free to ask about any of the skills or weapons you see in the Character Sheet that is Update #2.\nAs you go through life, often times, if you want to learn how to do something well, you spend hours training at it. If you want to learn to aim and shoot guns well, you spend hours at the shooting range. If you want to learn how to fix cars, you spend hours reading about and working on cars. If you want to learn how to drive a TARDIS, you steal one and spend millennia learning about all of its functions. The same is true in Edge of Heaven. Experience isn\u2019t gained from the mass murder of innocent wizards, kings, wizardkings, and their respective pets, but through training. As you play, you discuss with your GM which skills you\u2019d like to train and for how long, and you treat it as done. You cannot train skills whilst training other skills, or whilst occupied with other tasks. That is to say, if you sleep 8 hours a (telluric) day, you have 16 hours left to do what you need to do. Use your time wisely.\nThe last thing I want to talk about here, to give you an idea of our system, is movement. Every vehicle and every creature, and every race has a movement rating. For creatures and races, this movement rating represents the average walk speed. For vehicles, this movement rating represents the equivalent of an average walk speed, essentially the speed of the vehicle when you\u2019re driving leisurely and not gunning it. For humans, the average walks speed is 8 meters per 6 second round. Technically, it\u2019s 8.333 meters per 6 second round, but we want to make things simple and fun while we keep our grasp on realism, so we drop the decimal. If a Human runs, in Edge of Heaven, they do so at 3 times their walk speed, about 24 meters per 6 second round. It\u2019s not 25, because we dropped the decimal, remember?\nRacial Profiling and Stuff\nSo, enough about humans. I\u2019d like to showcase for you, briefly, the five other Races available for play in Edge of Heaven. C\u2019mon, we\u2019ll do it alphabetically. It\u2019ll be fun.\nCyborgs\nThe Vanguard Robotics Military Grade Cyborg is a labgrown creature made from organic and cybernetic materials. This term does not refer to your cybernetically enhanced humans, as it once did. These are creatures purpose built to serve as soldiers, law enforcement officers, and bouncers, among other similar things, of course. They are made in the likenesses of each other sentient Race, as requisitioned by the contract holder. There are, of course, Cyborgs that are made for other purposes, but Vanguard\u2019s are the only Cyborgs we\u2019ll be dealing with in the Core Rulebook.\nDroga\nThe Droga were re-engineered by Dunni scientists from fossil records on the planet Isis during the initial stages of planning for a Coup D\u2019\u00e9tat against the Matriarchy. The Droga rebelled against the rebels, and the Matriarchy granted them their sovereignty. It\u2019s believed that their original culture died out tens of millennia ago, before ever discovering space flight. Still, these little buggers are cool. They\u2019ve skin that can excrete a potent neurotoxin and change color and texture to match its surroundings. Shown is one of their natural colorations.\nDunni\nThe Dunni are subterranean proto-amphibians with a Matriarchal Empire. Think of them as (Nuclear) Steampunk Salamanders. Aside from the Victorian feel, one of the coolest things about the Dunni for me is their symbiotic relationship with a silicate colony lifeform. It presents in those glowing crystal markings in their skin.\nEdhir\u00e9di\nThe Edhir\u00e9di evolved from the one of the top predators on their planet. You would think that would make them ornery and gruff, but the opposite is true. These decidedly vulpine creatures are playful, intelligent, and kind. They\u2019re also very, very pretty.\nKelesti\nFinally, the Kelesti. Humans have been interacting with the Kelesti for millennia; they just didn\u2019t know it. The Kelesti have influenced every story of divine or semi-divine beings from \u201cHeaven\u201d, especially the stories of Angels. When Humans began to venture outside the solar system, they came upon a Kelesti vessel and, of course, fired upon it. It was largely unharmed and followed the humans all the way back home. Since then, the Kelesti have been helping humans develop in a much more overt way.\nArt Slavery and Stuff\nSo why are we asking for money? Well, writing an RPG is really only half of the work. We've got to put art in it and publish if we want to see it in stores and successful some day. \nWe've commissioned an amazing Artist in Emilyann Cummings. You can see some of the work she's done for the races and the Cover for the Core Rulebook below. As you can see, they're not entirely finished products. This is because we ran out of money to pay her, the poor girl, and she ended up doing this much for free. I was pretty tough on her, too. The budget as listed, $2500 USD, will cover the completion of the work she's done already only. We'll be able to pay her to finish the Races, the Covers of both books, and to start and finish the Twelve Stock Characters we intend to include in the Core Rulebook. Essentially, this fund is to end Artist Slavery here at Edge of Heaven. If we meet that goal and go no further, we'll be publishing out of our own pockets. But at least we'll be publishing.\nCover\n That said, let's move on to our Stretch Goals. \nIf we reach $5k, we'll be able to commission images of the important (and some of the unimportant) NPCs in the Mission Module and in the Skirmish at the back of the Core Rulebook. We'll also be able to commission chapter headers for both books. \nIf we reach $10k, we'll be able to commission all of the items and vehicles we'd like to see depicted in the books, as well as the basics of trim and page numbering. \nIf we reach $15k, we'll be able to commission some basic miniatures. We don't know who we'll be producing miniatures with yet, but we do know the preliminary cost for us appears to be about $5k (plus the $10k from the other stretch goals) with each of the three miniature makers we've looked at. This is to produce the preliminary molds for 12 distinct characters and to produce some of the product for shelves. \nIf we hit $20k, we'll be able to go to GenCon 2015. That would be super cool, no?\nOnce we hit $30k, we'll be able to produce an extra book, called the Tech Manual. This book would give a much larger list of available items and would be organized by Manufacturer. \nAt $50k, we'll be able to produce another extra book. A second Mission Module. This book bears specific significance because it introduces a new race, and because it is the first Mission Module in a slated Campaign Series tentatively entitled \"The Inquisition\". \nBeyond $50k, we've no current stretch goals. We'll see what happens and what we'll be able to come up with in the next month for reaching that goal.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter funding, we'll go through the publishing process. We'll be self publishing through Amazon, which presents a relatively smooth process. \nThe challenges we face here are about how much product we produce and who we send it to. \nChallenges:\n1) How much product do we produce initially? Is there/will there be enough demand to produce, say, 50 copies? If so, how long will it take us to produce and ship those fifty copies?\n2) How do we get our product into the hands of the consumer, aside from through the Amazon Store? How do we generate demand?\n\nSolutions:\n1) Honestly, the best way to deal with this initial question is to wait and see. We'll need to deal with Challenge 2 before we can adequate deal with this. Once we face and rise above challenge 2, we'll be able to produce product in anticipation of consumer demand.\n2) I have already started reaching out to stores. Many of them are intrigued, but cautious. They want to make sure we have a product to give them and a product that will sell before they commit to putting it on their shelves. It's entirely understandable. The hope, and the unspoken understanding, is that the success of the Kickstarter will go a long way towards building their confidences.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Zane Ian Aparicio\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI don't really know what to write here, to be honest.

When you have enough stuff, you can return to the Adventurer's Club, to tell your stories and trade those cards for points.\nThe game will come with roughly 100 cards (still working on the precise count) as well as six player pawns, one pawn for the Professor, a six-sided die, and a rules sheet.\nYou'll need a little strategy to make the most points in the fewest moves, and to manage your risk of running into the Professor! The game handles 2 to 6 players, ages 12 and up, and takes about 60 minutes. You can download the full beta version here. Or watch the how to play video below.\nProfessor Elemental is a \"steampunk-flavoured mad professor,\" a chap-hop artist from Brighton, UK. He's well-known for his lively comedy music and hilarious antics. Take a look at Professor Elemental's website.\nJames Ernest is the president and lead designer at Cheapass Games. He has designed more than 150 published games, including board games, card games, dice games, digital games, and gambling games. His best-known games include Kill Doctor Lucky, Lords of Vegas, and Pirates of the Spanish Main.\nHarold Fay is the artist for Stuff and Nonsense, a Canadian illustrator living in Paris, who draws silly characters for a living. You can check out some of his other work here.\nNote: If this theme sounds familiar, it's because Stuff and Nonsense is a remix of a 2002 Cheapass Game, Captain Park's Imaginary Polar Expedition. The new game has a similar story, but the rules are quite different.\nWhy Use Kickstarter? Printing isn't cheap, so it only makes sense to print a game when you can make a few thousand copies at once. So we're looking to Kickstarter to help raise the money for this minimum size press run. \nThis is our fifth Kickstarter project. Our previous games were Unexploded Cow, Deadwood Studios USA, Get Lucky, and Pairs. If you've backed one of our projects in the past, thanks again for your support.\nWe have three basic reward levels: the Attaboy, the All Aboard, and the Earlybird Special. We also have three larger \"convenience\" levels that contain basic assortments of add-ons, listed below.\nFinal Stretch Goal Update: All levels $5 and above now also include the Professor Elemental bonus track \"Get High!\"\nThe Attaboy is a simple entry level, for people who want to help out, but don't necessarily want a copy of the game. The minimum pledge for this level is $5. We're offering an exclusive print-and-play PDF of the final game that goes out to all our backers at this level and above. Backers at this level and higher are also eligible for all of our add-ons (see below.)\nThe All Aboard is the basic level. For $30 you receive a copy of the game. You also get two Kickstarter-exclusive rewards: a lovely souvenir postcard of Professor Elemental, and a set of 12 exclusive bonus cards.\nThe Earlybird Special is a limited level that is nearly identical to the All Aboard, but costs $10 more, and includes one copy of a limited-edition Blackjack-style card game called Red Baron. This game has never been published before. The goal is to \"shoot down\" the dealer by ending with a total no more than three points below hers. Don't despair if you missed out on this level; we will do an alternate version of this game in 2015.\nConvenience Levels: We have added three \"convenience\" levels with some assortments of add-ons. These levels have the same price as if you added the items individually. We've opened them up to US addresses only, because we didn't want to overcharge for shipping, but International customers can pledge the same amount and add these items through the pledge manager at After the Crowd, which will also calculate the shipping cost.\nThe Game Master level contains just one copy of each of the major games in this list: Stuff and Nonsense, Unexploded Cow, and Give Me the Brain. This level is $80.\nThe Au Courant level contains only those things that are new in this campaign: Stuff and Nonsense, Give Me the Brain, the three new coins (Brain, Cow, and Stuff), the five custom dice, and the set of meeples. This level is $95.\nThe Completist level contains one of everything: Stuff and Nonsense, Give Me the Brain, Unexploded Cow, all six coins, all five dice, the set of meeples, and the Professor Elemental Pairs deck. This level is $145.\nYes, thanks for asking. Having raised more than the minimum for Stuff and Nonsense, we are able to print several other things alongside it. If one of our basic reward levels isn't exactly what you want, you can add extra items to your pledge to create the reward that's perfect for you.\nHere's how that works. For now, just compute the cost of your extra items, and add that amount to your pledge. We will use a pledge manager called After the Crowd, which is the same service we used for Get Lucky. This service will go online about two weeks after the campaign ends. At that point, you can use the pledge manager to tell us what items you want, and you can add more to your pledge at that point if you like.\nUS shipping is included in these add-on prices. After the Crowd will compute shipping costs for International orders, based on destination and weight. If you are concerned about shipping costs, the best way to get a decent estimate is to wait and add your extras through After the Crowd.\nThe Extras:\nStuff and Nonsense: Add another copy of the core game for $25. Note that all copies from this campaign will include the set of Kickstarter-exclusive bonus cards, described above.\nUnexploded Cow: Our first Kickstarter game is up for a reprint, and it is (not coincidentally) in the same size box, and from the same printer, as Stuff and Nonsense. We'll be reprinting this game at the same time (using our own funds, of course), and we thought it made sense to make it available as an add-on, for $25. Read more about Unexploded Cow here.\nGive Me the Brain! One of our oldest and most cherished games will be reprinted in a new edition that happens to have the same size box as Stuff and Nonsense. We unlocked this add-on at $55k, and now you can add it to your pledge for $25. Learn more about Give Me the Brain here. \nProfessor Elemental Pairs Deck: Pairs is a \"New Classic Pub Game\" from our previous Kickstarter campaign. This is the Professor Elemental deck, illustrated by Cheyenne Wright, for $10. Read more about Pairs here.\nMeeples: Our $30k stretch goal, this is a set of seven custom pawns (\"meeples\") for Stuff and Nonsense. They include Professor Elemental, his orangutan butler Geoffrey, his girl Sadie Bell, and a handful of colorful adventurers, all at \"mega\" 19mm scale. These meeples are made by our friends at Meeple Source, and you can add them for $15.\nCoins: We have six collector coins (some from this campaign and some from previous campaigns). They are described in detail in Update #6. Each one can be added for $5, and they are: Stuff and Nonsense, Give Me the Brain, Unexploded Cow, Get Lucky, Pairs, and Fish Cook.\nDice: We're also creating five custom dice, for $2 each, shown below. The game-specific dice will be for Give Me the Brain (pink, with a Brain on the 1), Stuff and Nonsense (bronze, with the Professor on the 1), and Unexploded Cow (black and red, with a cow on the 6). We will also make two dice with the Cheapass logo: one that is black with white numbers, and another that is white with black numbers. The Cheapass Games dice will have the logo on the 1. (This is prototype art, not necessarily final.)\nHow do you add items? You can include an extra amount in your pledge now, or you can do it with the pledge manager after the campaign closes. After the Crowd will handle our surveys and add-ons, and you'll be able to indicate which items you want to add when you go through that process.\nStretch Goals:\nWe've passed most of our stretch goals and unlocked many fun extras. Here's the rundown:\nMeeples: At $30k, we unlocked the set of Stuff and Nonsense meeples described above.\nCoins: At $40k, $45k, and $50k, we unlocked the collector coins for Stuff and Nonsense, Unexploded Cow, and Give Me the Brain.\nBraaaiiinnnns: At $55k, we have raised enough to print a second complete game: Give Me the Brain.\nDice: At $55k we also unlocked five custom 6-sided dice, one for each game (Stuff and Nonsense, Unexploded Cow, and Give Me the Brain), as well as two with the Cheapass logo, as individual add-ons for $2 each.\nBonus Cards to 12: At $65k, we upgraded the bonus pack, from 6 cards to 12 cards. This is a Kickstarter exclusive and comes with each copy of Stuff and Nonsense. \nBrains with your Brains. We've reached $70k, so backers now will receive a little rubber brain with each copy of Give Me the Brain. These are colorful rubber pencil toppers, suitable for gaming or for erasing pencil marks. \n$75k: Imaginary Expedition Travel Stickers. At $75k, we unlocked a set of five 2\" travel stickers for the destinations in Stuff and Nonsense, which will be included with each backer copy of that game. These stickers are shown in Update #8. Just another little thank-you for helping us climb so high!\n$80k: Speaking of climbing high... What a perfect stretch goal to close out the campaign: An exclusive bonus track from Professor Elemental, \"Get High.\" We've just passed this goal with only a few hours to go, so everyone gets this track for free!\nFrom the Professor: \"This track is entitled Get High and was originally recorded for the Giddy Limit Ep. I've always had a soft spot for it and love playing it out at shows with Dj Nick Maxwell where it goes down a storm. It won't be released in full on anything else, so this is your chance to own the track exclusively and use it to show off at parties and social functions.\"\nAbout EU Shipping:\nYes, Professor Elemental hails from Brighton, but Cheapass Games operates out of Seattle, and we print our games in the US. So if you live in the UK (or anywhere else outside the US) you're going to pay International shipping rates. We know these are high. \nWe have done some research on partnering with an EU distributor, but there are no great options. There is no real savings when a distributor acts as an intermediary for direct retail sales from the US, and we are not selling enough copies to print a run in the EU. So shipping directly from the US still seems to be our best option.\nIf you are concerned about the price of international shipping, we completely understand. Stuff and Nonsense, and all the game products in this campaign, will be available in general distribution soon after the backer rewards have shipped, so you might have better luck buying the games when they hit retail stores. Limited items, such as the coins and meeples, will of course be harder to find.\nThanks for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStuff and Nonsense may actually be our most risk-free project to date. \n\nTypically our largest risk is artwork, but this time all the card art is already finished (and the cover art is underway). The game design is finished, we have reasonable quotes for the printing, and we have worked with all of the manufacturing partners before, down to the source for pawns. \n\nStill, delays and errors can occur, and no plan is completely airtight. We'll do our best to deliver a good product on time, but we aren't bashful about moving the deadline if it means an improvement to the final product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Girl Genius: The Works on Kickstarter!", "update_content": "Greetings, explorers! \nWe hope you're still having having fun wandering the mean streets of London.

I serve a great variety of people in my community including children and adults.  Many people who come to see me have food allergies and/or intolerances.  There are so many who walk through my doors and tell me that my place is the \"only place in town they can eat\".  It is moving to watch the faces of little kids when they are able to order their first birthday cake that won't make them sick or pick from 3-4 desserts when they have never been given that option.  Many have cried at my counter as they tell  me of their long struggles with food and illness.\nMy goal is simple: to serve the people in my community by providing the most high quality food and cooking instruction I possibly can.

Author Shannon Appelcline guides you company by company through the history of tabletop starting in the 1970s all the way up to present day. This series is chock full of fascinating insider tidbits, company profiles, and yes\u2014enough drama to fuel a hundred campaigns.\nEvil Hat Productions is incredibly proud to produce this updated edition of Designers & Dragons. You may remember the first edition that came out from the lovely people at Mongoose Publishing\u2014we'd wanted to publish it then, but missed the chance! So we leapt at the opportunity to take it on once their one-volume version went out of print. \nEven if you own the big black book (aka, the first edition), there\u2019s still plenty of new material in this second edition\u2014over 50,000 new words in the first volume alone. Our edition is fully expanded and extensively updated, a multi-volume set that won\u2019t break your back, illustrated with pretty pictures of the games you remember fondly. RPG WIN!

Check out the GeekDad review here.\n\nWhy Are We Kickstarting Designers & Dragons?\nPre-press production on Designers & Dragons: The \u201970s is already complete, and it\u2019s so gorgeous that it got us all riled up. We\u2019re really excited about this project, and we want this first volume to have company. In short, we want to be able to print and release all four volumes at the same time. But...\n... production and printing on each volume costs $10k or more, and the idea of producing all four volumes at once gives our financial people a case of nervous twitches. We want to make this happen responsibly so we can continue to produce the high quality products you\u2019ve come to expect from Evil Hat Productions. \nThis Kickstarter will enable our goal of printing more than just the 1970s volume at the same time. It will help cover the print runs and some of the costs for Volumes 2-4 so that we can do this right\u2014and with full knowledge of how many of you out there are interested! Plus, if we hit our initial funding goal and our first two stretches, we'll be able to release the full set all at once. \nThis Kickstarter gives us an opportunity to spread our excitement in more productive ways than running through the neighborhood whilst festooned with streamers and blaring horns. (And with less of a chance of getting arrested, which is a double win.) If you\u2019re as thrilled as we are about the chance to dig into the history of our hobby, we hope you\u2019ll help spread the word to people who feel the same. Seriously, these books are addictively awesome. They nearly drove us to festooning and horn-tootery, which we think says a lot.\nProject Rewards & Goals\nEach volume in the Designers & Dragons series will be a 6\"x9\" softcover, several hundred pages long, with black and white interior. Each decade's volume of Designers & Dragons covers dozens of companies founded in that decade and follows them through to their end, or the present day for those still with us.\n\nPlease note: Companies are generally listed by their best-known, or at least most-recent, name. So you might see something like Margaret Weis Productions listed above where it was originally known as Sovereign Press, and so on.\n\nDesigners & Dragons: The \u201970s: Immediately available in multiple digital formats to our backers.

When the time comes, we will ask you to fully configure your rewards package over on backerkit.com\u2014a well known third party pledge configuration service. (If using a third-party pledge configuration service is a problem for you, it's probably best to wait and buy our books when they reach distribution.) \nBackerkit will also make it possible for folks to add on additional books in case you forgot to pledge for them while the campaign was active. Bonus!\nWhat Are My International Options?\nShipping kills, friends. Shipping kills. So be ready for that!\nWe've added a number of \"BILL MY SHIPPING LATER\" reward tiers for our international backers. Please make sure to read the relevant section in Update #3 so you can understand exactly how this will work and how high that later shipping charge will be!\nThe books will be made available for sale to the international market once they're in print, so if you'd rather wait, that's totally fine. There are also some other options to consider besides the BILL MY SHIPPING LATER reward tiers.\nIf you want to stay apprised of developments on this project, consider backing us at one of the digital levels\u2014even for $1, a low-cost way to \"subscribe\" to this project's updates. \nAnother good option is to contact a retailer closer to you and arrange for them to order the books you want!

We've produced multiple printed role-playing games in a variety of physical formats over the past six-plus years. This is a non-fiction book series, which is markedly *less* challenging to produce than a RPG book.\n\nEvil Hat's experience puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that arise\u2014as with any project, experience tells us a few problems and bugaboos *will* arise.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nTHE TEXT: While the editing and layout of several volumes is largely done, it's possible that we will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we've got an editor, a proofreader, and a historian going over every sentence in close detail, so we feel we have this under control. \n\nPRINTING: Our company has grown up alongside the big boom in digital short-run printing technology. Thanks to the advances made there, we'll be able to print the book in any quantity we need. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, or simply goofing up the manufacture or shipping of the books in some way. With a number of potential domestic printers to use, we'll always have a back-up we can go to in the event that our first choice printer has to be set aside. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nSHIPPING: Packages get lost. We'll work with you to send replacements. Our shipper may take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFINANCES: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and Fate Core, Evil Hat is\u2014for the game industry\u2014a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already spent thousands on getting Designers & Dragons to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible. We intend to impress you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Print-On-Demand Platinum Appendix Update", "update_content": "Hello!\nThe Platinum Appendix print-on-demand options are getting ready to go live on DriveThruRPG.

(The Bundle ends on July 31, 2014, so seize your chance to get a ton of awesome games.)\nAnd because of that, we're adding bonus content to No Soul Left Behind that we had originally planned for stretch goals. \nIn the book: An appendix full of new powers, aspects, and Devilish Devices from the campaign and from the Arc Dream blog. \nIn the book: Campaign report card handouts to track your supervillains' performance across the school year. \nIn the book: The Fiendish Four, properly laid out and illustrated with commentary.\nNOW SEE WHAT'S NEXT!\nStretch Goal Achieved!\nSTRANGE FATE: Thanks to our backers, we'll produce a downloadable conversion guide to run No Soul Left Behind with the Strange Fate rules from The Kerberos Club (Fate Edition) and Base Raiders!\nUpcoming Stretch Goals\nAT $10,000: TONS OF SCENARIO SEEDS.

You\u2019re a supervillain. As the other player\u2019s demon, you tempt that supervillain with more power in exchange for greater and greater acts of evil. But beware! If you\u2019re TOO evil, your demon can drag you kicking and screaming right to Hell. It\u2019s sort of like the Legion of Doom crossed with the Lucifer-centric parts of Sandman. (And maybe The Exorcist if you're not careful.)\nBetter Angels was published in 2013 after a great Kickstarter campaign. A standalone adventure is available, too, plus a ton of free online resources. \nNow we have the first full-size campaign book for it: No Soul Left Behind.\nEEEEVIL for a Cause\nWritten by Caleb Stokes (No Security), No Soul Left Behind features ten adventures covering an action-packed (and demon-packed) year at a charter school in a troubled neighborhood. The player characters start off as ordinary teachers or students just trying to get by. When things go really wrong for the previous batch of supervillains, these non-villainous normals inherit their demons.\nTime for a thought exercise. Let's say you\u2019re a more-or-less good sort who suddenly has superpowers \u2014 and you have a demon that constantly demands ridiculous acts of crime. What do you do? How about you commit those over-the-top superpowered crimes \u2014 and you try to save the world along the way. Or at least the city. Or maybe just the school. I mean, you do what you can, right? \nNo Soul Left Behind works as a perfect introduction to Better Angels, because it lets you introduce everything to the players at the same time as their characters. And if you\u2019re a Better Angels veteran looking for new adventures and villainy, how do you like the sound of TWO HUNDRED PAGES of new adventures and villainy? Yeah. We like the sound of it, too.\nNo Soul Left Behind is completely written and playtested but it needs cash for art, page design, and printing. We thought about invoking our own patron demon, Capitalos the Endlessly Demanding, for aid, but first we\u2019re turning to you. \nIf we hit our main goal, we\u2019ll produce No Soul Left Behind as a 200-page black-and-white paperback book, loaded with art by Brett Barkley and Kurt Komoda (the illustrators of Better Angels itself).\nBeyond the main goal, we\u2019ll have stretch goals for new chapters in the book covering supervillain powers, devilish devices, printable tools to help with play, bonus characters, and so on.\nAnd if we get enough stretch goals, we go FULL COLOR HARDBACK.\nAnd then we start adding conversion kits for Fate and Wild Talents and Mutants & Masterminds and Savage Worlds and \u2014 and who knows what!\nThe Power of Dice Compels You!\nStill not convinced?\nHow about you listen to ALL of No Soul Left Behind run by the author, Caleb Stokes, in 13 episodes.\nOr listen to the Better Angels scenario \u201cThe Good, the Bad, and the Hunky.\u201d\nOr listen to a Better Angels game run by the author, Greg Stolze.\nOr \u2014 no! You need no further tempting. Capitalos the Endlessly Demanding has already insinuated himself into your heart. Your mind burns to read this book. Your fingers itch to hold it, paperback or hardback. Your eyes ache to see it \u2014 and not just in black and white but in glorious color. These infernal hungers can be sated only by pledging! \nPledge now! And bring your friends, all your fellow gamers, to make certain that there truly is No Soul Left Behind.\nAdd-Ons\nYour base pledge gets you the book and maybe one of the high-end rewards, depending on how much you pledge and which reward you pick. Those are all listed to the right. \nOn top of that, you can add additional money to your pledge to get other books that we\u2019ve done. Because it\u2019s part of the Kickstarter project, it contributes toward hitting the goals. And because it's part of the project, the prices are down sharply.

After the Kickstarter, the main book and bonus settings will be sold separately. It's also your opportunity for specialty dice!\nDid you miss the Kickstarter?

Then choose one personal attribute\u2014Brawn, Grace, Wits, or Will\u2014to be your strength and one to be your weakness. \nNext, declare an occupation\u2014any occupation you can imagine\u2014to serve as your main skill. Then choose up to eight secondary skills from a list of 15 to 20, depending on the setting. \nBusiness card character sheets unlocked! (See the \"Mini Goals\" below.)\nFind Your Focus\nAdd up your number of skills, plus one for occupation, and the total is your Focus number, the only number you\u2019ll need in the game. Characters with just a few skills are very \"Focused,\" which improves their success with those things. Characters with many skills are less \"Focused\" in any, but they have a better \u201cJack of All Trades\u201d chance when trying unknown skills. \nFight It Out\nLayered onto this central set of rules is a fast, tactical combat system that can be played either as pure storytelling or with map and miniatures.\nExplore Countless Worlds\nAs a final layer, you can choose any setting, representing three dozen worlds so far from more than 30 professional authors. (More authors are waiting in the wings, finalizing details with their publishers.) \nEach setting chapter will provide its own skill list, from fantasy magic to starship piloting to ghostly powers, along with any special rules for creatures in that world, as well as an example adventure. \nThe CORE RPG is a great system for one-off adventures, but it also stands up well to campaign play. A draft of the main rules is online at www.corerpg.com, where you can also find my game-design credentials.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe purpose of this Kickstarter is to pay authors of the settings chapters, plus an illustrator and editor, and to fund print copies of the book. The game will also be available in multiple ebook formats. \nThe more stretch goals we reach, the more settings will be included, and we also have some special electronic rewards planned, which will be revealed later. \nSo please, scan the backer levels in the right sidebar, pick something that appeals to you, and spread the word to all your friends. The better our success, the more everyone will receive for their backing. \nAnd if you have any other favorite authors whose worlds you\u2019d like to see included, please point them our way.

This is real-time movement, and the experience only involves the book, the film and yourself.\n\nThe very same special film can be used on all pages in the book.

The internal power-supply and PC board continued to evolve in sophistication and functional capability. \nSecond POWERQUBE MINI Prototype\n3rd prototype\nThe POWERQUBE original was launched via Kickstarter in June 2013, and exceeded it's funding goal.  Based on the feedback from our funders the original product has evolved to what we have brought to you today, the POWERQUBE MINI.\nPOWERQUBE Original and POWERQUBE MINI\nPOWERQUBE MINI Left Side with 3 Smart-Charging USB Ports\nPOWERQUBE MINI Right Side with 125 Volt / 15 AMP AC outlets\nPOWERQUBE MINI Carry Case\nPOWERQUBE MINI Carry Case (Inside View)\nInside Components of POWERQUBE MINI\n3 Prong Detachable Cord\n3 Prong Grounded Detachable Cord Receptacle\nThe POWERQUBE MINI is a revolutionary smart-charging device that can fit into the palm of your hand.  The POWERQUBE MINI is an evolution of the POWERQUBE original, and has been engineered to charge ANY smart device on the market today with our patent pending SP (SmartPower) Technology.  The PQ MINI can charge up to 5 devices at once, via 3 (2.1 AMP) smart USB ports and 2 standard 3-prong AC outlets.\nThe POWERQUBE MINI dimensions are 4 inches (width) X 4 inches (depth) X 1.8 inches (height). \nIn today\u2019s technology driven environment, consumers are using multiple portable electronic devices, often of varying brands. This prompts the need for multiple charging devices of various types, and necessitates tapping into electrical outlets in several different locations within the home or office.  The POWERQUBE MINI solves this dilemma. The product is an innovative solution with novel technology, that allows for the charging of any smart device on the market today.   \nThe sleek design of the POWERQUBE MINI means you don\u2019t have to try to hide it. It is compact enough to fit into the palm of your hand, and can be placed on your desk, nightstand, conference table, kitchen counter, and dorm room desk; anywhere you need power management and USB charging capabilities. At 4\" x 4\" x 1.8\", the PQ MINI can easily fit into your backpack or briefcase. The PQ MINI allows you to charge any three smart devices, including 3 iPads, simultaneously, via any of the three USB ports. With 5 feet of cable and a detachable wall plug, you can easily plug in the PQ MINI behind a desk or piece of furniture, and still put the device directly on your desk, conference table, countertop or nightstand with ease. The charging technology in the PQ MINI is patent pending, and truly is revolutionary to any charging protocol that is available and on the market today. The POWERQUBE MINI SP Technology\u2122 enables each USB port to independently negotiate, \"shake hands\", with each device that plugs into it; allowing for independent charging specific to the device protocol as negotiated and determined by the POWERQUBE MINI; a true smart charger for smart devices.\nOur patent pending SP (Smart Power) Technology\u2122 is a game changer. The POWERQUBE MINI will not \u201cpush\u201d current to the device once it is fully charged. The POWERQUBE MINI USB ports are 2.1 Amps @ 5 volts max each, constant (when asked for by device), and isolated. The AC outlets are 125 Volts/15 Amp.  We have not identified any other device equipped with technology comparable to our SP Technology\u2122, allowing for independent negotiation with each device specific to manufacturer charging specification; other chargers on the market today are not sophisticated enough to have this capability. SP (Smart Power) Technology\u2122 determines the device charging requirements, and also isolates each device from others plugged into the USB ports.   With the POWERQUBE MINI, if you have a faulty device on one of the USB ports (bad phone, shorted charging cord), it will not impact other devices. We have yet to find a device it does not charge, including Chinese mainland brands, and international phones; devices that will not work with most other chargers sold in the U.S. today.\nThe funds from the POWERQUBE MINI will be used for the following:\nEnhance Research and Development efforts; increase efficiency and time to market for pipeline products\nBuild tooling and molds needed to bring the PQ MINI to market\nIncrease manufacturing capabilities\nBuild global distribution platform \nWe have developed a sustainable and long-term relationship with our manufacturer partner Apollo Wire and Cable in Dongguan China.  Apollo is ISO 9001, ISO 9002, and ISO 14001 Certified and is a top-tier manufacturer sought out by many US Companies.  We are fortunate to have a strong relationship with such a strong organization:  www.apolloelectrical.com.cn \nApollo lobby in Dongguan, China\nBoard and Power Supply Manufacturing\nOur fulfillment will be completed in house, as we want to have total control of customer service and delivery of our product.  POWERQUBE MINI rewards will be shipped out of our warehouse in Indianapolis, Indiana; a strategic central location for shipping within the United States.\nWe believe in delivering innovative products that meet true unmet needs in your daily life.  The POWERQUBE MINI was developed out of feedback from the Kickstarter community, and we are thrilled to introduce the revolutionary product to Kickstarter.

Become a Universal Geologic Explorer and discover or invent new things; or explore new places around the universe no one has ever seen before.  \nSimply select a pledge level to the right to support our project, and continue reading to learn more about the game!\n Introduction to the story line\u2026.. In 2040, after more than 10 years of exploration and research on Mars, an accident resulted in a significant discovery that forever changed life as we knew it. A research scientist was collecting samples of an unknown substance when the unsealed collection tube slipped from her glove and fell to the dusty surface of the planet. A small cloud of dust puffed around the tube as it hit the ground and suddenly vanished just before the scientist was able to reach it. Amazed and uncertain of what had just occurred, she searched the ground all around her as if she simply lost site of where the tube fell and was mistaken about what she knew in her heart she had seen.\nLater, it would be discovered that the combination of the unknown substance in the collection tube and just the right amount of protactinium contained within the fine dust particles produced a rapid and violent reaction. The Scientist had found the \u201cnew gold\u201d they had been searching for since the beginning of the new millennium. Reminiscent of the American gold rush of 1848, galactic pioneers clamored for an opportunity to strike out in search of new substances of value.\nThe game is played within the futuristic setting of Earth year 2045. While trying to understand the discovery and what occurred in that instant, scientists unlocked the key to space travel. In the years between the discovery in 2040 and the in-game present day in the year 2045, top scientists and engineers from around the world worked feverishly to understand the new things they were learning and develop new ways to exploit them and advance our way of life. A few of the significant developments during this short period of time resulted in the discovery of a new, completely unknown planet now called Aznon; and the ability to send space vehicles there full of supplies and people. These new capabilities opened the door to what is being referred to as the \u201cAznonium Rush\u201d, to which players will join in search of adventure, fame and fortune!\nPlayers will play a single specific character (themselves) within a broader, futuristic, science fiction storyline derived from a Christian worldview without all of the language and excessive violence of other games so younger children can explore and begin building the life skills required to be successful in tomorrows digital age. The storyline will drive the scenarios you respond to within the game. Play independently and build your own entrepreneurial empire or build a team and achieve your goals together!  You can become a Geologic Explorer, or work towards becoming a business owner in manufacturing or retail sales. \n\u2022 The game will have a rich and imaginative setting with beautifully unique features, never seen before environments that will make you want to play the game just to wander through them.\n\u2022 Excavate your contracted grid of land searching for substances, minerals, metals and precious gems of value. Discover something previously unknown and increase your wealth and character value. In your efforts, you may discover an underground system of caves, caverns, or who knows what! Stake a claim on it and reap the benefits of the discovery by exploring it yourself, contract someone else to explore it and earn a portion of the profits, or sell the claim to get a guaranteed profit. If exploring yourself be careful!! You never know what you might run into. New substances can be volatile and we don\u2019t yet know if there is any life on this planet\u2026.that\u2019s part of the risk involved and why there is so much potential reward for those daring enough to take part in the adventure. \n\u2022 Explore un-excavatable regions, passes, peaks, caves, caverns, lava tubes and more that may lead to unexpected, but fantastic results.\n\u2022 Take the leap into management and earn a percentage of the discoveries other explorers make when they contract with you, but make sure you manage the business well or your profits will dry up! You can still do your own exploring in addition to managing other explorers contracted through your exploration company.\n\u2022 Risk it all and launch your own corporation! You\u2019ll earn a percentage of the profits made by the work done through all of your franchises. Make sure you hire the right franchise owners, or it may not matter how well you manage the corporation!\n\u2022 Once the land is completely explored and graded back to code, the owner may gain authorization (by the Universe Governing Council) to use the land for another business opportunity, lease it, or sell it to someone else. Buy the property from the owner and develop it to add diversification to your investment empire!\n\u2022 Players will build a knowledge database that may help them during game play, or they may reference and use it to improve their character skills and experience. Knowledge is added to your database throughout the game during each new experience, interaction with another knowledgeable character or by acquiring fully collectable and numbered character profile cards and unlocking various levels of skill, experience and/or knowledge that profile contains.\n\u2022 Enhance your own character profile and improve your character value points by designing and submitting your own creation in the innovation lab. If approved by the Universe Governing Council, you can earn royalties on every sale and/or use of your creation by licensing or selling rights to your patent \u2013 or, open your own business selling your very own creation.\n\u2022 Sell licenses to the use of your own character profile and earn royalties as other players benefit from your knowledge and experience.\n\u2022 Enlist the assistance of others, either real players or invest in a Nanoid. Load a character or equipment profile key and profile into the Nano-cortex of the Nanoid to activate and benefit from its assistance. Bots will be available at different levels of capability to help you achieve your goals!\n\u2022 Successful players will balance the choices they make within the game to maximize their value and health meters. These meters will affect how much energy they expend to achieve their objectives as they explore, discover and grow their empire! Your strategy and your choices will determine your game experience.\n\u2022 Achieve greater levels of success and rewards; unlock new worlds as players achieve new levels of experience, skill and success. The game will evolve with the desires of the players!\nTo combine all of these pieces successfully, I\u2019ll need time to do some pre-production planning with the team. During this first phase, we\u2019ll incorporate all of our new character profiles (from the Backer rewards) into the broader storyline and make sure there are no awkward incorporations to the story. The target is to complete this phase in the first 3 to 4 months.\nPhase 2 \u2013 we\u2019ll strap ourselves in for a 6 to 8 month development cycle with targeted completion by summer 2015! During this time we\u2019ll be heavy into development and provide our backers with sneak-peaks of the private-closed beta version of the game and collect feedback on what you like and don\u2019t like \u2013 so you influence the final result of the game! In addition, we\u2019ll be giving updates and showing you our progress along the way.\nThe final production version will utilize a client game server model, keeping the local processor as free as possible to handle richer graphics and more interaction with other players. It will be optimized for tablet devices running iOS and Android platforms initially.\nTo really do this right and deliver a full-featured, top-notch gaming experience, we need to raise $800,000. That\u2019s a lot of money, but if everyone does something, we\u2019ll be able to reach and exceed this goal! Exceeding the target goal will allow us to shorten our delivery date, expand to more platforms, add more intricate detail, more exploratory quests, more environments, more characters, more complexity to the storyline, more uniqueness to individual game play, build more worlds, and increase interactivity between players.\n $1 Million: Move up the delivery date!! We can add team members and complete the work faster with an estimated delivery date in spring 2015 instead of summer!    \n$1.25 Million: More interactivity between players!  We'll take players ability to interact directly with each other and work together to achieve goals to the next level!  \n$1.50 Million: More uniqueness to individual game play! We will expand the player's ability to utilize their knowledge database and enhance their skills and strategic advantage over other players with lesser knowledge and/or experience.\n$1.75 Million: More unique environments with more intricate detail and more exploratory quests that add challenge and adventure (fame! fortune!) to the gaming experience!\n $2.00 Million: More characters and more complexity to the storyline.

Of the officers and men in both the squadrons that faced each other in these stormy seas far from home, nine of ten were doomed to perish.\u201d\n-- Winston Churchill\nThis autumn marks the centennial of The Great War. Among the most dramatic sagas in a dramatic season was that of the German East Asia Squadron under Rear Adm. Maximillian Graf von Spee. Stranded by the sudden outbreak of war on the other side of the world, Spee\u2019s squadron evaded enemy forces for months. Dispatched the raider Emden to harry British trade in the Indian Ocean and then handed the Royal Navy its first defeat in battle in 99 years off the shore of Chile near Cape Coronel. That devastating defeat sent two British armored cruisers to the depths with their entire crews at trifling cost to Spee\u2019s squadron.\nThe stunning defeat provoked the British into sending two of their new battlecruisers thousands of miles from the European theater to search for and destroy Spee\u2019s squadron. Spee and the British squadron met at The Falklands just five weeks after Coronel. This time it was Spee\u2019s squadron which was annihilated.\nFor a hundred years historians and naval officers have debated Spee\u2019s choices and those of his opponents and speculated about what might have been. Fatal Choices looks at the course of the actual campaign and considers how it might have played out differently. But more than that, Fatal Choices applies the discipline of authentic naval wargames to evaluate those what-ifs under realistic constraints. And it provides the reader with the tools to see for himself how the battles may have played out.\nBy special arrangement with noted author and wargame designer Larry Bond, Fatal Choices contains an extract of Bond\u2019s superbly authentic and comprehensive Fear God & Dread Nought naval wargaming rules providing the reader with all the rules, ship forms and tables needed to refight the historical battles and several credible what-ifs. See ForYourself scenarios examine historical battles such as Coronel and the Cocos Islands, as well as possible alternative fights such as Spee running into the Australian battlecruiser HMAS Australia or the old battleship HMS Canopus. Other scenarios examine what might have happened if the modern armored cruiser HMS Defense had joined the British squadron in time for Coronel or if Spee had a ventured to attack the British ships while they were coaling in Stanley Harbor instead of attempting to flee.\nFatal Choices also includes another entire set of rules, an extract of Minden Game\u2019s NavTac fast-play naval wargaming rules for those readers who are new to naval wargaming or pressed for time.\nThe Kickstarter edition of Fatal Choices also includes a special set of laser-cut ship counters including all the ships mentioned in the scenarios as well as play aids.\nHow KickStarter Works: If we don't make our goal by our deadline, your credit card doesn't get charged and we get zip, zilch, nada!\nSo: If you want to help Fatal Choices get published, please support us today!\nThanks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are few risks aside from the kinds of delays that life can unexpectedly present.
