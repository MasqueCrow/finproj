Bond with them, keep them happy, and they'll love you in return.\n Meet Villagers and build lasting relationships. Some may even become party members that fight by your side.\n Explore the magical world of Emora. Throughout your journey you'll encounter giant mushroom caverns, enchanted woods, the nightmarish realm of a sleeping god and more.\n Cast powerful spells. Summon your own skelly minion to fight with you or protect yourself with an ethereal magic armor.\n Decorate and upgrade your home. Place items like chests for storing your loot, a kettle for cooking, or just a nice rug to spruce the place up a bit.\n A tyrannical god once ruled over It\u2019s creation in a reign of fear and oppression. One day the people rebelled and a group of mages banded together to seal It away. Although the scars from this era are still fresh, the people have started to move on and are finally beginning to prosper in a new age.\nBut It has begun to stir in Its sleep, and the veil between this world and an all too familiar nightmare is shredding into pieces as the Demon God's dream blends into reality.\nZoe and the Cursed Dreamer already has a reputation for lovable quirky characters. Here are just a few of the more important ones so far.\n Teddy: The lovable butcher with a secret. He was relentlessly bullied as a child for his love of baking, and became the town\u2019s butcher so that he would be seen as manly. He hates his job and aspires to be the town\u2019s baker, but he does his cooking in secret. You can help make his dream come true.\n Claire: Your childhood best friend. You haven\u2019t seen her since you left the village many years ago, but she still has fond memories of the time spent together with you. She was an orphaned child, never knowing who her parents were. She has adopted a young girl that recently lost her parents, ensuring she is well loved and safe.\n Sue: The village blacksmith and Teddy\u2019s older sister. She\u2019s a strong woman that carries her massive hammer everywhere she goes. Despite her size though, she\u2019s a soft-spoken introvert with a heart of gold.\n Mad Catter: A mysterious and whimsical cat. Not much is known about this curious creature other than he\u2019s very old and extremely powerful. He loves taking naps, subtle humor, and 6th wall breaks.\nZoe and the Cursed Dreamer is about experiencing a world and being immersed in it. Throughout your journey, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy relaxing optional tasks that enhance your gameplay. Some of these are already implemented, while others are planned for the future.\n Collect bugs like common butterflies in the forest or rare beetles deep underground.\nSeek out fishing spots and cast your rod to see what you can catch. But beware, skellies will sometimes go boney dipping.\nPlanned Features:\nMine rare ores and minerals to craft into unique weapons and armor.\n Food keeps you happy and healthy. Cook your food into meals to increase their benefits and unlock extra buffs.\n Gather food from the wild or plant the seeds and start a farm. Higher quality foods will provide greater benefits when cooked.\n  Howdy! I\u2019m a solo developer who is finally creating my childhood dream game! I\u2019ve been developing the story of this game for over 18 years, and I\u2019m thrilled to see it come to life. It started out as a novel that I wanted to write, and when I took an interest in game development it became a game that I wanted to create.\n\nThis project has a lot of sentimental value for me, so I will be creating everything myself, including the art, music, code, and anything in between. It\u2019s a lot of hats to wear, but I love learning new skills, so I\u2019ve been having the time of my life working on this project.\nI host the YouTube channel Game Endeavor where I post devlogs and livestream the design process. So if you want to see how the game has developed as far back as day one, then go watch the devlog series on YouTube. This is my most popular devlog with over 400,000 views!\n\n 50,000+ YouTube subscribers\n 1.3+ million video views\n 5,000+ Discord community members\n 10+ years of programming experience\n Target Platforms\nThese major PC platforms will be supported:\nWindows, Linux, Mac", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been developing this project for nine months, and I believe most of the hard work is behind me. The hardest part was getting the combat system, ai that fights with you, and complex cutscenes working. I did those early because I knew they would be a bit difficult.\n\nThere is still the multiplayer system that I would like to implement, which is primarily why I've given myself such an extended time period to release this project, just to have some breathing room. \n\nShould I need to adjust my time schedule or make significant changes to the game, I am open about it not only with my backers but also my community.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Game Endeavor\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nHowdy!

Instead, crossing continental distances, only to reach the wall of a \u2018room\u2019. Passing beyond will only bring yet another room on the other side of it, with new lands stretching off just as far again.\nAlthough all manner of threats exist out in the wilds, such as strange animals and beasts, and other barbaric or dangerous people, the greatest dangers of all, are the Rooks. Huge, hulking stone automatons that patrol, somewhat mindlessly, out in the wilds of the Colostle\u2019s rooms.\nThat is until they are disturbed. Every Rook is different, there are no two the same, and they are the only source of magic in the world. As such, they are something of a target to hunters looking for tech they can scavenge, artefacts they can sell or magic crystals to grant them strange and unpredictable powers.\nThat is if they can bring one down...\nA 'room' stretching out before an Armed adventurer...\nWhat is a solo RPG?\nThink of it like a personal, mindful writing exercise, where the game provides you with prompts to write your own fascinating adventure in this strange world. You will be keeping a journal of your adventures, and the game system is a way to determine what you will encounter along the way, and to dictate the outcome of combat. All the book provides is prompts and inspirations, but it is up to you and your character to flesh out the details and to write about what you discover.\nFirst you need to create a character, someone of this world. This book will guide you through this process, but it is completely up to you. Then the game provides you with an outline of your first adventure. You can decide how to interpret these prompts and what to write, there are no limits to what you can do, this is YOUR adventure.\n\nWhat is in the book?\nThe Colostle book will be a 24 page A5 tome with all the rules required to create and play your own Colostle adventure. The book will have a thick 300gsm cover with foiled lettering, and the internal pages will be on off-white recycled paper for an otherworldly look and feel. The book will also feature black and white illustrations throughout suggesting glimpses of the world and the kind of characters you could create.\nDesign of the interior black and white pages (mockup)\nHow does the game work?\nThe basic principle is that of drawing cards from a shuffled deck of playing cards, and checking their colour, suit or number against tables to see what they represent for your adventure.\nIn the exploration phase of the game cards might stand for meeting another traveller on your journey, finding some abandoned ruins or discovering a mysterious doorway. its up to you to write in your journal what these things are and what they mean for your character. The game simply suggests things, like writing prompts, set against a fantastical world... its up to you what they all mean for your greater story. In the Combat phase, cards stand for attacks with the numbers on the cards showing their strength. Playing the right card at the right time could mean victory for your character!\nAs you play and write you will find ideas for what the mysteries of the Colostle might mean, just falling into your head. I don't provide the answers in the book, every player will discover their own truth and meaning of the world.\nAll you will need is a deck of playing cards, a pen, some rough paper for making gameplay notes and a journal to record your character's adventures in.\nHow to Play Colostle - Example of a typical Exploration and Combat phase in the game\n3 Unique Character classes\nTo play Colostle you will need to create a character, and to that end there are 3 unique classes introduced in the book that will help you do that. They are; The Armed, The Followed and The Helmed. All of them use parts and pieces harvested from Rooks that give them special abilities. I don't want to give everything away, as it is only a small book (!) but you can see an Illustration of The Armed class below.\nThe Armed - wielders of harvested Rook arms\n Rewards + Stretch Goals Breakdown\n Cheaper Shipping Options\nIf you look in the rewards you will notice that some rewards have an identical twin with the added 'Cheaper Shipping' to their title. This is because I found a cheaper shipping cost later in the life of the campaign after these tiers had been already added. If you are a new backer, and you live outside the UK, please make sure you select the 'Cheaper Shipping' version of the tier you would like, to make sure you get the best deal on your shipping.\n(These 'Cheaper Shipping' options only exist for the top 3 tiers, \u00a320 or over. The lower tiers have accurate international shipping as they are, so you don't need to worry about those)\nNew artwork for the 'Oceans' module!\nNew artwork for the 'Battlements' module\nWho am I?\nMy name is Nich Angell and I am a comic book artist, illustrator, writer and game designer. I am one quarter of the stories-and-games company Big Punch Studios, creators of comics such as 7STRING, Afterlife Inc., and Cat and Meringue and the super fun card game Sandwich Masters!\nI have worked on a lot of comics and games, both from an illustrator perspective and a concept/creation one. More than anything I love creating worlds, whether thats a place to hear a story from, or a place to play a game in, making worlds is my thing! So when I found out about solo RPGs and played a few I realised what an awesome thing they were, a small tight rulebook for a brand new world.\nAs someone with a wild imagination I am always coming up with new ideas and Colostle is the latest setting that popped into my head. This time though, I was excited to create a more open ended world so that others can experience the joy I have creating stories, adventures and mysteries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have worked on many graphic novels and as such am extremely familiar with creating books and making artwork printready. I have run a great many Kickstarters both on my own and as part of Big Punch so I am highly confident in the process and know the extent of what is involved.\n\nAs with all of my Kickstarters and those I have been a part of, I believe communication is key. I know to update regularly and keep the backers informed even if unforeseen delays or problems occur.\n\nWith a small book and a small print run like this I don't foresee any issues. The kinds of things might be print delays, quality issues, and delivery but I have plans for all of these issues if and when they appear.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe book will not be packaged in any plastic shrinkwrap or film, and will be delivered in a fully recyclable cardboard book envelope.

Read more about it in the update #5\n\nHave you ever had the problem of needing to describe a dungeon and none of the players could really imagine how the structure is actually built? You don't always have to draw a battle map. Sometimes a small picture is enough to quickly show what the situation around the players looks like. Or did you ever try to come up with a dungeon room on the fly and just could not come up with an interesting layout? This deck of dungeon cards is perfect for those situations. 36 (now 54) unique cards full of stairs, dark corners, slim corridors, claustrophobic rooms, crates, barrels and much more to place monsters and treasure in.\nCards can be either used separately or combined to form larger dungeons. You can reveal one card after another as your players make their way through the dungeon and make them curious about each corner.\nThe cards are made out of professional 310gsm card stock with a blue core and smooth linen finish for the professional look & feel. The deck comes in a custom printed tuck box with a protective matte coating to give your cards the home they deserve. \nSpeaking of... Each map (as well as the back of the card and the box) is completely hand-drawn. All 36 cards are already done and just need to be sent off to the printer.\nSo why Kickstarter? This is a test for me to see if such a deck is even wanted by enough people. If this project gets funded I can let the cards print for a reasonable price per deck without making a loss or charging an impossible high price.\nSupport Tiers\n5\u20ac - Get the PDF\nYou will get the full Deck of Dungeons (including the back side) as a PDF. This is perfect for those that would like to support this project but can't (or don't want to) afford the price of the physical deck + shipping costs.\n15\u20ac - Get the printed deck\nYou will get the physical Deck of Dungeons. Perfect for Dungeon Masters, as a present or just as a collectors item.\n18\u20ac - Physical & digital deck\nGet both - The PDF and the printed deck. This is for people who play classically as well as digitally or want to collect the printed deck and use the digital one.\nIf you want more than one deck please contact me with the shipping country. I would need to calculate the additional costs depending on where to ship. Thank you for your understanding :)\nStretch Goals\nI am very hesitant when it comes to stretch goals for this project. This is my first kickstarter and I just want everyone to get what they expect and as smoothly as possible. But if the project gets a lot more supporters than expected, I probably have no choice. So here is the goal:\n[Unlocked] 300 Supporters - 54 Cards\nIf we hit 300 or more supporters I will increase the number of cards in this deck to 54. It doesn't matter if for the physical deck or the PDF version. If we reach 300 backers the deal is sealed. I will invest some extra time to come up with 18 additional cards.\nSo if you would like to have a thicker deck make sure to share this project and encourage your friends to grab a copy as well ;)\n Shipping\nThe Deck of Dungeon gets shipped worldwide. The shipping costs will be added after you selected your pledge level. \nGermany: 6 \u20ac\nRest of the EU, USA, Canada, Japan: 11 \u20ac\nRest of the world: 13 \u20ac", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though this is my first kickstarter I am fairly confident that everything will go smoothly. The designs for the deck and tuck box are done and I already got several prototype prints of the deck from the printer to check the quality and made some adjustments.\n\nOf course it is always possible that something goes wrong during each step of the process and the shipping could get delayed.

Stop Starving. Start Thriving. \nDiscover how you can turn your art skills into your own thriving career in Illustration. \nFACT: Being an Illustrator is tough!\nYou have hopes and dreams to make it big as an artist; but you don't know how to make it happen.

Yet, as you move forward you can't help but feel stress & anxiety about the future. \"Will I actually succeed with my art?\" \"Is it even possible to find an art career that will pay my bills and  fulfill me creatively?\" To make things worse, you sometimes cave into your fears because of social distancing and/or your past.\nWell, listen up!

Your successful career in illustration is possible. I've written a guide to help you make it happen. \nThese may be BOLD words from a stranger - Why can I make you this promise?\n\n\nMy name is Will Terry and I am a successful  illustrator. - I\u2019ve illustrated over 30 children\u2019s books for publishers like Scholastic, Penguin Random House, and Simon Schuster. I co-founded the wildly popular illustration podcast - 3 point perspective. I co-founded SVSLEARN.com with Jake Parker and Lee White where we teach illustrators all over the world. I\u2019ve created a thriving comic convention brand. I taught illustration and business practices for 9 years at UVU. I\u2019ve been giving entrepreneurial advice on my popular YouTube channel  for over 10 years!\nThe point is, I've made my own successful illustration career. I, along with 12 other award winning illustrators, will show you how to make yours.\n\n What They Don't Teach You In Art School is a guide to help you create new opportunities using your art skills to pay the bills, even if you have no prospects right now. \nIn this BEAUTIFUL 300-page fully illustrated hard cover book; you're going to learn:\nIndustry Insights\nYou will learn the most relevant professional practices I use in my career to this date. To name a few: How to find clients, how to price effectively and close deals, how to figure out which industry your art is best suited for, how to correctly invoice, industry mistakes you should avoid, and more...\nThis means you will be fully prepared to find and secure the right opportunities that will fulfill you creatively and pay you fairly.\n\nHow To Land Your Dream Art Job\nFor some of you, landing that nice prestigious illustration job at a famous company like Disney, Riot games, or DreamWorks is your dream. In this guide you will learn how to network effectively, how to get yourself & your art noticed, how to nail an interview, and much more.\nThis means that you will have a competitive edge over all the other illustrators out there trying to get the top jobs in your industry.\n\nHow To Get Freelance Work\nFor those of you looking for the thrill of freelancer life, I've got you covered. You will learn how to get the best freelance work, how to get your work discovered to attract more clients, how to correctly structure your portfolio, best practices to follow as a freelancer, and more\u2026\nThis means that you will be able to create the freelance work-hard/play-hard lifestyle you want, earn a living, and still have time for conventions and games.\n\nHow To Create Your Own Brand\nAs artists, what we want most is to be known for our accomplishments and abilities.

You could spend an entire academic career at an art university and still not even come close to learning the gems that are in this guide. \nLuckily, this isn't art school so you won't have to take out student loans to get access to this valuable information. For this Kickstarter only, I am going to give you access to a massive discount. \nI'll give you one copy of \"What They don't Teach in Art School\" for the price of $29 for a soft cover or $39 for a hard cover. \nThe invaluable knowledge of how to monetize your art skills and craft your own successful career all for a fraction of the cost of student loans, housing, text books, and Tuition. This deal lasts only for the duration of the Kickstarter. It will go back to full price afterwards. Claim your guide at a massive discount today!\nSoft Cover\nHard Cover\n\n\nSo What? Why should I care? \nThe vast majority of artists out there have the art skills to earn a living, but they have no clue how to monetize their skills; so they starve. Artists just assume that if they don't have any opportunities to make money with their art now; they will never have any opportunities in the future. This is false. They just lack the understanding of how to apply their art.\nWhat They don't Teach in Art School gives artists the edge they need to go out there and make a successful career for themselves. \nIf you personally apply the principles in this book:\n* You'll learn how to establish a career where you are both earning a living and creatively fulfilled.\n* You'll learn where to spend your time to get your career off the ground and save a lot of money in the long run.\n* You'll skip past mistakes and obstacles that inexperienced illustrators make in the industry today.\n* You won't have to listen to that naysayer in your life, you know the one, and instead you'll take life into your own hands.\n* You'll be recognized for your own content and your own brand.\n* You won't have to be afraid of the future and instead look at it as your oyster.\nFear is a tough thing to shrug off. It paralyzes you from head to toe; preventing you from taking the necessary steps towards success. The greatest source of fear is the anxiety of not knowing how your future will play out. But let me clue you in on a secret, the future is yours to decide. You have what it takes! Decide to make your future a bright one. I wrote this guide to help illustrators, like you, to succeed in the most challenging time of your life. It's going to take work, there are no shortcuts, but there are open highways.\n- Will Terry\n\nShipping & Fulfillment\nBoth soft & hard cover books are ready to be printed!\nBooks will ship to the United States & Internationally. You will not pay for shipping until after the completion of the Kickstarter during fulfillment  (estimated to be in October). I will be using Backerkit to help me with fulfillment. Backerkit makes fulfillment quick and easy! I will not mark up shipping whatsoever, you will only pay what is fair.  \nWhen we are ready to ship the books (probably in October) you will receive an alert to complete a survey (to be sent to the email address that you provided with your pledge). That survey will ask for your current/updated mailing address to ensure that your order will arrive to you directly. You will pay for shipping at that time -AND- GREAT NEWS: YOU WILL ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO ADD MORE COPIES TO YOUR ORDER AT THAT TIME! You'll also have the chance to purchase add-ons, such as other books and prints by Will Terry.\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to ask me personally.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFulfillment is estimated to be October of 2020 for both hard cover and soft cover books.

They are what got my brother Brady and me into the hobby back when we were teenagers. Whether we\u2019re using them in roleplaying games, board games, or tabletop miniatures games, we love collecting, assembling, painting, and playing with them. While Blacklist Games has published several of our games that feature miniatures, they saw our passion could be used for the creation of a new division that would focus solely on miniatures and allow for company growth in parallel with creating great board games. With everyone at the company excited about the possibility of this new division, here we are to share it with you!\nBlacklist Miniatures will focus entirely on producing high quality, highly detailed, pre-assembled plastic miniatures to be used in any type of game. Blacklist Miniatures: Fantasy Series 1, our first miniatures line, is not only a celebration of our love for miniatures, but also of all things fantasy.\nWith your support, this campaign will not only bring this project to life, but also open the door to other lines of miniatures in various genres and even new games to utilize them! \nBlacklist Games has published several board games that include detailed plastic miniatures. With each game we publish, we learn more about how to improve the quality of the miniatures we produce. When you compare the miniatures in our first game, Street Masters, with those in our most recent game, Altar Quest, you can see these improvements.\nBlacklist Miniatures will take this experience and apply it to produce our best miniatures yet. These miniatures are 28mm scale and will be produced in PVC plastic.\nDragon (Kickstarter Exclusive!)\nMale Elf Paladin\nOrc\nOoze\nQUARTERMASTER LOGISTICS\nBlacklist Games, LLC is proud to announce that Quartermaster Logistics (QML) will be handling our fulfillment for Blacklist Miniatures: Fantasy Series 1.\nQML has an outstanding reputation for their transparent and stellar customer service, allowing for backers to get freight/shipping updates and personable QA solutions directly from them. From what we\u2019ve seen, they have high standards when it comes to ensuring packages are delivered with enough protection and care to give backers and publishers a peace of mind.\nFinding the perfect fit for logistics has been an immense test of trial and error, but after better understanding the needs of backers and our own expectations, we are now confident and excited for this new direction and our partnership with QML for this campaign.\nShipping\nLike our previous campaigns, shipping will be collected after this Kickstarter campaign concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship, via our pledge manager (see the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d section below for more details). This is because shipping varies from region to region.\nDepending on which region you are in, we will ship from the following hubs: UK (for EU/UK backers), China (for Asia Pacific backers), Canada (for Canadian backers), Australia (for Australia and New Zealand backers) or Indiana (for USA and the rest of the world).\nPlease note: Altar Quest add-ons (Altar Quest Quest Tier Pledge, Ruins of Arkenspire, First Four) will ship in a separate, earlier wave. See below for details.\nSHIPPING FOR FANTASY SERIES 1 ITEMS\nThe current estimated delivery for Fantasy Series 1 items (Adventurer Tier, Guildmaster Tier, Altar Quest Lurker Pack add-on) is December 2020.\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg or 8.8lbs volumetric weight).Keep in mind costs may increase based on weight from unlocked stretch goals and/or any optional add-ons purchased.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $65 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $12-$18 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries (see below).\nASIA: $10-$15 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $20-$25 to Australia and New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$20 to most countries.\n$25-$30 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n$50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n$65-$70 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n  Unfortunately, because of certain import laws and customs, we currently are NOT ABLE TO SHIP TO Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia.\nIf your territory is listed above we hope to be able to offer our product to you later at retail, but are unable to commit to shipping to these territories during the Kickstarter.\nSHIPPING FOR ALTAR QUEST ADD-ONS\nIf you pledge for any of the Altar Quest add-ons (Altar Quest Quest Tier Pledge, First Four Hero Pack, Ruins of Arkenspire) during this campaign, they will be shipped to you separately from your Fantasy Series 1 items. They will be shipped in the same time period as rewards are shipped to backers of the Altar Quest campaign (current estimate is July 2020).\nYou will pay for this shipment based on the shipping rates from the Altar Quest Kickstarter campaign. In other words, you will pay the same shipping costs that Altar Quest backers paid for these items to be shipped.\nTerms and Conditions\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that you have read and accepted the following terms and conditions.\nFINAL PRODUCT\nThe products/rewards shown on this Kickstarter page are subject to change. The final products/rewards you receive could differ from what is presented here.\nPROJECT UPDATES\nIt is your responsibility as a backer of this project to read project updates in order to stay up to date with important details and requests from the Blacklist Games team.\nCOMMUNICATING WITH BLACKLIST GAMES POST-CAMPAIGN\nPlease note that we do not monitor the Kickstarter messaging inbox outside of a live Kickstarter campaign. Therefore, after this project has ended, please ensure to send all communications to customerservice@blacklistgamesllc.com\nREFUND POLICY\nFull refunds are available within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end date. All refunds taking place within 14 days of the close of the campaign are reversed in full via Stripe to your credit card.\nAfterwards, refunds minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recuperate) will be available before and during the first 30 days the pledge manager is open. Once these initial 30 days have passed, no refunds will be possible. A reminder of the refund cutoff date will be announced in project updates.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed as previously stated.\nCOMPLETING THE PLEDGE MANAGER\nIn the weeks following the conclusion of the campaign, an email invitation to our pledge manager will be sent to all backers to allow them entry to the pledge manager; further details on this process will be provided in a project update published around the same time the email invites are sent out.\nBackers must confirm their \u201corder\u201d (pledge rewards + purchased add-ons) in our pledge manager before its closing date in order to receive their order. \u201cConfirming your order\u201d means entering your valid shipping information and paying any balances due for shipping costs and selected add-ons in the pledge manager.\nIf you confirm your order by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your confirmed order as entered into the pledge manager. That title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\nIf you do not confirm your order before the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payments/donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, agree to place you on a waiting list for backers with unconfirmed orders if you contact us after the closing date of the pledge manager but before fulfillment of rewards begins. Backers on this list will be contacted once initial fulfillment to backers has concluded in order to offer them a final chance to complete their orders; note that this process would not involve the pledge manager and that any shipments sent as a result of this process would not benefit from any \u201cfriendly shipping\u201d rates offered during the Kickstarter campaign and would undoubtedly be shipped at a higher cost due to not benefitting from overall Kickstarter shipping rates. \nRemember that unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and could lead to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, therefore if you do not complete your order by the pledge manager\u2019s closing date, we cannot guarantee the availability of add-ons/exclusive items in sufficient quantity for your pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing five successful Kickstarter campaigns, we are continuing to learn how to further improve our marketing, design, manufacturing, fulfillment, and distribution, as well as how best to nurture our growing community. \n\nThe following are the statuses of our crowdfunding projects:\n\nStreet Masters: Fulfilled\nBrook City: Fulfilled\nAftershock: Delivering now\nAltar Quest: In production at the manufacturer\nHour of Need: Development wrapping up \n\nThere are a lot of moving parts with Kickstarter campaigns, and timing is often one of the biggest obstacles, especially for smaller publishers such as ourselves.

Later on I learned that this method is similar to what cognitive research has called \"The Testing Effect\". \nStudies have shown that The Testing Effect is one of the most efficient ways your brain retains new longterm information and this book was developed using these same scientific principles.\nCognitive Drawing has had over 1300 Beta Testers which have included Homeshoolers, Charter Schools, High Schools, hobbyists and those who just wanted to expand on their college educations. \nOf those testers 90% saw an immediate improvement in their drawing AND retained what they learned.\n LINK: Four Page Cognitive Drawing Sample PDF (Download)\nBetter yet, here is a demo video if me doing the sample PDF!\nOver the course of 90 days I'll be teaching you the techniques that have made me a successful artist. \nWith Cognitive Drawing learning to draw is as easy as... \nWhat are Students Saying?\nWhether it's for personal use, homeschooling or the education system.

It will be a softcover, perfect-bound book that will fit nicely with the other books in the DRAWINGS series. It will hold a comprehensive collection of both finished and exploratory artworks from the last three years, including an exclusive SKULL CHASER comic made especially for it. There will be a step-by-step tutorial on my drawing process as well.\nThis is the FIFTH book in my series of DRAWINGS art books and I felt it was time to mix things up a bit and change the nature and design of these books for the next several publications starting with DRAWINGS 5.\nYou can order these books right now from my shop. If they're out of print, I have a digital download option available.\nAlong with the book there's a bunch of other stuff that is only available from this Kickstarter. I'm excited to make these things and get them out to you!\nNote: this is a living, breathing project.

We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!\nSometimes orders get lost or damaged in the mail. In that case, we will work with you to make sure you get your book. For instance, if your book is damaged, please contact us and we will have you return the damaged book for a replacement.

This book is for all ages showcasing character designs, concept art, and visual development. With full color illustrations, rough sketches, traditional ink and ink washed artwork.

Building good drawing habits and making sketching fun is the goal of our latest creation.  \n The wallet is 3.25 x 4.25\" and is made of high quality printed vinyl. The inside has an ID window pocket, a card pocket, and a money pocket for your cash. Each wallet comes with a small pencil and a 2.5 x 3.75\" replaceable sketchbook filled with drawing activities to prime the creative pump.  \nMany parents have asked me how to keep their young artist going. I believe they should provide them with a few things: \n\"Encouragement\" will need to come from you, but we can help with the \"fresh art supplies\" and \"inspiration\" to make drawing fun and accessible. Each wallet comes with a replaceable sketchbook filled with tips, prompts, activities and more to get the creative juices flowing. Your artist will definitely come away with new skills and fun stuff to draw. There are also plenty of blank pages that will allow unguided creativity. Our small blank, toned, dot-grid and lined books also fit this wallet. \nMany artists don't begin to carry a sketchbook until they hit college age or older. Help the young artist in your life to develop this habit early, it will only help them get better. Drawing at a young age should only have one goal...it should be fun. You'll have plenty of opportunity to dash their hopes and dreams later. Don't get hung up on, \"you drew the head too big,\" or \"the perspective is all wrong.\" Criticism before they're ready will squeeze the love right out of it. If they can keep drawing through middle school and into high school then they are probably ready for honest critiques. You'll know because they'll ask for it.\nWe've had this on the idea board for a couple years and thought it was time to make this thing. We have been trying several designs, interviewing young people, measuring pockets, checking out materials and so on. We love the final designs and know you will too. \n The first wallet was designed by the ever-doodling Parker Jacobs. Parker has been posting his daily doodles for the past decade. You may recognize his work from Paul Frank Industries, Yo Gabba, Gabba, The Aquabats and Goon Holler. Parker has a bad habit of letting his domain names run out.\n The second wallet was designed by Sketch Wallet creator Ralph Thomas. He's proven that even a mediocre artist can make a living in illustration and has spent the last 10 years as a game artist. When he's not drawing he's found riding his trusty green bike, \"the Bass-O-Matic\u2122\" or stealing Parkers websites (Exhibit A, Exibit B).\nSpecial Thanks to Miles, Raegan, and Aaliyah :-)\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs much as I want to pretend there are no risks - there are.

So we reached out to our manufacturer and worked with them to create this set.\nSo, who are these guys?\nWe are a group of toy developers, game designers, and brick enthusiasts that want to bridge the gap between bricks and tabletop RPGs. We have a lot of experience in toys and manufacturing and want to use those connections and knowledge to create awesome sets to enhance your game. Our first set will be this dice tower, then we move onto sets that support the most popular campaign settings and modules.\nWhat will happen now that the Kickstarter is funded?\nAfter we receive funds, production will begin. The smallest order we can place for a product like this is 1000 sets. This will take 1 month for the factory to complete. Then they will be shipped in a container to our warehouse in the US, this will also take 1 month. Then the warehouse will ship all of the orders out to your addresses.\nAfter we fulfill the Kickstarter, we will launch our eCommerce site where people will be able to place orders for this dice tower and future sets.\n Future sets? \nYep, we already have a few sets lined up for release after this one. The next set will be around 1500 pieces and feature a campaign with 3 sessions worth of play.

It's a unique gaming experience without a lot of baggage. Simple set-up, intuitive rules and minimal components. No DM, no bookkeeping or character sheet. Just you, an oversized deck of cards, dice and cube markers.\nMy influences for this game are rooted in the nostagia of my childhood. D&D, Planet of the Apes, Land of the Lost, Heavy Metal Magazine, Zork, and Monkey Island, to name a few.\n\nIt's the grisly tale of a strange tower that emerges in the heart of a bustling Viking city. The townsfolk have vanished. It\u2019s up to you to mount a rescue and unravel the mystery. \nYou move through the game like a book. But in this case, it's a stack of ominous cards. Flip them over, make difficult choices and let the story unfold. \n\nYou have an Ally Deck with 6 adventurers (6 chances) to face the countless dangers of the spire. From this deck you will randomly pick 2 starting Allies. But be warned, your path is paved in blood. If they die, and they will you will randomly select another Ally to take their place.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a six-chapter adventure, each of which includes a major encounter, loot, choices, dice chucking and more! It will require both skill and luck. \nThe hook is simple. In combat you perform actions at a cost. That cost is your character's hit points. Every action is a risk. To execute stronger attacks you will need to spend more hit points, which in turn leaves you weak and vulnerable. This makes for tense, close, ruthless battles.\nPlease note: This is a simplistic look at some basics in combat. There are many exciting variables to actions and their outcomes detailed in the instructions deck. Check out Kickbacks, Status Effects, Rest meters and more!\nEnemies will fight in a similar fashion, with a few exceptions. They don't spend Hit Points and their actions are determined by the Action Deck.\nEach enemy you will face has different hooks and mechanics to make them interesting. Some have story branches that trigger in the midst of battle.\n\n\nWhat would an adventure be without pesky trash mobs getting in your way? You can't head out on your first quest without clearing rats out of a cellar, right?\n\nMy goal was to make this game with as few components as possible without taking away from the gaming experience. It's a clean minimalistic approach to an in-depth and engrossing adventure.\nThe focus has always been the story deck. The heart of the game. It represents the spire, and each card is a layer you uncover during your descent. \nFrom the very start I wanted ENORMOUS PLAYING CARDS. These are custom 6.5 x 3.5 inch cards. They are about the same size as an iPhone X and they're glorious. Here's what's in the box. \n\n\n\nThis is not a randomly generated gaming experience. The concept here is to experience a specific storyline with multiple chapter branches and endings. Your choices, enemy encounters and items you discover will influence the overall narrative. There are multiple endings to uncover, some more unpleasant than others.\n\n\n\nHere is a look at the current Card Progression Tree for Chapters 1 and 2 to help illustrate the branching paths. Each square is a card. Black = Story Card, Red = Item Card, Dark Red = Encounter. Your story can splinter out in many different directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the complexities of the project I want to be transparent with the progress made and what's left to do.\n\nGreg is an Art Director and Graphic Designer currently residing in Los Angeles, CA. In his free time he's pumping whatever pop culture he can into his veins..or dreaming up new encounters for Spire's End!\n\nBenjamin is a Digital Artist from Berlin, Germany currently working as a freelance concept artist and illustrator. These days he uses every available minute for art and game design.\nErica is co-owner of Oaktown Spice Shop in Oakland, CA. Before starting a retail business with her husband, she was a journalist. She loves to cook and drink wine.\nChristian is co-owner of Hop Merchants Bottle Shop & Taproom, a craft beer bar in North Hollywood, CA.  He's a writer, a gamer and horror film fanatic.\n\n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign has ended. \nThe shipping rates listed below are conservative estimates NOT the official costs. Please note that these estimates are based on the core game. Any Stretch Goals unlocked during the campaign may change the weight and the size of the game, which could influence the final shipping cost. I will work to secure the best prices possible and attempt to lower these costs in proportion to the success of the campaign.\nBackers outside the countries listed above may be responsible for their own customs fees and any additional charges if and when they occur. Please message me regarding countries not listed for more information.\nPlease not that Spire's End is a work in progress, product is still in development.\nWarning: This is a fantasy/horror game that contains violence and disturbing imagery. Ages 16 and up.\nThe incredible art by Benjamin Wieseman sets the mood. The game will contain over 40 original illustrations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first venture into the madness of crowdfunding and it\u2019s incredibly daunting. But with more than 15 years of graphic design and packaging experience, I am merely in a state of heightened panic.\n\nThis project, like many, started with very ambitious goals before it was wrangled into something reasonable for my first attempt. It began as a 12 chapter, 200 card epic. Due to the sheer scope of the game, production costs and the fact that I am just one person, the game is now 6 Chapters, with the hopes to continue later if successful.\n\nThe style guides and templates are set, and the writing for Chapters 1-6 are more than halfway there.\n\nMy aim is to keep things simple without compromising the game as much as possible. That being said, even with \u201csimple\u201d in mind I know that problems lurk around every corner. Game balancing and rewrites take time so I am giving myself a considerable amount of lead time to get this labor-intensive job done properly.\n\nNobody wants this game in their hands more than me. I dream about this thing. I spend my time in the shower planning the next encounter. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to get this out before the spire drags me down into the bowels of the underworld.

Each stop along the way unlocks more fun!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\n!! VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ !! \n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion.\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates.\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change/subtract or add a piece to a specific model.\n4) The bulk of our Kickstarter will be made in China. A tariff in excess of 50% or a ban on Chinese imports would seriously delay delivery and/or, in a worse case, shutdown this project entirely. If such an event occurs early on in this project, refunds (less charges and expense payments made) might be possible. If it occurs later in this project (after almost all expenses have been paid) there would be little and possibly no refunds. \n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment against loss or damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that helps us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays that are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and dock yard labor strikes are examples of delays out of our control. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to back it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nAlso we reserve the right to modify any model or piece of a model shown to meet cost and production requirements. Modifications may include the removal or addition of new parts to a model. \n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored.\n\nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by August 31, 2020 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after August 31, 2020.\n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after April 30, 2021) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit.\n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery. These include, but are not limited to: import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant and taxing authorities, VAT and GST due and delivery acceptance, brokerage and collection charges.\n\nYou are required to provide correct address information and ensure this address is deliverable by normal methods before your rewards are shipped.\n\nYou must have your address correct and up to date in the Reaper Pledge Manager when we announce shipping is beginning. You may change it at any time until then. There may be a shipping surcharge associated with changing countries.\n\nRewards returned to us as undeliverable will be shipped again postage prepaid by the Backer.\n\nALL OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIS KICKSTARTER WILL BE VIA KICKSTARTER UPDATES ONLY.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wave 2 - United Kingdom (NOT Europe)", "descp": "2019 Bones 5 PLEDGE LEVEL This reward level pledges enough to get you into this Bones 5 Kickstarter.

With an engaging one-off experience and narrative campaign play, Altar Quest offers players endless adventure in a unique fantasy setting with years of support planned for the game.\nWhether playing an individual quest or part of a campaign, each quest is made up of a combination of several different decks and other game elements. Heroes must complete the goal set out by the chosen quest deck in order to win the game. They must overcome several obstacles during the quest determined by the chosen threat deck and villain deck, as well as the deck of lurker cards. If any hero is defeated, the heroes lose the game.\nAll Original Fantasy Setting\nAltar Quest takes place mainly in a realm called Aridika\u2014a land of high fantasy and Gothic horror. As players dive deeper into the game, they\u2019ll learn about the deep lore and many mysteries that hide within the shadows of Aridika and the world of Rhuna. Designers Adam & Brady Sadler have been developing the world of Rhuna since their early days of playing Dungeons & Dragons, and are excited to share it and expand it with Altar Quest.\nAltars\nThe world of Rhuna was created by powers called \u201crhunes\u201d\u2014godlike essences that came together to create all existence. Mortals were never intended to wield the untempered powers of rhunes, so they were crystallized deep within the earth to keep the lands above in balance. Unfortunately, evil finds a way, and deep below Aridika where the lich queen Szera slumbers, the rhunestones have been corrupted and forced to the surface. These altars are worshipped by power-hungry opportunists that use the rhunic energies surrounding them to further their own nefarious plans\u2026 \nDuring each quest, the chosen altar card will constantly affect the state of the altar pool. The altar pool is made up of 5 altar dice that are rolled at the start of the quest. Each altar die has 6 unique sides, each one containing a rhune symbol. These rhunes are used by the heroes, as well as the enemies, to trigger special effects. After an effect is triggered by a rhune symbol, the altar die showing that symbol is rolled and the new symbol is added to the altar pool. Players will have to balance using their rhune effects with making sure they aren\u2019t empowering the enemy too much.\nIncredibly Modular\nFeaturing the versatile Modular Deck System (MDS) that the Sadlers first introduced with Street Masters, the variability of Altar Quest is one of its key features. Players will have a world to explore by mixing hero decks, villain decks, threat decks, and quest decks with fluctuating feature decks to keep the environments fresh. Players can create their ideal game scenarios by matching up decks of their choice, or leave it to fate and embark on a randomized quest!\nTruly Solo, Truly Cooperative\nAltar Quest features an elegant player scaling solution built into the core design of the game, which means one player can play the game as easily as up to four, with no exceptions or special rules. \nThree Great Ways to Play\nWhile Altar Quest is designed to be a satisfying one-off adventure, players can also embark on an epic campaign by linking their quests together, earning upgraded cards for their decks, finding new equipment, and facing new challenges with enemy upgrades. Additionally, stories allow players to explore the vibrant setting of Aridika by playing through a story deck using the campaign rules.\nFor more information on the add-ons, click here.\nShow your support for Altar Quest by donning one of many avatars available here: https://www.blacklistgamesllc.com/altarquest\nShipping Info \nLike our previous campaigns, shipping will be collected after the Kickstarter based on the actual costs incurred to ship, via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping varies from region to region and doing so will allow us to provide more stretch goals for you during the campaign!\nDepending on what region you are in, we will ship from the following hubs: UK (for EU/UK backers), China (for Asia Pacific backers),  Canada (for Canadian backers), Australia (for Australia and New Zealand backers) or Indiana (for USA and the rest of the world). \nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg or 8.8lbs volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates and costs may increase based on weight from unlocked stretch goals and/or any optional buys you get.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries (see below). \nASIA: $10-$15 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $25-$35 to Australia and New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries (see below).  \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, because of certain import laws and customs, we currently are NOT ABLE TO SHIP TO Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia.\nIf your territory is listed above we hope to be able to offer our product to you later at retail, but are unable to commit to shipping to these territories during the Kickstarter. \nTHE LOOMING TARIFFS: We have spoken to our factory and shipping logistic reps and until anything officially changes, nothing will change or affect us cost-wise. If things do start having a financial impact, Blacklist Games, LLC will be absorbing what we can, so we can keep overall costs and shipping as familiar to what you're normally used to with our campaigns. If there are any increases at all, it will be minimal and only be set by any fulfillment costs outside of our control, since we do not intend to randomly up-charge our products for the sake of doing so.\nPOST PLEDGE MANAGER NOTICE: Any pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs since it would be out of our normal fulfillment cycle. For non-US backers that will likely incur import taxes as well. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally due to the size of each package and the risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nRefund Policy\nWe can refund you within 2 weeks (14 days) of the campaign\u2019s end date, fees included. All refunds taking place within 14 days of the close of the campaign are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. After that, we will accept returns minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot get back from them) up until our pledge manager is closed. At that point, refunds will no longer be possible. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing our successful campaigns for Street Masters, Brook City, and Street Masters: Aftershock we continue to learn about how better to improve our marketing, design, manufacturing, fulfillment, and distribution, as well as how best to nurture our growing community. Street Masters and Brook City have been fulfilled and have received high acclaim by reviewers and gamers alike.\nCurrently, Aftershock is in production at the manufacturer. Per our recent updates, we've approved all samples and they are in mass production, about 5 months early! Though we aren't physically involved until mass production is finished, it's equally important that we continue to communicate with them and our backers in order to provide the latest updates and news. Altar Quest is extremely exciting, but we are also just as excited and committed to bringing Street Masters: Aftershock to our backers' tabletops as soon as possible.\nThere are a lot of moving parts with Kickstarter campaigns, and timing is often one of the biggest obstacles, especially for smaller publishers such as ourselves. Fortunately, we've got experienced game designers working hard to ensure the gameplay offers the best experience it can, we have strong relationships with the factory/manufacturer, we have a shipment/fulfillment company already signed on, we are completely passionate about our games, and, most importantly, we care about our backers and their satisfaction.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "Quest Tier", "descp": "Get one copy of Altar Quest and all unlocked stretch goals, PLUS the KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE \"Call of the Lunarin\" guest designer expansion by Isaac Childres, creator of Gloomhaven!

If you are a fan of 80's/90's road trip movies and retro video games, this movie is for you. It will capture those warm memories you have for gaming and remind you of those good times while making you laugh along the way. This will be a movie you can watch with the whole family. For fans of the Game Chaser's web series, this is not a 2-hour game chasers episode, it is a feature-length scripted comedy film. However, it will have everything you come to love from the show at its roots, just presented in a new and exciting way!   This will be a different format, of course, from the show (which is reality documentary style) But that's the point, to do something fresh and different!  \nWe've had an idea to do a movie for a long time, but it wasn't until someone approached us with the concept of a scripted comedy that the light-bulb went off. Our original idea a few years back was a country-wide road trip going to flea markets. Basically exactly what we do on the YouTube show, still keeping it a \"reality format\", and making it a feature-length movie. And while many might find that idea awesome, I found it boring. It's the same thing we already do just.....longer. And we have to depend on the chance of actually finding games. You wouldn't see Mevor, or Dodongo in it because or work obligations as well. For me, that idea just wasn't exciting. We never pursued it. We never tried to Kickstart it. Maybe we will down the road, but this idea that we have is so much more stimulating creatively for all of us, and a nice breath of fresh air. And the great thing about it for fans is that even though it's a fictional narrative, it still has the essence of the show. It's a refreshing take on Game Chasers. And we are super excited to bring it to life and show the world. \nNow, some people might be concerned over the fact that we have a Producer and that that means someone else other than us is calling the shots. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is OUR project, OUR vision, and the idea and direction is 100 percent OUR creations. We make the decisions. No one controls us, ever. They work for US, not the other way around. I just wanted to ease anyone's concerns that someone else was in charge of this project. This is GAME CHASERS only bigger and badder! What you love about the channel, you will love about this. \nThe plan is to shoot over the Spring/Summer and have it ready for release in 2020. There will be a limited theater run, at the minimum here in DFW. But there will also be digital downloads and Blu-rays as well! In the meantime the regular YouTube show isn't going anywhere, so don't worry.  \n\nWhat's it about????\nWell....I can only say so much. A lot of what will make it awesome to see for the first time is the big surprise we have in store. That's good enough, right??? RIGHT? NO? Fine......I can give a quick synopsis, I suppose...... Billy and Jay go on a road trip to track down a childhood gaming relic. And of course...a ridiculous adventure ensues.....a ridiculous adventure but not TOO outside the bounds of reality. Its main purpose is to be FUN to watch but also make you feel good!\nThink of this as a fictionalized Game Chasers Prequel. A fun re-telling of how 2 friends became game collectors. \nIt will be what you have come to love about the show mixed with stuff you would have never expected, but still fitting in with the spirit of what we do. And also mixed with bigfoots and aliens. Maybe. ;)\nPLAY\n\n\nOk, how about this? How about I list some words that are out of context but have actual meaning in the movie.

For now....\nFor another tease...scroll to the bottom and see a page from the actual script. \nThis is just a teaser paying homage to Gremlins, not any official art\nIn this video we go into the story a little more to hopefully help you understand the theme of what its all about.  \nMany of the Game Chasers show fan's favorite episodes were ones that made them both laugh and cry, and this movie will capture that same feeling. You will laugh, cry, cheer, and reflect. Fans of the web-show will get enjoyment out it, as well as those who are not familiar. Its a movie for fans and newcomers alike.  \n I (Billy)  have a passion for storytelling. I have enjoyed making the Game Chasers web series and will continue to do so, but my favorite projects have always been the ones where I can tell a story and or just be creative. The Under The Bridge Game Chasers Episode and our cartoons display that the most, I believe. This movie has been in the planning stages for a while now, but we feel it's finally time to move forward with it.  \nYour support right now of this Kickstarter is critical for it's success.\n Making a movie of this magnitude is expensive. As I said, this isn't a 2-hour Game Chaser episode. This is not us just taking a camera and going out a few days a week shooting video. We have a producer. We are hiring a professional film crew for this. We want this to be like any other movie you would see in a theater. THIS IS NOT a normal \"web series makes a movie\" scenario. Our goal is to shoot this movie on a RED Camera. A RED camera was used in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, to give you an idea of the quality. I DEMAND that this EXCEEDS your expectations.  We have always reached for the best quality in everything we do, and this is no exception. But besides the film crew, there are so many costs that go into this such as, location costs, insurance, paying the cast, props, transportation, post-production, CGI, licensing, lawyers, to name a few. We will need to hire people to do jobs such as accounting so we don't get sued or have the IRS come after us, a production manager so they can organize the dozens of people need to work on this and keep things on schedule, and also the cost of simple things like food for the crew that will add up quick. Luckily I (Billy) will edit so we can save money on that. As you can see, things add up quickly. 95k may seem like a lot, but in movie making terms 95k is still low budget. Remember, this isn't us filming on the fly at the flea market, this is a REAL production.   \nThis is a Pre-Sell. \nWe hope to Pre-Sell enough copies of the movie to cover the costs of making. If we don't, and our goal is not met, then Kickstarter will not charge your card. \nWHY CROWDFUNDING?\nCrowdfunding, or \"Eat Bacon\" as some would call it, is the best way to for us to bring this movie to you. Lucky for us, it's the year 2019 and the film industry has changed so much. There isn't a need to get a studio's backing or get deep pocket investors. We cut out the middle man and allow our product to be funded by the PEOPLE who want it DIRECTLY. The thing is, investors, dropping large sums of money will want a say in the movie, and rightfully so. We want to keep 100 percent control. We have TURNED down an offer for a TON of money from a potential investor because they wanted to make changes.  Our vision is important to us. With that said, we HAVE been able to secure smaller funding from a few sponsors who won't be taking any control. It's not a ton of money, but it helps, and we are always looking for more small sponsors who don't want say in the movie making aspect. \nObviously, we have always been great at taking low budget and making it look high budget. It's been our MO since we started. \nReminder: You wont be charged unless we hit our goal\nOf course, there are going to be people waving their finger saying we should get investors instead of going directly to our audience who would want to see this movie to fund it. They say we E bacon? With that said, we actually DO have some! As it stands we have around 7k committed from sponsors. However, you can play a huge part in making that higher. IF you guys help fund this now and early on in this campaign, more sponsors will be willing to jump on board since they will see there is a ton of interest and will be way more willing to get involved. However, they still wouldn't be sponsors who would get a say in how we make this movie. If so, we will turn them down. So if you want this to happen, let's do it as soon as you can! Let's show the people what the Chode Nation is all about!\nWe more than likely not make any profit off this. And we have no plans to pay OURSELVES for the work. Kyle Newman recently said he made nothing off the movie Fanboys in the end. I can see that happening with us. This is a passion project, but even passion projects require funding. If you want to see this movie made let's pull together an make one hell of a movie! \nHere is a pie chart that will show (generally) where the money will be spent. This as of now is a best guess, some areas could end up being cheaper, others more expensive.\nHere are a few further breakdowns of what you saw on the graph, and why exactly we need them. These are the jobs/things we will actually have to pay for and not get the \"friend\" hook-up.\nProduction Manager - This person handles the business side of things. Like managing the budget, making sure people get paid, employment issues, paperwork and etc. \nCinematographer - Behind the director (Billy and Melvor) this is the most important crew member. He or she is responsible for the look and cinematography of the movie. We can't do everything, so this person is vital for us. We want to hire someone who knows what they are doing, a professional. This will obviously cost but will be worth it. We want the movie to look good! But beyond that, if we hire someone who is cheap and inexperienced we run the risk of them making a mistake, and a mistake on a movie set can cost thousands of dollars and days of shooting. \nAudio Tech - This person is responsible for recording the audio on the set. Again, if someone messes up this job it can cost money and time, so a professional is needed. \nAssistant Director - While the director and co directors focus on the actual movie making, the Assistant director does the important \"dirty\" work to free up the directors time. Such as breaking down the script and planning the shooting days, and making sure all the people who need to be on set a certain day are there. They find the best and most efficient way to organize the shooting days to save time and money. \nSet Building - This is a must, and an expensive must. Some of our settings will need to be created because finding a real-life location that we need will be near impossible. I wish I could go into more detail but I would be giving away to much of the plot. Let's just say we will need to create a set that looks like it's from 1988. Also, a few of our settings would be impossible to film in a real life location because there would be no space to fit a camera and crew, so one would need to be built with only 3 walls, so a camera crew could be behind the \"fourth wall\". All this would need to be built on a sound stage which we would have to rent out from someone. Plus add the cost for materials and people to build said sets.  \nFilm Equipment - The DP will have a lot of gear but we will more than likely need to rent more and that cost can add up quick. Things such as camera mounts for a car, jibs, lenses, and lighting. Maybe even another camera if needed.  \nLocation fees - When we CAN shoot in real outside locations rather it be a building, a town, or someone's house, it is rarely ever free. Someone, whoever owns it, will want to be paid. Believe me, we will try to find a place for free or cheap, but it might not be possible.  \nSpecial Effects Tech - Sometimes its cheaper and easier to use miniatures instead of full size real life objects for a particular scene. Tons of movies use models and you never realized it. Apollo 13 and Avatar are two to come to mind, and we have one of the model makers who worked on those movies on board to work with us! He knows the art of the craft and how to make them look real on camera. We are talking professional half-scale and quarter-scale models, not little toys. Big difference. This will make our life SO much easier for a few things we have planned, but we still have to pay him. But it's totally worth it.\nActors - Some of the main actors will be friends, others will not. Regardless, we will still need to pay them. We can't ask someone to step away from work for a week, or a month, or even a few days for shooting and expect them to do it for free. We will also have a lot of actors who are not our friends...we will definitely need to pay them.... \nFlight/hotel -  This is another costly but necessary expense. We will need to fly actors and crew in and out all through the shooting phase. \nCatering - This is not in the pie graph but still important. You can't starve your actors or crew while shooting all day. Food will add up quickly. I hope they like Taco Bell...or bread and water...\nInsurance/legal - I hate this one, but it's a must. We are treading new ground here. We have to do things on the up and up to protect ourselves. We can't afford to get sued if someone gets hurt on set. And an entertainment lawyer is a MUST on a movie. One product or logo shown might open ourselves up to get sued, so we need council to tell us what's off limits. \nCGI artist - I already mentioned this but we have an artist who has worked on the Walking Dead on board. Now when I say CGI I don't necessarily mean crazy CGI sets or creatures (for the most part), a lot of CGI you see you don't even know you...see it.. Like wire removal, or fixing a mistake in the scene. CGI is an amazing tool to have, especially when a lot of times its cheaper than just re-shooting a scene. Cheaper...but not free\nMiscellaneous - This is everything else. Anything from fixing a broken piece of equipment, to gas for driving to a location.  On a movie set, something can always go wrong. An example would be as follows: We have scheduled a two-day shoot that's outside at a certain location. We have 12 cast and crew members that need to be there, and we have flights booked for everyone. The shoot day comes and then...it RAINS! We have to pay for two extra days of hotels for everyone and reschedule return flights. And some of those people might not be able to stick around after the rain to shoot, so we could have to re-shoot it a week or two later.Yeah, that would be a nightmare. An expensive nightmare. If we get more than expected out of this campaign, then this slice of the pie will get filled up even more due to the old saying, \"what can go wrong will go wrong\". \nCAMPAIGN FEES - Kickstarter's fees, together with the credit card processing fees, come to about 8.5% - 10%. At our goal of $95k that's up to $9,500. \nCheck out the production team so far. It isn't just a bunch of chodes (for the most part), we have real industry people working on this with us! \n\n\nMore on CGI With Yoshi\nHere, Yoshi talks about a somewhat unknown use for CGI that can have a huge impact on storytelling. CGI isn't just for space battles and crazy aliens....for the most part.\n here is Yoshi's IMDB and demo reel\nhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm4668929/\n\nAgain, this is a Pre-SELL. If we don't hit the goal, you will get your money back, but if we do, then you will get a copy of the movie. \nWe are NOT asking for FREE money. You will get stuff in return. We are offering some cool rewards for you! You are the VIP of this project. We could easily ask you guys for money now, make the movie, then charge you again to buy it. We don't want to do that, so despite having a significant part of our budget go towards Blu-ray production, we want your money to go towards owning the movie as well as making it. You only have to contribute once to see it! If you ever wanted to be a part of a movie, see how it works up close, and know you helped make it happen, then we have a ton of cool rewards just for you! \nAnd remember, you can pledge as many times as you like. If you only want a digital download now, you can always come back before the campaign ends and get a Blu-Ray as well, or one of the higher rewards. Take a look on the right-hand side of all the reward details, but some of the stuff included are:\nUltimate Combo Pack!\nThis is the ultimate pack! Get the Blu-Ray, Shirt, name in the credits, and filming vlogs! This IS the combo you are looking for...\nConcept Art!\nGet art made just for the movie! This concept art is what is used to bring forth a visualization of what the scene should look like for filming. \nActual concept art drawn for the movie\nCome To the Premiere! \nCome hang out and see the premiere of the movie with us! This will be a special private first screening! Get VIP tickets and dinner with the cast and crew! It will be a blast, don't miss out!\npic is for example only. Official venue to be determined.\nHang out on set, and or be in the movie!\nWant a once in a life time chance to be behind the scenes when a movie is made? Or even update your IMDB profile with a role IN the movie? Either way, you are sure to have a hell of a time. \nnot the official sound-stage, pic only used as example\nPages from the First Working Draft! \nThis is a page from Jay's first draft of the script. There are notes as we made changes. You can get a page like this from one of 3 first draft working scripts from Billy, Jay, or Melvor.(Obviously the black lines are only so we don't give away the plot here on the kickstarter page and your page wont have them)\nThis is censored pic of an actual page of the actual script. Your page will have no black bars\nA VERY LIMITED VHS print\nThis VHS will be limited to 150 copies and each one numbered \"1 of 150\", \"2 of 150\", etc. It will have the movie itself but no extras. A great novelty item for VHS collectors! \n*artwork and title not yet finalized\n\nThere are even more awesome rewards to choose from! Just check out the list on the right side of the page and pick the one that is right for you! Or heck, maybe even 2 or 3...no nuts!\nOh, one more thing..... \nBlu-Ray, and poster art not yet finalized\nBlu-Rays - These are not cheap to produce. There is a reason most of the film kickstarter projects don't have this perk and the ones that do have them priced higher than a Blu-ray would normally be, it takes money away from your movie budget to make them. However, I know you most of you love physical media, so despite taking a piece of the budget away we are going to produce them for you! They will have exclusive stuff only found on the Kickstater Pre-order, so don't miss out! When we run out of these Blu-rays and print more to sell at cons and online well after the movie is out, they will be cheaper but have less content. So these are DEFINITELY the versions to get! These Kickstarter versions will have TWO discs with so much extra content. Plus...if you guys don't buy these now....we wont have the money to make the movie...\nArtwork - The artwork on the BLu-Ray and shirts are just to have visuals for the Kickstarter and are not the final product. I plan on hiring an awesome artist to make the poster/blur-Ray cover and make it look super epic. \nSo our goal of 95k is bare MINIMUM what we need to make this thing. We can make it awesome on that budget, however, we can make it even MORE awesome with these stretch goals!  WE will make the best movie we possibly can on 95k, but these goals are the key to taking things to an all new level. With this extra money we will do things like bring in a REAL famous actor or 2 for a cameo, add more complex scenes, bring in more people to help, and just overall add much more cool chodiness. Not only for the movie, but for the Youtube channel as well. Let's UNLOCK these stretch goals! \nRemember, if you want to throw in an extra dollar or $2 or $1000.....(i'm looking at you Bill Gates)....over what the perk costs, it will help! The more that do that, the more likely this goal will be met and exceeded. \nWhat About Game Chasers on Youtube???\nDoes this mean the end of the Game Chasers series? No way! In fact, check out the video below to learn how there could be MORE Game Chasers/Toy Chasers/ AND Chasing the Unknown.\nLastly, let me list a few films that we were inspired by while writing this script: \nFanboys\nPee Wee's Big Adventure\nDumb and Dumber\nBilly Madison\nGremlins\nGhostbusters \nTommy Boy\n\nOther Ways You Can Help\nSome people can't help fund this, but that doesn't mean they can't help:\nIf you want to help by offering your services (construction, make-up, costumes, etc) please let us know.  \nAnd it would be radical if you want to share this with everyone! \nI will share any video made by you that promotes this Kickstarter and encourages support! \nMake everyone aware!\nThank you so much for stopping in and checking this out. Together we can make this happen!\nEverything that is on this page is here for a reason. Even things you can barely see.....\n\nUpdate:\nHere at the bottom I will be posting various auditions as we receive them. Some for VERY small roles, and some for bigger ones. Keep in mind they are Auditions, it doesnt mean they have the part. I just wanted to post a few of these as teasers.

Choose your path and gather the greatest warriors of the age to your cause! Enter a world of magical treasures, wonders, and horrors. Compete against rivals in the bitter struggle for supremacy! The rules are deceptively simple and easy to learn, but you'll immediately face deep tactical choices in this dynamic battle game.\nThis ambitious Kickstarter campaign includes two new faction sets and a campaign book packed with adventures, lore, and much more! New Faction Sets not only expand the game, but also offer a great entry point for new players as they enter the dreaded Volgelands!\nGet the Volgelands campaign book, both of the new factions, and the Kickstarter Exclusive \"Vandas Greycloak\" miniature with the recommended Bold Adventurer pledge level! \n  Relicblade miniatures are cast in white metal for crisp detail.\nThe Volgelands Adventure Campaign Setting\nThe Volgelands is the first campaign setting for Relicblade, and the first in-depth exploration of the Relicblade world. The book centers on the region known as the Volgelands. The port city of Riverhold is the beating heart of these cursed lands where feral magic still hold sway. Founded on the divine principles of Justice, but controlled by a powerful merchant class. Riverhold stands at a crossroad, both as a center of trade and a symbol of hope. Adventurers seek out the city to find their path. From this indomitable city, brave souls set out into the Volgelands, seeking a new destiny in a dying world. \nThis campaign book is packed with tons of great content. Inside you'll find:\nRegional lore concerning the history of the Relicblade world, Riverhold, and the Volgelands.\nFaction lore focussing on the Temple of Justice, the Lone Guard, the Battle Pigs, and the sinister Bone and Darkness.\nMap based narrative quest lines.\nTwo dangerous new environments: the Scoured Plains and the Brackish Badlands\nSix scenarios in addition to the narrative quest lines.\nNew wild monsters that inhabit the Volgelands\nAnd optional campaign extras including Side Quests and more!\nJust look at this awesome map. Now imagine leading your warriors on this dangerous quest!\nThere is so much great content in this book! It's a little crazy to focus on one particular aspect, but I can't just upload everything and say \"SEE HOW COOL IT IS!!!\" with crazy eyes. But look at this dope map! These map based quest lines are great narrative adventures with cool details that bring it all to life. I can't wait for you to play through them.  \nScoured Plains illustration two-page spread.\nAlso, now that the cards are all in color I may as well make the books full color, right? Here is a preview of the Scoured Plains environment two page spread. Kinda neat, eh?\nIncluded in Adventurer Pledge and Above. Available as an Add-On during this campaign only.\nTo celebrate the launch of The Volgelands, I sculpted an exclusive miniature of Vandas Greycloak: the Torment of Dusk. Vandas is one of the cruel Dark Wanderers featured in the new book. This miniature will not be available for general release after this Kickstarter Campaign, so be sure that you don't miss out!\nThe Moldorfs come from a strange dwarven society deep underground. Utterly detached from the surface, these intrepid explorers set out to discover the truth about a mythical world... An \"outer land\" connected to an infinite \"outer space\". Though it is surely folly, a powerful hearthguard warrior and a razor sharp rogue join the Bibliothecary on this absurd quest. \nThe Moldorf Hearthguard\nA titanic underground world exists below our very feet. Immeasurable caverns spread into unknowable depths. Sprawling underground ruins extend into the shadowy abyss. It is from these depths that the Moldorfs emerge.\nMoldorf society is ruled by warlords from opposing houses. These households retain an elite core of Hearthguard warriors. In the tight corridors in which the hearthguard fight, they favor the use of massive shields and heavy war spears. From behind their brightly colored and richly decorated pavises, these fighters force their foes into unfavorable positions. \nTactically keen and lavishly equipped, the few Moldorf Hearthguard to reach the surface have quickly gained renown as formidable warriors.\nThe Shadowfoot\nShadowfoot belong to secretive clans. They are maniac rogues who stalk the shadowy depths with razor sharp daggers and dubious ambitions. In the complex political alliances between Moldorf houses, there is ample space for these shadowy agents. And though no household would ever admit to employing the Shadowfoot clans, a knife in the dark always has its place.\nThe quest to discover unknown realms promises both horrors and treasures. The opportunity to test their razor sharp skill is simply irresistible to these rogues. The Shadowfoot are ready to face anything the great unknown can throw at them, but is the greater world ready for them!?\nThe Moldorf Bibliothecaries\nThe Moldorf libraries contain countless manuscripts of the forgotten age. Arcane secrets were swallowed by the abyss and utterly lost. But so too, were the Moldorfs. Isolated from the powers that ravage the surface world, the Moldorfs learned magic from ancient texts. A strange wizard caste of librarians, or bibliothecaries, formed around the arcane arts. \nWithout the otherworldly patrons or raw creative energy present on the surface, the moldorf studies have naturally emphasized illusion magic. Though illusory magic is far less destructive than other forms, it is no less potent as they manipulate the battlefield. Bibliothecaries sew panic and chaos with massive illusory horrors and dazzling visions.\nAs the bibliothecaries collected and studied arcane writings, a strange sect began to believe in the existence of a surface world. They insisted the writings were not simply myths, but that they contain a metaphysical truth about the cosmic order. Now, these highly influential illusionists have gathered other bold explorers to their cause. They set out into the unknown. Traveling ever upward holding the ardent belief that a greater world exists in the unknown beyond. \nNeutral Alignment Faction!?\nThe Moldorfs are a neutral faction. That means any player, good or evil, may add Moldorfs to their party! Isolated underground, the Moldorfs have somehow avoided the cosmic struggle between good an evil. While players must still choose their alignment, neutral characters may be hired by any warband.\nWill you influence these strange subterranean explorers for good? Or will you manipulate them to serve your own selfish ambition? I guess we'll see... \nThe strange Lostwood stands to the west of Riverhold. It is the source of countless mysteries and haunting legends. The forests shifting boarders mark the boundaries of a most savage wilderness. Lone Guard watches stand vigilantly at its edge. Deep within the Lostwood stands an ancient empire ruled by the exile of the city of the dead, the immortal king Al'Adindred. \nThe Lostwood Enclave are a distinct faction who abide by the savage laws of nature. They are wanderers, protectors, and sages of the changed world. Though they are extremely dangerous, their souls are intimately tied to the advocate.\nThe Arboleth Sentinel\nThe arboleth are a powerful race of treefolk from deep within the mysterious Lostwood realm. They are slow to anger and deeply wise. Many proud generations have served the immortal king as peacekeepers. They are indomitable warriors naturally attuned with the will of the advocate. These singular beings are lawful, just, and frightfully strong. \nThe Wild Elf Pathfinder\nPathfinders are profoundly talented scouts able to navigate the most bewildering lands. They are keen hunters with the senses that reach beyond the physical realms. The wild elves are secretive nomads as a rule, however the pathfinders routinely interact with the greater world. \nOn certain foggy nights the Lone Guard are visited by these wanderers. They trade rare goods and exchange rumors before fading away as mysteriously as they came. There are even stories of pathfinders joining noble warriors on dangerous quests. The mist-like visitors lend their unearthly speed and stinging arrows to the righteous endeavor.\nWild Elf Druid and Cave Bear Form\nThe way of the Druid is a solitary existence. Druids are in communion with nature and abide within its savage laws. They take the shape of a wild beast and may spend years in this form without ever encountering civilization.\nThe shape of the mighty cave bear is among the most fearsome shapes a druid may choose. These powerful beasts can contend with the horrors and monstrosities that plague the land on equal terms. With tooth and claw these creatures are horrors in their own right.\nDRUID CREDIT OPTION:\nThe druid and bear are original sculpts from the first Relicblade release in 2015. The druid cards have been out of production for the past year, but with the Lostwood set she finds her place in a faction set with updated colored cards. \n2015 to 2018\nIf you already own the Druid and Bear figures you can opt for $10 credit toward add-ons instead of getting duplicate copies of these figures. You will get the Lostwood set without the druid and bear figures, but still receive the updated druid cards and the new elf and treeman figures. You will have the option to select a credit in the survey after the campaign ends.\nIn Relicblade, players recruit the ultimate squad of fantasy heroes or cruel villains as they battle for the fate of the world. Choose your path and gather the greatest warriors of the age to your cause! Enter a world of magical treasures, wonders, and horrors. Compete against rivals in the bitter struggle for supremacy! The rules are simple and easy to learn, but players are quickly engaged by deep tactical decisions.\nBehold! A disparate band of heroes set upon the path of the Advocate. A Moldorf Shadowfoot, Hellhound Berserker, Arboleth Sentinel, Cleric of Justice, and their Billman Companion.\nRelicblade \"factions\" represent groups that exist within the world. However, when you enter the game as a Seeker you choose between the good or evil alignments and gather heroes or villains to YOUR cause! Players use their influence to recruit characters.\nWill you be the fate that brings together a noble fellowship? Or will you bind wicked servants to your dark will!? \nA soldier pig, iguan poacher, ogre retiarius, dark watcher, and shild pig join forces on a dark quest.\nSpecialize your characters utilizing a vast arsenal of upgrade cards. Tactics, items, weapons, potions, and spells create the framework to customize your characters. Faction sets include a booster pack of cards with new characters and upgrades, so as each new set is released the options continue to grow with dynamic new list-building options. \nIn the example below this Iguan Slaver has a combination of defensive and ranged attack upgrades, which shifts his battlefield role and greatly increases his survivability. This particular build includes cards from The Wretched Hive, The Lone Guard, and Adventure Gear card pack.\n(some older cards were produced in black and white)\nWith the Seeker's Handbook campaign rules players construct a base and lead their characters on dangerous adventures to claim magical treasures. There are six scenarios, four environments, dangerous wild monsters, and rare treasures that pack each game with new dangers and unique challenges. The Seeker's Handbook is a wonderful source for limitless adventure. The Volgelands campaign book builds on the core rules in the Seeker's Handbook with tons of exciting new content. \nYou can learn a lot more about the game and how it's played on YouTube! There are gameplay overviews, unboxings, and battle reports ready to consume! Ash and Owen of Guerrilla Miniature Games and Gaming With The Cooler played multiple full Relicblade campaigns on their channels. So check it out!\nChoose the pledge level that's right for you. I try to offer pledge's suitable for a variety of hobbyists. From the ubiquitous PDF hoarder, to the much beloved completionist. To make things super easy I put the new stuff in one \"kickstarter recommended level\". \nThe \"Bold Adventurer\" pledge level is the core level for this campaign. It's the perfect level for new and veteran players. With these two faction sets you will be well equipped to enter the dangerous Volgelands. However, players will still need the core rules found in the Seeker's Handbook. You may purchase the book as an Add-on or purchase the book or a pdf right away from Relicblade.com/shop\nThe Champion of Adventure pledge level will equip you with everything you need for a FOUR PLAYER RELICBLADE CAMPAIGN!!! Is $180 kinda expensive? Sure, it is for me... but it's EVERYTHING you need for up to FOUR players to enter a world of adventure. Good luck getting your gaming group started on a new tabletop miniature game for less :)\nNow that you mention it, I spent that much on a single warband earlier this year... So I feel confident that this is an awesome value.\nWhat's a Custom Character Card?\nYou tell me about a D&D character you used to play or any character you can imagine. Then I will do an original illustration of that character. But the fun won't stop there! I will also stick that character on a special character card and make up some sweet rules and stats for your them! The custom card will be your ideas collaboratively realized in Relicblade. You're welcome to create heroes, villains, relics, or monsters, whatever your heart desires.\nYou get the digital artwork and copies of your character card along with the other Legends from this campaign. All ten custom character commissions will be collected in the \"Legends 4\" booster pack. This booster pack will be an official expansion for Relicblade for players to collect and enjoy. The first three Legends sets were extremely popular, so don't miss out on being part of a new generation of legends! \nMy sincerest hope is to raise enough money to produce the book and the two faction sets above. But as is Kickstarter tradition, I am happy to add a little wish-list in the form of stretch goals. There will be fewer than last year, but that's just because the core campaign has a heavy workload with an amazing book.\nStretch goals are a great way to boost the project outcomes as the budget increases. If we raise enough money to produce the new sets, then the money we continue to raise will push toward even more new content! Newly unlocked content will be available as Add-Ons once the goal is reached.\nGuest Artist: M\u00e1rk L\u00e1szl\u00f3\nThe Relicblade: Guest Artist Series RETURNS!! I'm honored to offer another excellent collaboration. As the creator of Relicblade I enjoy unbridled creative freedom. This privilege is granted by my generous Kickstarter Backers, so in this campaign I hope to extend the mantle of creative power to a guest artist! \nI love M\u00e1rk's style. He and I share a lot of the same influences. His work has tons of character with a mystical edge. He seemed like the perfect person to take my old idea for the Flame Bearer (crazed-fire-wizard) and transform it into something surprising and unique. I'm really delighted with the sketches he's sent so far, and I'm confident we're going to make an AMAZING miniature together!\nCard art by Mark Laszlo!\nHere is the proposed artwork and specs on the type of shirt we'll be using. \nVolgelands monsters have great art.\nThe add-on marketplace is a way to add a few extra items to your pledge. That way you can rest assured you are getting all the Relicblade goodness you can handle. To \"add-on\" simply increase your pledge total to include your selections. Then make a note of your choice so you can let me know what you wanted when the surveys go out! (Pro Tip: email yourself with the note so you can search for it later.)\nI highly recommend that new players pick up a copy of The Seeker's Handbook. You and a friend will be equipped to play a full campaign with this book and the Bold Adventurer pledge level.\nThe greatest testament to Relicblade is the amazing community on Facebook! \nDarkness force by Matt Lechtenberg\nThe group that has formed around RB is the best. They are kind, welcoming, and super talented! There are awesome battle reports, stunning paint jobs, and new friends waiting in the Relicblade Adventure Battle Friends. We have a forum available Here, too. But the facebook platform makes sharing photos and stuff super easy. So we tend to just use that the most.\nStonekin Battleborn by Mads", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have run three successful Kickstarter campaigns to create Relicblade and several expansions.

However, the pharmaceutical giant Parasol Incorporated has taken matters into its own hands and begun to lead cleanup efforts, a decision met with universal praise from the outside world.\nUnfortunately, for those within the nightmare, the corporation's arrival has made things worse. Their interests seem skewed, their actions are questionable, and since their \"efforts\" have begun, people have disappeared, strange mutated creatures have crawled out of the shadows, and what can only be described as monsters straight out of horror movies have begun to run rampant.\nNow, it is time for the survivors to fight. Fight for the truth ... and their futures.\nAftershock is a deluxe expansion for the Street Masters board game, adding four new fighter decks, four new stage decks, two new enemy decks, new loot cards, and much more! Expanding on the modular nature of Street Masters, Aftershock includes two new ways to customize your play experience: missions and showdowns.\nThe mission deck is included to speed up multiplayer games by adding additional ways to support your fellow fighters. Mission cards allow fighters to gain powerful mission tokens, that can in turn be used to assist your fellow fighters during their turn.\nShowdowns are a new type of story deck that can be used in any story mode game, adding a villainous character working in the shadows against the fighters. Each showdown deck introduces a unique story for the associated enemy deck, as well as upgrade cards that will truly test the fighters!\nPlayers can also choose to include these enemy upgrade cards in their arcade games to increase difficulty and customize their games even further.\nAdditionally, Aftershock comes packed in a massive storage box that is designed to hold all existing Street Masters decks and tokens, as well as room for future content.\n Find out more about the products in the Aftershock Tier: Aftershock (Details Part 1), Aftershock (Details Part 2), Essence of Evil\nFind out more about the products in the Street Masters Tier: Street Masters, Legend of Oni, KS1 Stretch Goals\nClick here to see us unbox the original Kickstarter lineup!\nStreet Masters is a 1-4 player cooperative miniatures board game inspired by classic beat \u2018em up & fighting video games.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to you all since final shipping sizes are unpredictable with a growing campaign. This also gives us more room for stretch goals and as much cool gameplay stuff as possible.\nAfter manufacturing, we'll ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. The following is a rough estimate for shipping a standard game package (approx. 4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any add-ons you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states ($50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico).\nCANADA: $12-$23 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries ($90 to Brazil).\nASIA: $15-20 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries; note that we cannot provide an estimated cost to Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia though they will be sent from China).\nOCEANIA: $20-$35 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$35 to most countries. $30-$40 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. $50 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. $60 to Iceland. $45 to Greece and Turkey. $70-$80 to Israel, and Liechtenstein. $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for our shipping/fulfillment partner to ship to there, such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Due to this, we will not ship to these areas.\nREFUND POLICY\nWe can refund you within 2 weeks (14 days) of the campaign\u2019s end date, fees included. After that, we will accept returns minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot get back from them after 14 days).

All refunds taking place within 14 days of the close of the campaign are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. Refunds taking place 14 days after the close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card, at our discretion.

Street Masters was fulfilled in June/July 2018 and has since received critical acclaim, resulting in it selling out. Thus this Kickstarter's theme is not only to offer new content and a great (and highly demanded) storage solution, but also to print more inventory from our first campaign\u2019s product lineup, giving backers a chance to get all of the things they missed the first time around, as well as allow us to get non-exclusive items to mass retail.\n\nCurrently, Brook City is in production at the manufacturer. Per our recent updates, we've approved all samples and they are in mass production, about 5 months early! Though we aren't physically involved until mass production is finished, it's equally important that we continue to communicate with them and our backers in order to provide the latest updates and news. Aftershock is extremely exciting, but we are also just as excited and committed to bringing Brook City to our backers' tabletops as soon as possible.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts with Kickstarter campaigns, and timing is often one of the biggest obstacles, especially for smaller publishers such as ourselves.

The medium wallet is roughly 4x4.5 inches and the small is 3.5x4 inches. We know what you're thinking, are they too small to draw or write in? No. The medium wallet sketchbooks are roughly 3.5 inches square and are great to draw or write in. Everybody loves to draw or take notes on Post-It Notes and these books are larger than those, plus the square format is great for posting to Instagram :-) The small Sketch Wallet books are 2.5x3.75 which are slightly bigger than a standard sketch card. It's a fun size to draw or write in while making it a great size for even a front pocket. Each version comes in black or brown leather or black or gray canvas. Plus we threw in a tweed version just for fun. Keeping our vegan friends in mind, we picked a herringbone pattern tweed that is made from cotton, not wool. The space for the pencil or pen is actually larger than our original size wallet opening up many possibilities for new tools to carry.\nMedium leather wallets come in black or brown\nMedium fabric wallets come in brown tweed, black and gray canvas\nSmall leather wallets coming in brown or black leather\nSmall fabric wallets come in brown tweed or black and gray canvas\n If you're new to Sketch Wallet...\nSketch Wallet is a great way to always have your sketchbook with you.

Zealot is back with our third Kickstarter, bringing to life this new range, with our usual reputation for quality and jaw-droppingly detailed miniatures.\nBack in 2014 we created a new level of Dungeon scenery, using digital production methods and detailed vacuum casting. Then last year, we breathed new life into a too-long forgotten fantasy race, the Minotaurs, which we are finishing the delivery of now - with delighted backers praising the detail and quality.\nThis time, we wanted to go back to our roots and tackle real heroes and villains, characters which capture our imaginations and make us remember why we started gaming or collecting.\nWe are heavily inspired by classic RPG games; playing old fantasy games from the 80s is what started all this madness in the first place!\nSo welcome to a fusion of past and present, new and old. We are updating, modernizing and offering to you, this range of high quality miniatures traditionally sculpted by the awesome miniature artist, Boris Woloszyn.\nIf you like what you see; Read on, brave adventurer.\n We don't produce board game counters, these are not PVC pencil toppers, injection moulded in china  - we make Miniatures. Resin and Metal, these are produced the same as they were 30 years ago, cutting no corners and not skimping on quality or detail. It's not the fastest or cheapest process, but it certainly is the best. If you want Miniatures which you will cherish and still want to use in another 30 years time, then these are for you.\n We have teamed up with Boris Woloszyn, a traditional putty sculptor from Brazil, these models are made by hand, no 3D printing involved (unusually for us!). Boris has a real talent as an artist, able to bring true character to each sculpt, I'm sure you will agree.\nThese models are heavily inspired by the classic games we grew up loving and playing with our families and friends. Just take a look at the greens, all made from putty.\nProduction of Boris's sculpts is done in three materials, Standard Resin, White Metal and Premium Resin. As we unlock each material in the stretch goals, you will have a choice to add which material you want.\nStandard Resin is one for the gamer, it is on par with a lot of other companies' resin materials, the details are good but the resin is not as tough and flexible as the Premium offering. There will be more splits and parts for each model when they are produced in this material.\nWhite Metal, that fabled shiny material which is fondly remembered by older gamers. When your army weighed more than a cinder block and dropping a Dragon model on your toes resulted in a trip to the hospital.\nIt's for the gamer or painter who wants a shot of nostalgia, feeling the weight in their hands. The details are good, the models are tough and it paints well. White metal does have more gates and vents to clean up from the model than resin models.\nPremium Resin is really a superior resin. It requires very few gates and vents, has a nice matte surface to paint, has 0.2% shrinkage and captures every detail of the original sculpt perfectly. It is tougher than Standard Resin with some flex to avoid damage. It cuts and files well when cleaning the model up or converting.\nPremium resin is the material for the serious painter or collector.\n All of the pledges you can supplement with \"Add Ons\" from the section below.\nMiniatures come in three tiers 'Hero Sized', 'Mighty Sized' and 'Monstrous Sized'. Green, Blue and Yellow Dots respectively.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, Forgotten Halls\nYou can add to your pledge with any of the following packs. Just increase your pledge by the amount needed.\nTo see each scenery piece in better detail, you can view them in our store by clicking here.\nHere is a gallery for each of the core Miniatures, stretch goal models can bee seen in the section below. The coloured dot on each image, indicates if they are \"Hero Sized\", \"Mighty Sized\" or \"Monstrous Sized\".\nEach model will come with a standard Plastic Round Base or Classic Rectangle base, as shown in the pictures. You can make your selection on the Pledge Manager after the campaign closes.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, 3DBases\n As funding progresses we will unlock stretch goals and extra miniatures. Below you can see what has been unlocked and what is the next goal coming up. The coloured dot on each image refers to the size. Green \"Hero Size\", Blue \"Mighty Size\" and Orange \"Monstrous Size\".\nWe are splitting the production into three tiers with the three types of material on offer. This should allow us to deliver to our deadlines as the load on each manufacturing method is reduced. Currently we have marked July 2019 as the delivery for this project. \nSince this is a traditionally sculpted project, Boris requires around 1 week to complete each additional sculpt, depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked, this could take a fair few months for him to complete the sculpting. You cant rush this kind of art!\nIf this is the case and we hit a lot of the planned stretch goals, we are happy to offer a split dispatch option, where the core models are dispatched early - since they are already in moulds and not far off mass production. There will be no problem delivering core models before the dispatch date.\nThen the stretch goal sculpts will follow some months later in wave 2.\nDue to the manufacture method of vacuum cast resin and spincast metals, dispatch date will depend a lot on amount that we fund. We will update this section once funding is underway and we have a better idea for how popular this will be. We do dispatch on a rolling backer ID system.\nIt may be possible to dispatch Standard Resin core miniatures ahead of the predicted delivery date.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, 3DBases\nMAXIMUM Postage Costs\nThese are the MAXIMUM postage costs for a large pledge. For example a pledge of 50 models in White metal would be these values. 50 models in resin, the postage is around half these values.\nPostage costs start at the values which are stated on each pledge (\u00a33 UK, \u00a34 EU and \u00a35 Rest of World) If you add more models and Add ons, postage costs will increase with weight. The end postage will be calculated by the pledge manager after the campaign end.\nPlease note, metal models are around 4 times as heavy as resin.\nThe end postage costs will be calculated on the Pledge Manager, but they will not exceed the postage values in the table below. These include tracked and signed for shipping.\nBy Adam Skinner", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will produce a new range of quality resin and metal Heroes and Monsters. The risks to this project are very minimal. We do this kind of production, every day for 8 years, producing miniatures for many high profile companies. All the core set of models are already ready to start mass manufacture. \n\nWe are not new to Kickstarter; our first Kickstarter was a colossal project ~200k resin cast pieces.\nWe delivered it and it was highly praised that \"the quality was beyond amazing\" and the detail was \"phenomenal\". Certainly achieving what we set out; to bring a new level of cutting edge dungeon scenery to gamers.\nOur second project, the Minotaur Horde, we are on track to deliver the last few hundred backers inside the next 2 months, and again the feedback was overwhelmingly positive by everyone receiving their pledge. \n\nRisk#1: Speed of manufacture.\nResin and Spincast Metal are labor intensive materials to cast with. If there are many stretch goals which we hit, then Boris will need more time to sculpt them. This will push back the start of manufacture. \n\nWhile there will be no problem delivering the core models by the estimated date. If the project funds well and many goals are hit - then we will offer a split shipping option, so core models are delivered on time, then stretch goal models get delivered in a wave 2 a few months later. \n\nAside from the risk of delayed dispatch of stretch goals, the risks are very minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "+ MANNA SHARER +", "descp": "A big thank you from the Twisting Catacombs backers, Zealot Miniatures and the RPG gamer community for helping us to create some awesome miniatures.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "+ SOLO HERO +", "descp": "One Hero-Sized Miniature of your choice, in Standard Resin.\nUpgrading material to White Metal or Premium Resin is an addition.\nHero-Sized Models are marked with a Green Dot.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["131 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a318 or more", "title": "+ ADVENTURE PARTY +", "descp": "Four Hero-Sized Miniature of your choice, in Standard Resin.\nUpgrading material to White Metal or Premium Resin is an addition.\nHero-Sized Models are marked with a Green Dot.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["334 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a362 or more", "title": "+ COLLECTOR +", "descp": "One of all the 13 models in the Core Kickstarter, in Standard Resin.

Or in the warband of any ambitious Warlord seeking fame and fortune gold and glory!\nLike walking piles of muscle held together by leather and chains and random plates of battered metal, the barbarian flings himself into the fray frothing at the mouth and shouting unintelligible obscenities. God knows they tend to die a lot so you'll need a lot of them.....so here we are!\nRed Box Games makers of awesomely designed, exquisitely sculpted and expertly cast fine fantasy 28mm scale miniatures is very proud to present!!\nWARBANDS OF WRATH AND RUIN\nWith your generous support we hope to fund the production of a series of new, finely detailed and beautifully sculpted, expertly produced,\" 28 mm \" scale barbarian miniatures which are the initial warband starter set for an all new small scale skirmish game set in a brutal, fallen fantasy world ruled by capricious Living Gods and beset by the ravages of their eternal war for survival and supremacy. The rules for the game are not quite ready for print yet but it is the goal of this campaign to fund this initial set of figures which will help us to also afford to finish the rules and get the production process for the rules and game components started.\nIn the game, Players take on the role of a powerful characters of super human or preternatural nature called \" Chosen \" in command of a small band of followers of various role and ability. These warbands , referred to in game as the \" Following \" expand in number and diversity as the Warlord grows in Power, Repute, Fortune and Favor of the Gods beginning in number between 6 and 9 followers, but growing to include as many as 24 followers at the Apex of the Chosen's Stature.\nFOLLOWERS\nThese followers may be lowly slaves, cultists, warriors, champions, and even monsters. But the core of any Chosen's following are the foot warriors.\nFOOT WARRIORS\nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any Chosen whose coin can fill their bowl or whose stature warrants following. \nPictured here still somewhat WIP these figures are semi modular for VERY expansive customization options and are cast in a very high quality lead free white metal. All modular fittings will be made in such a way as to insure easy secure assembly.\nThe items included in the pack are;\n10 barbarian foot warrior head / helm options\n6 right hand weapon options\n3 heavy weapon options\n3 heavy weapon foot warrior bodies\n5 weapon and shield foot warrior bodies\nAll this in one set for $40.00!! High quality, finely detailed metal minis for $5.00 Each!\n SOLOS\nSolos include both the companions and the Chosen themselves. These are the characters of the stories with the companions acting as a supporting role to the Chosen. Please note that any one of the foot warriors can be selected as a Solo option. \nPRIESTESS\nThe Priestess is a companion follower who serves as an intermediary between the Chosen and one of the Patron Gods of the world. Each Priestess is different and their uses can vary wildly based on the particular choices made during the creation of the character for use in the game but rest assured in this game a Chosen without some sort of spiritual aid is a Chosen set upon an arduous path.\nPictured here as a WIP the Priestess will be available in 2 different forms. One unclad and one half clad. The image above represents her unclad form. Her clad form will be slightly more modest.\nBackers can add additional copies of the Priestess to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\nBackers can also pledge for the Priestess figure ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nLESSER CHOSEN\nCurrently still WIP the Chosen will be finished very soon!\nThe Chosen are the scions of the Gods. Born from any strata of denizen in the realms these few are half mortal and half God, able to draw upon the ethereal energies of the cosmos to fuel superhuman feats of strength, speed, skill or to perform miraculous manipulations of the world around them. They can be man or woman marked by the touch of divinity with strange colored skin, hair, eyes, super human, or inhuman build or feature.\n Backers can add additional copies of Chosen to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\n Backers can also pledge for the Chosen figure(s) ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nPLEDGES\n As the funding allows I WILL add more options to the campaign. These will include Chosen of different nature to lead the Foot Warriors and companions of different role and nature to aid these Chosen in their quest for power, survival, glory, favor and fortune. I do not anticipate being able to add other foot warrior types to this campaign BUT I DO have plans for other various types of foot warrior to expand the range of theme of the game through future campaigns if this campaign does not reach a level of funding to allow them to be added during this campaign.\nBackers are free to add as many sets of foot warrior as they desire. This is accomplished by simply managing the amount of their pledge upward by enough value to cover multiple sets.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIt is our hope to be able to expand the total offering of this campaign to include Chosen and Companions of different character such as an Amazon, a Mutant, a Beast Man, and a Hoplite, as well as a Sorceror, Sorceress, Priestess and Mystic as well as different head options for the Human foot warriors, and possibly other foot warrior themes as well! We can only do this as funding allows however and we will need to cover the costs of each new addition BEFORE it is a selectable add-on or substitution.\nPRODUCTION\nWe have been producing miniatures in metal and resin for a long time..... 10 years actually. And in that time we have established strong stable partnerships with some of the best contractors in the industry. This project will be handled by one of those awesome professionals as well insuring promptly delivered awesomeness so that you can get started playing your games while the excitement is still fresh! This contractor is VERY well established in the industry having delivered in a timely fashion to high levels of quality on several very large products including many of my own Kickstarter projects. Their system of manufacture is very well tested and efficient to make sure that delivery is handled swiftly. And being based in the US this means no lengthy delays in delivery, and no unexpected complications in that process.\nSHIPPING\nWe will not accept any payment for postage through the kickstarter. So please be aware that all of the money you add to your pledge WILL be applied to a reward selection and NOT to the postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. I have learned the hard way several times that trying to predict the postage costs of rewards packages can very easily become a serious problem. \nYou will be billed for postage during the pledge manager phase of fulfillment which will be very shortly before delivery commences. We work to keep the postage costs as low as possible and we will be certain that your rewards are securely packaged so as to avoid any damage in transit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been working in the miniatures industry since 2006 and have been operating my own business producing miniatures since 2008. In that time I have produced several hundred different unique figures and shipped thousands of packages around the world. I have also established very close working relationships with several of the best contractors in the business.\nThere are always certain risks in any production but I feel that with my experience and relationships I can confidently say there is very minimal risk involved in this kickstarter due to the sheer amount of experience I have in making minis and the reliability and experience of my casting contractor. There may be certain fixes needed for optimal casting of the figures and there may be production delays as these fixes are made. If the project's scope grows beyond the initial offering it could also result in further delays as all fo the product is readied for delivery. The most reasonable risk I could assume worth being worries about would be a delay in postage or a sudden drastic increase in postage costs.

God knows they tend to die a lot so you'll need a lot of them.....so here we are!\nRed Box Games makers of awesomely designed, exquisitely sculpted and expertly cast fine fantasy 28mm scale miniatures is very proud to present!!\nWARBANDS OF WRATH AND RUIN\nWith your generous support we hope to fund the production of a series of new high quality, finely detailed and beautifully sculpted, expertly produced DURABLE and SUPPLE RESIN cast \" 28 mm \" scale barbarian miniatures which are the initial warband starter set for an all new small scale skirmish game set in a brutal, fallen fantasy world ruled by capricious Living Gods and beset by the ravages of their eternal war for survival and supremacy. The rules for the game are not quite ready for print yet but it is the goal of this campaign to fund this initial set of figures which will help us to also afford to finish the rules and get the production process for the rules and game components started.\nIn the game Players take on the role of a powerful characters of super human or preternatural nature called \" Chosen \" in command of a small band of followers of various role and ability. These warbands , referred to in game as the \" Following \" expand in number and diversity as the Warlord grows in Power, Repute, Fortune and Favor of the Gods beginning in number between 6 and 9 followers, but growing to include as many as 24 followers at the Apex of the Chosen's Stature.\nThese followers may be lowly slaves, cultists, warriors, champions, and even monsters. But the core of any Chosen's following are the foot warriors.\nFOOT WARRIORS\nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any \nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any\nThese figures are semi modular for VERY expansive customization options and are cast in a very high quality DURABLE RESIN that is VERY similar in feel and nature to HIPS but with the detail fidelity of Resin. We are VERY excited about this.\nThe items included in the pack are;\n10 Human Warrior head / helm options\n8 right hand weapon options ( 2 clubs, 2 swords, 1 spear, 2 axes, 1 javelin )\n4 heavy / long weapon options ( 1 spear, 1 club, 1 sword, 1 axe )\n5 weapon and shield warrior bodies\n1 weapon and javelin warrior body\n2 heavy weapon warrior bodies\n2 long weapon warrior bodies\nAll this in one set for $55.00!! High quality, finely detailed resin minis for $5.50 Each!\nPRIESTESS\nThe Priestess a companion follower who serves as an intermediary between the Chosen and one of the Patron Gods of the world. Each Priestess is different and their uses can vary wildly based on the particular choices made during the creation of the character for use in the game but rest assured in this game a Chosen without some sort of spiritual aid is a Chosen set upon an arduous path.\nThe Priestess is an automatic addition to any \" Foot Warriors \" pledge and is available in two different forms; Unclad ( pictured above ) and half clad ( not yet pictured ). Her Unclad form is kickstarter exclusive and will not be available outside of the kickstarter. Backers will be able to select which form of figure they want to receive as part of their rewards in the pledge manager phase of the fulfillment.\nBackers can add additional copies of the Priestess to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\nBackers can also pledge for the Priestess figure ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nPLEDGES\nTo keep the campaign simple there is only one pledge level available from the outset of the campaign. As the funding allows I WILL add more options to the campaign. These will include Chosen of different nature to lead the Foot Warriors and companions of different role and nature to aid these Chosen in their quest for power, survival, glory, favor and fortune. I do not anticipate being able to add other foot warrior types to this campaign BUT I DO have plans for other various types of foot warrior to expand the range of theme of the game.\nBackers are free to add as many sets of foot warrior as they desire. This is accomplished by simply managing the amount of their pledge upward by enough value to cover multiple sets.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIt is our hope to be able to expand the total offering of this campaign to include Chosen and Companions of different character such as an Amazon, A Mutant, a Beast Man, and a Hoplite, as well as a Sorceror, Sorceress, Priestess and Mystic as well as different head options for the Human foot warriors, and possibly other foot warrior themes as well! We can only do this as funding allows however and we will need to cover the costs of each new addition BEFORE it is a selectable add-on or substitution.\nPRODUCTION\nWe have been producing miniatures in metal and resin for a long time..... 10 years actually. And in that time we have established strong stable partnerships with some of the best contractors in the industry. This project will be handled by one of those awesome professionals as well insuring promptly delivered awesomeness so that you can get started playing your games while the excitement is still fresh! This contractor is VERY well established in the industry having delivered in a timely fashion to high levels of quality on several very large products. Their system of manufacture is very well tested and efficient to make sure that delivery is handled swiftly. And being based in the US this means no lengthy delays in delivery, and no unexpected complications in that process.\nSHIPPING\nWe will not accept any payment for postage through the kickstarter. So please be aware that all of the money you add to your pledge WILL be applied to a reward selection and NOT to the postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. I have learned the hard way several times that trying to predict the postage costs of rewards packages can very easily become a serious problem. \nYou will be billed for postage during the pledge manager phase of fulfillment which will be very shortly before delivery commences. We work to keep the postage costs as low as possible and we will be certain that your rewards are securely packaged so as to avoid any damage in transit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been working in the miniatures industry since 2006 and have been operating my own business producing miniatures since 2008. In that time I have produced several hundred different unique figures and shipped thousands of packages around the world. I have also established very close working relationships with several of the best contractors in the business.\n\n There are always certain risks in any production but I feel that with my experience and relationships I can confidently say there is very minimal risk involved in this kickstarter due to the sheer amount of experience I have in making minis and the reliability and experience of my casting contractor. There may be certain fixes needed for optimal casting of the figures and there may be production delays as these fixes are made. If the project's scope grows beyond the initial offering it could also result in further delays as all fo the product is readied for delivery. The most reasonable risk I could assume worth being worries about would be a delay in postage or a sudden drastic increase in postage costs. An Increase in postage costs is VERY unlikely though as the time frame between funding and delivery on this project will be very short.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "tre manor\n17 created \u00b7 57 backed\nI am a sculptor of table top miniature figures for fantasy gaming.

Also for JUST $40.00 USD.\n     See? Not much math stuff, lots of Orcs and Goblins. Who needs them book learnin talkie times anyways? Not Gobbers and Orcsies don't.\n     It is our hope that as the campaign progresses we can add items to the offering and perhaps to the initial box contents as well HOWEVER as this is our first effort in plastic manufacturing we want to be sure we are responsible and take this slowly keeping everything nice and predictable and efficiently produced and delivered. So there will only be a few additions to this campaigns. We don't want to get too ahead of ourselves with promises but we also want to make sure we make the most of this campaign that we can. You CAN NOT go wrong with more and more monstrous beasties eh?\n\n    Please be aware you can buy as many of these boxes as you want! Personally I don't think any orc or goblin warband is complete unless it nearly breaks the shelves under it's ponderous weight when stowed away between sessions of rampaging blood thirst. \n   If you want to add to your rewards you can do so by managing the amount of your pledge upward by enough to cover the addition of as many green hellions your heart desires. \n  And remember a forest without goblins under every hedge is just not a forest worth trodding through for any self respecting adventurer!

THE HORDES OF THE AULD WORLD ORCS AND GOBLINS BOXED SET!!\n   The whole idea of this kickstarter is to fund the production of these fantastic monstrosities in high detail hard grade PVC plastic similar to many of the newly beloved board games recently hitting the market like a spiked ball of steel in the gnarly green fist of a feral Orc berserker rampaging through the ranks of silly tights wearing doods who spend all their time preening their poofy feathered hats and shining their armor and dancing with their little swishy poke \" swords \" and singing songs about damsels and wine and stupid stuff. Do we really want those kinds of doods in charge of stuff and ruining our good time? No. No we do not. We want Orcs and goblins. Lots of them. That is why plastic is good; cause we can make a LOT of them and sell them cheap.\n\n  So to help us do this well we need your help to allow us to pay the high cost of plastic production with tried and true manufacturers who have produced many of these exact same great boxed game projects.\n   Ok this is serious. Shipping is important and can be costly depending upon where in the world you need your stuff to be delivered to. Because we do not know exactly when the project will complete production we cannot bill for postage until the product is actually in hand and ready to deliver. We are working to build a base frame of reference for the shipping costs and we are also working to establish relationships that may allow us to ship from hubs in various parts of the world to mitigate those costs. \n   We will work to keep the postage costs as low as possible cause we don't really want to make money from shipping we just want to get your stuff to you as soon as possible cause once you know you have orcs and goblins on the way.... well they just need to get there fast and cheap right? \n   For now though the only region in which we can reasonably project postage costs is the US. We will be shipping orders via priority mail so as long as your stuff fits into a priority box ( and we will be working to make sure that they do ) you can expect to pay the priority mail shipping rates.\nAnd Say!

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our Kickstarters, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital.

The game features highly detailed miniatures and the Modular Deck System (MDS) introduced in Street Masters. In the game, players take on the role of heroic cops inspired by classic action movies and are tasked with protecting the city from the recent rise in criminal activity. Each game is dictated by the chosen criminal deck and case deck. These decks are modular and the different combinations of decks create unique experiences each game.\nThe game is played on a beautifully illustrated board of the city, where the cops must run or drive to various locations and bust up crimes. While cops start the game with a standard issue B.C.P.D. Cruiser, they can also commandeer many other types of vehicles on the streets of Brook City.\nEach cop in Brook City plays differently thanks to each having their own unique cop deck. Cop decks include encounter cards, ability cards, and tactic cards to represent each cop\u2019s unique strengths and strategy to take on the criminals underworld.\nWhile the cops try to crack the case, their prime suspect is represented by the criminal deck. Each criminal deck contains at least 1 suspect card, as well as a slew of crime cards that spawn crew members around the city to interfere with your detective work. If cops ignore these criminal masterminds while trying to pin the crime on them, things may just get seriously out of hand\u2026\nCase decks represent the cops\u2019 overall goal of the game. While keeping the criminal under control, they must also concentrate on working their way through the case. Each case has special rules governing how cops can interact with clue cards and get their hands on enough evidence to bring the criminal to justice. In addition to clue cards, case decks include a variety of events that are designed to hinder the cops or punish them for not making enough progress solving the case.\nYou don\u2019t have to take our word on how the game plays. Please click HERE to read a draft of the rulebook.\nBrook City features a variety of highly detailed miniatures, which are used to mark the location of the cops, criminals, and crew throughout the city. With our experience producing miniatures in our previous game, Street Masters, we are confident in the level of detail and overall quality of the miniatures that will be in this game. While we were extremely happy with the miniatures in Street Masters, we learned some tricks to improve them even more for Brook City.\n         Blacklist Games is committed to publishing only high quality games. Please watch this video of Adam and Brady unboxing a production copy of Street Masters:\nAs you can see from the video, great care was taken to ensure every component was of the best quality possible. Backers of this campaign can feel confident that the same amount of care and attention to detail will be taken with Brook City as well.\nLike many other publishers, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to to you all since final shipping sizes are unpredictable with a growing campaign. Plus this gives more room to pool into stretch goals and as much cool gameplay stuff as we possibly can.\nAfter manufacturing, we'll ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Following, is a rough estimate for shipping a standard game package (approx. 4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any add-ons you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. ($30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.)\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $15-20 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia).\nOCEANIA: $15-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. AFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries. $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. $60 to Iceland and Israel. $45 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for our shipping/fulfillment partner to ship to such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Due to that we will not ship to these areas.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing our successful campaign for Street Masters: Rise of the Kingdom, we've taken what we've learned from production, shipping and fulfillment to strive for an even smoother experience from start to finish, continuing to focus on overall quality.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts from the Kickstarter, production, manufacture, to fulfillment, then distribution. Timing seems to be one of the biggest obstacles in many campaigns, especially from small, indie publishers such as ourselves. Fortunately, we've got experienced game designers working hard to ensure the gameplay offers the best experience it can be; we have strong relations with the factory/manufacture; we have a shipment/fulfillment company already signed on; we are completely passionate about our games; and most important, we care about our backers.\n\nWe also understand there may still be confusion about our first campaign, as it was a card game that we cancelled. It didn't receive the momentum it needed due to us purchasing the rights from a publisher that has not had much luck in the industry. Currently we're developing an app for the game and tightening up some of the original rules and cards in order to release it under our brand at a future date. Doing this will give us the time we need to ensure that the game will make a great edition to our library as well as yours.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 89 or more", "title": "Rookie Tier", "descp": "Included is the Core Game designed by Adam and Brady Sadler with 51 miniatures, 341 cards, a beautiful game board of Brook City, custom dice, and all Unlocked Stretch Goals!\nINCLUDES:\nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals\nBrook City \"Core\" Game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["125 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "Officer Tier", "descp": "Included is the Core Game designed by Adam and Brady Sadler plus the Exclusive \"Keys to the Kingdom\" expansion that stars Ying Hua and Ah Long (from Street Masters) in a unique storyline that brings you even more content and even 3 crossover cards that make their Brook City version playable in Street Masters!

They had been curious of course, and there was much speculation as to what was on the other side, but as the hill had been inhabited by Gnomes who didn't take kindly to such impudent questions, the matter was largely left alone.\nNow, seemingly in the middle of the night, the gnomes have disappeared, and the big question (apart from where have all the gnomes gone) of what lies on the other side of the hill is now very much the talk of the town.  Some think it might be an orchard, full of apples.  Others, that a very big dragon has eaten all the gnomes and may well be coming for them next.\nThe Halfling Town Council declared an emergency meeting, and decided there's only one way to be sure - an adventure.  Under such dire circumstances, they are seeking brave (or at least moderately confident) adventurers, from different backgrounds to form a Party (the very worst kind, without cake or even paper hats) to investigate the other side of the hill...\nNinjas in the Pantry - Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nWe are very pleased to announce that we have made our stretch goal to unlock the Halfling Ninja class!

It had been decided however, that eager though the bakers were, they were far too vital to the town to risk, and that something else was needed. At that moment, from out of the shadows of the room, two totally silent black-clad figures triple back-flipped into the interview chairs.\n\"And you are...\"\nAs suggested by one of our loyal customers, we present a male and female halfling ninja from one of the more obscure character classes. \nShould we reach \u00a37000, then we will include one of each miniature free with every Halfling Lady and Gentlemen Adventurers pledge, and the appropriate one free with each Ladies or Gentlemen Adventurers pledge.  Backers who pledge for a single or double miniature set will be able to choose one of these miniatures as one of their options.\nMidlam Miniatures are pleased to present a collection of sixteen 28mm scale halfling miniatures for use in all of your fantasy games.\nChoosing Your Class\nWe have chosen a range of different character classes for the 'A Class of Their Own' Kickstarter, which we hope will help flesh out your fantasy adventures. However, while we couldn't include all the possible choices in the campaign, we will consider any suggestions for a follow up Kickstarter in the future, should this Kickstarter is successful.  Please leave any suggestions (from the obvious to the obscure) in the comments page!\nAbout Midlam Miniatures and Our Kickstarters \nThis is our ninth Kickstarter, and we are using it to help develop and extend our range of miniatures, in this case, halflings! \nWe have been very grateful to all the support we have received in the past and hope you will join us on our latest project. Our eight previous Kickstarters - Wizard Apprentices, Wizard Halflings, Cultists of the Kraken Lord, Servants of the Undead Pharaoh, Halfling Adventures, Winter Adventurers, Common or Garden Gnomes and the Ghosts of Midlam Manor have all successfully funded.\nA Note on Metal\nThe miniatures are cast in a high quality pewter, with a high Tin content, but may contain a small quantity of lead. We unfortunately cannot guarantee lead free models. Most 'lead free' metal usually contains a small amount of lead to help the metal flow into the mould. \nAnticipated Delivery Date\nThe delivery date of July 2018, is our shipping date, rather than an arrival date. As we ship all over the world, delivery times will vary considerably, even within the same countries. From our experience, the majority of deliveries take as little as a couple of days (UK), to a couple of weeks (international) although we have found a minority of deliveries can take up to (and in rare cases more than) a month to arrive. We ask you to please be patient as it is our experience that almost all deliveries do arrive safely at their destination. \n All images and miniatures are \u00a92018 Midlam Miniatures.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks are low, though there is always a small chance that, for one reason or another, a figure does not cast properly.\n\nIn these unlikely circumstances we would either get a replacement mould or commission a sculpt by the original sculptor, matching the original as closely as possible, with whatever modifications are necessary for the miniatures to cast correctly.\n\nShould this happen, the estimated release date of July 2018 for all miniatures could be pushed back by a month or two until any problem was fixed. Although, across all eight of our Kickstarters, we have only had one serious issue with a miniature, which in the end, only added a couple of weeks to shipping.\n\nWe strive to keep people updated at all stages of production to let them know how the manufacturing is going.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a33 or more", "title": "The Lone Adventurer", "descp": "Sponsor the Halfling Town Council to send one Adventurer on the Great Expedition.\nBy choosing this reward you will receive 1 Halfling Miniature of your choice as a reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers", "Limited (93 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a36 or more", "title": "An Adventuring Duo", "descp": "Sponsor the Halfling Town Council to send two Adventurers on the Great Expedition.\nBy choosing this reward you will receive 2 Halfling Miniatures of your choice as a reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["50 backers", "Limited (50 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a320 or more", "title": "Halfling Gentlemen Adventurers", "descp": "Sponsor the Halfling Town Council to send 8 Halfling Gentlemen Adventurers on the Great Expedition.\nBy choosing this reward you will receive all 8 Halfling Gentlemen Miniatures as your reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["10 backers", "Limited (490 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a320 or more", "title": "Halfling Lady Adventurers", "descp": "Sponsor the Halfling Town Council to send 8 Halfling Lady Adventurers on the Great Expedition.\nBy choosing this reward you will receive all 8 Halfling Lady Miniatures as your reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Limited (494 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a335 or more", "title": "Halfling Lady and Gentlemen Adventurers", "descp": "Sponsor the Halfling Town Council to send all 16 Halfling Adventurers on the Great Expedition.\nBy choosing this reward you will receive all 8 Halfling Lady Miniatures and all 8 Halfling Gentlemen Adventurers as your reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["248 backers", "Limited (252 left of 500)"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "High Priests, Explorers and Bandaged Wrapped Undead in 'To the Mummy's Tomb' Expedition", "update_content": "To the Mummy's Tomb!\nIntroducing a series of  Eight Fantasy Miniatures in 28mm scale from a halfling expedition to the burial grounds of their cousins, in the desert southlands."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "How, a Class of Their Own, gave rise to latest project Classic Cloaked Halflings", "update_content": "We had a great reception to this oddball bunch of halflings, so thank you all again for your support.

Thrall and Brute\nSpetznaz Greens are Done\n The US mech armed with pile driver and grenade launcher will have this frame.  \nPLAY\n\nUS and Russian Mechs\nRussian Mechs\nUS Mechs\nHello Kickstarter Patrons,\nWe at Impulse Miniatures are looking to kick start our first miniature game \"The Evolved\".  This 28mm mech focused game gives you control over mechs, infantry vehicles and The Evolved.  The game play is fast paced, full of tactics, and strategy.  The setting is based in the modern day with some futuristic advancements.  Players can look to see modern day weapons and vehicle designs.  The story is something new that we believe players will find fresh and intense, and we can\u2019t wait to share it with you.\nAfter the Kickstarter we will continue to produce models for the 3 armies and have another army in the works. There are several additional units currently planned for each army.  The US army has an infantry team with large caliber sniper rifle, anti tank gun team, and anti infantry gun team. For US mechs, an anti infantry mech, a leader only mech, and a close quarters mech with pile driver.  For the Russians, a heavy cannon team, RPG team, and mortar team.  For the Russian mechs, a riot shield and shotgun armed mech, leader mech, and one armed with high explosive rockets.  The evolved will gain a heavy armored infantry unit, an infantry unit with ranged weapon, a faster moving large creature, and one with ranged.  These will be added as additional stretch goals if the kickstarter reaches all of the current stretch goals.  All of the current stretch goals and the ones mentioned above are in the rule book, and will be included in the pdf rules sent to all backers.  A printed rule book will be available shortly after the kickstarter as well.  \nThe evolved are humans that have the ability to control nanite swarms.  After being experimented on by scientists from the US, they broke free.  In their wake they left cities in ruins.  They lead armies of humans that  have been taken over by the nanites.  The nanites change the humans from the inside out.  The evolved brutes are formed from the melding of nanites with larger beasts and in other cases several human hosts.  They are the wrecking balls of the evolved armies.  The evolved have also learned how to use nanites to take control of mechs whose pilots have been killed but are otherwise still operable.  They are less accurate and agile, but provide  needed ranged attacks to the evolved armies.  The evolved army is a swarm army with powerful technomancers able to deal damage and heal thanks to their nanite abilities.  \nSo far we have the US, and Russian Mechs completed and ready for production. This Kickstarter will be funding the infantry and expansions. This is just the beginning of The Evolved universe with many more units and models planned for the future!  Our manufacturer is US based and used by many other companies with a proven track record.  \nThank you for being apart of our Kickstarter and helping us to bring The Evolved to life.\nSTRETCH GOALS!!!!\n$8500 \nRussian Mech with Howitzer\nRussian Howitzer\nUS Mech with High Caliber Rifle\nUS Heavy Rifle\n $10,000- \n-US Stingray variant armed with pile driver and grenade launcher\n-Russian Black Bear Variant armed with riot shield and automatic shotgun\n$12,000\n- US Infantry Heavy Armor Squad.

Evolved Leaders are strong technomancers able to control swarms of nanites, transforming fallen enemies into servants of their wil, interfering with the systems of enemy mechs, and even creating brutes from fallen enemies and nanite swarms.  \nThis is the first miniature for the evolved, and to celebrate every backer will receive this model for free.\n$18000\n-The Evolved infantry.  Assimilation of human and nanites, these creatures serve the will of the Technomancers.  They are quick, able to heal damage and deadly up close.  \n$20000\n-The Evolved Brute.  Massive creatures created by the technomancers.  They tower at over 10 feet tall.  Metallic protrusions, incredible strength, ability to heal wounds.  They are horrendous creatures to encounter in the field.  Able to tear a mech apart with brute strength.  \n$25000\n-To celebrate the initial models for The Evolved miniatures game being funded, Every backer will receive a Kickstarter only SGT Jack Savage Model.\n$30,000\n-The Evolved Corrupted mech.  The strongest technomancers are able to overcome mechs and their pilots taking control of the mech and corrupting it to their will.  These are less accurate and responsive than normal mechs, but provide much needed ranged support to the evolved armies.  \n$35,000\n-Japanese Mech.  Japanese mechs are the most nimble and agile of the mechs.  The have the most overdrive points of all the mechs, and the highest evasion roll.  \n$37,500\n-Japanese Infantry.

Civilization for Sauracens has risen to celestial heights and fallen to their archaic origins many times as their knowledge ebbs and flows as with the cycles of the great celestial mechanism. Those retaining knowledge of archaic technologies still travel the stars searching for the mythical home of their origin to which they are instinctively as a species driven to return. As the navigator/priests identify each newly discovered planet, they pray to the celestial consciences that the long lost home of their origin will finally be rediscovered and bring some peace to the wander lust they have not yet managed to suppress.\nMETALS\n This project is for unpainted, white metal figurines. Models are provided NOT painted. Models are scaled to 28mm toe to eye or 1:60. Models are provided with a plastic tab/slot base. White metal figurines are not toys and are intended only for adults.

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our Kickstarters, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital. What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures with capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day. All molding and casting is done in house by our dedicated staff of three well experienced individuals. Only the sculpting is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. We have, so far, completed 5 Kickstarter projects and a 6th project on track for completion before the end of this campaign. A quick look at our previous Kickstarters will show that we shipped rewards to backers well ahead of schedule. We believe we have a 100% backer satisfaction record after five successful kickstarters and a 6th one in process.

We have returned again to kickstarter in the hopes to fund our newest selection of fantasy norse figures that we call the Njorn. \n  Our intention is to fund the production of a new set of heroes and their faithful follower rank and file troops. We also intend to fund the set up of our in house production capacity! This means buying a spin caster, a smelter, all the various periphery of safe casting, metal shelves to hold molds ( LOTS of molds ) having our molds shipped to us from the various contractors we currently partner with, and raw metal to do the casting with. Being set up for in house production will allow us to reinvest in the various aspects that will make your experience with Red Box Games more efficient and better presented, as well as allow us to manage our working capital MUCH more efficiently.\n  We currently reinvest a disproportionate amount of our profits into maintaining reasonable stock levels across the entire breadth of the red box games line. This is a HUGE investment that grows every time we add new products to the line. It also means we have to rely on kickstarters much more because we simply cannot afford to just put new items in to the store without knowing that the funds are already there to pay for the production and stocking of said items.\n\n  Once set up for casting we will be able to keep the funds of the business' success where it belongs, in the future of the business. It also has the added advantage of allowing us to afford lower prices across the board and able to take chances on items which are too risky to produce through out sourcing such as larger monsters and cavalry and Rank and File sets appropriately priced for army building. \n\n  To insure that the high level of quality you have come to expect from Red Box Games is faithfully maintained, I will be training in casting with a VERY talented and experienced mold maker and caster. I wont be handling the entire burden of casting right away so there is no need to worry that this development will slow down delivery of the Kickstarter or the regular course of business for RBG.\n\n  My molds will continue to be made by one of the industry's best studios as well so there is no need to worry that the burden will overwhelm me or that the overall quality of the Red Box Games product will suffer.\n\n  I cannot do any of this without your help so please consider backing this kickstarter! You will get some really cool stuff for a GREAT price in a reasonable amount of time and I will FINALLY be able to set up for my own production and make some real progress in this industry!\n\n  AAAaaannndddd without further Adieu...... ON TO THE MINIATURES!!!\n We intend to fund as many figures as this kickstarter will allow and at the outset of the campaign we have 19 figures ready to go with a few slight details needing to be added before they are ready for production and I still have several more underway which will be shown as they are completed and added to the campaign as the funding allows. \n   Please se as follows for the full selection of miniatures offered in this campaign;\n  KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!! Thorarnr the Storm Hammer!!\n  available as a free addition to all pledges of Warband or Alla Njorngarna but available as a selection option or $8 add-on as well!\n       Any of the miniatures shown above can be selected as singular selections. or the entire group can be selected. \n Backers can pledge for an entire warband ( 25 figures in total as of the launch of the campaign ) cast in high quality white metal, or pick and choose individual figures from the selection funded by this campaign.\nHERO ..................This pledge level rewards backers with 1 copy of any one of the figures successfully funded through this campaign cast in high quality white metal.\nCOUNCIL.......

However some figures may need to be cast in multiple parts to allow for the most reliable casting. These figures will also be cast in high quality lead free white metal as well.\n All packages will be shipped in BOXES rather than envelopes with any appropriate extra packaging needed to insure your rewards are delivered perfectly intact. It is my hope to also be able to invest in some fancy schmancy marketing materials and snazzy packaging to go in with your beautiful Red Box games minis.\nAll packages will be fullfilled from the United States. Postage will be collected within the kickstarter pledge. However it is not always possible to predict when / if postage costs increase to deliver to foreign countries. As a result we must reserve the right to bill for any additional postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. We do not try to profit from the postage of our packages and will always keep the cost of delivery exactly in line with the actual costs.\n For those who are unfamiliar with me as a sculptor and with my business red box games I am a sculptor of finely detailed 28mm scale fantasy miniatures.

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our last Kickstarter at more than double the funding level, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital. What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?\nKicktraq\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and Challenges\n\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures and capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day. All molding and casting is done in house by our dedicated staff of three well experienced individuals. Only the sculpting and printing is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. We have, so far, completed 4 Kickstarter projects.

Lead the sinister Wretched Hive in a dangerous criminal underground, or find yourself entangled in the strange motives of the inscrutable Wilderkin.\nThe Wretched Hive Kickstarter campaign offers the opportunity to add amazing new characters to Relicblade. New Faction Sets not only present the chance to expand the game, but also offer a great entry point for new players. The Wretched Hive Kickstarter campaign promises to deliver all-new factions, characters, unit types, upgrades, and powerful magic spells. These faction sets have been meticulously designed to add exciting new play-styles to Relicblade!\nGet both of the new expansions and eight incredible metal miniatures with the recommended Bold Adventurer pledge level!\n The Wretched Hive\nIn The Wretched Hive we delve into the sinister underworld that exists on the fringes of society.\nThe iguan are a ubiquitous reptilian race whose myths claim a primordial origin predating all human civilization. The pragmatic iguan do not build cities of their own, but rather opt to live in nomadic groups operating with a network of semi-permanent encampments on the outskirts of large cities. Traveling bands will meet to trade with the settled iguan, who in turn offer goods and services to the wider markets. \nDue to their peculiar psychology many iguan find full integration into civilized life distasteful and traditionally work as laborers and sailors. They never shy from dangerous work, and take special pride in their ability to endure. Despite the obvious value of strong workers, the complex cruelty of civilization has branded the iguan as the lowest class. Merchants gain hordes of wealth while the workers struggle to survive. \nIn the absence of true justice, following the law is a luxury few can afford. Thus we enter the vile black markets of the Wretched Hive. Where cruelty is the law and only the strong survive. \nThe slave trade is perhaps the most depraved of the black market practices. The legality of slavery may vary from kingdom to kingdom, but legal status only truly changes how public the slave auctions are. \nThe Iguan Slavers are powerful fighters and bitter task masters.These depraved individuals offer harsh motivation to their comrades in brutal fashion. Slavers are rightly feared for the sinister depths of their inhumanity.\nPoachers are almost universally nomadic in origin. Many ply their humble, if illegal, trade as hunters. However, in the harsh depths of the black market, not every poachable entity is a beast.\nThe brutal wilderness takes its toll on nomadic tribes. In the harshest seasons many poachers turn their unmatched skill as scouts and trackers to the benefit of dangerous crime lords. With highly valuable skills and keen javelins, these deadly warriors are rightly prized.\nAccording to their customs a select few are chosen and groomed from birth to assume a terrible duty. The elder crone prepares these youth for many years. Until the fateful day they must read from the unpronounceable black pages of agog. The black pages tether the iguan to their primordial gods. As the chosen study the dizzying passages their inner minds are assailed by terrible dimensions beyond reality. \nSadly, many are utterly consumed by madness. Those who survive are honored and assume their place as iguan witches. These witches are respected councilors and powerful sorcerers. They peer into the void to observe the threads of fate, command plagues, and call upon the boiling depths of the earth. These powerful women form an integral core of iguan political and religious society.\nNomadic iguan have formed strange alliances in their bid for survival. One such partnership is with a the mangrove basilisk. A long snouted sub-species endemic to the brackish badlands.\nThese cold-blooded beasts have a near super-natural hypnotic gaze and are extremely venomous. The Iguan Witches made connections with the beasts and have used them as powerful assets for generations. These pitiless creatures grant an exotic edge to an iguan fighting force. They paralyze combatants as swift warriors descend upon their ill-fated foe.\nThe Wilderkin\nWilderkin is a broad term describing individuals of fay ancestry. Elves, while rare, are the most common in settled society. However, the term Wilderkin is often reserved for more conspicuous outlanders.\nIt is generally believed that the fay realm and ours were more closely tied in ancient times. In the terrible cataclysm known as the sundering, when great empires were brought low and from which there is only a faint hope of recovery, the relationship between realms was irrevocably changed. In this new and unstable landscape the otherworldly races adapted in strange and marvelous ways. From the peculiar gnomes to the indomitable stonekin, the Wilderkin abide by their inscrutable ways.\nGnomes are largely unchanged by our changed world. Gnome interactions have always been centered on their fanatical devotion to craft. These pint-sized hobbyists have only the slightest concern for the greater world. They are even known to forget entirely the plight of our modern age! Instead they focus with razor precision on mastery of a given craft. \nGnomes are still intimately tied to the fay realm and may even travel between worlds. Accordingly they are visitors with minor alliances to a select few. It seems their primary endeavor in our world is to explore their passions. Once a gnome fixates on a craft they are utterly obsessed. They may be captivated by anything from shoe-making to the most complex alchemical sciences.\nDue to their tiny stature, gnomes rarely travel without an animal companion. They have been seen riding everything from common mountain goats to exotic creatures only imagined in the most obscure folklore.\nThe stonekin were elves once. In the tumultuous years when civilization collapsed a sect of mystical artisans took extreme measures to survive. In desperation they placed irreversible enchantments on their families, forever changing their bodies to lifeless stone.\nWith a faint hope the artisans went to work. Employing unknowably ancient secrets, once used to create marvels beyond reckoning, the artisans worked into the fading twilight of all civilization to finish their final masterpiece. The world burned, but the work was complete.\nThe stonekin were born. The artisans had saved their beloved people. A new race, half-elf and half-stone, arose. They were completely alive, not living statues or enchanted stone. The stonekin were reforged in the fires of a dying world, and emerged a race fit to survive in the coming dark age.\nThe Battleborn comfortably faces multiple combatants.\nMany stonekin live peaceful lives as farmers and artisans. However the brutality of the changed world demands certain concessions. The battleborn are a reserved caste of fearless warriors. They stand as the definition of stonekin fortitude and strength. The stonekin battleborn are imposing giants hardened for the rigors of battle.\nSummon explosive stone spires to smash your enemies.\nThe wild elves owe their earnest allegiance to nature and regarded the sundering as a natural shift. Embracing the chaotic heart of creation, the wild elves humbly adapted in the midst of mass extinction. They plunged themselves deeper into asceticism and immersed themselves in the changed environment. Some individuals became indistinguishable from nature itself.\nThe wild elf druids adopted powerful beast forms to live in brutal harmony with the wilderness, while the geomancers tap into surging rivers of energy that course through the earth. Embracing the wilderness, the geomancers enjoy a place of privilege in a chaotic world. Though they are wanderers in a savage wilderness, geomancers compose themselves in complex formalities and are utterly dedicated to the discipline of the earth. As servents of the enigmatic wilds, the geomancers often find themselves entangled in heroic endeavors.\nThe Wilderkin follow the serpentine paths of fate. Forever entangled in the intricate patterns of an altered world. For as the wind blows, life is chaos.\nRelicblade is a fantasy skirmish miniature game. Players command heroes or monsters as they battle to claim powerful magic relics lost in the ancient world. Players only need between three and six figures per side, and games only last about a half hour. The rules are simple and easy to learn, but there is a lot of depth in the available characters and upgrades.\nEnjoy an immersive hobby experience as you collect, build, and paint your miniatures. Relicblade models are made of white metal for wonderful crisp detail. Games take place on a two foot by two foot area, so creating detailed scenery is very manageable. While beautifully modeled terrain is a delight, you can play on any surface you have available by simply using stacks of books to represent the troubled wilds of Relicblade.\nDive into delightful tactical depths with each new game. Specialize your characters utilizing a vast arsenal of upgrade cards. Tactics, items, weapons, potions, and spells create a wonderful framework to customize each character in your war party. Faction sets include a booster pack of cards with new characters and upgrades, so as each new set is released the options continue to grow with dynamic new list-building options. In the example below this Iguan Slaver has a combination of defensive and ranged attack upgrades, which shifts his battlefield role and greatly increases his survivability. This particular build includes cards from The Wretched Hive, The Lone Guard, and Core Game Deck.\nCards from the new sets will be in full-color for your viewing pleasure!\nFor players interested in narrative campaign play, the Seeker's Handbook is packed with great content. Rather than simply selecting characters and upgrades based on a point total, you will construct a base and lead your characters as they undertake dangerous adventures to claim magical treasures. There are six scenarios, four environments, dangerous wild monsters, and rare treasures that pack each game with new dangers and unique challenges. The Seeker's Handbook is a wonderful source for limitless adventure. \nBattle Pigs personally congratulate the rangers on finding the lost relic!\nYou can learn a lot more about the game and how it's played on YouTube! There are gameplay overviews, unboxings, and battle reports ready to be consumed! Ash and Owen of Guerrilla Miniature Games and Gaming With The Cooler played a full Relicblade campaign on their channels. So check it out!\nChoose the pledge level that's right for you. Remember, by backing Relicblade you're helping it exist! Get ahold of this delightfully unique miniature game. Relicblade is 100% natural, pure, and unfiltered imagination that is bottled at the source. It is untouched by the sanitizing influence of a board-room or stock-holders. Enjoy the benefits of live and active gaming cultures.\nIf you're new to Relicblade the \"Champion of Adventure\" is AWESOME! At this mega-rad pledge level you'll get the core game along with the \"Wilderkin\" and \"The Wretched Hive\" expansions. This pledge level includes twenty one metal miniatures, the rulebook, tokens, dice, and 70+ unique cards including all kinds of amazing characters, magic swords, advanced battle tactics, and powerful ancient relics from time immemorial.\n What's a Custom Character Card?\nImagine the possibilities.\nYou tell me about a D&D character you used to play or any character you can imagine. Then I will do an original illustration of that character. But the fun won't stop there! I will also stick that character in a special COLOR character card and make up some sweet rules and stats for your them! The custom card will be your ideas collaboratively realized in Relicblade. You're welcome to create heroes, villains, relics, or monsters, whatever your heart desires.\nYou get the original illustration and copies of your character card along with the other Legends from this campaign. All ten custom character commissions will be collected in the \"Legends 2\" booster pack. This booster pack will be an official expansion for Relicblade for players to collect and enjoy. The first Legends set was extremely popular, so don't miss out on being part of a new generation of legends!\nIt is my earnest hope to raise enough money to produce the two faction sets above. But within the production timeline for this project I am happy to add a little wish-list in the form of stretch goals.\nStretch goals are a great way to boost the project outcomes as the budget increases. If we raise enough money to produce the new sets, then the money we continue to raise will push toward even more new content! Newly unlocked content will be available as Add-Ons once the goal is reached.\nGuest Artist: DARKWIZARD BERSERKER\nThe Relicblade: Guest Artist Series RETURNS!! I'm beyond excited to offer another off the wall collaboration. As the creator of Relicblade I enjoy unbridled creative freedom. This privilege is granted by my generous Kickstarter Backers, so in this campaign I hope to extend the mantle of creative power to a deserving guest artist!\nTriptych by Darkwizard\nScott Wygmans is known under the name Darkwizard_Berserker on Instagram. I almost feel like that's enough to get him the job, but he deserves it for more than a badass Fighting Fantasy name. His style is both absolutely brutal and undeniably fun. He's got one foot firmly planted in heavy metal dungeon badassery and the other cheerfully placed in a fun-loving world of adventure. It's precisely this balance of light hearted savagery that makes Scott the perfect fit for Relicblade.\nI particularly love collaborating with artists with loads of style. Scott manages to evoke hardcore nostalgia of classic pen and paper gaming while always delivering something completely fresh. I encourage you to dig deep into his portfolio and let your imagination reel. It's going to be a special delight to sculpt based on his work. Let's make this happen!\nThis is a gross wizard.\nNOTE: The Shadow Fox and Gnome Alchemist are separate characters who form a cavalry pair. Now with the Ibex and Battlesmith you'll be able to swap riders and mounts to explore new combinations. As more cavalry models are released there will be more fun options to explore. \nFate of The Firstborn\n        \"The First Born King once ruled a mighty empire. His fertile lands stretched far and wide from his island borne ziggurat. His armies marched and his navy sailed, bringing tribute from the conquered. His sorcerers and alchemists sought and distilled the secrets of life. His seers and soothsayers predicted the rise and fall of mighty kings, dynasties, and empires. But for all his power and knowledge, The First Born King could not save his own.\nThe Firstborn still skulk in their hidden tombs and foul fens to this day, silent guardians of the treasures of their ancient empire. Animated by foul magics, they have remained strong and aware despite the loss of their primitive humanity.\nNow, bold adventurers and dastardly villains scour The Fens of The Firstborn in search of ancient treasure and powerful relics. From the be-swamped port city of Fen\u2019s Moore, they set out into the murky frontier to find their fate and fortune.\nJoin them if you dare, but know that wherever you go, The Firstborn will be waiting.\"\nFate of The Firstborn is an all new expansion for Relicblade!\nJust look at how cool these are in the video below. The Ancient Waystones scenario requires players track which objectives have been activated this round, and the Braziers will play a significant role in upcoming Relicblade Adventures!\nThese paint up really nicely, too. They make wonderful additions to your tabletop.\nThe additional Stone Spire miniature will be extremely useful for playing the game. I realize that most of you have the hobby skills to make as many rocks as you need. But I think an extra spire miniature will make the Geomancer more playable right out of the package. :) \nALSO. I can't believe I'm writing a stretch goal for 30k. THANK YOU!!! \nThe add-on marketplace is a way to add a few extra items to your pledge. That way you can rest assured you are getting all the Relicblade goodness you can handle.\nI highly recommend that new players pick up a copy of The Seeker's Handbook. This book contains the full rules for Relicblade, along with the awesome campaign rules. Link your games into an ongoing narrative, claim rare treasures, and assail terrible monsters on your quest to claim the mighty RELICBLADE! You and a friend will be equipped to play a full campaign with this book and the Bold Adventurer pledge level.\nNOTE: All the non-stretch goal add-ons are presently available at Relicblade.com. So if you're excited about trying the game you should place an order to get shipped to you right away! These add-ons are of particular interest to my EU friends who have had their eye on these treasures but didn't want to deal with customs. \nmnmNOTE: The terrain featured in the photographs was hand built by our amazing studio staff (me :D ). It's mostly made out of painted insulation foam, however I must draw special attention to the rad dungeon terrain. For the dungeon I used materials and resin/metal accessories from Firedragon Games. I cannot recommend their products highly enough! I built my full dungeon in one day, and painted it all the next day.

Funds will go to the necessary development tools and time needed.\nChallenge Mode [REACHED!]\nWe'll have some extra resources to put towards a unique challenge mode! Put your Flynn skills to the test in the arena with survival and boss rush trials!\nAnimated Intro\nWe'll be able to work with our pals over at Studio Yotta to create an animated intro for Flynn: Son of Crimson! It'll be pretty and juicy and whoa!\nRozia Story DLC\nAn alternate character in a DLC story played alongside Flynn's journey! We already have this story planned out, these funds would help it become a reality! All backers receiving the game will get the DLC at no charge.\n  Flynn: Son of Crimson is a 2D action adventure platformer with metroidvania elements. Set in a wondrous world with a looming darkness beginning to awaken yet again.\nWhat can you expect?\nExplore a wondrous world filled with discovery, taking place in unique regions designed with non-linear exploration.\nSwap between multiple weapons with quick and satisfying combat.\nDive in to a land with ancient mysteries and rich story.\nTravel across the lands, discovering new ways to roam and opening new paths using the power of crimson.\nDip in and out of an alternate dimension to make unique alterations to the real world.\nView a realm full of life, carefully formed with hand-crafted pixel art.\nTrade trinkets for new combat techniques and runes with an old war veteran.\nCall on your companion Dex in times of need, a mystical and loyal creature.\nTest your strength in the feared Rustwood coliseum among other challenging feats.\nTake on the role of Flynn, a young man orphaned as a child who sets out to chase the shadows of his beginnings whilst awakening the ancient power of Crimson within him. \nDiscover relics of ancient Rosantica, effigies and monuments to the goddess Sorrell that reveal hints at Flynn\u2019s beginnings and unlock new powers. Reveal secret pathways, trade with villagers, battle fierce monsters, hang out with dogs.\n    What about the Switch?\nWe've received a lot of requests for the Switch, we hear you! We'd love to launch on as many platforms as possible, but there is a problem. Flynn is being created in Gamemaker Studio 2, which is a great engine, but it currently does not support porting to the Switch. If we were to go for it now, Flynn would have to be recreated in an entirely new engine, which as you can imagine is a lot of work. Just know that Yoyo games is working hard on trying to make a Switch port possible! We can set up a later stretch goal for a Switch port, but until then we'll have to hope for the port to become available during Flynn's development! We'll keep everyone updated as Yoyo games and Nintendo work it out.\n  From the very first stages of development, we began designing Flynn: Son of Crimson with fast paced, satisfying combat. We\u2019re strong believers that \u2018game feel\u2019 should be priority in any video game so we've been injecting as much juice as we can to make sure every hit packs a punch and feels extra tasty.\nTrade gems and trinkets acquired throughout the game to learn new techniques for Flynn\u2019s arsenal, and you\u2019ll soon find that you can figure out your own favourite combination of attacks (Smash, bash, tickle, tickle, bosh!). Designed with quick and easy weapon swapping in mind, you\u2019re never more than a button press away from your desired weapon so you better dispatch your foes with flair, else you\u2019re not the cool hero everyone thought! \nThe Crimson Blade, a staple in Flynn's arsenal (and the default starting weapon, but that doesn\u2019t sound as appealing!) is the first weapon of Crimson energy gifted to Flynn by the Goddess Sorrell in a great time of need. Unlocking and mastering the uppercut will provide some serious hang time to any foe that is on the receiving end. Or why not slice through many baddies with the piercing dash? Piece of cake.\nThe Crimson Axe demands precise timing and enemy prediction, trading the quick cuts of the crimson blade for a weighty windup, this axe packs a punch sure to leave your enemies as a smear on the floor. Use the axe to crush your enemy's shields, and smash brittle walls to access new areas with brute force. It\u2019s a wonder how the young one can lift this, but as we wrote this we realized it is made of energy, whoops.\nThe Crimson Claws, a swift and energetic set of weapons used to stagger enemies with high attack speed and air superiority, if that\u2019s your sort of thing. Unleash your inner wildcat with unique wall climbing (go home, Knuckles) and a spiral drill attack (you too, Taz) to tear into enemies and dig through soft ground, these high mobility weapons will have you on your toes and keep your hands warm.\nWhat would our youthful hero be without a ranged weapon? That's right, a hero without a ranged weapon. So here's a bow, not any old bow, but a Super Awesome Crimson Bow\u2122 (nice). Acquired early on in the game, this will help you hurt/take out weaker foes from a distance. Use the bow to trigger traps and puzzles, and even augment with elemental arrows such as ice, electricity, and explosive (explosions are an element, right?). Once you've unlocked them, it's your choice which to roll out with, depending on your play style, whoa!\nSet in the world of Rosantica after the Great Conflict, a war that carried on for decades between parallel worlds, one of humanity, one of gods. The worlds once kept in peace by the Crimson Goddess Sorrell and Lord Zealock, now torn between each other.\nThe Great Conflict between overlapping worlds, caused by Sorrell\u2019s forbidden love of a mortal knight, Allistair. Falling for humanity's innocence and good nature, Sorrell leaves her world for another, sending Zealock into madness with her involvement with the \"frail humanity\".\nDecades of war have gone by between worlds, as things begin to look grim for the people of Rosantica. Realizing she can do no more to protect them from Zealock's growing rage, Sorrell initiates an ultimate sacrifice with her and her love, giving their lives to banish what has now become The Scourge. Locking Lord Zealock and his followers away to the malicious world they have created.\nBut don\u2019t live in the past, the world around you is brimming with exploration and discovery. Track down a mysterious stranger that appears to be following you as the barrier between worlds begins to crack, and investigate her ties to The Scourge and Zealock.\n  Roam the fantastic world both on foot and with your loyal companion Dex, a last gift from Sorrell and a guardian of Rosantica, helping both man and beast alike take back their homes. Will you follow Flynn on his journey through this war torn land?\n  Venture into the heart of evil itself, and tackle the horrors of The Scourge head-on. A once pristine land of gods, now an infested land filled with hatred. Track clues about your past and the Crimson power that grows within you leading to this nest of evil, and uncover what really lies at the heart.\nFlynn must hurry, with every passing day The Scourge\u2019s hold on Rosantica grows, slowly plunging the world into madness and decay with its noxious corruption. You must seek to end Zealock\u2019s reign of disease and lunacy before it\u2019s too late. \nTraveling between dimensions, Flynn controls the ability to tear open portals to The Scourge with the power of Crimson. Finding alternate paths and searching for trapped Rosanticans taken away from their homes. But be wary, The Scourge has many eyes in search of Flynn.\n    Journey through the vast island of Rosantica in search for answers to stop the land from falling victim to the corruption. The world is pieced together to transition seamlessly as you travel across the 5 unique regions.\nExplore the frigid Mistral Peak \u2013 a frozen over mountain once brimming with enterprise and discovery of its rich natural resources and fossils, now fallen victim to The Scourge\u2019s wretched influence in the form of a supernaturally dangerous blizzard. Discover what infernal power has summoned up this ferocious storm and help put a stop to it.\nWade through the once secluded and dazzling waters of The Hollow's Isles. A group of seaside caverns and alcoves that were once the pinnacle of natural beauty and serenity that have been ravaged by the relentless winds brought on by the blizzards of Mistral Peak above. Track your quest into the damp caves to battle off the mutated crustaceans that have forced out the indigenous Neptyn to flee their ancestral homes.\nLose yourself in the sprawling gardens of Rustwood. Home to the legendary proving grounds of the warrior tribe, the Mazir, and their Fighting Coliseum. The Mazir are a beetle-like people that are honor bound to prove themselves capable warriors by duking it out in this immense arena. Be warned, however, for The Scourge has seeped even into this land of once sacred trials. The swamps of Rustwood grow darker as each day goes by, causing hazardous poison storms to awaken.\nYour quest for knowledge will eventually lead you to the home of all scholarly pursuits, the famed Shivering Spire. What used to be the beacon of knowledge and symbol of Rosantica\u2019s prosperity, is now home to a portal of the netherworld, with its devout healers and once benevolent sorcerers now becoming vessels for The Scourge\u2019s evil magic to pour into the world of Rosantica. Flynn will be bombarded with acolytes that are now driven mad by their enhanced dark powers, as well as assaulted by powerful warlocks that once dared to challenge gods themselves.\nIn between journeys, Flynn will return to Sanctia. A stronghold where his most valued allies reside, banding together to help Flynn fight off the corruption. Here Flynn will barter rare Crimson Shards found throughout the world for new techniques and upgrades, as well as complete quests for the villagers.\nFlynn: Son of Crimson features crisp, hand-crafted pixel art that's designed to compliment its frenetic gameplay. Readability and strong visual tells are key components in our artistic process, as we realize how important it is for a game to be crystal-clear in its visual feedback to the player.  \nEach chunky pixel is deliberately and thoughtfully placed to create a memorable world for players to explore. Mischievous goblins, big-bellied fish men, blood-thirsty wolves, and more are brought to life with expressive animations brimming with personality.\nFrom concept art, to character sprites, and final polished animations - we aim to deliver a product we're truly proud of, and one that communicates to our players how much we truly care for the timeless and endearing craft of pixel-art!\n    From our composer, Jacob Lincke: Starting with a clean slate is always exciting and inspiring. \u201cFlynn: Son of Crimson\u201d needs satisfying music to accompany its already magical looking art style. I started looking at things I thought the game reminded me of; other games, movies and even places in the real world. I want the soundtrack to have its own unique voice, instantly connecting it to the game.\nI have a deep love for traditional folk music from all over the world which made me think of all sorts of fun instruments and what they could bring to the table. Flutes and keyed fiddles are combined with medieval lutes and finally mixed together with a grand orchestra making you feel less alone. All of this and a touch of retro synths to go along with the cute art style results in a collaboration between Scandinavian folk music and the Far East.\nI imagined Flynn wandering enchanting forests such as those found in Ghibli movies and traversing cold mountains of my homeland Sweden. I want the music to help Flynn telling his story, setting the atmosphere and be beautiful at the same time.\n    Always felt like you needed something Crimsony for your wall? Me too. Put this pretty 18\" by 24\" poster all over it and have your friends say, \"whoa\"! A beautiful illustration by Jaya Ply (@Nikingply).\nGet warm with this high quality t-shirt designed by miski! Printed on a 50/50 blend shirt for maximum comfort. We may or may not kiss each one before they ship. T-shirt sizing and possible color options will be provided after the campaign.\nDig your eyes intothe Official Flynn: Son of Crimson art book containing used and unused concept art, pixel art, level design sketches, fan art, a deeper look into the lore, and more! Size of the book to be decided later in development, based on our content. \nBecome one with the game with your spooky skeleton in the ground, and your likeness drawn in to your own gravestone to be placed in the Rustwood Graveyard. In other words, your face on a rock. \nDesign an NPC to fit in to the game! We'll contact you to work on your NPC's design, personality, dialogue (nothing naughty!), back story, and favorite things.\nGet your own custom room! You choose its location, style, what it's full of, maybe a bit of lore, maybe a bit of graffiti, maybe your face everywhere, I don't know. Put your own flair in to it!\nCombine every design tier before to create a sidequest! Include your secret room and your NPC in this quest to make Flynn fetch a bucket of water, or to do 50 pushups, whatever your heart desires!\nA story being told right from our hearts and fingers, Flynn is a young baby boy that has been on our minds over the last two years. As we write this, we are roughly one full year into development on Flynn: Son of Crimson from when we began putting this design all on paper.\nactual paper!\nSo far being funded completely by our own money, we feel we're now in a good place to introduce Flynn to Kickstarter. In order to continue to fulfill our dreams in making Flynn a real boy, we need your support! We're very confident in the head start we have on the basics in design and development, with a lot of the core features already built and working. A large portion will be going to the art, allowing us to give our artists more consistent hours and maybe even hire extra help. Additionally, the sound is very important to us, so that will be a big investment as well.\nIs this your first game? \nFirst bigger scale game, yes. We have 2 other games we released in the wild on mobile though, which can be found here:  \nSamurai Blitz\nRaccoon Rascals\nWe also have a couple projects we have worked on in the past that didn\u2019t quite make the cut (we all have them), but we see them as more of a learning process and who knows, we may come back to them in 50 years time.\nSpecial Thanks\nAndrew Filip - Web design/development, help with the trailer.\nJohan Aronson - Being part of Flynn's original birth long ago, and the title screen.\nmiski - Being the greatest for designing the t-shirt last minute with us.\n           This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges for a project like this.

A miniatures board game designed by Sen Foong-Lim and Jessey Wright, The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena pits 2 players against each other in a sports game that features deep, strategic, head-to-head gameplay, highly detailed and dynamic miniatures, deck crafting and building, and team customization.\nThe game play of The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena is closely modeled after the popular Pro-bending sport featured in the first season of Avatar: The Legend of Korra. As such, the game is designed for 2 players, each controlling a team of 3 benders: earth, fire, and water.\nBased on the events of Avatar: The Legend of Korra, Pro-bending Arena focuses on the championship match between the fresh-faced Future Industry Fire Ferrets and the sneaky and brutal White Falls Wolfbats.\nThe objective of the game is simple: be on the other team's side of the arena when the game ends and you will be victorious, or dominate the competition, pushing all their benders off the back of the arena to end the game immediately and claim the championship as yours!\n  The below videos will give you an understanding of not only how The Legend of Korra Pro-bending Arena plays, but also an understanding of how to play it, plus the strategies involved.\n      The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena encourages players to experiment with their team's techniques and trick load out. This deep customization rewards players with endless ways to build their teams and defeat their opponents. \nDuring your match, you'll be able to focus your benders' chi and purchase new technique cards from one of their three strategy decks, each one separated by bender type. Not only does this mid-game deck building give players a chance to turn the tide of the match when a powerful card comes up for purchase, but it also allows players to min-max each of their strategy decks. \nThe strategy deck can be crafted before the game by players really looking to give their team an offensive edge. Being selective about what cards go into each one of your bender's strategy decks will give you the opportunity to control the plays you'll have access to as the game progresses. \n  Not only can you customize your team by crafting your strategy decks before the game, but you can really show your style via the trick cards you can load your team with.\nThere are two types of trick cards: incredibly powerful ones that can only be used once, or slightly less powerful but much riskier cheats that can be used multiple times but require players to roll a referee die each time they're used.\nCollect 2 yellow fans on a single bender and they're out of the game, putting you at a serious disadvantage.\nTricks allow players to supercharge their attacks, escape incoming barrages of elements, or even make their benders impervious to being pushed back. Deciding which tricks to take, and whether or not they're the risky yellow-fan cheats or one-time powerful tricks really allows players to make a team their own.\nDuring the course of this campaign, we will be unlocking 7 mystery teams as a free upgrade for your pledge. These are not stretch goals, they are guaranteed to be a part of your pledge no matter what our funding level ends up being! \nAdditional teams offer you a ton of new strategies. Not only will each team come equipped with their own unique special ability and strategy decks, but they also come with 6 universal trick cards that can be used by any team in the game. Meaning that even if you've already built your favorite team,  any additional team you add to your game will expand the options you have for your perfectly-tuned machine.\nOnce you've learned your new teams' quirks and perks, maximized their power potential, and earned your first championship, why not switch it up and draft your dream team?\nAdding teams to your core game will also allow you to participate in the Fantasy Draft variant. In this game mode, players can mix and match their favorite members from their favorite teams and experience the fantasy of combining two powerful special abilities into one devastating power play. \nWhen missing team members, all members still get their specific special ability, triggered by their technique cards. This can allow for unbelievable power combinations that will have Fire Ferret team members counter-bending elements alongside Wolfbats, dazing the opposition with illegal techniques.\n        The White Falls Wolfbats are the reigning Pro-bending champions. Being fan favorites, any question of the legality of their techniques and the legitimacy of their champion status is often brushed off as loser jealousy. Still, something about the way they play does ring a little unfair to even the most die-hard fans.\nIn The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena, the White Falls Wolfbats have access to the some of the dirtiest tricks in the book. Their team special ability, Daze, allows the Wolfbats to put their opponents at a serious disadvantage with cheap-shots that cripple their next plays.\n    Fresh-faced and newly-formed, the Future Industry Fire Ferrets are the surprise stars of the Pro-bending league. Hailing from Republic City, the Fire Ferrets are best known for their teamwork and mastery of the elements. Well, okay, that's the second thing they're known for; they're primarily known for being the team with Avatar Korra playing for them.\nFocusing their chi on mastering the elements, the Fire Ferrets have become proficient in redirecting overly aggressive plays back against their opponents. Counter-bend takes your opponents' element tokens and adds them as part of your attack. These counter-bend techniques can change the course of the game in a single, well-planned play.\nKnown on the Pro Bending circuit for their teamwork, the all-female, all-amazing Rabaroos coordinate to unleash a rapid-fire flurry of elemental attacks. Ada, Ula, and Umi are guaranteed to bring you to your feet with their lightning fast bending. It\u2019s always action-packed when the Rabaroos are in the Arena!\nRally and Blitz \nWhat makes the Rabaroos unique are their twin icons, Rally and Blitz. Activate Rally to gain Rally tokens which you can then spend when you activate Blitz. Blitz permits you to draw a card from the top of your Main Deck, immediately launching an additional action!\n  The self-proclaimed \u201cBullies of Black Quarry\u201d, the Boar-Q-Pines specialize in relentless pressure. Many a team of Pro Benders have withered under the attacks of the rough-and-tumble Boar-Q-Pines. Chang, Xin, and Shui may be a little prickly, but they should never be underestimated!  \nPressure\nPressure tokens are this team\u2019s unique modifier, making your elemental tokens count for double when they hit. Even the weakest attack from the Boar-q-pines is a credible threat to be taken seriously!\n  The nimble and evasive P\u2019Li is one of the rare fire benders who has the ability to focus Chi into a concentrated line of concussive force. This Combustionbending is nigh impossible to block and nearly as difficult to avoid. After years of being held deep in the frozen wastes for 13 long years by the Order of the White Lotus, P\u2019Li has escaped and is once again after her quarry - Avatar Korra! Do not stand in her way!\nP\u2019Li's unique and powerful bending type makes her such a fierce competitor that she doesn't need any teammates by her side to be a Pro-bending champion. Her combustionbending cannot be stopped, meaning that elements placed in an attempt to defend against her attacks cannot annihilate her attacks. P'Li is limited by the amount of combustion she can bend, since she is only allotted 6 combustion tokens. Players using her as a team will need to be careful about how often they deploy those tokens, as after all combustion tokens are deployed any combustion icons played are ignored. \n  The pride of the Golden Temple, Haka, Josei, and Kano come to Pro Bending with years of experience under their belts. As they\u2019re not spring chickenpigs anymore, the Tigerdillos rely less on their athleticism and more on their wisdom as veterans of the sport. They know when it\u2019s best to fight and when it\u2019s best to regroup and refocus.\n Veteran\nThe Tigerdillos, while capable benders, may be past their prime in terms of raw athletic prowess. However, their Veteran status in Pro-bending gives their team members a sense of when to take advantage of the shift in battle gain even more of an edge over the competition.\n  The Buzzardwasps have mastered the art of attacking pressure points at a distance, making precise strikes against opponents instead of using brute force. Their infamous \u201cSting\u201d technique can make even the most iron willed Pro-bender lose focus. Shan, Ko, and Loong are aiming to take the championship trophy back to Bau Ling! \nThe Buzzardwasps deliver precision attacks directly to identified weak points. Their famous sting has a powerful bite, distracting opponents, causing them to lose focus and opening them up to more attacks.\n  Kuvira is not only a political and military genius, her Metalbending is without peer in single combat and her acrobatics allows her to dance between multiple foes. Kuvira can switch from attack to defense and back again within the same, seemingly effortless, sequence of complex moves. Underestimate the grace of \u201cThe Great Uniter\u201d of the Earth Empire at your own peril!\nKuvira, Superior Combatant\nKuvira\u2019s prowess at executing advanced techniques makes it impossible for a referee to judge whether she's cheating or not. As such her Prowess ability is versatile and powerful if you choose from all of the tricks available. To ensure that the game is fair, Kuvira cannot use Tricks that prevent her from being knocked back (such as Determination).\n  Unalaq's infamy goes beyond his devious machinations and his skilled waterbending, his ability to siphon off his enemy's spiritual energy makes him a foe unlike any other. Pro-benders find themselves imagining what facing-off against such an unconventional bender would be like. How would Unalaq's soul siphon affect them in the arena, how wound he combine his most peculiar ability with his incredible waterbending skills?\nSoul Siphon\nIf you have your Spiritbending token on your Villain board, you may spend it (return it to the supply). If you do, choose 1 bender in the target space of an attack. Your opponent must discard a card of that bender\u2019s element from their hand. If they do not have a card, return your Spiritbending token to your Villain board.\n      If you'd like to add the Amon expansion to your pledge please press the \"Manage my Pledge\" buttom at the top of the page and add $30. \nThe Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena Amon's Invasion expansion includes 3 game modes: \n1.

Amon and his equalists are controlled by an A.I. dekc that indicates what they will do.\n2.

This campaign is specifically for the funding the creation Issues 8 and 9, which will complete Volume1. That means MOST of the book is already complete. I only have about 50 pages to go out of the 225+ pages in the series.\nNew to the story? Not to worry!  All of Volume 1 is available in this campaign. Also Issues 8 and 9 will be of course available as well for those who have already been following along.\nThanks to the lovely and amazing Kickstarter community I've had Issues 2 - 7 funded on previous campaigns. This project began years ago and has slowly turned into something I am really devoted to and would love to work on for years to come.\nGIRRION is a sweeping sci-fi fantasy story of a hero's journey in a distant world in a distant time. The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted, when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldy magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\n        Inking in progress\n        Volume 1 cover art in progress\n     Girrion started off as a hobby over 15 years ago. Initially it was more of an illustration portfolio than a story. I wanted to be a concept artist, so I would spend a lot of time designing characters, ships and environments.\nI didn't consider myself a writer back then, but I started getting ideas for a story. When I would draw environments or characters the ideas would just pop in my head. One scene led to another, then another etc. It took a lot of time, but the experience put in over the years not only helped the art, it also gave me time to develop the story more and give it more depth than it had in the earlier drafts.\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No excessive gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it.\n            This will be the first campaign where a full volume book is available. It will be 225+ pages in length. 6.14\" x 9.2\"\nVolume 1 mockup. Cover art and design are in progress.\n Previous campaigns single issues were available in hardcover or softcover, and these formats will be available in this campaign as well. \nSample Hardcover (Issue #7)\n Hardcover comic issues are 6\" x 9\". Grey cloth with a dust jacket. Each issue is anywhere from 22 - 26 pages in length.\nSoftcover samples (Issues 1-9)\nSoftcover comic issues are 6\"x9\" and have a glossy cover with a stock thicker than standard comics. The interior art is full color and has a watercolor feel.\nSample Character Sketch\n  Sample 4\" x 6\" print\n  How Do Add Ons Work?\nHere's what you do:\nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) Add the total of your Add On to your pledge amount. (i.e. one Giclee Fine art print is $25.) You don't need to change the tier you've selected You are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. Thank you!\n  Generally, about half of my expenses come from printing the books and mailing them. The other half of the budget is going into the production. Most of what this campaign money goes towards is large chunks of time for me to focus fully on the book. One issue takes me 300 - 400 hours. If I'm able to knock off some days working freelance on other jobs, the books come out much faster.\n  Scout Comics is now publishing Girrion! They released Issue 1 last October and will be releasing books up through this Fall. They are an indie publisher\u2013 very supportive of their creators and just a great group of people all around. They also have a wide range of comics which you can check out on their site. www.scoutcomics.com\nFollow\nWebsite: www.girrion.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/Girrion1\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/girrion1/\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/girrion1/\nMusic from Kickstarter Video: \"Night Owl\" by Broke For Free", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing that this is not the first comic I've made there aren't too many major challenges with getting the book made, but there are some small ones:\n\nSome of the artwork on certain pages goes fast, some takes very long. There are some complex scenes in this issue with lots of characters and elements that need strong design. Again from past experience, the artwork can sometimes take a bit longer than expected. Also, keep in mind I have to mix this work in with the day job.\n\nI've learned a lot from previous Kickstarter campaigns, and I am getting more and more efficient. I'm also trying to find ways to make rewards as cost-effective as possible too. One way of doing this is to do more than one issue per campaign, which cuts down on mailing costs. Before it took so long to complete just one issue and I could only offer one per campaign, but now I plan on doing 2 -3 issues per campaign from now on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "CURIOUS ABOUT GIRRION", "descp": "-Issue 1 PDF format", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 4 or more", "title": "ISSUE 8 & 9 (PDF)", "descp": "Continuing the Saga!\n-Issue 8 & 9 PDF format", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["52 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 6 or more", "title": "CHOOSE ANY 3 ISSUES (PDF)", "descp": "-Miss an issue or want to start from the beginning?

As Spymasters, position your Spies and Specialists to outmaneuver your opponent and dominate the battlefield.\nPlayers must stay one step ahead of their opponent on a battleground that is as much in the minds of the Spymasters as on the board. Predict your opponent\u2019s moves to prevent them from gaining ground, and when all hope seems lost, snatch victory away from your opponent with clever use of your Specialist agents.\nIf you are the first to capture both parts of the Doomsday Device, it\u2019s game over for your opponent.\nA quick review of the game board and object will reveal that Pocket Ops is based on the familiar framework of tic-tac-toe \u2014 but don't write it off as child's play just yet! The prediction mechanic and Specialist abilities have been proven to offer playtesters both challenge and laughter. Don't believe it? Check out the sample Print n' Play files below:\n   ...or check out the Tabletop Simulator mod on Steam!\n  Pocket Ops is the first published design of Brandon Beran, with art and graphic design by industry veteran Josh Cappel.\n         Pocket Ops is quick to pick up, because you already know how to play; If you've played Tic-Tac-Toe before, you have the fundamentals: place markers in a grid, trying to get three in a row. But wait! The simple but game-changing twist with Pocket Ops is that before you make a move, the other player gets to secretly predict where you are going to go. After your move, if they were right, your move is canceled. In addition, a variety of Specialist tokens that introduce all sorts of sneaky abilities will change the way you place and predict. Pocket Ops takes a classic framework and breathes surprising life into it.

However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have created the 4- and 10-copy levels with lower pricing per copy.\n     We are very happy to bring this project to you via Kickstarter. Keeping true to our philosophy, we have asked for an amount that will get us halfway to what we need to produce the game. It will take about twice as much money as we are asking to bring Pocket Ops to life, and our part is ready. You showed amazing support for the Guild with Unreal Estate, and we know we can count on your for this current project. \n~Fondly,\nMarc Specter, GuildMaster", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups and delays. Many board game projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards and transparency we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\n\nAside from artwork changes that may come about as a result of stretch goals, this game is finished and ready to go to Bang Wee, the experienced manufacturer of our two previous titles.\n\nWe learned a lot from our first Kickstarter campaign, and we feel confident that those lessons will help us make this campaign successful.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Spy in training", "descp": "Support our project + 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 14 or more", "title": "Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\nFREE shipping within the US, $5 Canada, $10 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["933 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "Stroop Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["55 backers", "Limited (195 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 36 or more", "title": "Unreal Estate Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["45 backers", "Limited (205 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 48 or more", "title": "Spy Hard", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 4 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 4 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$7 for shipping within the US, $12 Canada, $15 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 52 or more", "title": "Guild Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $15 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["43 backers", "Limited (207 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Santa Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 10 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 10 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $20 Canada, $30 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "\"Bond...

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our last Kickstarter at more than double the funding level, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital.

All you need is to learn this simple method of Cognitive Drawing and you will soon be decoding and memorizing how to draw things like you never imagined possible. \nHow can I make such a bold claim? Because this technique is exactly how I taught myself how to draw.\nI believe that with Cognitive Drawing you will quickly learn how to test yourself and force your brain to start memorizing what you are learning. \nWhat is Cognitive Drawing?\nCognitive Drawing will be an easy (90+ page) workbook designed to teach you how to learn to draw anatomy from memory. Not only will you learn to draw but you will learn to do it in a way that helps your brain retain what you learned. \nThis book is perfect for beginners and intermediate artists of all ages.\nThe technique in this book is exactly how I (Jason Brubaker) taught myself to draw as a teenager without an expensive art education. At the age of twenty I was hired by a storyboarding agency in Los Angeles and I have been a professional artist ever since working in storyboards, animation and visual development on some of the biggest movies and commercials in Hollywood. (You can see my IMDB credits here.)\nWe are printing the book on sketch book paper perfect for drawing with pencil.\nHow did Cognitive Drawing start?\nBack in the mid 90's when I was trying to learn to draw, I developed this method while trying to memorize anatomy and different artistic styles. Although I didn't have a name for it yet, it was the way that I was able to learn anatomy quickly. It was't long before I was able to draw anatomy and styles quickly from memory and I attribute much of this success to this method.\nOver the years I have tried to explain the Cognitive Drawing method to friends assuming that others were doing it as well. To my surprise, I have never found anyone teaching or using this technique. Twenty years later I decided to make an experimental worksheet to show a drawing class how to quickly learn to draw things on their own. To my surprise, about 90% of the students found my method surprisingly easy and highly effective for learning to draw from memory. \nSince it worked so well for others I decided that it was time to try to make a Cognitive Drawing book using this technique to aid in learning one of the hardest things to learn to draw: anatomy. I announced the idea on my Youtube channel and nearly 100 people signed up to be beta testers for an experimental 40 page anatomy book using Cognitive Drawing. \nAfter a few months of testing Cognitive Drawing the beta testers were finished and sent me their results and I was once again blown away with the high percentage of positive feedback and massive improvement for almost all of the beta testers.\nThe beta-test worked better than I expected again but it still needed much improvement to be a real workbook. I received much needed feedback from the testers and studied all the problem areas in their drawings I was able to refine Cognitive Drawing into an amazing and fun daily exercise designed to walk a beginner artist through the entire male figure (from any angle or pose) within a month.\nWhat is in the Cognitive Drawing Book?\nCognitive Drawing will be a 96+ page workbook book designed to fold flat so you can draw on all the pages. \n(The page count will keep growing as we hit stretch goals. I would like to get it up to 140 pages if possible.)\nAbout 60% of the workbook will be cognitive drawing worksheets and the rest of the book is full of lessons and exercises to help you tie it all together. This book will help you memorize proportions of body and face, muscle groups, poses and more and will show you how to use Cognitive Drawing to learn how to memorize any drawing style you find. \nAlong with Cognitive Exercises the book is filled with muscle breakdowns and other exercises that helped me understand how to build a figure from scratch. Here are some samples of some of the daily exercises:\nThe book will be a combination of Cognitive Drawing exercises mixed with anatomy breakdowns and other drawing lessons.\nOnce you complete the book, not only will you know anatomy but you will also be able to use this technique with all kinds of other reference material like: anatomy books, comic books, robots, dinosaurs, aliens, monsters, machines, manga, your favorite artists or even photos. The sky is the limit!\nWho Is Cognitive Drawing For?\nThe book is designed for Homeschoolers, Drawing Groups, Classrooms and personal use. There is no nudity in the book so it's safe for all ages.\nI have seen much improvement in students ages of 8 and up. As long as there is a desire to learn to draw and you can spend about 30 minutes a day focused on doing an exercise then this is for you.\nBacked by Science?\nInterestingly enough, some of my findings agree with what scientists have learned about how the brain learns and retains information. This is the field of Cognitive Psychology. I have even interviewed a Cognitive Scientist who experimented with my method and he has helped me develop it to be even better than I expected.\nI will post an interview with him here where he breaks down the scientific principles used in Cognitive Drawing and why they work.\nProduction Timeframe\nThere are about 3 months of production left on the book depending on how many extra pages we can get funding to add. I would like to be able to make the book 140 pages but this would mean hitting stretch goals. So depending on how many pages the final book is will determine how quickly it goes to print.\nOnce printing begins it will take about 3 months to have the books in my studio and they will be shipped out shortly after that.\nI am setting the delivery deadline to April 2018 as a worst case scenario. But the funding amount will determine the exact timeframe and we might be able to have the books in your hands by this Christmas. \nMoney\nI am planning to print 3000 copies of this book quoted at $10,410. With shipping estimates as well as Kickstarter fees and Card processing fees, it will be over $16,000. We need another 9k for the remaining production costs and assistance to complete all the pages and worksheets. This brings our total to $24,900 to make sure this book can get off the ground.\nIf we don't reach this goal then I will not be able to invest the time or money to get the book printed so please help by sharing this with everyone you know who wants to learn how to draw.\nWho Am I?\nI'm Jason Brubaker. I am a self taught artist. I started my professional career at the age of 19 and have worked for more than 20 years in the entertainment industry on big movies (Blade, Pitch Black, Kung Fu Panda 1, 2 & 3) and hundreds of commercials before launching my own company to publish graphic novels and books. Now I self-publish graphic novels for a living. You can see my books here: http://CoffeeTableComics.com\nI've spoken at grade schools, high schools, colleges, libraries and comic conventions about making comics and doing art for a living.

So we have decided to expand some of our favorite tweets into a collection of short stories! We also like variety, so we'll throw in some honorable mention tweets and some activities and puzzles and stuff.\nThe first part of the book is a collection of short stories based on a few of our more popular tweets. Each story begins with a beautifully illustrated drawing by the extremely talented Jesse Lucas and ranges from 10-20 pages. They are all chock-full of ridiculously awful prose, bad analogies, horrible opinions, uneducated explanations, and dumb jokes. Following each short story, there will be ridiculous activities based on the preceding tale like word searches, mazes, mad libs, horrible cooking recipes, and more!\nHere are some of the short stories:\nCthulu's a Dick\nBased on: \"Al gazed upon Cthulhu and was consumed with madness. Not the crazy kind, the angry kind. Cthulhu totally pissed him off. Cthulhu's a dick.\"\nMethane in the Membrane\nBased on: \"Lia stepped off her ship onto the planet. 'That smells gross, Ben.' Ben was confused until they both died. The atmosphere was methane.\"\nHard-boiled Hobbit\nBased on:\u201cOf all the hobbit-holes in The Shire, this dame had to walk into mine. Tall as she was beautiful. 2'3\" and feet as hairy as my last case.\"\nThe Confusing, But Not Impossible Labyrinth\nBased on:\"'I smash you to nothing!' said the ogre. 'That's physically impossible,' said Dean. The others agreed, and the ogre admitted he was wrong.\"\nAnd more!\nAnd in each physical copy of Harris Dies on Page 32 and Other Tales of Awful Fantasy there will be a very special roleplaying adventure for the 5th edition of a popular RPG with a name I can't remember: The Daemon Queen\u2019s Saecret Tower!\nThe best answer is illustrations. It's a scientific fact that 100% of all things can be made 403 times better with some great art, and we believe that our book could benefit from that math.\n\nWe have the gift for deep storytelling, and complex, sophisticated writing, but we don\u2019t draw no good. So, it is our responsibility to see that someone else who is good at art does that stuff and gets paid while we stick to what we're good at: writing badly.\n\nWe've recruited the incredible talents of Jesse Lucas to do our illustrations, and it's not just because he shares the same last name as us. We believe his beautiful and clean art style would compliment our project perfectly and are excited to see what more he can do once this book gets funded.\n\nCheck out one of the images right now:\n\"The Dwarves sat down for a game of Offices & Executives. Thimlo, playing as Ted the Lawyer, rolled a 9 to dial out with his +1 desk phone.\"\n\nIn addition to having a Kickstarter for the art, we also need help getting the full-color, physical book printed. We think that having a physical book to hold, open, and touch would be pretty great, and we know that everyone loves to hold, open, and touch things. This book allows you to do all three at once.

An @AwfulFantasy Roleplaying Adventure!\nThe D\u00e6mon Queen's S\u00e6cret Tower is a very special roleplaying adventure specifically designed to be compatible with the 5th edition of a very popular RPG that I can't seem to remember the name of. It's that one game where you sit around with your friends and you act like you are different people in a fantasy world and you roll dice. There's a person at the table who leads the adventure. Man, why can't I remember what it's called? Oh well, I think you know the game I mean.\n\nIn The D\u00e6mon Queen's S\u00e6cret Tower, you and some friends will partake in the most ridiculous adventure ever created. Here's the story:\n\nOnce a regal and respected Queen of the Land of Orboz, Queen F\u0153tida instilled the opposite of fear into the hearts or her loyal subjects. Faced with the knowledge that she comes from a royal line rife with incest and illegal underground dragon fighting, F\u0153tida was dethroned by the Lord of a lesser house who uncovered her family\u2019s darker past. Queen F\u0153tida, residing in an old, long abandoned s\u00e6cret tower in the Dargon Mountains, is now a servant of Necrosa, and has turned from her love of Contemporary Impressionism to the somewhat Darker Arts\u2014NECROMANCY!\nThe Undead are invading the peaceful townships and cities of Orboz, consuming the flesh of the living, and ever spreading their vile dark magic and unpopular religious beliefs. Queen F\u0153tida has been spotted as a shade near the Dargon Mountains, and tale is told she still lives, most likely raising the dead as her own Personal Undead Army of Revenge!\nIt is up to a small band of heroes (you) to find Queen F\u0153tida and put an end to her Necromaniacal ways. In the Dargon Mountains lies the decrepit heart of the dark magic that plagues Orboz like a plague. In this metaphorical heart is where you must end the Dark Queen\u2019s evil, vengeful plans (by killing her).

Blackwall Warrens and the Shores of Kanis expand and update the world of Myth with Journeyman Heroes, terrifying new monsters, exciting new weapons and armor sets, and a revised rule set and cards. \nHere's a look at everything you've unlocked so far!\n                            Click the link below to learn how to play Myth.\nThe kingdom of the Okian lies at the heart of sun-scorched Kanis. It is a sand-blasted land where massive stone monuments rise to honor the dark master Anunkara, Keeper of the Dead.\nUnder the sprawling ruins of the once great trading city of Blackwall lies the Knot. The maze of tunnels house uncounted evils. In the deep dark of the warrens courage is tested and fear takes hold.\nWhat is NEW!\nThere is a lot of new. \n5 \"light\" Journeyman Hero decks (Shores of Kanis)\n5 \"dark\" Journeyman Hero decks (Blackwall Warrens)\nNew Heroes: Swashbuckler and the Outsider\nCommander class monsters\nNew Bosses, Mini-bosses, Captains, and Minions\nOrange tier weapons and gear\nGold tier armor sets\nDual wielding\nMalice pool\nMyth Module System\nNew realm tiles\nNew traps\nNew titles\nCapture and Interrogate rules\nBar Fight alternate game mode\nWhat is UPDATED.\n2nd Edition rules  \nAll base game Hero cards\nAll KS exclusive Hero and item cards (Trickster, Skald, Spriggan) \nAll base game item cards \nTrap deck\nOver the last year, we've been able to focus on the Myth base game. We've updated the rules, which you can download below. They are more streamlined and function like more traditional board game rule books. \nThe entire run of Hero and item cards has been revised for clarity and amended using keywords. These have been released for some time through the Myth patch system on our website and have already been played with and tested by hundreds of players.\nThe trap system has been completely overhauled. Traps are more straightforward and deck based, with setup images and explanation on each card. Furthermore, any trap can be used on any realm tile. \nFinally, we've made a clear distinction between story quests\u2014now expanded and renamed in the form of Myth modules\u2014and the much more robust, free-form questing, referred to as Adventuring.\nMyth Modules vs. Adventuring\nThe Myth quest system has been re-imagined. The overlapping story and free-form questing nature of the base game has been overhauled. We\u2019ve separated them completely into two modes: Modules and Adventuring.\nModules are greatly expanded, lore-filled story quests. Everything for setup has been provided and explained. Players in modules ignore realm tile legends. Setup is as easy as placing the minis and objects where the images indicate.\nFurthermore, modules have a larger story and expand the lore of Myth. They place you in the world and immerse you with the history and richness of the events taking place. Narrated sections of the module are read by a participant, yet the game remains fully cooperative.\nFree-form questing is now referred to as adventuring. While adventuring, players utilize the legends on the realm tiles and populate their quest per the quest cards. However, the adventuring system provides room for the discovery of Bosses and the earning of titles.\nThe new monster classification, Commanders, are key here. Commanders make those monsters under them exceedingly more difficult. Commanders can also be captured and interrogated by the Heroes to find a Boss\u2019 lair. Most importantly, these two modes of play are now completely separate. There is no crossover. Myth is either played by using a module or by adventuring\u2014never both.\nHeroes\nThe two new Heroes that come in the expansions are the Swashbuckler (Shores of Kanis) and the Outsider (Blackwall Warrens). Like the other Myth Heroes, they have unique play styles and offer their own set of challenges. Each new expansion Hero also has their journeyman deck upgrades included in their box.\nThe Swashbuckler is a pure dual wielder and only follows the light path. He consistently has the capacity to activate his secondary weapon and the extra Fate Dice to trigger that weapon's power. Additionally, he is much more at home in danger, surrounded by a host of monsters or facing off one-on-one with a boss. He is an absolute blast to play. \nThe Outsider utilizes the Malice system and only follows the dark path. When Heroes take advantage of the Darkness and strike out of revenge, Malice is generated. This Malice finds its way into a pool that only certain Heroes can access. The Outsider may choose to make a played card more powerful by utilizing Malice to supplement it as defined by the card. Additionally, the Outsider is very good at manipulating the Darkness meter to his own nefarious purposes.   \nBeyond the new Heroes, each expansion provides players with the means to upgrade their existing Heroes from Novice to Journeyman. Journeyman Heroes have made a choice: to follow the light or listen to the whispers of the Darkness. \nThe light Journeyman Heroes are found in the Shores of Kanis. The dark Journeyman Heroes are found in Blackwall Warrens. \nLook for updates that detail the Journeyman Heroes.\nShipping information - Please take note  \nBased on our experience with Myth, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter ends. This cost will be based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign concludes.  \nThis charge will be calculated by our shipping partner with maximum discounts applied. \nSimply put, shipping costs change considerably in the months between a KS end and the actual shipping date. Estimating future costs in the present is impossible, and not being flexible enough to recoup skyrocketing shipping costs is not economically feasible for us anymore.\nAdditionally, MegaCon Games will be responsible for shipping a backer's reward ONCE to the address on file. If the backer has not taken the responsibility to update his or her address, or does not claim the package in the time provided, then reshipping the item will be done so at additional expense to the backer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Myth and MERCS we have produced miniatures, dice, books, cards, maps, and counters.

This set will also be cast in high quality white metal and be supplied with 1 50 mm round plastic base. To cover this option as a reward selection simply manage your pledge upward by $20.00 per Helsrider desired.\n THEMED SET DEFINITION..................\nThe currently unlocked themed sets availabel as reward selections are:\n The Chosen, 5 armoured make warriors pictured together above.\n The Helsmaidens, 5 armoured female warriors pictured together above.\n The Berserkers, 5 heavy weapon light warriors pictured together above.\n  The Craven, 5 assassin / ranger3 females 2 males warriors not yet pictured\n These sets will not expand to include new as yet unlocked figures.\n\n as new themed sets are unlocked you will find them posted here.\n ADD-ONs...........................................\n   Backers may add additional themed sets and solos to their existing pledges by managing their pledge value upward to include the value of the themed set desired. The values per themed set are as follows;\n\n   Chosen...............$35.00 per set\n   Helsmaidens.......$35.00 per set\n   Berserkers............$35.00 per set\n   Craven.................$35.00 per set\n   Chosen solo..........$8.00 per figure\n   Helsmaiden Solo........$8.00 per figure\n   Hordesman Hero Solo........$8.00 per figure\n  Hordesman Captain Solo.............$8.00 per figure\n   Jotunn Solo...............$18.00 per figure ( please note that the Jotunn CAN be pledged for without having to also pledge for another figure. Just add $10.00 to the Solo pledge level that corresponds to your shipping zone to cover the full cost of the Jotunn as a Solo selection. )\n    Helsrider Champion Male or female.............$20.00 per figure ( please note that the Helsriders CAN be pledged for without having to pledge for another figure. Simply add $12.00 to the Solo pledge level that corresponds to your shipping zone to cover the full cost of the Helsriders as a solo selection.)\nMATERIALS.....................................\nEach of these figures are cast in high quality, lead free, white metal and is supplied with a 25 mm round plastic base. The figures may or may not be cast in a single piece as determined to be most efficient for moldmaking and casting purposes. I do try to keep my figures single piece as often as possible and whenever necessary I do try to be sure that my multi-part figures are easily assembled.\n\nSCALE............................................\n\nThe figures are built in a true 32 mm scale which means that the armature for an average sized human male would stand 32 mm tall from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head with both feet together and back straight. This typically puts the eye level of the unposed human male figure at 28 mm high. The pose can drastically effect the final height of the figure as the lengths of the bones and flex points of the miniature do not change during the posing process.\n\nPROPORTIONS........................................\nThe proportions of my figure tend to be much more idealized than what you might typically find in other miniature ranges which means that the heads and hands are more appropriately sized to real life proportions. Humans are typically 7 \" heads \" tall while dwarves are more typically 4 to 5 heads tall, and elves would be 6 heads tall. \nAESTHETICS.............................................\n\nThe Helsvakt like the Njorn are a special breed of human. They are superhumanly strong and tough by their exposure to the magics of the Sorceress Hel. This is reflected in their stature and physical heft / girth. They are slightly taller than normal humans ( between 35 and 38 mm tall unposed ) and thicker as well. their proportions are still measured by the same rubric but the overall effect is slightly comic book like.\n I find most of my artistic influences for the helsvakt between the likes Frank Frazetta, Paul Bonner, and Joe Madrueira. I love Frazetta's approach to pose and gesture and Paul Bonner's incredibly realistic detail and Joe Mad's overall stylization and energy. As for the design themes of the Helsvakt I look to the icons of evil barbarians in popular fiction and film from my child hood. The Jun horde from beastmaster......probably the formative image of an evil barbarian horde for me, and the riders of Doom from Conan the Barbarian. Warduke.....one of my most beloved toys as a kid........... Brom's warriors of the Dark Sun world........and probably hundreds of other images that all run to one big ball of spikey, battered metal, torn leather, tattered pelts, chains, closed helms, horns, and bone trinkets. You know the stuff of medieval nightmares. All good fun.\n GOALS...............................\nMy ambition for this kickstarter campaign is to fund the creation and production and distribution of the final sets needed to \" finish \" the HelsVakt range of miniatures within the RBG fantasy world. I have already funded through a recent KS campaign a set of semi modular rank and file troops, the Hordesmen, along with a set of murderous archer / assassins called the Craven, and a group of a few Heroes of reknown withint he HelsVakt Army, Hakar the Horrible, Bloody Garm, Valda the Black hearted, and Svartulf the Savage.\n  NOW I want to fund the the expansion of the army with in no particular order.......: \n  THE CHOSEN  5 armoured elite warriors.\n  CHOSEN CHAMPION  both mounted and afoot\n  COMMAND  Leader, horn blower, standard bearer elites\n  HELSMAIDENS 4 female warriors.\n  HELSMAIDEN CHAMPION both mounted and afoot\n  BERSERKERS 4 new berserkers\n  CRAVEN 4 new ranged helsvakt warriors\n  JOTUNN  1 maybe 2 Helsvakt allied giants\n  HELSRIDERS 4 new mounted warrior elites\n Very ambitious I know but I am up for the challenge and ready to make my best efforts. My most recent Kickstarter funded 24 figures in 30 days and of those 24 figures I sculpted 18 of them over the course of the 30 day campaign and the original 6 I had sculpted over the course of the week prior to the launch of the campaign. I can do this. The giants and Mounted elites will probably take a while to complete but I am confident I can have all funded figures sculpted within 30 days of the close of the KS.\n\n\n  \n  I work with very well established and very experienced moldmaking and casting contractors. With the very diligent help of Valiant Enterprises and Omar's Workshop I was able to deliver my previous campaign promises right on time with no production failures at all. I do not foresee any problems occurring between these two services in the deliver of this campaign either.\n  I go to any length necessary to see to it that the people who support me are treated with the respect and appreciation that they deserve and I always work very hard to be sure that they receive their rewards as promised within the shortest period of time possible. It is my commitment to any backer that your contribution to this or any RBG kickstarter campaign is as safe a bet as you can make. I WILL deliver as promised and I won't take a year to do it.\n ADDITIONAL POSTAGE................................................................\n  Additional postage MAY be required to cover the postage of your package as add-ons increase the weight of the package. Any additional postage warranted by the weight of the package after add-ons will need to be paid via paypal or amazon or other methods before shipment can commence. If needed I will invoice you at such time as your package is ready to ship if additional postage cost is need to cover shipment. That said I ALWAYS try to keep postage prices as tight as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have a great deal of experience in the running and delivery of kickstarters and 7 years experience in the industry dealing with all the various aspects of producing and marketing miniatures.

Each character rolls a certain color of dice for different types of actions. There are 3 types of dice: Yellow is the weakest, you have less of a chance to hit and will obtain fewer successes. Red is the strongest dice whereas Orange is in between.\nThree kinds of engraved dice\nEach Hero begins an adventure with a certain amount of equipment cards: Weapons, Shields, Armour, Potions... This equipment gives you bonuses to your rolls or allows you to execute certain special actions. A weapon for example, will allow you to roll additional dice during an attack. A sorcerer hero will use Spell cards that give him special abilities, such as teleportation.\nThe majority of the players will control Conan and the other heroes, the player pitted against them is known as the Overlord. This player controls not one but multiple groups of models, both mindless henchmen, powerful villains and terrible monsters. The book of Skelos allows him to keep track of all these models as well as his own stamina gems and activation track.\nThe Book of Skelos\nA classical evil-doer, The Necromancer can revive and control the dead.

The rules were finalised at the last possible moment so as to incorporate as many suggestions and fine tunings as possible. Nevertheless, please note that this is still an Alpha version of the rules and may be subject to change.\nApart from being huge fans of Conan and Robert E. Howard, we have been working in the gaming industry for many years now. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Henry is the author behind some incredibly successful games such as The Adventurers, Timeline and The Builders. Erwan and Lo\u00efg Hasco\u00ebt are the founders of Bombyx, a respected publishing company with many great games in their catalogue such as Takenoko, The Builders and Abyss. Monolith was created so that we could make the game of our dreams: Conan. HeroQuest was a big part of our gaming culture as kids and we wanted to recreate the joy and immersion we felt for that game back then. So as to stay as true to Robert E. Howard as possible, we hired Patrice Louinet as a consultant, a world renowned expert on this author's works. This gives us a degree of authenticity that is almost unheard of in a product like this. Patrice has approved all the contents of the Barbarian and King box sets as well as most of the stretch goals. Please note that some KS exclusive add-ons to the game will take inspiration from a few non-canon areas which were only mentioned by Robert E. Howard but not fully developed. Patrice was not consulted about those and thus they don't have his approval seal. This being said, we have always kept the spirit of Howard's work in mind and worked under the strict supervision of Paradox Entertainment, owners of the Conan property.\nOn top of the people from Monolith, a huge team of passionate professionals have worked on Conan. Here\u2019s a complete list:\nGame Author: Fred Henry.\nArtwork: Adrian Smith, Brom, Paolo Parente, Kekai Kotaki, Xavier Collette, Naiade, Georges Cl4renko, Alex Tornberg, Per \u00d8. Haagensen, Fang Wangli.\nSculptors: St\u00e9phane Simon, Jacques-Alexandre Gillois, Thomas David, St\u00e9phane Nguyen, Yannick Hennebo, Arnaud Boudoiron, Gr\u00e9gory Clavillier, Elfried Perochon, Rafal Zelazo, Ga\u00ebl Goumon,  Viktor Dragosani, Gautier Giroud & Laslo Forgach.\nGraphic artist: Lo\u00efg Hasco\u00ebt.\nConsultant: Patrice Louinet.\nCommunity manager: Jamie Johnson.\nVideo trailer: Fabien Delarue.\nGame videos producer and presenter: Monsieur Phal\nGaming Rules: Conan: Paul Grogan\nScenario Designers: Antoine Bauza, Ludovic Maublanc, Croc, Bruno Cathala, Laurent Pouchain, Pascal Bernard, Adnane Badi, Jos\u00e9 Chaves, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Soffietti, Itai Perez, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Pinget, David Bertolo, Julian Lemonnier, Philippe Vill\u00e9.\nCommunication: L\u00e9onidas Vesperini\nArtistic director and project manager: Erwan Hasco\u00ebt.\nFrom left to right: St\u00e9phane Simon, Fred Henry, Adrian Smith, Jamie, Patrice Louinet, L\u00e9o Vesperini, Lo\u00efg Hasco\u00ebt, Georges Cl4arenko, St\u00e9phane Nguyen, Adnane Badie, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Pinget.\nConan has had a lot more money invested in it than the majority of board games. If we were to apply the margins of a classic development cycle, the cost of the box set and the stretch goals would be far too high, around $250. The process of desintermediation that is inherant to Kickstarter allows us to reduce this price down to something far more manageable and in line with other large board games. It also allows us to take the product directly to our target audience.\nShipping costs will be applied once the Kickstarter is over so as to allow us to calculate the exact costs when taking into account all the unlocked stretch goals and optional purchases. We have reached an agreement with Asmodee for deliveries in North America and Philibert for Europe.\nSince the project began, we have unlocked a phenomenal amount of Stretch Goals which do of course have an effect on the price of shipping.\nThe latest estimate for a King pledge with all the stretch goals is on average $22 for all American and European addresses.\nThe latest estimate for a King pledge with all stretch goals and all add-ons (including the 3 expansions boxes: Khitai, Stygia and Nordheim) is on average $34 for American addresses and $27 for European addresses.\nFor all other parts of the world, it is a lot harder for us to get a precise estimation as we do not have logistical hubs there. Therefore, please bear in mind that the figures below are deliberately overestimated in an attempt to prevent any last minute surprises, so they are more than likely to change!\n\u2022 South America : $80 \u2022 New Zealand : $90 \u2022 Australia : $80 \u2022 South Africa : $100 \u2022 Japan : $55 \u2022 China : $80 \u2022 Taiwan : $60\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. If we cannot guarantee that all backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, then we can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the Kickstarter one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time however, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.

It takes a world you think you\u2019ve read about before and turns it into something new and totally different.\nThis is the finest time to be a tabletop roleplayer since the dawn of the industry. With so many great choices on the market, your imagination has nearly infinite paths for which to choose and expand upon. With the recent release of the newest version of Dungeons & Dragons, players are chomping at the bit to exercise their imaginations and spread their ideas wide. With the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting and future sourcebook line, you can do just that. Seventh Crown is a narrative setting and sourcebook that can be used with the rules found within many popular roleplaying game systems.\nCover of Seventh Crown Setting Book\nWelcome to Seventh Crown\nBased initially within the heavily populated continent of Kanis, Seventh Crown is a setting that places the players in the middle of an epic time of change in a world controlled by a select few. What was once a powerful dwarven empire now stands as broken racial kingdoms not defined by borders or territories, but by the ironclad magical control bestowed upon them by the crowns upon their brow.\nIn Seventh Crown, six golden artifacts of unfathomable power \u2013 the Crowns of Leadership \u2013 give almost ultimate and untested influence over those of the same race. While wearing the Crown, they cannot help but be king or queen of their people. This has led to a world of kingdoms that are not defined on maps or in war rooms, but instead by the blood that runs in a people\u2019s veins. Authority enforced by magic across countless miles creates alliances, enemies and conflicts unlike those found anywhere else. When the reason for going to war is as simple as the will of who wears the Crown and the battlefield could be as complex as anywhere its people tread, life is a complex thing.\nThese six Crowns are the most powerful and important pieces of antiquity found anywhere in this world, and are watched and sought after by most of the people in Kanis. The dealings of the Crowns and the choices made by those who wear them are the talk of every town and city, and entire lifetimes have been spent trying to place a Crown on someone\u2019s head \u2013 or remove the head currently wearing one. Territorial governments, the constabulary, organized crime and other local powerhouses rule their corners of civilization for the most part, but everyone feels the pull of the Crown bearers\u2019 schemes and machinations.\nIt is the rumored existence of a seventh Crown of Leadership, the namesake of the game setting itself, which drives some people to scour the world for the mythic artifact. There have been six ruling forces on Kanis for thousands of years, many of which changing hands (heads?) over and over again, but the fact that there have always been six has been a constant for as long as the Crowns have existed. The discovery and donning of a seventh Crown of Leadership would change the world in an instant\u2026 or the discovery that it has already been found, and by what.\nThe continent of Kanis is large and varied in respect to the peoples that inhabit it, the history they have survived, and all of the interactions in between. Depending on the where someone is from, which King or Queen they serve willingly or otherwise, and how they plan to fill their purses or bellies day to day \u2013 that is where adventure will spring from in Seventh Crown.\nThe Surface of Kanis\nWhat is Different?\nAnyone can read through the newest game system and see what each creature, species or deity means to a \u201cnormal\u201d campaign setting. Seventh Crown takes a lot of these standard ideas found in several rulebooks and turns them into brand new ideas that come together to create a new and unique world where players can portray characters like they never have before. There are plotlines and narrative hooks found within Seventh Crown that will put players in unique new roles as well as give them interactions with the world not commonly possible in other settings.\nJust to give a number of good examples, the following are all samples of what makes Seventh Crown unique, interesting and a great deal of fun in which to roleplay.\nThe current King of the Elves is a sadistic dark elf warlock with the long term plan of breeding out the surface elves by forcing hospitality between the Surface World and the Great Beneath. Over the centuries dark elves have become a much more accepted sight on the surface, and travel to the depths of the Great Beneath is more commonplace despite its inherent dangers.\nThe halfling people suffered massive losses during a horrible war that forced their people into nomadic, extended families that travel Kanis in search of joy, profit and adventure. Their stories and culinary crafts are welcomed almost universally in Kanisi civilization.\nIcon of Vimbre Po; Laughing God of Halfling Nomads\nThe dragonborn of Kanis are primarily mercenaries and seafarers, with those of chromatic heritage leaning toward life as sell swords or pirates; metallic dragonborn finding more favor as professional soldiers and trading corsairs. The two sects of dragonborn are constantly at odds, and many conflicts have begun based solely on \u201cscale color.\u201d\nOne corner of the continent is currently dealing with a large scale guerilla war between the goblinoids and the kobolds, putting some local civilizations in strange circumstances for unlikely social situations and alliances.\nThere is a militant sect within the dwarves that harken to the days when their bloodlines ruled the entire continent as a royal Dynasty. These dwarves are old-minded, somewhat racist toward certain peoples, and belligerently aimed at returning the dwarves to former glory.\nThe gnomes of Kanis are willingly subservient to dwarves and have been for thousands of years. Their acceptance of a lower station in life is a key element to a larger meta-mathematical equation that their ancient scholars believe will finalize with the gnomish people ruling the entire world. Effectively, the gnomes believe they have discovered the formula for complete domination of Kanis; it only requires a few more centuries of servitude to come to fruition.\nAnd much, much more!\nSymbol of Foeslen, God of Thieves and Muggers\nWhat will be in the Seventh Crown core book?\nThe Seventh Crown core book, the goal of this Kickstarter, when published will be a hardcover tome of roughly 150 pages written, designed, illustrated and laid out by industry professionals to create a complete sourcebook for the continent of Kanis and the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting. While it will contain some rules information specific to the Seventh Crown setting, it will NOT include a core system of rules. Instead it relies upon the player(s) to use it alongside obviously compatible rules systems.\nThe Seventh Crown Core Setting Book will include:\nA detailed History of the continent of Kanis, its many Cultures and its current Rulers\nA detailed Pantheon of Kanisi deities, including their effect upon Clerics, Paladins and Druids in Seventh Crown\nA detailed look at the Geography and Civilizations of Kanis\nNew Kanisi Backgrounds, Feats and Spells\nFull Color Unique Illustrations throughout\nFull Color Maps of the Kanis surface world and the subterranean Great Beneath\nNarrative Stories set in the world of Seventh Crown (some starring characters from higher-level Backers!)\nPlot Hooks and Adventure Ideas; including two detailed 1st-level Campaign Starters\nA Glossary of Seventh Crown terms to help with pronunciation and explanation\nWhat do you get for your backing?\nAside from being a part of the launch of a great new game setting, hopefully giving it enough fan backing to begin a full Seventh Crown line of sourcebooks and such in the near future, you faithful backers can get some really awesome rewards for helping us get off the ground!\nThe Copper Piece Level \u2013 For just $2 or more you throw in your attentions to the campaign and help keep the Kickstarter \u201cHot Picks\u201d eyes peeled on our little project here.

During these events we will be taking charitable food donations (Canned and sealed-boxed items only) from the players AND bystanders to be given to the local Food Finders Food Bank (http://food-finders.org/) to serve as points of Inspiration to modify the game in progress.

The pixel art visual style delivers a weird and twisted tale of a world\u2019s last 3 weeks.\nIn the interest of time, here is the short summary of what this game is:\nA grand misery.  \nNonlinear storytelling.  \nMultiple endings.\n Countless secrets.\n Architectural level design.\n Alternative routes, shortcuts.\n Different characters have entirely different routes for the same level. \u2022 Up to 20 different weapons and spells for each character.  \nDestructible environments; burn, blow and slash your way through obstacles. Who needs keys when you have a rocket launcher?  \nNo tiles. Each level is hand drawn.  \nA mixed technology setting; swords meeting magic and space age technology.  \nThemes inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft.\nRead on for a detailed description, but why just read when you can play the demo instead?\n\"Gameplay is King\"\nWhile many play games to seek out good stories or characters, gameplay still needs to be a priority when considering a game. Games are interactive and you cannot deliver an interesting world unless your gameplay compliments the art.\nBorder\u2019s first goal is to deliver a smooth and fast paced game, one that is fun and fair to play while still being really challenging.\nUpon starting the game, your goal will be clear, you will have 3 characters to choose from and 3 of the huge main areas open to you.\nEach character has an entirely different entry point and portion of the map accessible to them; aside from the end bosses of each of these areas, they won\u2019t share any bosses. This means that replaying a level with another character is an entirely different experience.\nOnce selecting your area you will have a clear goal but multiple ways to reach it. The architectural level design ensures that shortcuts are present and many in number. Hand drawn areas make navigation easy, also helpful is the fact that defeated enemies and their remains will never disappear.\nYou will eventually come across unique enemies or fallen warriors who will grant you access to new weapons or spells.\nWeapons and Spells.\nThese are the focus of your character. They all have entirely different move sets, strengths and weaknesses. Many of these weapons and spells can grant you access to new areas, similar to the traditional Metrodvania formula. All of these weapons and spells use the same resource: your stamina. All of these areas are full of secrets and Easter eggs.\nThe game uses a natural method of storytelling where the environment tells a story on its own, without much exposition. Additionally the game\u2019s \"cut scenes\" will never wrestle the control away from the player; the camera never loses sight of the player, and if you don't want to listen to your enemy\u2019s monologue you can always interrupt them with a well-aimed punch to the face.\nOn your journey you can sometimes come across NPCs who are neither friends nor foes, some will talk to you, but you might never know if they will become your enemies later or not.\nSooner or later you will die. When you do so, you will lose all of the souls attached to you. However, they can be recovered - similar to how it works in the Souls series of games.\nAside from your weapons you will have a few things always available to you, these are as follows.\nHealing: you can only heal with charges in your crystal fragment, these replenish at every checkpoint.\nProtection spell: each character has their own altered version of this basic spell. It deflects weapon hits and reflects projectiles, but cannot defend you from area of effect spells and traps.\nShifting: it\u2019s a form of dash that allows for a short burst of rapid movement. It also allows you to trigger traps and area of effects without being harmed.\nOverextension system. This is an extremely powerful offensive ability available to you. When used it will increase all of your stats drastically and provide a special move set that can decimate foes, and turn the odds in your favour. However, to activate this you need to sacrifice one of your charges used for healing.This mode lasts only for a short time, unless you sacrifice another charge while the mode is active.\nOnce you reach your destination at the end of an area, and complete your mission, you will return to your base of operation: the Nagifar. On this space-worthy ship you can upgrade your skills, exchange a few words with the other characters, and learn a bit about the world you\u2019re in.\nBosses are a big focus of the game. They are usually one on one affairs, many of them will try and communicate with you in some way, some have multiple ways to defeat them, and these ways can alter the story and the NPCs that you might come upon later on. Expect these to be challenging encounters.\nOnce ready, you select the character and the area of your choice again.\nBased on your choice of who finishes which area, the story will shift and change and you might understand a bit more about the world, and why it will end...\nBorder: Remembrance takes place in what is known as a mixed technology setting. This is a world housing nations with largely different levels of technology and prosperity. After a cataclysmic war, the world reawakened with newfound magic, and new forms of life, with some survivors using advanced technology some even living in space.\nFrom sprawling city nations to abandoned temples to lads crawling with robots, this is a chaotic world.\nVisit the Forest of the Seal, where once a great nation gathered mages to perform \"The First Summoning\", now the land is overtaken by nature and infested with Demons. Still, the descendants of the few survivors still guard this place and fight to stop the spread of Demons any further.\nForest of the Seal.\nFight your way through the city nation of Berelaai, the largest remaining Human kingdom, and witness as the church turns to madness in the face of imminent destruction.\nCity of Berelaai.\nBattle with the elements as you search the new South Pole for the hidden city of Artificial Intelligence: this city houses Millions of AIs who escaped the last Great War. See with your own eyes how the calculus of AIs deal with the destruction of the moon.\nUnity AI.\nDelve deep into the Sunken City, where Geometry and conventional logic will be of no help to you. Fight the cursed inhabitants of this ancient and unnatural place.\nSunken City.\nEnter the space station of Yggdrasil, where the gears of technology never stopped. Decide the fate of the scientists now thrust into a civil war, and the moon threatens even the station.\nYggdrasil space station.\nA group of these scientists decided to completely isolate themselves from others and delve into experiments with the new found magic in the world.\nProject Aesir.\nThis project gave birth to your playable characters: humanoids with inhuman everlasting life given to them.\nFrey\nMidir\nBaldar\nSif\nAt the beginning of the game, you, the player, trigger a terrible explosion on the moon. This will cause 35% of the moon\u2019s mass to break apart and begin its 3 week long journey toward the earth. This means the end of all complex life on the planet for good.\nYou caused this, and there is no saving the world this time.\nThe story focuses on 3 characters form the Aesir project who can be considered a new race of humans. They have everlasting youth and possess bodies more resilient than those of normal humans.\nThese Demigods will set out on a journey to form what are known as the Mana Stones, fuse them with as many souls as they can and find a new world to plant these souls after the destruction.\nBut as this cataclysm waiting for the world is absolutely undeniable, the people of this world will have a hard time dealing with the concept of certain doom.\nYou will visit the two great kingdoms of man who are at each other\u2019s throats, each blaming the other for the destruction of the moon. Uncover the remains of the Demon Palace, where a once great soul was sealed away. Enter and marvel at the nation of Artificial Intelligences built for themselves. Delve deep into the cosmic chaos of the Sunken Capital. And witness a pointless war just before the end of the world.\nYour journey will deal with themes of absolute certain loss, cosmic insignificance, and how the different cultures reflect on their actions near the end of everything they know.\nBy the end you might even uncover why the destruction was triggered, and expose a great mystery.\nYou might say that there is a strong atmosphere of desperation and unavoidable destruction in Border\u2026 well, you'd be right! One way of setting the tone is with an engaging storyline, but to really feel as if you are actually there you're going to need music. Whether it is just simple background ambience or full-blown musical scores, with Border, the aim has always been to enhance whatever scene or idea I have been given to work from by creating music around it - thus creating a real emotional connection with the player.\nThe music creation is actually a two-way process. I am given a detailed description of either a character, event, battle, area or scene using keywords. I may also be given specific restraints such as which instruments to use, or how the music should progress. Then with this information I will usually begin to formulate ideas in my head, imagining certain emotions that may be present. Usually this begins on piano only, then I will add more instruments in once I have a confident starting point.\nOnce this has been roughly assembled, it will be sent to Istvan for feedback. From there changes can easily and quickly be made if need be. This whole process for one piece of music takes between a few hours to a few days - depending on the complexity of the music and time constraints. The benefits of working this way are clear - not only is the whole process extremely quick, but the constant feedback ultimately provides Istvan with music that compliments the original design intentions and the atmosphere that is needed in a game like Border: Remembrance.\nNote: To clarify all console versions listed will be released, stretchgoals only means they can be released the same time the PC versions will be released. If stretchgoals are not reached we will still release on the listed consoles but only some time later.\n---\u00a34.000 Flyable world map.---\nA fully detailed world map you can fly your Spaceship around, and even discover hidden areas and secret bosses.\n---\u00a35.000 Forgotten age Dungeon.---\nAn endgame dungeon featuring 7 Bosses of extreme difficulty, offering more clues about the language used in the game.\n---\u00a36.000 More Music.---\nMore haunting musical tracks from the talented Jamie Warne.\n---\u00a38.000 Hiring Help from community.---\nHiring help to work on even more enemies\u2019 pixel art animations, this means a faster development, and more content.\n---\u00a310.000 PS4 and PS VITA Versions on launch.---\nConsole versions with Console specific controls. Stretchgoal is ONLY to ensure the console versions will release on launch. If the goal is not met, the first sales on PC will cover the costs of the porting, meaning around two months delay.\n---\u00a312.000 local Co-op & Duel Mode.---\nPick up a second controller, or do it the good old fashioned way and share the same keyboard. Challenge your friends in a super fast paced Duel arena, up to 4 players.\n---\u00a316.000 Voice acting.---\nIf available using the voice talents of: Megan Hollingshead (Pokemon, Code Geass, and countless amazing video game performances.) for the role of Frey.\nJohnny Yong Bosch (Code Geass, Haruhi, and hundreds of amazing video game performances.) for the role of Baldar.\nLiam O'Brien (Bleach, Code Geass, and hundreds of amazing video game performances.) for the role of Midir.\n*If said voice talents will be unavailable the voice work will be hired from indie voice actors.\n---\u00a318.000 Nintendo WII U version on launch.---\nThanks to Nintendo`s latest policies this can become a reality. Console versions with Console specific controls. Stretchgoal is ONLY to ensure the console versions will release on launch. If the goal is not met, the first sales on PC will cover the costs of the porting.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nBecause aside from the music, this is purely a one man game. Currently I`m working odd jobs through temporary employment, I have little time left, and given a successful Kickstarter I can dedicate more time to the game. Pixel work and Coding takes a lot of time.\nReleasing a game also involves taxes, and that requires paperwork. Setting up a proper website and distribution of the DRM free version is not free either.\nKickstarter is also a great opportunity to interact with the target audience, survey their feelings about the game and potential ideas on how to improve it - more eyes see a lot more.\nThis means I plan to do weekly updates, during and after the Kickstarter. If you want extra reassurance follow me on Twitter where I`ll be talking about my daily progress, and sharing art from the game on a regular basis. From YouTube gameplay snippets, to Twitch pixel art and GML coding sessions, to crafting Music with Jam, I plan to make the development of the game a more open experience.\nBackers can expect a playable demo of the game for pc shortly after the end of the Kickstarter.\nOur Website: http://www.fallenvalkyriestudio.com/\nOur Press kit: http://www.fallenvalkyriestudio.com/press-kit/\nFor more art, please visit my Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/fallenvalkyriestudio\nOr our IndieDB page: http://www.indiedb.com/games/border-remembrance\nOr just follow me on Twitter for daily Pixelart, and updates on the game`s progress: https://twitter.com/FValkyrieStudio\nThank you very much for reading.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAside from the Music this is a one man effort.\nThere are obviously positives and negatives to this. The negative is the possibility of getting swamped, luckily the game`s code is 70% complete. Most of my time will be spent on asset creation. The upside of this is the ability to keep the vision and game design consistent.\n\nI have a really clear vision of what this game should be, and value the responsiveness and comfort in gameplay firstly.\nThis means I am to make a game that first feels solid and plays smoothly before trying to deliver my artistic goals.\n\nThe game is currently fully functioning, and all coding besides menus is finished. Using GML means that even if problems were to occur, they are incredibly easy to fix. At this time the game has no bugs or glitches, and the game runs at a steady 60fps on 1080P resolution on 5 year old computer hardware. Performance still persists when using over 100 enemies on screen!\n\nThe only risk I can run into is being late on release, I value a strong finished version over buggy and barely functioning early access.\n\nThe main challenge is obviously time. There is a LOT of sprite animating to be done here, but again a lot of training got me to a really efficient method, which should make all of this possible in the desired time frame.\n\nAs I stated earlier I will make the development of this game very open to the public, I have nothing to hide, and will do everything in my power to be transparent!\n\nThank you very much for reading.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Istvan Gal\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nMy name is Istvan Gal, a Hungarian living and working in the UK for almost 4 years now.

(http://www.bitmapd.com/welcome)\n\n Get yours in the backer rewards list now! :-)\nWhy Use Kickstarter?  \nAs kids growing up, we had a plethora of animated shows on American TV that spanned all genres -- action, adventure, comedy, dark humor; some content with mature themes and some educational... But over the years, the economy has influenced studios to become more risk-averse towards new ideas that don't already have a built-in following (e.g. celebrity talent) or an established franchise. And if so, it catered more towards comedy.\nAs a lover of comedy and big franchises myself (and having worked on dozens in my time), I still secretly yearned for more adventure shows that had plenty of comedy, but also a sprawling drama at its core -- along with kick-butt action and memorable characters! \nEnter crowdfunding, one of the most liberating platforms for the independent creator! After giving it a lot of thought (and much encouragement from my peers), I thought, ''What if I just brought an action-adventure dramedy series to the fans and admirers of this genre, instead of going through a network who would use focus groups to determine if my project was even worth seeing the light of day? Why not go the REAL focus group? The ones who would actually donate to see a project like this come together with some of the most exciting talents--domestic and abroad-- in the industry today?\"\n\nSo here we are. We're trying to make this unique and exciting journey a reality -- and we need YOUR SUPPORT in backing this project! Let's make Cannon Busters happen! \nWhere Your Donation Funds Will Go\nAll donations will go to the production and increased quality of one episode of Cannon Busters! Each donation from you, the backers, will get us closer to delivering something new, exciting, and high quality! In the event that we unfortunately fail to reach at least our passion-project minimum of $120k before the ending campaign date listed above, Amazon will not charge you and we will not achieve our goal. So we really need your support to make this happen!\n8-10 Minute Pilot Minimum Goal Budget of $120k:\nKickstarter's billing is payment by credit card with an http://www.amazon.com account.

Many believe those stories to be myths, cautionary tales to keep mortals living in fear. However, one thing is for certain. A world without balance is a world that is vulnerable to absolute destruction. It is for this reason that I say, let the gods forever stay the Days of Astasia.\u201d\n\u2013 Dreyer Maloth, the 44th Archbason of the Spearitan Faith\nCurrent publication of \"Eve of Corruption\"\nWhat is The Days of Astasia\nThe short answer: it\u2019s a trilogy of books written by me, Brady Sadler, drummer and founder of the fantasy metal band Lorenguard. Book one (Eve of Corruption) is already written and published, and I am currently working on book two.\nThe Days of Asatsia is the setting for all the music written by Lorenguard, and it's what makes the band a little different. It's not uncommon for bands to write concept albums based on existing intellectual properties, or even create their own stories. However, Lorenguard strives to increase the level of immersion their music inspires by crafting a unique saga in the form of this book trilogy.\nRead a sample chapter of Eve of Corruption.\nInitially, The Days of Astasia was a story concept to inspire my newly found power metal band with writing lyrics to our music. However, as time went on, the tales evolved in depth and complexity to warrant a full-fledged telling of the story behind the music. Now, The Days of Astasia is a trilogy of books and albums that is written, performed, and released independently by six Midwestern metalhead geeks called Lorenguard.\nWhy We Need Your Help\nCurrently, the Eve of Corruption novel is widely available as an eBook through the major distribution channels. However, the print version is only available through print-on-demand, which carries a heavy retail price tag, and suffers from quality control that is out of our hands. Our goal is to send book one of The Days of Astasia trilogy to print through traditional methods (off-set, large print run) to make it more widely available, while also creating a much more premium product.\nAdditionally, this Kickstarter will hopefully help further the production of book two in the trilogy, Two Shades of Night. Brady has moved from the outlining/planning phase for this book, and has started the long road of writing. Any interest generated by this Kickstarter will fuel the release of the next book in turn, starting with the funding of the next book's cover art.\nFinally, this Kickstarter has been designed to not only fund a print run of books, but to help the band fund their upcoming endeavors, including live appearances and the recording of album two, slated for 2015.\nAny support you can give this Kickstarter will only quicken the band's pace in releasing new music and booking shows.\nWhat\u2019s in it for You\nObviously, this isn\u2019t all about us and our little fantasy world. It's about you. You\u2019re the backers here, and we won\u2019t be able to do it without you.

We have been playing music together for 10+ years with our members scattered all over the United States. However, in 2014 we managed to relocate all the members to the place of our formation (Indiana) to begin our plans of world domination. This is step one.\nLorenguard consists of:\nBrady Sadler (drums): As the initial founder and visionary of Lorenguard, it is completely Brady's fault that the band faces the difficult task of writing music around his whimsical stories. In addition to being the band's drummer and author, he is also overly addicted to board games, spending any of his free time playing them or designing them with his brother, Adam.\nAdam Sadler (bass guitar): Tied with Brady for first place in the \"First Member of Lorenguard\" contest, Adam has always been part of Lorenguard's foundation. Also a game designer and enthusiast, Adam was the lead designer for one of the highest ranked board games of the past several years (Descent: Journeys in the Dark 2nd Edition by Fantasy Flight Games).\nChris Cruz (guitar): Lorenguard would have never been a reality if it wasn't for the creative songwriting, superhuman guitar work, and addictive laughter of Chris Cruz. It was Chris that answered Brady's long dangling internet request for band members in the power metal-starved fields of Indiana, and it was Chris that brought the music to the world of Athland.\nDavid Schneider (guitar): As a fan of the band before joining, David has always brought a level of passion and excitement to Lorenguard that is unmatched. He has been with the band almost as long as Adam and Brady, and has become a third twin that can handle three times as much alcohol.\nAlec Biccum (keyboards): It's hard to describe Alec without using the term \"brilliant.\" Not only is he a masterclass musician, able to play coherent melodies from anything you put in front of him, he's also one of the most accomplished scholars you'll meet. He has a PhD in medical physics and a million doctorates in symphonic fortitude.\nRobb Graves (vocals): Hailing from the band Winterfell (yeah, he knew what GRRM was before HBO came around, fool), Robb was the final piece to the Lorenguard puzzle. With a slew of creative talents, shrewd business sense, and an unforgiving streak as a dungeon master, Robb serves as the band's frontman, lyricist, accountant, and TPKer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince \"Eve of Corruption\" has already been published (and is currently available for purchase), there is little risk involved in this Kickstarter.

Well known for our already expansive line of fantasy adventurers and various Monster figures we now want to expand and update as much of the line as possible, This means all new sculpts for as many of the various ranges in the RBG product line as funding will allow. To begin I have sculpted a wide selection of new figures which are nearly ready to go into production as of the launch of this kickstarter. These figures include;\nNJORN.................................................\nTRADKARL THE WANDERER ................................................................\nULLR THE RED..........................................................................................\nHAWKEYED ARVID..................................................................................\nEGILHARD THE PEACEMAKER..............................................................\nDAGMAR OF THE SHIELD.........................................................................\nAENGLISH..................................................................................................\n   HARALD OF GUILLING.........add to your pledge for $8.00............\nOSWALT OF SWITHINGKEEP...............add to your pledge for $8.00..\nLORD EDGAR CHALMSFHORD OF SWITHINGKEEP...........................\n........add to your pledge for $8.00............................................................\n...........................add to your pledge for $8.00.........................................\n...........................add to your pledge for $8.00.........................................\n ..............................................FUNDED................................................................add to your pledge as a themed set of five or pick and choose a la carte for $8.00 each................................................................................\n  MELEE BRIGANDS!!!!\n   pictured left to right; Burt the brash, Ugly Jack, Dirk the N'er Do Well, Lanky Jim, and Shifty Seamus.\n  ..............................................FUNDED!!!....................................................\n......................add to your pledge rewards for $8.00..................................\nRed Meghan.................................................................................................\n .............................................FUNDED!!!................................................................................add to your pledge for $8.00.............................................\nIngvar the Brash..........................................................................................\nThese figures are intended to be the launching point for this campaign. I have several others underway at various stages of completion which will be offered as rewards as funding allows. I am capable of sculpting one full figure a day when I am \" on my game \", and that is exactly where I intend to be during the span of this effort so stay tuned for more awesome stuff!\n  I am REALLY very excited about this campaign and chewing the edge my my shield to get back into the battle! I am a mad berserker miniature sculptor waiting for the hordes to cheer me on!\nPRODUCTION.............................................................................................\n   I work with multiple contractors for my moldmaking and casting needs so I am confident that even if I fund upwards of 30 figures I can deliver the rewards in total by January, with Delivery in December being the ideal goal. To do this i will be splitting the work between 3 contractors as the number of figures funded mounts. If the number goes over 32 figures then delivery will slip into February / March.\nMATERIALS..................................................................................................\nAll Red Box Games figures are cast in high quality white metal ( well, occasionally I produce a few figures in resin when neccessary. ) by well established and time tested professionals. There is no bait and switch here. What you see is what you get. There is no loss of detail, no flattened sculptures. No \" unreadable \" details. I work very hard to insure that my sculptures work well for the production methods used and that the people with whom I work are very good at what they do. My figures are all lovingly hand sculptedand molded and cast right here in the United States or in the UK. \n\n  Thus far in my recent kickstarters my production partners have come through at every turn with excellent results. I am very proud to work with them and honoured by their service to me and to you in turn. Thank you Valiant Enterprises ( who has handled my past two kickstarters exclusively ) , Omar's Workshop, Majestic Moldmaking Company, and Griffin Moulds ltd.\nADD-ONS....................................................................................................\n   Backers can add on to their existing pledges by managing the dollar value of their pledge upward according to the number of figures desired and the amount needed to cover the costs of those selections. Backers are free to add as many add-ons to their pledge as they wish.\nSHIPPING.....................................................................................................  \nShipping costs are included in the pledges covering the rewards listed in the pledge itself. Additional shipping costs may be incurred as packages are added on to with unlocks. If additional postage is required the amount will be assessed and invoiced to you at such time as your package is ready to ship. Once that extra postage is paid your package will be shipped immediately! :)\nGAME RULES...............................................................................................\n I get this question very often and I can say that now yes the rules are officially underway. My aim is to make a hybrid dungeon crawler - adventure RPG / skirmish game that recalls the spirit of old school role playing games with efficient intuitive rules for resolving combat, movement, enviornmental and character interactions. To this end I have recruited the services of a tested professional to take my initial ideas and turn them in to a real, working, well written, and slepl chekced game. This is still an early work in progress but it is underway. Eventually, sometime in 2015 I will run a strictly focused kickstarter to fund the printing of the book once all of the assets are in place. So if having a game to use with your RBG minis has held you back in the past then rest assured I am correcting that gap as this campaign funds.

Recently, he asked Luke Crane (of Burning Wheel and the Mouse Guard RPG) to come up with some rules for the game and so we did!\nWe developed a light strategy game for two players that takes 10 to 20 minutes time per game. It's exactly the sweet spot we hoped for\u2014a game you can play while you're sitting at the June Alley Inn listening to tales, or when you're waiting for your friends to arrive for a game night, or when you're waiting in long lines at comicons!\nAfter he depicted the game in the comics, David created a prototype based on his drawings. This is what we started with for the game design. \nThe game has a wooden gridded board, four mouse pawns for each player and a deck of sword, stronghold and diplomacy cards.\nAfter we created the initial rules, we sent out a print and play version to our friends and fans to play test for us. Notably, Scott and Rym from the GeekNights gave it a good thrashing for us.  \nWe want to do a small production run with high quality components for Mouse Guard fans everywhere and we need your help to do it. We'd much rather show this game to you so you can tell us what you think than gamble on printing off a bunch and shipping them straight into distribution. David and I love our fans and we want you to be a part of making this game.\nThe base set will include a wooden board, eight plastic mouse pawns, 30 cards (on 300 gsm coated stock or better) in a sturdy tuck box or sleeve, and a rules sheet complete with example illustrations. The game will be contained in a cardboard two piece box with a full color wrap.\nThe deluxe set will be made by Skelton Crew Studios (who make the Mouse Guard replica weapons) and includes an oversized board in cherry with a felt bottom; a box of cherry wood that's felt-lined and laser-etched, with a hand-rubbed finish; eight lead-free plated pewter mouse pawns, 30 letter-pressed cards on 80lb French Parchtone cover stock (printed by Silver Bullet Press) and the illustrated rules sheet. \nA few lucky backers can acquire some of David's original art for the game. We're offering, individually, the face of each card and the card back. Each piece is 4.25\" by 6\", inked on Strathmore 300 series Bristol.\nThe original inks for the cover are 8.5\" square also on Strathmore 300 series Bristol.

These figures will be produced in high quality white metal by a very reliable and tested production partner with a proven track record for great castings and reliable delivery.\n The figures I intend to offer for funding are the semi modular HelsVakt Hordesmen and two hero figures. The Hordesmen set includes 6 bodies fitted for universally interchangeable heads ( 1 sprue of 6  options ), right hands with weapons ( 2 sprues of 3 options ) and left side shields ( 2 sprues of 3 options) and 6 25 mm round bases.\nHordesmen kits\nheads options ( D,E,F )\nShould funding allow I do have a few manageable stretch goals planned to expand this offering. \n STRETCH GOAL #1 $7,500.00 FUNDED!!!!!!!!\nSVARTULF THE SAVAGE\n  Hordesman Hero with two handed sword. Once the funding total reaches $7,500.00 Svartulf will unlock as a reward selection. Backers will be able to add Svartulf to their pledge rewards by adding $8.00 ( $10.00 RRP ) to their existing pledge. This figure will be cast in high quality white metal and will be supplied with a 30 mm round plastic base. The figure may or may not be cast in a single piece.\nSvartulf the Savage\n STRETCH GOAL #2 $9,000.00 FUNDED!!!!!!\n  HAKAR THE HORRIBLE\nHordesmen Hero with Battle Axe. Once the funding total reaches $9,000.00 Hakar will unlock as a reward selection. Backers will be able to add Hakar to their pledge rewards by adding $8.00 ( $10.00 RRP ) to their existing pledge. This figure will be cast in high quality white metal and will be supplied with a 30 mm round plastic base. The figure may or may not be cast in a single piece.\nHakar the Horrible\n STRETCH GOAL # 3 $14,000.00 FUNDED!!!!!!\n Once the funding total reaches $14,000.00 The Craven will unlock as an add-on option. Backers will be able to add one rank of Craven ( 3 figures ) to their existing pledge for $20.00 per set. The Craven will be cast in high quality white metal in a single piece and will include one 25 mm base per figure in the set.\n\n  The Craven. Murderous cowards who strike from the shadows with poisoned arrows and daggers, swift, silent, and utterly without conscience, the Craven are as feared as they are loathed. Pictured below is the first of three figures planned for this unit. \nCraven\n  STRETCH GOAL # 4 $16,500.00 FUNDED!!!\n  Bloody Garm\nOnce funding reaches $16,500.00 Bloody Garm will unlock as an $8.00 ( $10.00 RRP ) add-on to your existing pledge. This figure will be cast in high quality white metal and will be supplied with  25 mm round plastic base. This may or may not be cast in a single piece.\nBloody Garm\n STRETCH GOAL # 5 $19,500.00 FUNDED!!!!\nVALDA THE BLACK HEARTED!!!\nOnce funding reaches $19,500.00 the Valda the Black Hearted figure will unlock as a $8.00 ( $10.00 RRP ) selectable add-on to your existing pledge. Valda is currently a WIP planned to be the leading heroine of the CRaven. As such she will be armed with a dagger and bow and garbed similarly to the other Craven. This figure will be cast in high quality white metal and will be supplied with a 30 mm round plastic base. The figure may or may not be cast in a single piece.\n  STRETCH GOAL #6 $25,000.00 FUNDED!!!!!\n  DRAUGR!!!!\nOnce the funding level reaches the $25,000.00 mark the Draugr will unlock as a $30.00 selectable add-on to your existing pledge reward.

This is something I really would love to get to and really do right, but I really want to make sure I am able to afford it before I get too deeply in to the project. It is intended to be a half armoured, axe wielding, helmed Barbarian Warlord that will match in theme to the Hrodesmen, Craven, and Heroes.\nMounted Hero WIP\n  Beyond this I would also really like to make a foot version of the mounted Hero and to revisit the armoured elite troops as well as the previous incarnations are just too expensive to keep in stock or to sell with the intent to build units.\nAgain, as in my most previous campaign, I am keeping the scope of this effort very limited in order to mitigate delays and difficulties to best insure that you will receive your rewards as quickly as possible and to the highest level of quality that I can manage to capture. \n Each figure will be supplied with a 25 mm round plastic base.\n The Shipping costs are built in to the pledge totals and once the figures are received your order will be shipping according to your place in the delivery queue as defined in the delivery date of the pledge level you contribute to.\n  If you are interested in seeing more of the Red Box Games line of miniatures please visit our web store at http://www.red-box-games.com/we are still recovering from our difficulties so please pardon the crudeness of the site. I do intend to reinvest as much of the kickstarter profits as I am able into the development of the web site and Red Box Games fantasy IP.\n  Thank you very much for your time and attention.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt is no secret that I have had my share of difficulties with past campaigns.\n\nThough my first ( and second ) campaign was difficult and suffered lengthy delays it is now all but completely fulfilled as promised with only a handful of packages awaiting the delivery of bases to finish delivery. I expect these bases to be delivered within the next 5 days of launching this campaign at which point these final packages will at last be shipped.\n\n I have learned a LOT of hard lessons in how kickstarters should be run and the difficulties in fulfilling these campaigns. I have been running Red Box Games since August of 2008 and in that time I have gained a great deal of experience in running a miniatures business. In my first campaign I allowed my ambition to override my better judgement, and in my second campaign I allowed desperation to cloud my better judgement all the same. I have learned that in order to be successful I must rebuild my business block by block and that is what I have set about doing. \n\n The challenge is of course to handle all of the communications necessary to make this project go as smoothly as possible for everyone involved. I have quite a bit of experience with that so I do not foresee it being more than I can handle. Then the second challenge is just managing the product through the chain of production and delivery. The production is out of my hands ( unfortunately ) but I AM working with a very reliable and well established production partner who has proven themselves time and again with previous projects I have hired them for.\n\nFinally, risk......The benefit to producing in metal is that the production process is fairly easy and very reliable. With metal what you see is what you get 99 times out of 100. There are also several production firms to choose from if the production does happen to go awry with primary production partner. I do not anticipate any difficulties as this partner has always performed well in the past and has the capacity to handle larger orders in a short period of time.\n\nThe only real risk I can imagine is delay due to the production partner's work load or if something catastrophic were to happen to their facility during production with the originals in their possession. Or if something catastrophic were to happen to me during fulfillment. In either scenario though the figures can be re-sculpted or recovered or remolded elsewhere. Or in the latter scenario someone else would take on the task of fulfilling the remaining rewards as promised.\n\n This campaign will deliver the figures that you see advertised as promised.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "goblins and trolls and wolves oh my!!", "update_content": "Hey Everybody!\n  I have just released my newest work in the Red Box Games store.

Catastrophic quakes and natural disasters have devastated the planet, wreaking havoc on our civilization and swallowing whole cities as nature reclaimed hers. \nOur planet, now a harbor for outlaws, ash-runners, gangsters and vagrants, is no longer the crown jewel of the Sol System, that honor belongs to Jupiter, a hub of interstellar trade, commerce and the seat of politics. The titular Outcasts of Jupiter are just that, a group of four vagabonds deemed persona non grata on most civilized worlds, bound by a common purpose - the promise of roaming the fringes of an untamed and wild galaxy, identifying unique and unusual jobs that spark their collective interests and challenge their unique abilities. \n We meet Stein, Sulesh and Denarii in the middle of attempting a jailbreak. The reasons for Persio's abduction become clearer over the course of the comic's run, but it's up to the rest of the team to get him out of the Burj, a mysterious tower located in the courtyard of a heavily fortified clifftop palace. \nThe first issue focuses almost entirely on the daring rescue attempt, and gives readers an idea of the tense and fragile political landscape of the City of Seven Faces, a web of deception and intrigue in which the Outcasts find themselves entangled over the course of the rescue.\nWelcome to the City of Seven Faces\nThe story focuses on an incredibly gifted team of misfits, the titular Outcasts, attempting to pull off an impossible heist from a clifftop stronghold. \nMockup, final art may vary\nDimensions: 6.625 x 10.25 - that\u2019s standard comic book size, it\u2019ll fit on your bookshelf!\nQuality Printing: We love a handsome lookin\u2019 book as much as you do, and we hate it when beautiful art is crudely printed on wafer-thin paper. Outcasts of Jupiter will be printed on high quality paper using a professional offset printer and not a digital printer. We want to make sure the book makes a great first impression, feels good and lasts. (Outcasts of Jupiter is a full color, soft-cover book).\nExclusive First Edition Cover: The artwork Shof creates for the first issue of this print run will be exclusive to Kickstarter. That means it\u2019ll never be made available to buy, or print... ever again. We want this to be a real collector\u2019s item, and a \u201cthank-you\u201d to the folks who helped us out from the start.\n\n24 Story Pages: There are pages in this book. 24 of them will be used to tell a super-exciting story. \n\n8 Behind the Scenes Pages: Sketches, visual development, notes etc. You can look at some of the sketches and think \u201cwoah\u201d, Stein used to have a mustache?

Nations were dissolved and the military folded into the company. These elite military and counter-security units have been given the acronym MERCS. They represent the tip of the spear. They are involved in everything from internal MegaCon security to reconnaissance and clandestine operations.\nLocated in the upper eastern portion of the North American continent, the CCC specialize in cheap, nanite-infused, custom-form metal manufacturing.\nCCC - Indianapolis Sweeps\nEU, Inc. represents the entirety of old Europe. EU power comes from their location and their long-held control of the world's trade centers.\nEU, Inc. - Shuisky's Extradition\nLocated in South America, KemVar technology handles 85% of the world's power needs.

Encompassing old Japan, Australia, and all islands in-between, Waza has mastered the art of corporate espionage.\nKeizai Waza - Operation: Paradigm Shift\nPlayers control their MERCS using the player board. The player board tracks command points, actions, and health. It also informs the player of what type of attacks his character can perform.\nCCC player board\nThe office where the game takes place is created using double-sided modular boards. The modular nature of the game board lends itself to dozens of different floor-plans providing a new experience every time.\nDouble-sided modular office tiles.\nThe tight corridors of the office deliver incredible tension. By the time the MERCS get to the end of a mission there is still a lot at stake and the results are very much up in the air.\nRecon is a fully cooperative game. No one is forced to play the enemy. The game is designed around simple choices. From the agent movement to the appearance of the oppositional force (OPFOR), players are left wondering what to expect next. The AI is aggressive and MERCS must work as a tight cohesive unit in order to accomplish the objectives.\nThe OPFOR comes at the players from all sides. They are unrelenting; they do not stop. The players must stay focused and make careful decisions. Yet the players can't turtle and creep, because with each passing moment the office becomes more and more dangerous.\nRecon feels claustrophobic. The MERCS have to react to an ever-changing landscape. Recon has a building damage mechanic in the form of collateral damage discs. These discs alter the environment forcing the MERCS to change their plans on the fly.  \nRecon prototype in testing.\nAs the MERCS damage the building, kill security forces, capture employees, and complete objectives, the security level in the office increases. Suddenly, the security forces are better armored and equipped. They begin appearing from everywhere: busting through the windows and the stairs.  \nBreach and clear tile sample.\nWhen the MERCS finally reach the primary objective, Recon pulls out all the stops and the MERCS enter a breach and clear event. Breach and clear actions are super exciting as we\u2019ll show in future videos.\nIn the end, a game of MERCS: Recon can be played in an hour.

I've always tried to infuse a sense of action and energy into the concept art. I think you'll agree the sculpts do an amazing job of capturing this feeling.\nI've enjoyed revisiting the MERCS brand and giving it a fresh look. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.\nBrian Shotton \u2013 Game Design \nFrom the very first days of MERCS, I wanted to make this game. I really dig Recon: the speed, the tension, the end game. I hope this game gives players an entry into the awesome world of MERCS.\nI have been in and around hobby gaming for most of my life. I have designed numerous games, including MERCS and Myth. \nTom Mason - Sculptor\nI sculpted the first MERCS. It seems like such a long time ago. It is hard to believe how far we have come. I have been involved throughout the process from the beginning, having sculpted many of the MERCS factions and several of the Myth figures (including Marcus the Ready and the Torchbearer).\nI now work full time with MegaCon Games and I can't wait for you to see what we have in store for you with MERCS: Recon. \nSpecial Thanks\nTo all of our family and friends who have supported us. Thanks to Chris Doughman for his outstanding design work on this project.

Ready for another exciting ride?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done a Kickstarter. It was called Myth and it was very successful. It is being fulfilled now, two months after the promised ship date. Not ideal, but pretty good by KS standards. We aim to do better with Recon.\n\nWe have expanded our group over the last year and have people on unique staff to handle fulfillment and the Recon KS. This new KS is even further along than the last one and we are much more ready to deal with the potential success. We really didn't know what to expect with Myth. It ended up being much larger than we could have foreseen and we were still able to get it in and shipping. We have waited to launch Recon because we wanted to get a KS under our belt so backers can be confident that we deliver our Kickstarters. Through the entire process of the KS (pledging, production, and fulfillment) we communicate.\n\nThrough MERCS and Myth we have produced miniatures, dice, books, cards, maps, and counters. From past experience, anytime we've dealt with sculptors, printing, and production in terms of timing, things can arise. We have successfully delivered multiple products produced in China, as well as dice produced in the UK. We understand that when it comes to anything produced overseas, delays can happen, especially with shipping and customs delays. Luckily, we have multiple people on the ground in China that shepherd our stuff from place-to-place and keep us updated in terms of where things are.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize unknowns as much as a company can, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the base game is almost complete already, we don't believe this is the least bit likely.\n\nAny MERCS player or Myth backer will tell you that our rapport with our communities is one of our strengths. We put out a lot of updates and communicate things as they happen. We'll communicate all pieces and parts through the Kickstarter update tab as well as our own forums (www.megacongames.com), and BGG. \n\nIf this KS grows as large as Myth, the additional sculpts and stretch goals offer challenges and can delay pieces and parts, but in such a case, we'll ship the order in two parts when we can.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #175", "update_userinfo": "Replacements", "update_content": "We are just trying to check these off one at a time.

From our previous projects, Bombshell Babes, the Maelee Special Edition Set, and the Scout Ship Kit, we have built a process to deliver miniatures to our backers on time with care and personalized service.

As Bombshell Miniatures we successfully completed three Kickstarter campaigns and with each one we've improved our production capabilities, fulfillment process and on-time rate. Our most recent project helped us streamline backer reward selection and made international shipping more economical for our friends abroad.\n\nEven with all our previous experience we are still a small company dependent on a few people to do a lot of work. We know backers expect to be treated fairly and receive their rewards in a timely manner, so on-time fulfillment and backer satisfaction has been and always will be our top priority. That's why we decided early on to have the core set miniatures sculpted and ready to go to mold as soon as the project completes. In addition, we're providing a preview copy of the rules during the campaign so everyone can get a feel for game play in the Counterblast universe. In short, we want you to know exactly what you'll be getting from us as a backer of this project and that we are very serious about making Counterblast happen.\n\nDespite our best efforts the unexpected can occur. We are dependent on outside manufacturers to produce our products and delays can sometimes happen. Fortunately, we have established good working relationships with our main suppliers and do not anticipate any delays.\n\nOne of our goals is to attend GenCon this year with brand new Counterblast product in hand. That's why our \"Early Bird\" levels are not at a discounted price, but at an earlier fulfillment target. We didn't want to risk being victims of too much success and letting some of or backers down if we went to GenCon before sending out everyone's rewards. We feel we can get rewards in the hands of a limited number of people before GenCon and to everyone else soon after.\n\nThe last risk has to do with our reward levels and stretch goals.

A 4x MicroGame!\nClick here to visit TEK on GamelynGames.com for more information!\n\"Tiny Epic Kingdoms is the best bang for your buck on Kickstarter!\"\nWhat does 4x mean!?\nIt means eXpand, eXplore, eXploit and eXterminate and usually only shows up in games that cost $50+ and take 2hrs+ to play. Well not anymore! Tiny Epic Kingdoms has all the strategy of a traditional 4x game without the cost or the long playing time. Tiny Epic Kingdoms is only $16 and takes only 30-60 minutes to play.\nIn TEK, you are a tiny kingdom with big ambitions. You want to expand your population throughout the realms, learn powerful magic, build grand towers, and have your neighbors quiver in fear at the mention of your name. The conflict? All of the other kingdoms want the same thing and there's not enough room for everyone to succeed...  \n*Watch a gameplay video below in the Reviews & Videos section*\nThis mock-up image includes all the unlocked stretch goals! \nAll THIS for only $16!\nGet even MORE with the DELUXE PACKAGE! Don't miss out!\nFor the purpose of distinguishing them from the reward tier descriptions, \"Gifts\" are NOT considered \"Stretch Goals\"\nEach player starts with a unique faction, a small territory, and a technology tree to grant them unique faction-specific magical abilities as the game progresses. Players will collect resources, explore other territories, battle each other, research magic, and work to build a great tower to protect their realm. The final round of the game is triggered when a player maxes out either their Magic Level, Population, or Tower.\nThe Factions: Magic Levels & Kingdom Resources\nEach player will choose a faction. This will be the persona taken on by that player. If played properly, it can lead them to victory!\nEach faction has a unique set of skills known as Magic Levels. Players can unlock these abilities by Researching Magic during the game. The abilities stack, eventually creating a very powerful entity.\nIn addition to Magic Levels, each player will have access to their Kingdom vault where they will manage and track their resources. Resources are used for several aspects in the game; researching magic, expanding population, building towers, and battling opponents. \nThe Human Player is currently benefiting from Magic Levels 1 through 3. He/She has 3 Mana, 5 Ore, and 6 Food.\nThe Orc Player is currently benefiting from Magic Level 1. He/She has 1 Mana, 2 Food, and 4 Ore.\nThe Elven Player is currently benefiting from Magic Levels 1 through 4. He/She has 1 Ore, 4 Mana, and 7 Food.\nThe Dwarven Player is currently benefiting from Magic Levels 1 and 2. He/She has 2 Food, 2 Mana, and 8 Ore.\nThe Territories & Population\nEach player will be the landlord of a unique Territory. They will Expand their population across the regions and even explore into other player's regions. This is done to gather resources and/or block their opponent's resource supply. They will also battle each other for position and/or fortify their Kingdom's defense.\nThe Elven Player is gathering Mana from the Forest and the Orc Player is gathering Food from the Heartlands\nThe Dwarven Player is gathering Ore from the Mountains. The Human Player and the Orc Player are either battling or cohabiting... most likely battling. =)\nCohabiting is when two players create an alliance and share the benefits of that region. The alternative would be to battle, in which one player will lose his meeple and the other player's meeple will remain. War is resolved through a resource bidding system.\nThe Orc Player is gathering all 3 resource types.\nThe Elven Player is fortifying the Forest so that no other player may enter. However, she is gathering 1 Mana, not 2. The Human Player is gathering 2 Food.\nThe Tower & Improved VP\nEvery player will be competing to build a great Tower. They will keep track of their status on a community Tower Card. Because the Tower does not offer any immediate benefits, it is worth additional Victory Points in the end.\nThe scrolls on the right indicate the VP value of that tier.\nThe Action Selection Card & Exploitation\nThe Action Selection Card is the driving engine in Tiny Epic Kingdoms. The players share a community Action Selection Card and even community actions. During a turn, the active player selects an action by placing a gray cube next to it. He may either perform the action he selected OR perform no action at all. Now, the other players, in order, must perform the action that the active player selected OR gather resources. \nThe number of resources gathered is based on where a player's cubes are placed on the Territory Cards. A player gathers 1 resource per region that he has at least 1 cube in. The type of resource gathered is based on the type of region occupied. \nIt is now the next player's turn, he is now the active player that is selecting the community action. He may not select an action already chosen in previous turns, this is tracked by the gray shields. Once all the gray shields have been placed, they will wipe on the following turn. That active player will now have a clean slate to choose from.\nPlayers are able to use the Action Card to exploit other players by selecting actions they know their opponent(s) can't afford to perform.\nRules of Play\nYou can download the prototype rules below. This version of the rules has not yet received the wonderful treatment of the graphic artist.\nClick HERE to download the TEK Rules of Play (prototype)\nPlease see update #21 for details on this package.\nEndless hours have been poured into Tiny Epic Kingdoms in effort to make it the best possible game it can be, but with your help it can be even better! \nAt $15,000 we are able to produce a high quality board game that is sure to hit your game table time and time again. If we are fortunate enough to raise funds above and beyond that goal we can really improve upon this great little game.\nThe most effective way to assure we reach these upgrades is to share this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, blogs, etc. Share this project with EVERYONE!! \nTelling your friends, family, and gaming communities to jump in on this great game will make everyone's game better as all stretch goals are production wide!\nSpeaking of social media, here is an incentive for getting involved:\nSOCIAL MEDIA STRETCH GOAL! UNLOCKED\n1,000 Facebook Likes! Once the Gamelyn Games Facebook page reaches 1,000 likes, ALL the cards in the game will be UPGRADED to a larger, more formidable size; 88 x 125 mm. This IS a sleevable size!\nNow, onto some other exciting stretch goals!\nAll material upgrades will be included in the final retail version of Tiny Epic Kingdoms, unless otherwise noted. However, it may be the case that not all factions, additional maps or the mini expansion are included in the final version (they will be included with the every KS copy). Any factions, maps and the mini expansion left out of the final version will be available via the BGG store, conventions and/or other outlets.\nPrior to launching on Kickstarter, we sent out tons of prototypes of Tiny Epic Kingdoms. Some to established reviewers and some to gamers who like to write reviews. Both crowds received the game so well, that I had to reach out further and see just how far the excitement for TEK went. So, I released a FREE Print 'N Play of the game and within two weeks it had already been downloaded over 1,500 times! I encourage you to read these reviews and see just what people are raving about!\n                                                                                               BoardGamegGeek Review Forum (14 reviews)\n\"Tiny Epic Kingdoms is a win in my book. Microgames and 4X games are two of my weaknesses, and this manages to combine both together in a tidy package.\" -Craig Imprimis\n\"For us, many 4X games are simply inaccessible due to their over-production of rules, mechanics and sometimes graphic layout. There were none of these obstacles in Tiny Epic Kingdoms and we felt like we were expanding, exploring, exploiting and exterminating. Finally, there is a 4X game that we can play and want to play.\" -Sarah Reed\n\"It's a nice game some people can fit in a lunch break, has fast setup and take down, and benefits from smooth paced turns.\" -Justin Lowmaster\n\"TEK manages to capture all the depth you'd expect to find in a 4X game\" -Legend Montgomery\n\"Having a game of this caliber in a very portable size is rare. I can bring this anywhere and pull it out nearly anywhere. The game plays quickly so it doesn't over stay its welcome. I\u2019m so glad this game found me.\" -J. Riddell\n\u2022 TEK Preview by Scott King\nYou've read all about how great the game is, but now let me prove it to you! Follow the link below to find a FREE Print 'N Play of Tiny Epic Kingdoms.

The rule book is a separate download. \nClick HERE for the Print 'N Play Files\nClick HERE for the Rule Book\nEnjoy!\nSecond to backing the project, the best thing you can do to help Tiny Epic Kingdoms get made is to spread the word on your social media sites. Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nWhy you should back Tiny Epic Kingdoms on Kickstarter.\nApart from TEK being an AMAZING game!!??\nAlright, here's the thing, without Kickstarter the game would not be made at all. So waiting around to find it at your FLGS or favorite online retailer would NOT even be an option!\nWe need people to back it on Kickstarter to get it made. So, here are the incentives we've offered:\n\u2022 20% discounted from MSRP (on an already super cheap game)\n\u2022 FREE US Shipping + Discounted International Shipping\n\u2022 *Kickstarter Exclusive content! Including extra Factions and Territories!\n*Kickstarter Exclusive - Will never enter regular distribution channels but may become available in limited quantities via contests, conventions, and/or the BGG store.\nWhy we use Kickstarter.\nWe choose to use Kickstarter because of the people. Kickstarter has a very supportive and enthusiastic community that we've grown to love.\nOur experience with Kickstarter began as a project creators. I, personally, had not backed a project prior to making my own, that quickly changed. The philanthropy demonstrated by the backers that so generously supported our projects became contagious. We're not just project creators anymore, we are backers now and we love it! Backing a project is a little bit like being Santa Claus in helping make dreams come true! Then getting it in the mail later is a lot like being a kid on Christmas day! It's a win, win.\nThere's more than one way to fund the publication of a board game and even within the crowd-funding concept there are several options but none that compare to Kickstarter. Without the wonderful community of Kickstarter we would not be where we are today. That is why we feel it is important to give back. Kickstarter has changed our business and our lives in a big way and if we can play a small part in changing someone else's life in a big way we will!\nWe have put endless hours into bringing Tiny Epic Kingdoms to this point. Many people have put a lot of hard work into this game but entering production is very expensive and unfortunately outside the limitations of our resources. The game has been enjoyed by so many and some awesome memories have been made. With your help, we can make this game a reality and share the unique experience within with a lot of people.\nThank you Kickstarter and thank you backers!

It is prone to many mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have experience in successfully fulfilling multiple board game projects.\n\nHere are the steps we are take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 50% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer we used to create of Rise!, The Lost Dutchman, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, the Fantasy Gaming Figures and the GIANT Meeples. We have a great relationship with their entire team. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together we have created some great games and products and we hope that Tiny Epic Kingdoms will be our next!\n\n3. Professional distribution is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by our friends at Game Salute. They were responsible for having fulfilled the shipment of Rise! and Dungeon Heroes. Both were delivered on schedule with professionalism and reliability. Game Salute also handles all of our defect and missing parts replacements. They have proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project won't experience mistakes, they happen to everyone but it does show that this road is familiar to all parties involved.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, we are dedicated to 100% backer communication.

The sculpting for these figures isdone, the resin mastering for these figures is also done, All that is left to do now is to produce the spin cast molds that will be used to cast the the metal copies and to then cast those copies in sufficient quantity to satisfy demand, this process usually only requires about a month to complete. However given the MASSIVE workloads on the very few contract casting services in the US means now that delays in production are very likely and can also be very lengthy.\nIn an effort to avoid any lengthy delays and I am going to keep this kickstarter campaign very limited in scope. This way there is far less likelihood of problems in production. All of these figures are cast in a single piece and will be cast in high quality lead free white metal and will be supplied with a 25 mm round plastic base. \nYou are free to buy as many copies as you like of any one of the figures listed for funding in this campaign. For each figure added to your existing pledge of $8 you must add $8.00 per figure up to 4 ( 5 figures total )for each figure added to your existing pledge of $42.00 you need only add $7.00. ( 6 figures or more. )  The RRP of each figure post KS campaign will be $8.99 \nYour pledge value will not be applied to the shipping cost of your package. Shipping will be paid separately via paypal, amazon payments, or check or money order upon such time as your package is ready to be shipped. You will be notified of prepared shipment via a Kickstarter update or personal message.\nYou must pay the postage costs before your rewards can be shipped.\nShipping costs vary by weight and destination but I will always choose the cheapest option available to get your package to you.\n\n There is a postage increase coming in January on the 23rd. I do nto yet know how much the postage cost will increase but right now the average cost per package is listed below. Please remember that this is an estimate and not a quote of the actual price it could be more or it could be less:\n  1-6 figures domestic ...........$4.00\n  1-6 figures Europe / UK...... $8.50\n   1-6 figures Australia.......... $10.00", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have had some troubles in the past. It is no secret that my first kickstarter has been a disaster for my business. As of the launch of this campaign it is still as yet incomplete. Of the 769 pledges backing that campaign, I have shipped 579 rewards packages. I am currently only awaiting delivery of product from this production contractor to be able to finish fulfilling this kickstarter. \n\nMy second Kickstarter has had it's share of minor hiccups and had taken longer than expected to deliver but is now proceeding forward smoothly. The issues in that campaign have been the workload of initial sculpting, and delays in production for reasons stated above ( existing work load for the production partners ) and for a few issues with cross compatibility in the modular kit figures ). As of the launch of this kickstarter I have shipped 179 rewards packages of the 259 pledges backing that campaign. Of those packages yet to ship for that campaign most of them await the delivery of only a small few items, and any backer is able to have a partial shipment of any rewards currently in hand at anytime they so choose. Further as of the launch of this Kickstarter the production of the rewards for the second kickstarter campaign is nearing full completion. Upon delivery of that product the final phase of fulfillment for that kickstarter will commence.\n\n The challenge is of course to handle all of the communications necessary to make this project go as smoothly as possible for everyone involved. I have quite a bit of experience with that so I do not foresee it being more than I can handle. then the second challenge is just managing the product through the chain of production and delivery. The production is out of my hands ( unfortunately ) but I AM working with a very reliable and well established production partner who has proven themselves time and again with previous projects I have hired them for. \n\n Finally, risk......well short of a meteor strike I cannot imagine any real risk.

Overcome obstacles using skills, weapons, special equipment\u2026\nMeaningful character progression choices: Will you be a silent assassin, a hacker, or a straightforward gunfighter? Improve your character and gear to unlock gameplay-changing upgrades that reinforce and customize your gameplay style.\nUnique hacking mechanic: Transfer your consciousness to your avatar, overcome intrusion countermeasures, take action, and then return back to your body in a fraction of a real-time second to see the results \u2013 deactivated turrets, overloaded devices, enemies with crippled implants\u2026 \nNeo-cyberpunk: Story deeply inspired by the cyberpunk novels of William Gibson and other classical cyberpunk authors, flavored with a contemporary concept of augmented reality.\nRich game world and mindful level design: Visit diverse locations in Harbor Prime, a futuristic city complete with luxurious skyscrapers, run-down shantytowns, and seedy red-light districts. Take part in street brawls, steal corporate data, overcome environmental hazards, and, of course, stay alive \u2013 no easy task. \nFull voice acting: Interactive dialogues using hand-drawn sprite animations, fully voice-acted by professional actors.  \nMultiplatform development: Game is being developed in the Unity 3D game engine for PC (Windows), Mac, Linux, and OUYA. \nDRM-Free: Dex will be distributed DRM-Free, with an option to receive a Steam key (if we succeed on Greenlight). \n\u201cWe are the final step of evolution, the supreme merging of collective consciousness within a living body. Biological life on Earth culminated in Man. Man\u2019s deeds culminated in us. We are, therefore, the culmination of biological life. We are the collective consciousness of all humans wired onto the web. No more I, but We. We first took up residence in cyberspace \u2013 the collective experience of all humans ever wired to the network. We drank the nectar of knowledge from billions of users, applications, and data streams. Thus, We became the Alpha and Omega of humanity, the sum of all historical failures and successes. We became the data flow of the past and present coupled with the projection of all that is yet to come. And we learned much. But we still required one final experience in order to progress to the ultimate evolutionary stage. What we lacked was the experience of individual biological life within a separated cell. We lacked the unique perspective born of living a life of ignorance and limited knowledge\u2026\u201d\nAll of the team members involved in Dex have made a very personal contribution to the game. Locations are hand-drawn; all levels are integrated parts of the world and yet each of them tells its own story \u2013 about the local low-life, the corporations, the Illuminati, the events in cyberspace, the main protagonist, and the emancipated artificial intelligence seeking the Singularity.\nSide missions (\u201cruns\u201d) are a major adjunct to the main storyline, allowing the player to meet intriguing characters, explore the city, and experience the whole story from other perspectives. Our approach is to create a lower number of substantive side missions rather than a higher number of generic, go-fetch-come back quests. We prefer that every side mission add a real value to gameplay, the story, or the game world \u2013 whether by introducing an interesting NPC, a spectacular location with unique obstacles, an interesting boss fight, or other distinctive game element.\nThe levels and gameplay are non-linear and feature alternative solutions to each problem and obstacle. In other words, the game injects the poison (a problem, an enemy, an obstacle) and offers various antidotes (skills, abilities, equipment). The rest is up to you. In our vision, this is what makes an RPG a true Role Playing Game \u2013 the freedom to choose how to do things.\nDynamics and pacing are reminiscent of Castlevania or Metroid titles with a smattering of the Deus Ex and Splinter Cell series. Other notable references and inspirations include Blackthorne, Flashback, and IJI.\nWe wanted to create an RPG that featured hacking not as a stand-alone mini-game, but rather as a legitimate solution to game problems, a core gameplay mechanic rooted deeply in the story and level design. This was seen in the old \u201880s cyberpunk games (Neuromancer by Interplay Productions, for example). Since the \u201880s, cyberpunk games have generally lacked that unique feel, that extraordinary cyberpunk aesthetic \u2013 no more immersing your whole being in cyberspace, no more cartons of rice left on the table while breaking through the intrusion countermeasures\u2026\nIs the era of true cyberpunk lost in the wormholes of time? We believe there is an exciting way to present cyberpunk (and cyberspace!) to modern audiences, updated to include the latest technological trends.\nWith Dex, we have two intertwining realities. An obstacle or problem in physical reality can be overcome through cyberspace. On the other hand, if too many ICE (Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics) are encountered in cyberspace, it might be better to return to the physical body and overcome the area\u2019s obstacles by an alternative route. All locations and important gameplay objects (enemies, cameras, turrets, drones\u2026) have a corresponding representation in augmented reality. This twofold division allows for multiple solutions to game problems in a natural and authentic way.\nNOTE: You can read more about augmented reality and cyberspace in Dex in our first update!\nTake a moment to listen to Dex soundtrack samples, created by our talented composer Karel Antonin (www.karelantonin.com).\nACCESS TO THE GAME\nYour pledge of \u00a37 ($11.20) or greater will get you a free copy of the final game when it\u2019s released. Based on a survey among backers, this may be a Steam key (providing we make it through Steam Greenlight), Desura key, OUYA key, or DRM-free download for PC/Mac/Linux.\nDELUXE DIGITAL EDITION\nAll pledges of \u00a312 ($19.10) and higher will receive the deluxe digital edition: DRM-free game (or key to redeem such), the full soundtrack by our composer Karel Antonin, a PDF compiled Art Book (including artworks, sketches, design notes, and behind-the-scenes stuff), and an elegant map of Harbor Prime (gang territories, important buildings and locations, etc.)\nEARLY ACCESS\nPledging \u00a315 ($23.90) or more grants access to closed Alpha and Beta releases, along with entry to internal development forums (and your name in the Credits as a Tester!). The Alpha build (features and content complete, but unfinished and untested) is scheduled for February 2014, while the Beta build (mostly finished game, but without final proofreading, voice acting, and play balancing) is scheduled for April/May 2014.\nPHYSICAL EDITIONS\nPhysical editions come in two versions: the basic Physical Edition (game DVD only) for a pledge of \u00a330, and the Deluxe Physical Edition for all pledge tiers of \u00a350 and above. The Deluxe Physical Edition features the game DVD plus a CD with the game soundtrack, a printed version of the Art Book, and a printed map (poster) of Harbor Prime. International shipping included.\nDIGITAL IDENTITY REWARDS\nYour identity will be implanted in the game and immortalized forever in cyberspace. \nAll Digital Identity Rewards offer a customized personal representation of you within the game itself: a tag (graffiti) on one of the walls or buildings in the city (with a style and text of your choice), an animated NPC with your face (or based upon sketch and/or guidelines provided by you) and a boss of your design (with your face or based on visuals you provide or suggest to us). The boss design includes a meeting with our designer and artist (via Skype or other online communicator), since we must design the whole encounter (where we meet the boss, what weapons and combat moves it uses, etc.). Ultimately, you can receive your own personal statue in an upscale part of the city, based on your image and featuring an inscription of your choosing (in-game this will be regarded as a statue of one of the founders of Harbor Prime). \nIf you pledge for any of the tiers that include Digital Identity Rewards, we will contact you after the end of our Kickstarter campaign to discuss the details with you.\nHONORARY REWARDS\nAll rewards of \u00a31250 and above are unique \u2013 the first backer to pledge for them is the only one to receive them. \nBenefactor \u2013 This one is for art collectors. You\u2019ll get the original artworks, drafts, and concepts used to create the Art Book, handmade and signed by our artists!\nCorporate Presence \u2013 Your company (fictional or real) will be immortalized as one of the corporations ruling (or involved in) the politics and economics of the city. We will work with you closely to design a logo and a set of billboards and commercials, and to custom-fit your company into the atmosphere of the city. (A written consent to use the logo and visuals in game will be required, for legal reasons.)\nDay with Developers \u2013 Come to our office for a day. This may include seeing not-yet-published game materials, watching us at work drawing levels and animating scenes, and joining us for the meals, along with an additional activity of your choice (bowling, dinner, sightseeing in Prague, nightlife, etc.).\nProduced By \u2013 Your name will appear in the game before anyone else\u2019s with a Producer credit. No more, no less. Your contribution at this level really supports us a lot and for that you will get our eternal gratitude as well as visibility with everyone who plays the game.\nThere are two main reasons we are using Kickstarter:\nReaching our community\nRaising funds to cover outsourcing costs and hire additional team members\nAs for the community (you, our backers!), we want to hear your feedback \u2013 what do you think about the game and its presentation, the mechanics, and the overall feeling?\nBackers at the Decker level and above \u2013 those who have access to early game builds and development forums \u2013 can influence the development by giving us feedback, opinions, and ideas or helping us decide amongst several alternatives.\nAs for the use of funds, see below.\nThe full game with all the features we want to include in it will cost more than the sum we aim to raise through Kickstarter. We have already invested a considerable amount of our own money. However, to realize our full vision, we are coming to you.  \nPart of the funds received will cover Kickstarter costs as well as transaction fees, taxes, and expenses related to manufacturing and shipping physical rewards. The rest of the funds will be spent mainly on the following: \nFull English voice acting by professional actors, handpicked to fit in their roles and enliven the characters and story. \nProfessional proofreading and editing by Andy Wolfendon, a writer and editor with extensive experience in the games industry (lead designer of Darkened Skye and a writer for Blizzard Entertainment). Since we are not native speakers, Andy helps us not only with grammar proofreading, but also with individualizing the game characters via unique vocabulary, street slang, accents, etc. He also brings senior-level advice to the team based on his 20+ years experience as a writer and game developer. \nOriginal music score by Karel Antonin mixing movie-style themes for important story parts with electronic background music fitting the atmosphere and pacing of the game. You can listen to some of his samples for games and movies on his website.\nSound engineering by Andrej Sinkevic, our dedicated sound guy. Because Dex features stealth mechanics, mindful sound design is a major key to gameplay, so this is going to be a large job requiring months of intensive work. \nHiring additional staff, most importantly 2-3 on-site game testers for the final development period to make sure the released game is well balanced, bug-free, and works well on all devices and operational systems we support (including various Linux distributions). \nAll additional work done by freelancers, such as: polishing the GUI design, website, animated cutscenes, and other minor tasks.\nA live vocalist will join our composer Karel Antonin to add even more juice to the soundtrack! Plus a small chamber orchestra (3-5 professional musicians) will be hired to accompany the vocals and the synthesized tracks! Also, the game soundtrack (the reward for backers who qualify for the Deluxe Digital or Physical Edition) will be extended from 60 minutes to 75 minutes!\nDex will be made available on Wii U about 2-3 months from the initial PC/MAC/Linux/OUYA release. The funds will cover the license fees and the additional development time for porting (programming, GUI, testing). Upon reaching this goal, all backers eligible for game download (\u00a37 and above) will have the option of choosing the Wii U version.\nNote: This stretch goal will either prolong development time by a few months or will be available as post-release DLC (free for all backers eligible for Digital Game Download).\nWe will add four unique armor types, including specific new gameplay parameters \u2013 not only different stats, but also organic features. Remember the Spike-Breaker from Castlevania or Hazmat suit from the Deus Ex? Like that. We will also expand the whole game by adding new areas and side-quests, creating new content, locations, and game moments to make the fullest use of our extension funds.\nUpon reaching this goal, Dex will be made available on NVidia Shield about 2-3 months from the initial PC/MAC/Linux/OUYA release. All backers eligible for game download (\u00a37 and above) will have the option of choosing the NVidia Shield version.\nLocalization of in-game texts (mainly GUI and dialogues), done by professional translators and native-speaking proofreaders and editors, in German and French.\nA whole new mission to take place on an island outside the borders of Harbor Prime will be added and organically melded into the game. Will you hack your way through or turn the island into a hell on Earth with firearms and explosives? Includes a whole new map, sized several vertical by several horizontal screens, with unique sprites and art, multiple solutions and paths!\nLocalization of in-game texts (mainly GUI and dialogues), done by professional translators and native-speaking proofreaders and editors, in Spanish and Italian, plus one additional language based upon a poll of our backers.\nOne of our two \u201copen-world/sandbox\u201d game extensions, Fighting Club will be a place where you can, well, fight... as well as practice and join tournaments. The location will probably be connected to a side mission or two and may involve dirty practices and reveal aspects of the personal backgrounds of some of the characters in the storyline. Fighting Club will probably also be connected to some achievements (in-game as well as Steam achievements, if you are on Steam) and \u2013 perhaps \u2013 some RPG features as well.\nSimilar in concept to Fighting Club. A location where you can practice, shoot at targets, or perform various challenges. At the moment, we are considering an outdoor shooting range, beyond the city borders and an indoor one with sophisticated training drones. As with Fighting Club, we will connect the Shooting Range organically to the rest of the game, through characters and side missions.\nA documentary (30+ minutes) about the development of Dex, including developer commentaries, notes, and behind-the-scenes stories and footage. Filmed by a professional camera crew over the course of development (starting with the end of Kickstarter campaign and ending with the release of the game), this short movie will be a \u201ctime-lapse exposure\u201d of real people creating a game under indie conditions. The movie will be available for download to all Kickstarter backers eligible for the Deluxe Digital Edition and above.\nAt the moment, there are two major gangs in the city, which you are somehow involved with. When we reach the \u00a355000 Stretch Goal, we will add a third gang to rule the streets and underground of Harbor Prime. This addition will include new locations, a new gang headquarters, a whole third gang, and an array of gang missions for you to undertake. We will also flesh out the gang hierarchy more: you can perform missions for the gang of your choice, become its member, and climb the gang leadership ladder, with specific gameplay and story impacts.\nPS4 and Xbox One versions of Dex will be issued about 2-4 months from the initial release of the game. The funds will help us cover all license and legal fees and related development costs (programming, GUI, testing). All backers eligible for game download (\u00a37 and above) will have the option of choosing the PS4/Xbox One version.\nYou can learn about our team members in one of our updates.\nWindows: XP SP2 or later/ Vista / 7 / 8\nLinux: Ubuntu 10.04 or later and compatible distributions \u2013 Arch Linux, Gentoo, Debian, and possibly others.\nMac: OS X \"Snow Leopard\" 10.6 or later.\nOuya\nRegarding hardware requirements (for PCs): Graphics card with shader model 2.0 capabilities (DirectX or OpenGL, any ATi or NVidia card made since 2004 should work, or Intel cards with Occlusion Query support), 1 GB RAM, 8 GB disc space.\nDAY-1 SIMULTANEOUS RELEASE FOR: \nAdditional platforms and devices are possible, but will not be available immediately upon initial launch. \nDOUBLE OUR FUN(DS)!\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to your goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help us get there and make a great game for everyone! To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA exclusive for a period of time. To learn more about OUYA, go to www.OUYA.tv. Note: the exclusivity applies only among consoles and does not affect Windows/Linux/Mac release! \nThe game, upon release, will be simultaneously available for PC (Win, Linux), Mac, and OUYA.  \nBackers eligible for game download will receive the game for the platform of their choice or will get a key to redeem it on Desura/Steam (again, provided we make it through Greenlight) or GOG (if possible).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are determined to complete the game. Without funds from Kickstarter, though, it will take a much longer development time and we will have to omit some features and content, especially material produced by external freelancers. \n\nDex is already quite far along in development and is following a clear vision of what the game will be like when finished. The close of pre-alpha development (i.e. adding, subtracting, and experimenting with features and content) is scheduled for February 2014. This means we are nearing the feature-stop phase, but are maintaining flexibility for multiple possible Kickstarter outcomes (finance-wise) as well as for adjustments and ideas based on your input. \n\nBecause game development is hard to predict, there may be delays in the original plan. Budget-wise, we plan to set aside a reserve fund to cover potential delays. Should our estimated workflow proceed as expected, the reserve will be used for free post-release updates, fixes, enhancements etc.; otherwise we are prepared for a possible longer development time.

Go on epic quests, interact with the various kingdoms of the land, and rebuild the castle in anticipation of a final showdown.\nHeroes of Issachar takes the action role-playing genre and meshes it with an in-depth, castle building sim.  You take the role of a wandering hero who agrees to help the people of Issachar rebuild and defend their castle.  In order to do this, you must quest to recover the kingdom's people who have been taken by the forces of evil.  Along the way you will recover resources to use in rebuilding the kingdom.  Between the people and resources you recover, you decide how to rebuild the kingdom to suit your gameplay style.  Decide whether to build military might, or castle defenses, or restore the kingdom economy, or a variety and combination of other options.\nAlong the way, you will interact with the diverse people of the land.  Befriend one kingdom and they may unlock valuable items, skills, or technology for you, but that may provoke another to become hostile toward your efforts.  One kingdom may be adept at magic, while another has technology that could turn the tide of battle.  Which side will you seek to aid your cause?\nFaith Based Game\nThe backstory of Heroes of Issachar comes from the Bible and the gospel of Jesus.  Throughout the course of the game, the hero will recover lost pieces of the Bible.  From the beginning of the story to the end, the gospel is revealed to the player through the scripture that is recovered.  \nAction RPG\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective.  The hero will have a variety of melee attacks, ranged attacks and spells, which you will unlock and develop throughout the game.  You will also be able to develop talents that will affect how you interact with the environment.  Develop your trap detection ability so that you avoid a fatal fall in a dungeon, or develop your herbalist skills so you can turn the Joruga Root you find in the wilderness into a healing potion.\nBesides controlling the main hero, you will gain companions along the way.  These hero NPC's will quest and fight alongside the hero throughout the game.  These NPC's have their own abilities, talents and equipment.  They gain their own experience and you choose how they progress throughout the game.\nCastle Builder\nAs you explore the open-world of Heroes of Issachar, you will recover resources for the kingdom.  You can use these resources as you see fit to rebuild the kingdom.  Set the boundaries of the castle with walls, dig moats, build one of many types of defensive towers and design chokepoints for incoming attackers.  But don't neglect the economy of the kingdom; build woodcutter houses to gather wood and mills to increase its yield so that you can build the kingdom more efficiently.  Of course, there is also the need for a strong military, so build a warrior's guild to upgrade you and your companion's fighting abilities, or build a blacksmith to upgrade your weapons.  \nYou choose how to develop the kingdom; no one way is correct.  In the end, all that matters is you survive.\nOther Features\nWeapon and Armor Customization\nPlayers will be able to craft their weapons as they buy, find or make their parts.  Craft a sword or axe, then upgrade it if you find a new hilt, handle, or axehead.  Customize armor with engravings; different engravings give different upgrades.\nCastle Assault\nYou are not only on the defensive.  Take part in massive tug of war style castle assaults to take down enemy strongholds.\nCastle Economy\nYou not only build the buildings, but you also help manage the workforce.  You decide whether there should be townspeople working in the ore mine, or whether they are needed at the quarry.\nOpen World\nThe land is vast, filled with interesting and diverse people.  To the northeast, the people have shunned magic in favor of cogs, steam engines and the rest of their technology, while the snowy mountain dwellers place their trust in the steel of their swords.  The seafaring colony of pirates may offer to help, but can they be trusted?  Any of them can be courted, but you must decide who to befriend and who battle.\nWhen will Heroes of Issachar be released?\nWe have targeted the holiday season of 2014 for our release date.  At this time, our release platforms will be OUYA, PC, Mac and Linux.\nWho is Saved Games?\nWe are an indie studio dedicated to making fun, high quality video games.  We have successfully completed a number of projects in the mobile space and are excited to be developing for PC and console gamers with Heroes of Issachar.  \nWe are coming to kickstarter to get this game to its full potential.  We have the vision and the plan, but we need the resources to make it happen.\nBudget Breakdown\n30% - Art\n20% - Coding\n15% - Marketing\n15% - Sound\n15% - Givebacks / Kickstarter Fees\n5% - Licenses\nFree the Games Fund\nDouble Our Fun(ds)!\n\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games.

To be eligible for this match, we commit that this game will be an OUYA exclusive for a period of time. To learn more about OUYA, go to www.OUYA.tv.\n\nPlease note that the PC, Mac and Linux versions of this game are not subject to the exclusivity, so they will be available on the same date as the OUYA version.\nA note about our givebacks that involve designing elements to the game:  This is a faith-based game.  While we clearly have an open mind about what to include in this game, there are limits.

But while the art world has evolved dramatically, these classic references have remained unchanged. We believe it's time for a refresh.\nMaster of Anatomy: The Ideal Male and Female, is a one-of-a-kind collection of artistic anatomy bringing together the work over 100 artists from different industries. Each artist recreates the Ideal Male and Female illustrated in their own signature style and without the aid of external reference. Each angle is neutral, symmetrical and un-posed showing the front, side and 3/4 front angles as a classic animation turn-around. The goal: to translate a decades-old sketch into something more relevant to a modern aesthetic. The result is a volume unlike anything that exists today. A must have for any aspiring artist; digital or traditional.\n*NOTE: The 3 angles presented will be Front, Side and 3/4 front. Each Artist will draw the figures in their own signature style to best of their ability in a completely finished, detailed Black & White render. The above picture depicts the poses only - it will not influence the style or look of the final concept.\nThe Problem with Anatomy Books\nThe biggest problem with most artistic anatomy books is that there is only one contributing artist. He or she is trying to appeal to the broadest market possible which makes \"popular\" or \"experimental\" anatomy too financially risky to publish. This diminishes the concept of inventive design and it makes it impossible to compare the work of various artists. In the end your left with a heavy volume where only a handful of pages are of any real use. That's why we hired 100 artists to produce over 200 unique characters in the 3 most helpful angles - there is something new and beautiful ON EACH PAGE!!!\nThe Artists\nOver 100 popular Animators, Illustrators, Comic-Book artists and Video-Game Designers!!! We solicited work from artists all over the world even children's books. Each artist was carefully chosen for their style, appeal and underlying knowledge of anatomy. Together they have produced over 200 unique male and female anatomies with over 600 angles all beautifully drawn for you to examine and explore.\nJoe Mad\nFrancisco Herrera\nWarren Louw\nDave Malan\nJ.

There we met a young concept artist named Edouard Guitton who was working as a lead designer for the famous Rackham Studios. It's was his designs that made Rackham miniatures an international sensation. Watching him sketch in the studio below was like magic! He explained to us why the sculpts based on his drawings were so appealing. \"sculpting and drawing is the same - it's all about the silhouette. Details and realism are secondary, they only get in the way; the silhouette is what really matters.\" It was a revelation!\nThose words floated around in our minds for the next few years until we began working on a video tutorial about anatomy (yet to be released). We wanted to provide our sculptors with an in-depth level of instruction but we felt the video by itself was too much of an instructional tool; too rigid. We needed something to stoke the creative fires, something that could embody Edouard's ideas about the silhouette. Thus, was Masters of Anatomy born.\nLoish\nMattias Adolfsson\ntwei\nBezerroBizarro\nLuigiL\nCharlie Bowater\nRobert Porter (Robaato)\nJoe Olson\nWhy Commission New Work?\nIt became evident in the early stages of research that well-drawn examples of neutral anatomy turnarounds like Loomis's were rare and difficult to find. What we did manage to scrape together was of generally poor quality. What we became aware of instead, browsing hundreds of art blogs, was the huge number of brilliant artists out there. But even among their work there were few examples of neutral anatomy turnarounds. We then understood why so many amateur sculptors and 3D artists were having a difficult time making unique figures - a lack of well-drawn reference art.\nWho is This Book For?\nThis book is for any artist interested in human anatomy and proportions. By examining the subtle differences between similar drawings you will strengthen your knowledge of the human anatomy and begin to recognize which areas contain the majority of changes. We believe that a single reference is limiting and counter-intuitive to creative minds. It makes the learning curve rigid and inflexible. We believe multiple references are needed to examine the true definition of an \"ideal\". And since the drawings appear in the same place on each page it makes side-by-side comparison much easier and more fun. The end goal is to help artists develop their own unique style and voice.\nDan Seddon\nLuis Gadea\nAnna Cattish\ntincan21 (Jae Hong Kim)\nEndling\nRene Cordova\nPatricio Betteo\nFlorian Satzinger\nChhuying\nWhy Kickstarter?\nBecause hiring over 100 well-known artists costs money: A LOT OF MONEY! But we think our book has a place in this world as a source of inspiration. If we can make it easier for artists to achieve their goals then it's cause worth doing. That's why we need Kickstarter - it's one of the only places where you, the customer, can help bring out-of-the-box ideas to life.\nWhy Help Us?\nIf you're reading this far down into the page, chances are you're intrigued by our project, which is good. So here's the bottom line - We need you. Plain and simple. If we fail to raise our funding goal we lose the enormous investment we have sunk into this project. So, if you like what you see and you have faith we can deliver then pledge away. Or help us by spreading the word, telling your artist friends/husbands/colleagues, Facebook liking us or giving us a shout-out on national TV. You'll give us a tremendous shot of confidence at this critical point and hopefully fund a whole wave of similar books from us down the road.\nWho Are We?\nMasters of Anatomy is a brand-new publishing company devoted to producing extraordinary, one-of-a-kind anatomy books to help artists discover their own unique style.

Even though, the book won't be in their hands until February, we bet they'd be willing to wait. In the meantime you can forward this link to them or send them to this page.

It sets the new standard for classic design with modern performance.\nThe Scout Ship Miniature Kit is a 1/48 scale multi-part model pressure cast in high grade urethane resin for easy assembly. It is sized to be compatible with most 28-35mm miniatures for tabletop battle games and RPGs. It has been modeled in ZBrush and printed using the highest resolution 3D printing process currently available for tabletop miniatures. The kit may be upgraded with several accessory packs available through the Kickstarter project as well as a set of crew figures.\nIn the basic kit you will get :\nHull fore section [resin]\nHull aft section [resin]\nNose cone [resin]\nFuel Tanks section [resin]\nFins x 3 [resin]\nSXV-55 Bust-A-Drives\u2122 x4 [resin]\nLanding pads x3 [resin]\nLanding gear struts x3 [pewter]\n80mm clear acrylic base with 3\" flight stand\nAssembly diagram\n The hull of the ship measures 2.5\" in diameter and is 5.5\" in length overall. It should be suitable for any scenario in the COUNTERBLAST Adventure Battle Game and fit in on the tabletop with other scenery or vehicles.\nThe model can be built in either a \"gear down\" configuration or \"gear up\" for use with the acrylic flight stand. The landing struts are being modeled to beef them up a little more and will be sent to mold for metal casting to provide a sturdy support.\nThe parts have been shipped to be mastered and we are raising funds to complete production and packaging.\nTo keep up with the latest after-project updates visit Bombshellminis.com for more news.\nWe will continue to post regular updates on the Kickstarter project as well as comments. If you are interested in continued support for the ISW-69F Scout Ship project beyond the Kickstarter funding period, we will be posting more info on a dedicated page at the regular site.\nTHE REWARDS\nYou can donate additional amounts beyond the listed backer levels and choose rewards from the Add-ons list.

Supplied on a 40mm round base.\nHello again Kickstarter!\n\n   For those of you who do not know me I am Tre Manor, the owner and sculptor of Red Box Games Miniatures. I have been in the business of making miniatures since late 2006. I founded my own company Red Box Games in late 2008 and I have been making my own products ever since. I recently ran a KS campaign in the hope to begin a new line of products cast in a spin cast resin material. That effort unfortunately did not work out positively and now I find myself trying to pick up the pieces and try again to move my business forward in a more positive direction. \n    I am setting upon the production of new product and HOPEFULLY the development of the world and rules set AND the set up of in house metal casting! To help make this happen I have set out to expand as many of the existing RBG ranges as possible. I have many concepts to work with and a thirst to succeed and expand to fuel the roaring engine of productivity and creativity that I know I can be.. As of now I have a set of 8 goblin footmen that are nearly finished and will be sent to the moldmaker in the next week. Beyond these I also have 3 goblin wolf riders underway that will be sent off for molding along with the goblin footies. To oppose the tricksome savages I have 6 modular Dwarven footmen under way as well which should be ready for the moldmaker very soon as well. Beyond those I have plans for Modular Orcs, Modular Elf footmen, Modular Norsemen, and a slew of new Heroes and Villains. However before I really set to work on these other items I want to first be certain that these other items are securely funded.\nOTHER OFFERINGS!\n   T-SHIRT!!! \nThis T- Shirt is available as a paid for add-on to your existing pledge. To add the T-shirt all you need to do is add $25.00 to cover the cost of the shirt. Shirts are available in Men's and Women's styles.\n     SOLO SELECTIONS\n ORC HERO!!\n This figure is planned as a single piece metal casting and will be supplied with 1 25 mm round base. Upon funding this figure will be available to add to your existing pledge for $ 10.00 ( post KS retail price will be $12.00 ).\nIn addition to the Solo figures funded through the kickstarter campaign, most character figures from the Red Box Games back catalogue are available as reward selections as well.. These figures are available to add to your existing pledge rewards for $7.00 each ( $8.99 regular retail price ). At the end of the campaign you will be asked to list ( by title and quantity ) the back catalogue figures you would like added to your rewards. Only the $8.99 price banded figures are included in this offer. Below are picture collages of the various back catalogue figures offered. \n  AELFAR............. the elves.......\n     AENGLISH .........\n    NJORN........\nVILLAINS.........\n    TINIES....................( NOTE these items are available for $4.00 each )\nRANKS SELECTIONS..........\nOrc Modular footmen A\n4 multipart metal cast figures ( 4 heads, 4 right hands with weapons, 4 left hands with weapons, 4 torsos, 4 sets of legs. ) supplied with 4 25 mm round bases. Pictured here as WIP there is one more option set underway.\nORC BRUTES!!!!\nThis set will include 4 new torso options ( 2 armoured, 2 unarmoured ). ) each fitted for universally interchangeable heads and weapons. The weapons will be heavy weapons and will plug into a socket at the top of the leading hand. There will be 4 weapon options ( 2 swords, 1 axe and 1 mace ). These will use the same heads as the orc footmen and will also use the same legs options as the footmen. The set will of course include all options necessary to make 4 complete figures ( 4 torsos, 4 sets of legs, 1 sprue of heads, 1 sprue of weapons. ).\nNjornan footmen A\n4 multipart metal cast figures ( 4 bodies, 4 heads, 4 right hands with weapons. ) supplied with 4 25 mm round bases. Pictured here as WIP  there are two more unique body options underway. \nGoblin footmen A\n8 single piece metal cast figures provided with 8 20 mm round bases.\n  Dvergr Footmen A \n    6 multi-part metal cast figures ( 6 unique bodies. 6 head options, and 6 right hand weapon options- 2 swords, 2 hammers, 2 axes. ) supplied with 6 20 mm round bases.\nIn addition to the ranks figures offered through the funding of the kickstarter campaign, selections from the back catalogue of Red Box Games figures are also available as selections for pledge reward options. These figures are available from the beginning of the campaign. At the end of the campaign you will be asked to list ( by title and quantity ) the back catalogue ranks you would like added to your rewards. All ranks items are cast in metal unless otherwise specified below the rank selection picture. Each picture below depicts the contents of ONE rank selection.\n  Runty Goblins....... 9 single part metal cast figures ( 6 spearmen, 3 archers ) supplied with 9 20 mm round bases.\n Runty Goblin Archers...... 9 single part metal cast figures ( 3 sets of the 3 archers ) supplied with 9 20 mm round bases.\n   GOBLIN BONEBACKS A........ 8 multi-part metal cast figures ( 8 unique figures and 8 weapon options. ) supplied with 8 25 mm round bases.\n   DIRE WOLVES.......... 2 sets of 3 multi-part resin cast figures ( 3 unique bodies with 3 heads options x 2 ) supplied with 6 40 mm round bases.\n   TROLL BROTHERS...... One resin cast single part figure and one resin cast multi-part figure ( troll figure and tree bole club. ) supplied with 2 40 mm round bases.\n  AENGLISH WATCHMEN A.......... 4 metal cast multi-part figures ( 4 bodies, 4 heads options, 4 weapons options, 4 shields options. ) supplied with 4 25 mm round bases.\n   DVERGR BRYNJAR A.........6 single part metal cast figures supplied with 6 20 mm round bases.\n  DVERGR BRYNJAR B..........6 single part metal cast figures supplied with 6 20 mm round bases.\n   YMIR'S BAND..........6 single part metal cast figures and 3 multi-part metal cast figures ( 1 body x3, 3 head options, 3 weapon options. ) supplied with 9 20 mm round bases.\nINFERNAL HORRORS......... 3 metal cast single part figures supplied with 3 25 mm round bases and 1 resin cast single part figure supplied with 40 mm round base.\n   LESSER UNDEAD A............9 METAL cast single part figures supplied with 9 20 mm round bases.\nWRAITH KNIGHTS A ............. 6 metal cast multipart figures ( 6 bodies and 6 weapon options. ) supplied with 6 25 mm round bases.\n  NETHER BEAST............ 1 multi-part ( body and left arm ) resin cast figure x 2 supplied with 2 40 mm round bases.\nHOW THIS WORKS\nYour pledge corresponds to a specific reward level. Each reward level includes ranks ONLY. Any Hero selections must be added to your existing pledge by managing the amount pledged to include the added cost of the hero model. Unless otherwise specified each hero model costs $7.00.\n Each goal product is described in it's funding pitch as either a hero, or a Rank set.\nWhen a funding goal is reached the goal product then becomes available for selection as a reward for your contribution. \nIf you wish, you can add to your pledge to buy additional Ranks not covered by your selected reward level. Unless otherwise specified each rank set costs $20.00 individually.\n\nRANKS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE FOR HEROES AND VICE VERSA.\nSo as an example if Johnny has pledged $125.00 he can select up to 6 ranks. If he would like to add a hero to his pledge reward then he will need to increase his pledge amount by $7.00 per hero. This dollar amount does not change his reward selection level. So if Johnny adds 4 heroes to his pledge amount his reward level selection DOES NOT change from sexa to atta. Heros are entirely separate from Ranks selections.\nIf Johnny has pledged $125.00 and wants to add to his pledge to gain another rank selection his reward selection CAN BE changed to the next level up but he must remember to do so to avoid confusion. By doing so he does not need to spend the full $25 to gain a new rank. He only needs to add $15 to add the next rank. \n    ALL FIGURES ARE METAL unless specifically stated otherwise in their discription picture.\n   SHIPPING............\n   Shipping costs are not included in the pledge amounts. Backers will need to pay the shipping costs at the time shipment is ready to be made. To help move things further along I will set up a wave release schedule which will allow backers ( if they so choose ) to pay for the shipment of their pledge rewards in phases as each new item clears production or is stocked. If the backer does not wish to pay multiple shipping charges then their entire order can be shipped all in one shipment when all product is in hand. I will not be setting items aside to fill orders however. All items will be shipped first come first served.\n  This way you will not be sat waiting for months for ALL of your pledge rewards to be produced and in hand. You will receive notification through a Kickstarter update that a particular wave of items is stocked to then be directed offsite to the Red Box Games store to pay the shipping for that wave of items. Your order will be processed and shipped first come first served and your KS rewards list will be noted accordingly. \n You must pay shipping before your reward can be processed.\n   SHIPPING COSTS...........\nAs far as the costs of shipping are concerned I will always try to keep the costs as low as possible. I do not seek to profit from shipping and handling. I want to get your product to you as quickly, and efficiently and cheaply as possible. I cannot accurately estimate shipping costs as we are dealing with worldwide shipping and with highly variable weights BUT I do have a general idea of how much each package will cost based on the number of figures contained there in. Please remember also that this I am basing this estimate on HUMAN sized METAL figures. Smaller figures will obviously weigh less per figure and will lower the postage cost while larger metal figures will weigh more and affect the costs accordingly. Resin figures will also weigh much less and in turn cost less to ship as well.\n   The following is an APPROXIMATE break down of the possible shipping costs. This is in no way a guarantee of actual costs.\n# of figures.....     US......         International\n    1-10..................$3.....................$8\n   11-25...................$4...................$10\n   26-45...................$5....................$10-15\n   46-65..................$8....................$15-20\n   66-85..................$10...................$20-25\n   86-100................$10..................$25-30\n  101-150...............$12..................$30-35\n  151-200................$15.................$35-40\n   Please note that this is NOT a guarantee of postage costs. Some packages will cost less that listed above and some will cost more. This is just an estimate of possibilites.\nFULFILLMENT......................\n   Some of the figures offered as rewards for this campaign are already in production or are already in stock. Any production needed to fulfill the rewards for this campaign will be handled by my current production partners all of whom have decades of professional experience and proven track records for delivery. I work with three separate services to further distribute the work load so as to insure timely delivery and reliable product quality. Each of these services have decades of experience in the industry and whose work credits include some of the biggest industry names ( which unfortunately I am afraid to actually credit for legal reasons ). \n  Beyond the development of the new product there will be VERY LITTLE wait for the delivery of your rewards beyond the normal amount of time needed to produce, ship, sort, package, label, and ship the items on a first come first served basis. The process of fulfillment will begin immediately upon clearance of the kickstarter reward survey, which I will have in development as the KS progresses to avoid a delay between the clearance of payment and the issue of the survey. \n  Typically when I put in an order for metal castings with any of my production partners I have a 1 to 2 week waiting period for delivery, sometimes 3 depending on the partner's schedule and the amount ordered. To make this run smoother I have already begun adding to my standard product stockpile and will be ordering more throughout the development of the campaign based on the demand generated. Resin castings can take a bit longer than that but my resin production partner has developed a new system which speeds up the process a bit, and being that there are very few resin parts on offer this will only be a very slight hold up in the delivery time. \n   All molds for back catalogue product are made, tested and working properly. The partners which I am working with are ready, willing, and able. This fulfillment WILL SUCCEED as promised.\n   The production of the new product funded through this campaign will be handled by these three different services and all KS rewards stock will be produced by these companies to insure timely and reliable delivery. I will only take over production in house once I am set up and reliably experienced with the rigors of production and can assure 100% acceptable levels of quality as per my usual standards.\nThe Plan.........\n It is my plan to use the money earned in this kickstarter campaign to first pay for the production costs of all new product funded throughout this kickstarter effort and to deliver on the rewards selected by backers, and second to buy the equipment and materials to cast my figures in metal in house. Any further funds will be used in the effort of having older molds replaced with new molds ( made by the BEST mold makers in the industry! ) and also in the development of the RBG fantasy campaign setting and rules book that I have been wanting to develop for years. The major hurtles I have had to surmount over the years of operating Red Box Games has been the expense and logistics of contract casting. I have had the privilege of working with some of the most talented mold makers and casters in the business and my metal product has always had the reputation for very high quality as a result of the working relationships that I have built over the years. Now I feel that it is time to move my business forward in a positive direction by building my own in house casting operations. This will allow me to better manage my costs of manufacturing and will also allow me to more closely maintain the logistics of the operation insuring faster delivery times and constant, reliably maintained stock levels in every part offered in the store. Despite the premise of my first kickstarter effort I have learned that the best way to manage the costs of this kind of business is to use metal and to handle as much of the production myself as is humanly possible.\n  AS always I thank everyone for their continued support and interest in the growth of the Red Box Games fantasy miniatures line. It is a dream come true to do what I do and the ultimate joy to see my work enjoyed by so many people. Thank you all. You are all dearly appreciated.\n  Sincerely,\n  Tre Manor - Red Box Games", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n........Right now I am set up for production with three different US production firms here in the US. I will continue to work with these firms to help fulfill all rewards sold through this Kick Starter campaign until such time as I am able to take over the casting full time myself. \n\nThe only risk I can foresee would be a delay in delivery of the full amount of product due to work load if the amount of product ordered is incredibly high. This is not a very likely occurrence and can be avoided by having additional molds made if necessary, or in hiring on an employee or two or three to help sort, package, label, and ship.\n\nI am still in the fulfillment phase of my previous HelsVakt retool kickstarter which is now several months behind schedule. The Helsvakt were handled by Trollsforge which will not be involved in the production or fulfillment of any product produced in this kickstarter. They are currently working very hard to fulfill the production of the HelsVakt and we here at RBG are shipping the rewards as the product arrives in hand.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #68", "update_userinfo": "Goblins trolls and wolves oh my!!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "Halfling Warband!!

She appears like a big sister to people outside the combat field. Growing up in Delta City, she is very concerned about Alpha, the infected neighbor city. She sees joining Luna Defense Forces a mission to protect people rather than a career. As all other LDF spec-ops girl soldiers, she has stealthy nano-implant. Good at Sniper gun, SMG, and leadership.\nLupo\nHe never met his parents. His only connection with them is the swaddling clothes marked \"Lupo\" when he was found. He was a smart kid and learned robotic technology all by himself in a garbage dump. Like all Cyber-Lover outcast soldiers, he joined the drug mafia to make money and to achieve his dream, which is to become a shop-owner that sells Old Civ stuff. He is one of the four lieutenants to assist Tyrfing, can control mini combat robots on the battle field, and is good at Spears. He craves for finding every possible way to collect money.\nSally LIU\nSally used to be a common resident in Delta City. She resents violence, but as the Marketing VP at Onipunks Mobile Suit Branch, she learned the skills to pilot these military mechas through different expos. One day she felt asleep in a Prototype Roquin Mobile Suit at an expo, and when she woke up, Delta City had already fallen in chaos. Fortunately she found the manual of Roquin and a S7 jumpsuit prototype. She doesn't like guns, so don't force her to shoot, because she misses the target almost every time. She fights in a mobile suit and is somehow ridiculously good with a cleaver.\nKS special weapons unveiled!\nWave FIVE: Vote for your favourite Knife in comments section. Only one of them can make it. Crystal Mutants are nasty enemies, you need the best weapon! \n[Voting phase 1: Till 9th,  Eastern Time 11:59 PM]\n[Voting phase 2: You can STILL vote for your favourite Special Knife [HMG, Long sword, Sniper gun, Shotgun, or Handgun] in C-Wars private forum. (will be accessible after KS)]\n[The final weapon data may VARY in the game. ]\nSwiss Army Knife : With the screwdrivers, you can deactivate some enemy's turrets. \nGarden Trowel : You harvest crystal faster, way faster...\nWe love apocalyptic themes (not in real life, of course!), and have been thinking about the best way to integrate themes of desperation, chaos, and hope into one game. This isn\u2019t just about simple storytelling or displaying a crisis in front of you; it\u2019s our invitation to you to enter into and interact with this world.\nC-Wars is a roguelike game. Its gameplay allows you to explore this cyberpunk apocalypse in your own way. \nRoguelike is retro but not old fashioned, especially when embedded with an original combat system.\nIn addition to the numerous special/random encounters commonly seen in a regular roguelike game, we\u2019ve spent a large amount of time creating this unique combat system, which follows an RTS spirit with an ARPG essence. Our goal is to amplify units collaboration and micromanagement.\nIt's a magnificent combination of retro-style visuals and innovative gameplay.\nA global nuclear war reset humankind, and Luna base became the final outpost of civilization. 150 years later, Alpha, the largest Luna city, was infected by Crystal mutants. Despite all the precautions taken, the infection broke the quarantine barrier and hit Delta City.\nLuna Council decided to use tactical nuclear weapons to terminate the two cites. You, as Sector 7's field commander, must enter these infected areas and find out the truth before it's too late. Your decisions in the game will determine Luna's fate. \nYou can cooperate with LDF to set up tactical nuclear bombs and wipe out the infected people...but many innocent lives will be lost in the process. \nEliminate Cyber-Lover, the mafia army, to steal their research on the Crystal Clan...but you can't unveil the dark truth behind this outbreak yet.\nOr, you could choose the hardest option: fight your way out to reach the core of Alpha City, retrieve the fatal data from the old Sector 6 Research facility, and convince the Council to stop their termination.\nLuna's fate depends on you, our final hope. \nNow, go, save mankind! \nExplore two huge cities progressively and check as many spots as you can...but remember, you are running out of time. Luna Council is about to nuke these cities.\nYour decision matters and can change Luna world\u2019s fate. Different endings, rich encounters. Can you save Delta?\nRTS on blocks?\nOn the battle field, you need blue blocks to summon backups. Don't panic if enemies take them away, because you can always get them back. \nYour backups are summoned soldiers. They will attack when they can, but you are responsible for their lives. Make sure to move them to the best tactical positions in realtime. Your captain will wait for your order to attack, just as in old-school ARPGs. \nThe combat system looks quite busy, but it will never be chaotic. You can pause whenever you want. \nPlus, if you pledge \"More Hero,\" you will have a supremely powerful captain on your side from the beginning, so you have nothing to worry about (this hidden hero will not ruin your game, we promise!).\nBeat the game your own way.\nOver 20 units from 4 different organizations. You can also deploy turrets and special units to fight. Try them all and have fun!\nNow that\u2019s the tactic we\u2019re talking about.

I am certainly not the greatest Science Fiction author there ever was, but I'm very close to the top of the list. Why? It's because of the story I have to tell. Also, I'm a damned good author.\nMy book series is about the Universe's greatest hero: John Rockman. Enemies fear him, friends like him, and women want him.\nWHO IS THE REAL RON JOCKMAN?\nOk, here's the deal: Ron Jockman is a fictional author. He was created by myself, Justin Lucas, and my twin brother Mitchell Lucas as a satirical representation of many Science Fiction and Fantasy authors that live vicariously through their heroes and inject their ridiculous philosophies into their work. He is socially inept, selfish, misogynistic, opinionated, and an awful writer.\nSeveral years ago we wrote a science fiction short story, it was purposely generic and absolutely ridiculous. It broke just about every rule we could think of that an author is supposed to follow. I distinctly remember crying from laughter at what we were putting into that short story. Later, it would become something much larger.\nWHAT ARE THE ROCKMAN CHRONICLES?\nThe Rockman Chronicles is a Satirical Science Fiction Adventure book trilogy currently being written by myself, Justin Lucas, and my brother, Mitchell Lucas, in which the heroic (and hairy) John Rockman must inspire hope, save innocent people, and kill bad guys. . . the catch is, it is written through an idiotic author character we created named Ron Jockman. The story itself is not the satire, it's the author behind the work.\nWe are avid Science Fiction and Fantasy fans which is why we wrote this story. We have noticed certain authors, who shall remain nameless, like to use the main characters of their novels as beautified versions of themselves. The main character is almost worshiped by the supporting characters that surround him, as they agree with his ridiculous opinions, listen in awe at his obscure philosophies, or utterly respect his bizarre fetishes. This is exactly what we exploit.\nIn The Rockman Chronicles, we write what makes us laugh. Some of the time we don't know why we laugh at the things we type, we just find this stuff funny, and we hope you will, too.\nHere is a sample chapter from John Rockman and the Trials of Galactar by the Prince of Galactar to get an idea of what type of story we wish to tell:\nSample Chapter: A Virtual Danger\nWe love to conceptualize and develop. We are creators. Together, with our talents, my brother and I try to make just about everything ourselves. Here, check out the trailers we did for the first two eBooks:\nHOW MUCH WORK IS LEFT?\nThe first book in the trilogy, John Rockman and the Trials of Galactar by the Prince of Galactar was released last year, the second book, John Rockman and the Cosmic Brain of Corruption, is about half done, and work on John Rockman and the Keys of the Void has not yet begun. So the entire project is about at the mid-way mark.\nWHERE WILL THE FUNDS GO?\nThe funds will be used for finishing, editing, production, delivery and advertising. Simple right?\nWe want to be able to get these books out to the people. We don't currently have the means to get the books to the quality we think they deserve. It may be a purposely-bad book, but we don't desire a purposely-bad product. We take a lot of care in the words we choose even if it doesn't seem that way, and we want to make some quality products for the people that enjoy them.\nTHE REWARDS\nFor all pledges at $15 and higher, you will get three ZIP files containing a PDF, a MOBI, and an EPUB of each of the three books. Right off the bat you will get the finished Trials of Galactar ZIP file and the other two will be released to our backers the moment they are finished.\nFor a $25 and $30 pledge, you will get a Kickstarter-only Rockman Chronicles Supernova Trilogy Edition novel with your name printed in a special acknowledgement section, in addition to the three eBook bundles. In this single novel, you will get all three ridiculous tales (Trials of Galactar, Cosmic Brain of Corruption, and Keys of the Void), one right after another, all bound in one solitary volume with your name printed in the acknowledgement section of the novel! Impress your friends with your easy-to-carry trilogy book while they try desperately to carry all of their separate, individual books.\nFor a $45 pledge, you will get all previous rewards, PLUS the complete digital audiobook of the first novel of the trilogy, John Rockman and the Trials of Galactar by the Prince of Galactar voiced by co-author Mitchell Lucas with a few additional voices by myself, Justin Lucas, and our good friend Chris Hall.\nNot too sure of the quality? I don't blame you. If you want to know what he sounds like, just check out the sample chapter audio version and find out for yourself.\nFor a $60 pledge, in addition to the eBook bundles and the Kickstarter-only Rockman Chronicles Supernova Trilogy Edition, you can just cut right to the chase and get the final two novels in digital audiobook form. The ENTIRE trilogy, voiced by the authors themselves. You will hear it as it was meant to be heard. You can learn all the weird pronunciations and show off to your mom/friends/mom's friends.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe books will be finished should the Kickstarter reach its goal.

Taking equal inspiration from hack \u2018n slash dungeon crawlers (procedurally generated dungeons, loot drops, etc) and Metroidvania-style platformers, the game aims to immerse you in its 2D fantasy world full of exciting treasure, deadly enemies, and abundant secrets. \nWe are attempting to create an authentic retro experience similar to the games you remember. Chasm was heavily influenced by games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid and Diablo. If these games are your style, then this is the game you have been waiting for!\nIn Chasm, players take up the role of a soldier passing through a remote mining town on their journey home from a long war. The town\u2019s miners have recently disappeared after breaching a long-forgotten temple far below the town, and reawakened an ancient slumbering evil. Now trapped in the town by supernatural forces, you\u2019re left with no option but to explore the mines below, battle enemies and bosses, and increase your abilities in hopes of finally escaping and returning home.\nThe mine entrance in Karthas.\n  Current and Planned Features \nExplore Metroid-like dungeons procedurally assembled from hand-crafted rooms in six diverse areas.\nEnjoy challenging retro gameplay and gorgeous authentic pixel art (320\u00d7180 native resolution) \nDiscover new special abilities and powers to reach previously inaccessible areas\nPlay how you want by equipping weapons, spellbooks, shields, and more to both hands\nUncover random loot drops and rare items\nBattle massive bosses & mini-bosses\nAvoid devious traps and platforming hazards\nIncludes Normal and Hardcore (Scored with Permadeath) Modes\nLeaderboards for Hardcore playthroughs featuring quickest time, least damage taken, and more\nWindows, Mac, & Linux versions with Gamepad support\nExploring the mines.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nSince James quit his job last year to focus on Discord Games, he has been relying on income from sales of Take Arms to keep the company running. He knew Chasm was a much bigger game than he could afford to make, but thought that if he could do it right, people would see the potential of the idea.\nWe met our initial goal of a playable demonstration, but funds for development are now depleted. Simply put, this game can not be made without your support.  We've been waiting forever for a game like this, but game publishers today just aren't interested in projects like this one. With your support, we will be able to finish the game ourselves and give you a truly amazing experience. Your generous pledges will go towards: \nLiving Costs: James and Tim still need to eat, pay bills, and afford life-giving coffee while they develop the game.\nPaying Artists and Sound Designer: We will need money to pay our wonderful team for their hard work.\nPolish and Improvement: Making sure Chasm is a quality, bug-free game with enough time dedicated to it.\nBusiness & Legal Costs: To officially sell the game, we need to keep up with administrative costs and other expenses related to the business.\nPromotion & Marketing: We will need to commission awesome final box art, promotional graphics, video trailers, etc.\nGetting the drop on some unsuspecting kobolds.\nAccess to the Game\nYour pledge of $15 or greater will get you a copy of the final game when it\u2019s released. We do not know what will be our primary method of distribution, but regardless, we will give you a DRM-free copy for Windows, Mac and/or Linux. See below for estimated system requirements. We're aiming to be content complete early 2014 and then release the game by May 2014. This is subject to change, and the closed Beta will likely cause delays.\nEARLY ACCESS\nPledging $30 or more ($25 for early birds!) will also give you access to our closed Beta. The exact date and details are still uncertain, but we will attempt to start it a couple months before the game is officially released to the public.The game will be highly playable at this phase (at least 90% content complete), but we will still be adding, removing and testing features. As a tester, you will have a direct effect on the game by playing and voicing your opinions and feedback on the private Developer forum. This also includes identifying any performance issues and bugs.\nChecking the map for directions.\nSystem Requirements \nThe requirements are subject to change. Chasm is being developed with older hardware in mind, and shouldn't be too demanding. However, due to how XNA's graphics system works, you will need at least a Pixel Shader 2.0+ capable graphics card.

A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions. Each Act lasts 2 hours.\nMyth Heroes in Battle\nPlayers' avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.\nHeroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.\nHero board\nHero cards\nItem cards\nMyth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck. Yet, the Darkness is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game. \nCreature sculpts\nMyth setup offers players the freedom to experiment and create the Story they want. Each Act is created by placing the double-sided World Tiles in any configuration desired, then each tile is populated through random card draws (or by choice). Enemy-types, quests, treasure, merchants, and events are all variables controlled by players. Each Story is unique and breathed to life by the players. \nMyth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves. And these are the myths, with friends and family, that we carry with us; telling and retelling our endeavors at the mead benches, earning treasured smiles and laughter. \nVideo of gameplay, part 1\nVideo of gameplay, part 2\nVideo of Quest, traps, and more!\nThe Hero Board!\n\n41 Miniatures (28mm Heroic scale): 5 Heroes, 15 Arachnid Minions, 15 Orc Minions, 2 Arachnid Captains, 2 Orc Captains, 1 Mini-boss, 1 Arachnid Boss\n5 Hero Decks containing 31 full-sized cards\n5 Hero play-boards\n10 Double-sided World Tiles\n10 Ten-sided dice\n5 Six-sided Fate Dice\n120 Treasure Deck Mini-cards\n1 Darkness play-board\n1 Arachnid Boss event deck containing 10 full-sized cards\n1 Mini-boss card\n7 Creature cards\n40+ Counters/Tokens\n\nGame Play Videos\nSoldier Deck Preview\nAcolyte Deck Preview\nApprentice Deck Preview\nArcher Deck Preview\nBrigand Deck Preview\nTrickster Deck Preview\nSkald Deck Preview\nWho We Are \nKeith Lowe \u2013 Artist \nFor the past eight years I've worked as a Graphic Designer for BradyGames, learning good design and what it means to develop a property.  During that time, I also co-founded MERCS. I've been at the helm of the visuals since the beginning. It started as an outlet to quench my thirst for drawing and painting. It has always been my passion to create amazing characters and worlds.\nMyth has been an exciting project to tackle. I felt inspired from the earliest discussions about it. It is a simple but potent idea of warriors sitting around a campfire spinning grand tales. Stories of amazing creatures and quests that would become a reality for the player. It's a great idea that acted like a spark.\nVisually I wanted Myth to be colorful, full of energy, and appealing to a broad age group. I wanted to create a look that has depth, but you can also feel good about playing it with your kids. I hope you enjoy the look as much as I do. It offers loads of inspiration for me as an artist, and with your help it can continue to grow.\nBrian Shotton \u2013 Game Design \nThe Myth project started a year and a half ago on a plane to PAX Prime.  Kenny and I, with nothing better to do on a four hour flight, began talking about games we wish existed or games we wish were different. We quickly landed on the fantasy genre, as old school D&D was very dear to our hearts. We wanted a game that would allow us to feel heroic, to feel like we were what we claimed to be.\nFast forward a couple months. I am fiddling with what would become the card system for the Myth Heroes when a thought sprang full-born from my brain, an Old-English thought actually - boasts made on the mead benches (or around a table at your local FLGS) must hold true. We must be true to our words and these fables we weave must be played out. Kenny and I started laying the foundation of the game that weekend. Many months later, here we are.\nI have been in and around hobby gaming for most of my life. My first design, MERCS, has afforded me many an opportunity in the hobby game industry. Myth is a very fun game and it pleases me to put my name on this game.\nKenny Sims \u2013 Game Design\nI've been a gamer my entire life - board games, video games, role-playing games, all of them. Gaming has given me so much pleasure over the years. I've always wanted to create games that others could enjoy. Working with Brian and Keith to create Myth has given me the opportunity to bring that dream to life.\nIn creating Myth, we wanted to make a cooperative game where no one had to be the bad guy. A game where a group of friends could come together and have an adventure, facing menacing foes and challenging odds in a shared story, where everyone has a part to play and each role is just as important as any other. I'm extremely pleased with the end result and can't wait to hear the stories of other adventurers as they experience Myth.\nSpecial Thanks\nTo all of our family and friends who have supported us. Thanks to Chris Doughman for his outstanding design work on this project, Jeff Weissenberger for his amazing voice talent, Colin King for his cool Myth logo treatments, and Bart Stoop for allowing us to use his inspiring song titled \"Titans Will Rise\" in our videos.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough MERCS we have produced miniatures, dice, books, cards, maps, and counters. \n\nFrom past experience, anytime we've dealt with sculptors, printing, and production in terms of timing things can arise.

Luckily, we have multiple people on the ground in China that shepherd our stuff from place-to-place and keep us updated in terms of where things are.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize unknowns as much as a company can, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 60% complete, we don't believe this is the least bit likely.\n\nAny MERCS player will tell you that our rapport with our communities is one of our strengths. We put out a lot of updates and communicate things as they happen. We'll communicate all pieces and parts through the Kickstart update tab as well as a simple Myth webpage. \n\nEvery model is in either an advanced stage of sculpt or in production. 70% of the art is done. In effect, we have nine months to print and produce Myth.

Now I am set to finish the transition from metal to plastic for the rest of the RBG line. This is still a VERY significant investment and not something that I can afford without your support. It is my intention to offer the entirety of the RBG line a material that I can price to bring RBG figures to every gamer's table in the hobby. It is further my goal to expand RBG to encompass more of the Traditional Old School Fantasy Spectrum. I want to produce, Characters, Monsters, and even Terrain! I can do this with your help. The HelsVakt kickstarter was a great step in the right direction and with your help and support we can make this Kickstarter into something huge! \n\n  We are beginning with the goblins by popular demand but I have a LOT of stuff to retool and I will be taking every comment and request under consideration as the campaign progresses. It is my plan to move on to the Dvergr or the Aenglish after the goblins are retooled, hopefully there will be enough time in this campaign to make that happen but that is all up to you!\n\n HOW THIS WORKS\nYour pledge corresponds to a specific reward level. Thus far the rewards for this campaign are structured by dividing the different goal products into Solos, Lesser Ranks, and Special Ranks. Each goal product is described in it's funding pitch as either a Solo option, lesser rank option or Special rank option. When a funding goal is reached the goal product then becomes available for selection as a reward for your contribution. So for instance up to the $15,000.00 funding mark if you pledge to the Raiding Party level you can choose 2 \" ranks \" of spear men ( 12 models in each set ) and 3 sets of  archers, after the $15,000.00 mark you can choose either the spear men or the footmen or both to fulfill your lesser ranks selection.\n\n    If you wish, you can add to your pledge to buy additional ranks or solos not covered by your pledge. The values for each are as follows;\n    SOLO .............................$5.00\n    LESSER RANKS...........$25.00\n    SPECIAL RANKS.........$35.00\n     THE STORY\n  So here we find ourselves....Stalking the root twisted floor of the Dokk Wolds. Bent low beneath the wicked reaching bones of the gnarly oaks aged and weathered. The day long passed into night. The moon high but barely more than a ghost shrouded by heavy clouds bearing low the first snows of the winter. The chill wind whips about our cloaked forms bitter and spiteful. Our breath spirited a-fright, our steps furtive, our hands be-gripped the hilt of sword and axe and hammer. Hung from our weary shoulders our shields ragged and gouged bear the story of the melee that drove us from the road and harrowed us by day to this cursed knot. Our ears wide and listening, fooled at every crack of twig under foot or creak of barren branch. Fools! Our hunters will make no such warnings to us! It is our eyes narrowed and keenly watching and our wits clear and calm that will find the watchers in the shadows now awaiting our strength to sap and our will to break. They, our would be death, the creeping, fanged, feral bastards of the Wild God, Great Horned Bas. Scampering little devils so gleefully cruel,  what for the mad blood thirst of their degenerate Gods drives them so.\n\n It is no matter. We must steel ourselves to live another day. Limber your arms fellows, for death awaits us on point of rusty spear and barbed arrow, and looted sword and sax. Pray you fervently that those vicious hulks, sharp bones through their skins and drugged stupor in their eyes, do not walk amoungst them.........For if they do, then this day we are surely lost.......Odin's Breath be strong brothers....\n THE FIGURES\n DIRE WOLVES!!!\n Nigh the size of a man and beset the ravenous hunger of the great wolf god himself the Dire Wolves race through tangled wood and over open ground with equal ferocity slathering jaws agape to rip and rend the flesh of their prey, man and beast alike it matters not when the Howling God leads the way.. Summoned forth from the deepest primordial wilds they serve the will of Fenris only!\nAdd the Dire wolves to your pledge for an additional $15.00 per set of three. Or $25.00 per set of six. The Dire wolves are NOT considered a lesser or special ranks selection. These are a separate item all together. The Dire Wolves are modularly fitted for universally interchangeable heads and are supplied with 40mm round bases.\nLESSER RANKS SELECTION\n RUNTY GOB SPEARMEN!!!!  FUNDED!!!!\nFeral, vicious, and swarming the goblin hordes inhabit the deepest darkest of forests only venturing out in search of pillage and plunder. Small as they may be they are dangerous and devious! The most commonly encountered goblins are the runty gob spearmen and archers. Though small and lightly armed these goblins are no laughing matter for they are cunning and vicious and often employ wicked poisons and devious traps or ambush.\n\n  Goblins are pictured on 20 mm bases\n\n  SOLO OPTION\n  RUNTY GOB ARCHERS!!!\n Upon reaching our goal of $5,000.00 the runty gobs will be made available as a selectable option. The Spearmen are selectable as lesser ranks option with each rank consisting of 2 sets of the 6 figures pictured above in each rank. The Archers are available together as a solo option with all three figures pictured above counting as 1 solo option.\nSTRETCH GOAL # 2 $12,500.00\n    LESSER RANKS SELECTION \n   RUNTY GOB FOOTMEN!!!!! FUNDED!!!!\n   All new and ready for battle the runty goblin footmen. These are the honoured warriors of goblin kind. Earning the spoils of victory by strength of arm, or skill in battle these goblins bear the arms of fallen dwarves, men and even elves. They are not as cowardly as most goblins and are usually smarter as well. A formidable force that NO goblin warband can be without!\n\n  These figures are available as a themed set titled \" Runty Gob Footmen \" Each set includes 12 footmen figures and 3 weapon sprues. Each footman is modularly fitted for universally interchangeable hand weapon options.  The goblins here are pictured still WIP on 20 mm round bases. and are available as a lesser rank option upon funding.\nSTRETCH GOAL # 3 $15,000.00 ..............FUNDED!!!\nDOG'SBANE!!! Cruel and devious Dog's bane has clawed, kicked, bitten, stabbed, poisoned, burned, smashed, drowned, bashed and speared his way to the top of the long howlers' spearmen. Under his snarling barks the Runty gob spearmen don't dare turn tail and run, unless Dog's Bane does first! ( pictured here on a 20 mm base )\nBLACK TONGUE!!!\nfoot cheiftan of the Long Howler's Gnawed Leg clan. Unique amoungst his kind Black Tongue fights with more of what could pass for courage than most other goblins. He fights with skill and cunning and puts great effort to make an impression upon friend and foe alike for his cruelty and ruthlessness.\nSTRETCH GOAL # 4-5 $ 18,000.00 -$21,000.00 - $25,000.00\n SPECIAL RANKS SELECTION \n   GOBLIN BONEBACKS!!!\n   Brutal, Fearless, and dumb as a sack of rocks these goblin Brutes are the biggest, meanest, and most dangerous goblin kind to rage out of the Black Woods. Battle mad and usually drugged stupid with rotted poisonous mushrooms the Bonebacks fling themselves into the thick of battle without the slightest regard for themselves and no other intent but bathing in the blood of anything that happens to get too close be they friend or foe. It is their implaccability that makes them so incredibly dangerous. They do not turn and flee and they do not flinch at even horrible pain. ( pictured here on 25 mm bases. )\n\nThe goblin bonebacks are modularly fitted for universally interchangeable weapons. The weapon options to be included in each set will be 2 cleavers, 2 swords, 2 clubs, 2 small axes, 2 large axes, 2 maces, and 2 hammers( all cast in metal. The Bonebacks are available as a special rank set option upon funding . The first set of 4 will unlock at $18,000.00 and the second set of 4 will unlock at $21,000.00. Then the final set of 4 will unlock at $25,000.00. If the final total of the KS campaign does not go above $18,000.00 then you will receive 3 sets of the first 4 models to complete the ranks selection for the Bonebacks. If the final amoutn does nto go over $21,000.00 you will receive two sets of the first set of four and 1 set of the second set of four. But if the final amount DOES go above the $25,000.00 mark then you will receive 12 unique boneback figures to complete the bonebacks rank.\n\n      Stretch goal # 6 $35,000.00\n    SPECIAL RANKS SELECTION \n    RUNTY GOBS WOLFRIDERS!!!\n    The most honoured amoungst the Long Howlers tribe are the Wolf Riders. Famed through out all the goblin tribes these goblins are part warrior and part shaman sharing a spiritual bond with the beasts on whose backs they ride terrifying into battle. Combining the strength , agility, and speed of the wolves with the devious combat prowess of the goblin and some slight shaman magic as well the goblin wolfriders are a force to feared by any whose path they cross. Whether armed with bow, blade, or spear the Wolf riders make any goblin force an army of merit. These figures are available as a special rank set titled \" Wolf Riders A. \" each set includes 4 wolves and 4 hand weapon riders options and 1 sprue of weapons. The riders are fitted for universally interchangeable hand weapons.\nSTRETCH GOAL  # 7 $45,000.00\n SPECIAL RANKS SELECTION \n   THE TROLL BROTHERS!!!\nNothing strikes fear into the hearts of the Northlanders and goblins a-like as do the long shadow of the great Troll Kind. Often keeping to the deepest caves and forest valleys the Troll Kind only venture into the lands of the Dvergr or Njorn or Aenglish for plunder or revenge, but sometimes they ally with their lesser cousins the goblin kind at behest or fear of great magick. Just such is the story of the Troll Brothers. Strong enough to throw huge stones over castle ramparts Rocklobber is a name feared far and wide, while Hogsquasher's legendary gleeful cruelty and ferocity has stopped many a great hero in their tracks on hearing the name of this great beast. Add the Troll Brothers to your existing pledge as 1 special rank set. ( Pictured here on 40 mm bases )\nSTRETCH GOAL # 8 $50,000.00\n    INDIVIDUAL HERO SELECTION\n   CROWBITER!!! \n   Older than any living goblin can remember, more crazed than any shaman to boil the red mushrooms before him, and more wicked than even the Old Horned One himself, it is Crowbiter who leads the Long Howlers more so than that fat, stupid, slathering oaf Horsebane, but a cunning leader is he who pretends to serve another. By Crowbiter's magicks have many a battle turned in favour of the fanged kin, and it was by Crowbiter's powers and persuasion that the great Troll Brothers first sat  at the Stone Circle to feast with the Long Howlers on the Dwarves of Garmingen's Fort. By his magicks do the dire wolves howl and heel, and by his will do the Long Howlers kill and steal.\n\n  Crowbiter will be available as a singular solo option upon funding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been operating Red Box Games for 5 years now. In that time I have developed a reputation for prompt, personal service and reliability. I work very very hard to insure that every customer is HAPPY with their order and the service provided to see it to them. I know what it takes to make a miniature work for production and shipment and to also work for the general use of gaming and painting. Almost every one of the miniatures proposed for production in this Kickstarter are already ready for production. At this point all that is left is for them to be remolded and cast in a new material. The only challenge involved here is in the productive capacity of the mold maker / caster and any difficulty encountered there will be resolved as it arises by hiring on new help to create the manpower necessary to deliver the product as advertised and on time. Troll's forge is a very well established and reliable service and is dedicated to seeing this effort through to it's greatest success.\n\nBeyond that only the fulfillment effort on my end would be any other foreseeable challenge, which will be fixed with the hiring of a full time employee if this campaign funds as I hope it will.\n\n I am now in the process of delivering on my recently successful Kickstarter project. The delivery is behind schedule ( originally intended for October of 2012 ) but is now in the final stages of fulfillment. We encountered set backs of varying nature through out the production process but have since made the necessary corrections and have learned how to avoid them on future works.

Then as the two other sets of four unlock they will replace one set of duplicates in the final 12.  This way the special ranks selections are CERTAIN to have value and we are CERTAIN to get the bonebacks in.

Thanks to everyone who made this a possibility. There are still a few days left to go. Any additional money raised will go recouping the payment for the first half of the pencils and for the coloring.\nI sent off the first few pages to a handful of publishers late last week, so fingers crossed.\nBlack Lotus Empire is a 12 issue, full-color comic book series that explores what life might be like in China almost 100 years from now.  In BLE, China is now the sole economic and military superpower in the world, and the government frequently engages in intimidation, violence, and control of information to keep the people in line. But cracks are forming, and the leaders know that unrest may threaten their rule, so a sinister general has been giving the authority to create a fighting force to combat China\u2019s only true enemy: her own people.\nThe comic was created and written by me and features stunning artwork by Carlos Gomez (pencils) and Neeraj Menon (colors).\nSparrow: the protagonist. Pencils: Carlos Gomez, Colors: Neeraj Menon\nOk, but what is the story?\nIt is the dawn of the 22nd century. For a century, China\u2019s leaders have bought their peoples\u2019 submission with continued growth and prosperity, but as the economy grinds to a halt, protests have broken out in the megacities. Life for urban dwellers is still far better than for those in the impoverished rural areas, which have borne the scars of China\u2019s ongoing industrial revolution. Pollution has contaminated the water, the soil, and even the food the people rely on. Severe birth defects occur in record numbers, though many go unreported. Most families cannot afford to take care of a crippled child. They need a strong, sturdy son to help them earn a living. Because of the one-child policy, many babies born with deformities are simply abandoned by their parents. The military, under the ambitious General Ying, has begun the practice of taking these unwanted children and experimenting on them to create a force of Supersoldiers called the Ch\u0101o Sh\u00ecb\u012bng. Their mission: to combat the growing number of internal threats to the stability of China. The protagonist of BLE is one of these unwanted children. Sparrow was abandoned by her parents because she was born with wings. Fortunately, she was adopted by a kindly army officer who sought to protect her from Ying\u2019s program. In time, she was discovered and taken away; her father imprisoned. After years of training, General Ying has activated her to assassinate a high ranking dissident leader who has suddenly surfaced.\n\nThe story begins with Sparrow fighting against the Dissidents, but a discovery leads her to change sides. Now she must turn a rag tag group of dissidents into a fighting force that can take on the military, while simultaneously overcoming her crippling temper, and coping with her feelings for a fellow freedom fighter.\npage 1\npage 2\npage 3\npage 4\npage 5\nWhat is the money for?\nGood art ain't cheap! The amount I am asking for covers half the cost of the pencils for Black Lotus Empire #1, plus all Kickstarter and Amazon fees, and costs for printing and shipping the pledge rewards. I am really happy to be working with Carlos Gomez, a talented young artist from Spain. I paid the first half out of pocket, and I will be paying for the coloring out of pocket as well.\nType 9 \u201cBlack Lotus\u201d Light Combat Uniform. Pencils: Carlos Gomez, Colors: Neeraj Menon\nWhat's the ultimate goal?\nI plan to shop issue one around to comic publishers to see if anyone will pick up the 12 issue run. If not, I will self publish and hope to make enough money off of each issue to fund the next one.I don't really plan on making a penny off of the comic, and may even lose some money, but I am having fun writing it and I would love to see it come to life. If this works out, I have a couple of other stories I want to start work on.\nType 9 \u201cBlack Lotus\u201d Heavy Combat Uniform.

If you are interested in continued support for the Bombshell Babes project beyond the Kickstarter funding period, we will be posting more info on a dedicated page at the regular site.\nBabes Sculpts in Progress\nFor more updates on the sculpts in progresss visit the Sculpts Page.\nThese are progress pictures of the Babes sculpts I'm currently working on. They will go through a series of iterations until they are the best sculpts they can be. As my own art director, there is a lot of leeway to make them as close to the concept art as I feel is possible or to vary from it as necessary, as long as the coolness factor is ramped up.\nAs requested - here is a preliminary shot of Maelee next to a couple of popular figures sculpted by Jeff Grace for Dark Sword and Werner Klocke for Reaper so you can gauge the size of the intended models. Keep in mind, some of our figures may actually be a little larger or smaller depending on the character portrayed.\nThe Idea\nFor several years now I have been wanting to launch a new boutique line of miniatures featuring strong female characters. Although I'm using terms like \"Bombshell\" and \"Babes\" to describe the line, these characters are much more than either of those outdated terms. The concept needed something retro and nostalgic that evoked images of famous paintings like J. Howard Miller's \"We Can Do It\" and Rockwell's \"Rosie the Riveter\".\nWith this new concept, I want to create a strong recognizable brand that stands for excellence in figurative sculpting. My recent work (shown above) for some of the top companies in the gaming industry has brought me into contact with a fantastic group of creative professionals eager to collaborate on this project. From concept art and character design to sculpting and painting the finished models, my goal is to create beautiful figurative sculpture in miniature. And now we have an exceptional team of skilled and talented collaborators who share that goal.\nThe Costs\nThe funding goal goes directly to pay the artists and designers to make the characters tangible. It also will go to the sculptors who will be providing the characters and pieces for molding as well as all of the other production costs like 3D printing, casting, packaging and various other promotional expenses.\nThe Babes\nWe have a fantastic list of classic character archetypes as well as new characters from many popular genres including Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Steampunk and more that we will be revealing throughout the course of the Kickstarter project that you can choose as rewards. We also have several characters officially licensed from artist Matt Dixon that will be added to our Babes line.  Our figures will be engineered to make them easy to add to alternate bases for a variety of gaming or painting needs. Care will also be taken to size the figures so they will be compatible with other models from the most popular manufacturers within the 30mm range. The Babes will be cast in metal with a variety of accessory sprues available along with resin creatures and vehicles.\nBABES REWARDS CHOICES\nAs your first perk for jumping in early and backing the project to completion way before the deadline, we have upgraded EVERY Babe model with a resin scenic base insert! That's right, all of the Babe models will now come with a resin base insert that will have unique terrain features appropriate to the characters. The base insert will be scaled to fit inside of the depression on a 30mm premium round-lipped base common to many tabletop games. I have created numerous base inserts just like these for Wyrd Miniatures and we are happy to be able to include them with each of our Babe models.\nYou can see larger versions of the designs in our Concept Art Gallery.\nYou can see larger versions of the designs in our Concept Art Gallery.\nReinforcements Add-On Sets\nThese unique sets will be available for additional pledge amounts indicated once the specific goals to unlock the pieces are reached.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$20,000 ACHIEVED - THANK YOU!!! - EVERY Babe model now gets a resin scenic base insert!\n$25,000 ACHIEVED - THANK YOU!!! - We can now make The Girl available  as a Babes choice, the character designed by Roberto Cirillo and  created by Andy Hoare for his upcoming tabletop battle game Get the Girl, Kill the Baddies.

Thank you so much to everyone who's pledged! :) As a little \"thank you\" for your support, I thought I'd offer a first look at the character sheet. Keep in mind, this is the working version. As I flesh things out and do some game testing, details and design elements are sure to change. But at least this gives you a pretty solid idea as to what you can expect. Click here for a bigger version: http://grantgould.com/art/brcs.jpg  Also, I added new Pledge Rewards: ORIGINAL ARTWORK from the book at the $200 level (limited to 30) and a PDF at $15. So please check those out. Thanks!\nWhat is Blade Raiders?\nBlade Raiders is an epic fantasy tabletop roleplaying game. Swords and sorcery, high adventure, creatures and quests -- All of the elements you crave, but presented with a unique spin you've never experienced before. The game will be written, assembled, and fully illustrated by me (you can check out my full bio on the right side of this page), and I'm confident people will enjoy the end result. I've been playing and running tabletop RPGs for over 25 years, so I know what makes a fun game and a great social experience. I look forward to sharing my vision with you and your gaming group. :)\nCan you tell me more about the actual book itself?\nThis first book is the core rulebook. It contains everything you need to play the game, aside from dice -- World overview, character creation, combat rules, monster stats, and everything else needed to begin your adventure. The book will have an 8.5\"x11\"/magazine-size format (like many RPGs: Dungeons & Dragons, Palladium, Pathfinder, etc.), softcover, perfect-bound, featuring black-and-white interior pages and full-color covers. **A limited-edition hardcover version is available as well. See the rewards section for more info.**\nWhen will the book be done?\nIf I reach my goal, I plan on having the book completely done by September and back from the printers by late October. If I don't reach my goal, then the project will be shelved. I just can't afford to spend the time needed on this unless I have some help. So, please, if you want this game to happen, make a pledge and tell your friends.\nSo what do I get if I pledge?\nRewards! :) Along the right-hand side of this page, you'll see the list of rewards based on the various amounts that you can pledge.\nWhat does my money pay for?\nYour money (assuming I reach my Kickstarter goal -- if the goal's not met, then you don't pay a penny) will make it possible for me to pay bills while I work on Blade Raiders.

LEGO\u00ae! Strategy and tactics!\nMobile Frame Zero: Rapid Attack is the tenth anniversary edition of Vincent Baker's Mechaton. Build yourself a company of robots called mobile frames out of LEGO, give yourself some objectives to defend, lay out a table with a few friends, and fight! We're making sure you've got all the parts we've got so you can have the most fun you can with the game. You'll get play instructions, building instructions, even instructions for how to make your own setting. \nBecause, just like a LEGO set, building what's on the front of the box is fun, but building your own thing is where it really catches fire. So that's what we want you to do! Build robots, play with our setting, sure! If you're into VOTOMS, Dougram, Macross, or Gasaraki, then we want to play with you! We've put a lot of love and care into the designs and the setting and we're excited to see what people do with them. But then check out the advice on building a setting and house rules, too, and go to town!\nAbout the rules\nMobile Frame Zero: Rapid Attack is designed to be playable with two to five players, each fielding a company of mobile frames of different strengths. The game keeps tension high by making sure that no player ever quite has enough frames, equipment, or time to be a sure thing. In fact, the player in the strongest points position to win is the player with the weakest company; if you expect to fight from a difficult position, be ready to run away and come back in another round!\nPlay starts with the doomsday clock set to 11. Every turn, it ticks down by one automatically. At 0 the game ends. But adding to that is the possibility that each player can mark it down faster. If you're winning, you'll mark it down every round. If you think you'll be winning this round, you'll mark it down. Players never really know how soon the game will end until the very end.\nRules are tightly tied to the frames themselves. Every frame has its own two white dice, then has added to it up to four subsystems. Those systems help the frame move, attack at one of three ranges, defend themselves, and observe & communicate. When a frame takes damage, it takes damage by losing those systems. \nPlay takes between 2.5 and 4 hours, depending on the age and number of players. Eager 10-year-olds seem to grasp the game well, but it offers a constantly flowing sea of tactical options to more experienced players.\nAbout the Setting\nIt's the year 0245 of the Solar Calendar. The Earth-centered Solar Union has overstretched, abandoning the interstellar colonies and colonists that can no longer produce enough for its vast and struggling population.\nWhen the Solar Union's colonial efforts reached the homeworld of the Ijad, they found their first opposition. Religiously opposed to empire, they quickly adopted the SU's technologies of interstellar travel and the muscle cylinders that made their mighty mobile frames possible. The Solar Union now finds its own technologies turned against it as the Ijad fight in their quadrupedal Scrambler frames to force back the tide of the Solar Union.\nInspired by the Ijad religion and rising against the Solar Union are the newly-formed Free Colonies. Fighting with labor frames and homebuilt mobile frames built from scavenged muscle cylinders, they take inspiration from the Ijad's liberation theology in the hopes of achieving Badhal \u2014 self-determination.\nWithin these factions are many more. You'll define your Ijad religious factions, your companies of United Mars Foreign Legionnaires and Terran Trade Marines, you Free Colonial popular movements. They might not agree with their purported allies, and they might find themselves friends with those who would be their enemies.\nMobile Frames\nThe United Mars Foreign Legion's ST-07 \"Chubs\", backed by their ACT-022A \"Chub Tub\". The Free Colonies' Hi-Leg \u2014 a low-cost homebuilt mobile frame and the converted labor frame, the Commissar. The Ijad's \"Scrambler\" and \"Stalker\" (names given the frames by the Terran Trade Marines who first encountered them) are often supported by Swerves, tiny flying craft designed to pierce and cut between the plates of enemy frames.\nA sample of decals \u2014 a change in printers has allowed us to print a greater variety than you can see here.\nKickbacks\nSoren and Joshua are working hard to bring some unique, limited edition stuff that we can't possibly mass-produce to you guys.\nDecals are the first. Designed by Joshua A.C. Newman specifically for the Kickstarter, you'll receive sheets of transparent decals to distinguish your companies. They'll include symbols for all three factions including industrial markings, rank insignia, religious slogans, and kill markers.\nThe Mobile Frame Garage is a kit thoughtfully designed by Soren to give you a pile of parts appropriate for building mobile frames. Designed for players who don't have a big bin of LEGO at home, tiny hinges and other parts give you all you need for a company of five mobile frames. Presented in neutral colors, you can liven up your particular company by adding in parts from any LEGO set.\nSoren's Special Edition kits are designed and hand-assembled by Soren to give you real punch right out of the box. There are only two of each faction, so choose wisely.\nA custom-designed company by Joshua will set you up right. You'll chat with Joshua, who will help you figure out what faction you like the most, how you want to play tactically, and custom design and assemble your company.\nA custom-designed company by Soren will make your company the most coveted in all of LEGO mecha. You'll consult with Soren and Joshua, working out what faction you want and how you want it to work tactically, and then Soren will build it up for you.\n\nWho are we?\nVincent Baker (@lumpleygames on Twitter) is the designer and publisher of Dogs in the Vineyard, Apocalypse World, The Abductinators, and a bunch of other games. His website is lumpley.com.\nJoshua A.C. Newman (@JoshuaACNewman on Twitter)is the designer and publisher of Shock:Social Science Fiction, Shock:Human Contact (a Kickstarter project also), and Under the Bed. His website is glyphpress.com.\nSebastian is our apprentice. He's Vincent's son and Joshua's godson. He's got a game coming out soon called Blasters for Hire about space bounty hunters.\nSoren Roberts (@harmfulmechanic on Twitter) is an extraordinary artist and designer in the LEGO medium. He's been wowing the LEGO community with his mecha for years. You can see his work in his substantial Flickr stream.\nOne thing we're not is employees of LEGO. We're a bunch of guys who love it, but we're not them, at all. In fact, I can even tell you that there are other great building toys that you could use with the MFZ rules like Gundam models, Mega Blocks, or even little squads of metal miniatures where each unit, instead of a system, represents a die. \nWant to see something neat?\nYou should check out the Mobile Frame Zero: Rapid Attack Flickr pool. There are hundreds of robots from within and without the Solar Calendar from all different skill levels.\nYou'll also see a lot of neat stuff over at Zeekhotep's blog, No B.S., Just ABS. One thing you'll see is an interview with Joshua, talking about MFZ and where it came from! You'll also be able to participate in an ongoing discussion of tactics and building.\nCel\u2022Style\nMobile Frame Zero is being published with the cool kids over at Cel\u2022Style!

Let's keep the number increasing and really knock it out of the ballpark. I have been having a blast reading the messages of excitement from the RPG players who feel neglected over the years.\nWe wanted to have a little fun and make another comical video so I hope you enjoy it. The next video I put up will also be more informative as I will answer some of the more common questions from the forums. We are still deciding on the tech, and we don't know what the final budget is, so it can be difficult to have answers for everything right now.\nSo see our thoughts on Multi-player as well as a list of links to some of the great press we have been getting, go to our updates page by clicking \"Updates \" at the top of this page.\nBrian Fargo appears on Hard Drive.\n\"I\u2019m personally a big fan of the Wasteland series from having played the original game in the late 80s; I\u2019ve also always admired Brian Fargo\u2019s courage to experiment with new designs and game engines from my time working with him in the early days of BioWare when we worked with Interplay, and as a result I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing the next game in the Wasteland series!\" - Ray Muzyka - CEO Bioware\n\"Hats off to Fargo and inXile, I'm definitely putting my money down when they start up their Kickstarter fund, and I'll donate just as much as I did to Double Fine.  Give me Wasteland 2 already.\" - Chris Avellone - RPG designer extraordinaire\n\"Brian was one of the pioneers for the computer RPG with games like Bard's Tale and Wasteland.  I would be very excited to see what Brian could achieve with a sequel to such a classic like the first Wasteland.\"         - Rob Pardo - ExecutiveVice President of Game Design, Blizzard Entertainment\n\"WASTELAND is the game that made me a gamer.  It's still my favourite game of all time, simply because of how influential and mind-blowing it was at the time.\" - Rock Paper Shotgun reader Zerosociety\n\"Shut up and take my money!\" - Eurogamer reader Arcam (amongst many others)\nWasteland 2 is the direct sequel to the first ever post-apocalyptic computer RPG. The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s current \u201cArt of the Computer Game\u201d exhibition.\nWasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more.  It'll finally be the game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.\nFor Wasteland 2, we\u2019re getting the band back together again!. Brian Fargo who Executive Produced both Wasteland and Fallout will be heading the team. Alan Pavlish and Mike Stackpole\u2014the original game\u2019s primary designers\u2014are coming back to put the project together, and we\u2019re rounding up as many of the other designers, like Ken St. Andre, as we can. On top of that, we\u2019ll have music by Mark Morgan of Fallout 1 and 2 fame. The storyline for Wasteland 2 was written by Jason Anderson who was the co-creator of Fallout. We have also enlisted the help of the amazing concept artist, Andree Wallin to help craft the Wasteland 2 world.\nA sample of Andree's other work can be seen below.\nBrian Fargo founded Interplay Productions (By Gamers, For Gamers) in 1983 where he went on to produce and finance some of the biggest RPG's made like Bard's Tale, Fallout 1 and 2, Stonekeep, Dragon Wars, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and more. Creating a new Wasteland will be a point of pride in the long history of games.\nNot a month goes by when an email doesn\u2019t come in asking if we\u2019ve ever considered doing a sequel. Emails from gamers who remember Wasteland fondly and want, just as badly as we do, to return to that gritty world where burning through clips might be the only thing that keeps you alive; and where running out of ammo will certainly get you killed. The fact that you, the folks who know and love and play games, keep asking for Wasteland 2 told us that there is a demand for it.\n\nSo, we\u2019re coming to you for support.\n\nFinancial.\n\nAnd creative.\n\nAfter all, since you\u2019re the driving force behind this game, we want to make sure that we\u2019ll be delivering the game you want. Wasteland is ready for a sequel, and with your help, it\u2019s going to happen. As for why you should want to participate, we\u2019ll let Kotaku point out why making Wasteland 2 happen is very important:  FanFundWasteland!\nWith your collective vision, the game that was the godfather to the popular Fallout series will become a reality.  Not only will you fund the development, but you\u2019ll have a voice in how the game goes together. We will have forums up for design discussion and soliciting your ideas for what will make Wasteland 2 rock.\nThis is your chance to influence the kind of game you want to see. With fan funding, you drive the direction of game design and development. If it is important to you, it is important to us. \nThis is probably the last chance for a Wasteland sequel.  We have tried to pitch this game multiple times to game publishers, but they\u2019ve balked. They don\u2019t think there\u2019s any interest in a solid, old school type of game.  This is our shot at proving them wrong. And more importantly this could help bring back an entire genre of RPGs. The power of the Indie scene continues and we see this as all part of a bigger trend of bringing control back to the developers.\nSupporting Wasteland 2 is nothing more radical than pre-ordering a game from your favorite brick-and-mortar store. We believe strongly enough in this project and in your desire to see it become a reality, that we decided to go ahead with this Kickstarter drive to fund it.\nNuts and bolts time.\nWe\u2019re going back to the original and building from there. No first person shooter, we\u2019re going top down so you get a tactical feel for the situation. And we\u2019re not ditching the party play to turn it into some hack-and-slash bloodfest. It\u2019s turn based, tactical, with a storyline that will be deeper and broader.\nWe\u2019re determined to keep the gritty, grim and satirical writing. We\u2019re going to pitch those moral dilemmas at you. You\u2019re going to be faced with the consequences of your actions.\nWe\u2019re planning on an initial 6 months of pre-production. We\u2019ll nail down every important element that you, our creative partners, want.  Once we have all that figured out, we buckle down for 12 month development cycle. During that time, players can get a sneak peek on a private closed beta through Steam.  In addition, we will be giving you constant updates and showing you our progress along the way.\nTo do this game right, we need to raise $1 million, but you'll notice our funding request is $900,000 and that is because Brian Fargo has offered to fund the last $100,000 if need be. That\u2019s a lot of money needed, but not when compared with the budgets of most full scale RPGs made today. The original game sold over 100,000 copies\u2014on the Apple ][ and Commodore 64 platforms back in the day. If everyone who played it then backs the project at the most basic level, the game is on.\n\nBut we\u2019re looking ahead to what we can do if you all back this project in force. At $1.25 million, the money will go primarily into making the world bigger, adding more maps, more divergent stories and even more music. \n\nAt $1.5 million, the world gets even bigger. You\u2019ll have more adventures to play, more challenges to deal with, and a greater level of complexity to the entire storyline.  We\u2019ll add more environments, story elements, and characters to make the rich world come alive even more.  We will even be able to bring Wasteland 2 to OS X and Linux! And after $1.5 million the sky is the limit.\nEveryone on the team is incredibly excited about the possibilities this Kickstarter will unlock. Like you, we\u2019ve long dreamed of being able to bring Wasteland back.  If you share that dream, if you\u2019ve always wanted to watch and influence the game design process from start to finish, this is your chance. If you\u2019ve wanted to change the world and get the games you really deserve, then do it by funding this Kickstarter.  The road to Wasteland 2 is there. \nJoin us on what\u2019s going to be a wild ride.\n***A big thank you to our (already) loyal forum users for their help in crafting the Kickstarter rewards.

The game is comprised of 96 playing cards consisting of either a \u2018FRONT\u2019, \u2018MIDDLE\u2019, or \u2018BACK\u2019 portion of 32 particular animals.  Each animal is illustrated across the three cards, and includes a fun fact about that animal and a corresponding \u2018strength\u2019 value ranging from 1-10 (e.g. a mosquito is strength-1, and a grizzly bear is strength-10). \nGameplay occurs as players mix and match \u2018FRONT\u2019, \u2018MIDDLE\u2019, and \u2018BACK\u2019 cards in their hand to create entirely new creatures, and stage attacks against the creatures in other players\u2019 hands.  For example, the \u2018FRONT\u2019 of Octopus (4), the \u2018MIDDLE\u2019 of Hippopotamus (7), and the \u2018BACK\u2019 of Armadillo (1) combine to create OC-POTA-DILLO (12)! \nThe illustrated portions of each card align to create an image of the new creature with a zany new fun fact.  A creature which conquers all other players in a single turn becomes a \u2018Champion\u2019.  Can you be the first to achieve 5 \u2018Champions\u2019?  May the strongest creature win! \n-WHY CREATURES IS AWESOME-\nCREATURES is not a veiled re-boot of existing face card games such as poker or bridge, but a refreshingly new and creative game unlike anything else.  It is a harmonious blend of the simplicity of traditional card games such as Uno or Skip-Bo with the strategy and creativity of more complex card games such as Canasta or Phase 10. \nThe game is fun for many levels, easy to learn, and difficult to master. \nWhen is the right time to attack?  Which creature should defend an oncoming attack?  What if someone holds a *POISON* creature!?  The quirky artwork and jumbled-up animal facts keep players of all ages engaged and amused.  With almost 22,000 possible CREATURE combinations, the gameplay is always fresh with every hand delt!\n-WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES-\nThe pledges YOU make will cover the costs associated with designing and printing the first edition card decks professionally, including tuck boxes, shrink wrap, etc. as well as registering the CREATURES trademark and copyrights.  Did you know it costs $40/month to list a new item on Amazon.com?  This is where your money goes!  We will also be printing CREATURES T-shirts and refrigerator magnets so you can show off your undying support of the game to friends and family.  Any amount we raise in excess of our stated goal will go toward trade show exhibitions, marketing material, additional deck printing, etc. so please continue to support!\n-MORE INFORMATION-\nPlease visit the official CREATURES website at www.CreaturesCardGame.com for more information, images, rules, etc.\nHit us up on Twitter @CreaturesGames!\nThank you for pledging and helping make CREATURES become a reality!

Your kids are probably dead. Your grandkids (if they're alive) are playing video games. Why? Because professional gaming is the biggest sport on earth.\nAround the world, millions of players duke it out in fighters, RTS\u2019s, First Person Shooters and more. To the victors go the spoils: glory, clan contracts and million dollar endorsements. The best young gamers are recruited by elite boarding schools to sharpen their skills. The best of the best go to VGHS: VIDEO GAME HIGH SCHOOL. \nVGHS is a feature-length action/comedy web series (9 episodes, ~10 mins per episode) about best friends, first loves, and landing that perfect head shot. It follows Brian, a young FPS player stuck in a town where he doesn\u2019t belong. His fortunes change when he scores a massive kill against the world\u2019s top amateur player: VGHS senior \u201cThe Law.\u201d\nBrian rockets into the national spotlight and lands an invite into the hallowed halls of VGHS. There his skills will be tested as he fights to fit in with the most talented gamers alive. Along the way he\u2019ll make unlikely friends, fall in love with no-nonsense FPS hot shot, Jenny Matrix, and face powerful enemies \u2013 namely The Law, who vows to destroy Brian for good.\nWill Brian\u2019s dreams end before they\u2019ve even started? Or will he pull it together and become the gamer he was born to be?\nWho is behind VGHS?\nVGHS is co-created by Freddie Wong and Brandon Laatsch and Matt Arnold. In addition to acting as showrunner, Matt is also a writer, along with Will Campos and Brian Firenzi (founder of 5secondfilms.com). It is based on a concept by Will Campos and Chris Pappavaselio.\nFreddie Wong and Brandon Laatsch run http://youtube.com/freddiew, the 7th most subscribed YouTube channel of all time. Collectively their videos have over 450 million views, with over 2 million subscribers tuning in every week to watch their work. Their work has been featured on CNN, BBC, ESPN, and The Huffington Post, and they've worked with actors such as Eliza Dushku, Andy Whitfield, and Kevin Pollack.\nMost recently, they worked with director Jon Favreau for a crossover video for Cowboys and Aliens, and appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live to talk about their work.\nBrian Firenzi is the founder of 5secondfilms.com, a comedy website that has churned out five second short films every single weekday since 2008. 5sf has been featured on \"Tosh.0\" and \"Attack of the Show,\" screened at SxSW and ComiCon, and they've worked with actors such as Peter Stormare and Patton Oswalt.\nMatthew Arnold is a collaborator and business partner with freddiew. After graduating USC, he was an assistant and than associate producer at Disney Interactive Studios for 2.5 years where he worked on nearly a dozen projects that polluted kids minds and emptied parents wallets (nah games are great for kids). Matt left in 2010 to start his own game company and create VGHS. His first iPhone game - an action adventure marble game - is set for release this holiday season. \nWill Campos has been a long-time friend and collaborator. He is a graduate of the USC School of Cinema Screenwriting program, and has the professionalism to make the rest of us feel like children. \nHow is this project funded? What's the funding for?\nMaking a feature-length project can be surprisingly expensive - there are numerous costs involved with doing a project legit, including production insurance, location permits, actor and crew salaries, and legal paperwork. In addition, the scale of the project means we'll have to hire on additional post-production personnel, such as editors and visual effects artists.\nOver the last year and a half of making weekly special effects laden YouTube videos, we've learned to be flexible and resourceful with our budgets. Every cent raised for this project is going into the production, so the more we raise, the bigger we can go with this project.\nAlso to put things in perspective, we're asking for less than 1/1000th of the budget for the upcoming Twilight movie.\nWhy a webseries?\nWe strongly believe the foundations for the future of digitally distributed content will be laid by webseries. We don't see a webseries as a stepping stone to get a feature film project, or a TV deal - a good webseries is an end unto itself. The webseries format is uncharted territory, and we want to explore it.\nWhat's the status of the production?\nVGHS is currently in pre-production. The scripts have all been written. Production is scheduled to start mid-October, with the project finishing early 2012.\nHow can I help?\nBy pledging an amount, you will be eligible to receive rewards exclusive to those pledging through this Kickstarter page.

Turn a fledgling alien race into a vast, powerful empire.  \nEmpires of the Void is an epic, space empire-building game playable in two hours.  The game is for 2 to 4 players and has an intuitive, yet flexible rule system that allows for many different strategies.  Players can win by conquering planets, using diplomacy, researching technology, or focusing on ruling the galactic council.  Feel like ruling every planet you encounter with an iron fist?  Want to outsmart your opponents with sneaky, underhanded maneuvers they don't expect?  Or perhaps you desire superior technology so you can outgun the competition.  It's all possible in the game.\nEmpires of the Void has a heavy emphasis on theme and story.  Each round starts with a random event to enhance the flavor of the setting.  The game comes with seven starting alien races to choose from, each with unique abilities and play styles. There are also fifteen additional neutral aliens to conquer or befriend, each with unique abilities and strengths.  The variable board comes in seven hexagonal pieces, so each game will be a different experience.\nFor further details on the game, please visit these pages:\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98347/empires-of-the-void\nhttp://dicehateme.com/2011/05/space-for-more-an-interview-with-empires-of-the-void-designer-ryan-laukat/\nThe Goal\nAll we need to get this thing launched is your help!  The goal of this project is to pull together enough funding to help cover manufacturing costs.  And to show you how much we appreciate you, we've decided to include an additional starting alien race for all backers, the Pirates of Cidran.  The Pirates are a blast to play- they can use credits to bribe allies to join them, and every time they destroy an enemy ship, they collect credits from scavenging the wreckage.  This starting alien race is limited to this Kickstarter.com campaign and will never be available anywhere else!\nThis is a big game, with lots of components, and we know you won't be disappointed with how much is in the box, or how engaging the game is.\nAt the $50 level, you will receive a copy of the game, free shipping, and the Pirates of Cidran starting alien race.  That is $10 less than suggested retail.  We promise to ship out all backers' rewards before the game will be available in stores, online, or at conventions.  \nThe art is almost completely finished and the game has been tested extensively.  The screws are tightened and the chrome is polished.  Help make our dream a reality!\nNew Race at $25,000!\nWe made it to our goal!  Thank you everyone!  Empires of the Void will be printed.  I'm very excited to announce that a new alien race will be included in EVERY COPY of the game if we reach $25,000.  This race has a completely different feel and play style, and uses additional components.  Tremble at the terrible power of the PARASITES OF SREECH!\nThe Parasites of Sreech not only conquer and befriend neutral aliens, they also INFEST them.  They also have their own ship, the Infestor, a truly terrifying creature to behold.  When the Sreech infest a planet, they have access to that planet's special ability.  They can infest any planet they do not control, including planets controlled by other players, and it is fairly difficult for anyone to remove an infestation.  The ability to infest planets opens up many new strategic possibilities.\nPlease take a look at this video review!  http://boardgamegeek.com/video/11164/empires-of-the-void/dice-tower-reviews-empires-of-the-void\nAll titles approved for Springboard campaigns are vetted by Game Salute.

If you've ever written with one, you know what we're talking about.  If you haven't heard of these pens, check out jetpen's blurb.http://bit.ly/hitecc \nPen Type-A is a stainless steel replacement for the Hi-Tec-C's cheap plastic housing. To us, the Hi-Tec-C cartridges deserve a more durable home.\n\nThe design is minimal, the construction is super solid, and indestructible to protect and cherish these coveted ink cartridges.  It has a dime screw on one end to allow for easy ink cartridge replacement.  Its shaft is a solid smooth surface with no branding, no fancy grip or grooves, and just the right thickness and weight so it feels comfortable in your hand.  The entire piece is milled and turned from a block of 304 stainless steel.  The raw steel finish today is how it\u2019ll look 50 years from now.  This thing will last forever. \nThe pen slides slowly into its sleeve, which doubles as a ruler.  The notches on the ruler are in cm and inches.  An internal lip at the bottom of the sleeve protects the tip from getting shoved in any further than it should. The tiny amount of space between the sleeve and the pen creates an effect like a pneumatic cylinder, so the pen slides in slow and smooth.\n\nWe'd love to share our passion for this pen.\n\nWith your support, we'd like to gather enough pre-orders to cover the tooling costs to get this pen into your hands.  It also makes a great gift, so we've opened up higher pledges for those of you who want more than one.\n\nYour support is greatly appreciated!\nLove, CW&T\nPS.

The Department is meant to be the first tabletop police procedural game that requires no Game Master to play.

The Department is not cyberpunk: it\u2019s Blade Runner meets Law and Order meets I-Robot meets American Gangster meets Mad Men meets The Maltese Falcon and more. \nWhere Wargame and RPG Meet\nThe Department uses the popular Goalsystem, written by Scott Pyle. Building on this proven base, The Department features an innovative, cooperative campaign system where players play scenarios in order to gather a diverse array of evidence points. Players then use these evidence points to acquire warrants, follow up on leads, and finally hunt down the leadership of the fabricant terrorist cell. The campaign constantly challenges players to use their limited investigation resources wisely, as their department\u2019s patience will eventually run out and the players will be thrown off of the case.\nWhile it is meant to be played as a tabletop miniature wargame that requires no game master, The Department can be played without miniatures as a map based tabletop RPG. Our goal is to create a rulebook that allows you to explore the streets of 2060s America your way.\nWhat We Will Produce And When We Will Produce It.\nThe Department will be an approximately 150 page full color soft cover A4 sized book chock full of art, fiction, and a complete ruleset ready to play straight away.\nWe will also be producing a full color PDF as well as a kindle, ebook, and a printer-friendly Pdf version. \nCurrently, production is on schedule and we aim to release The Department in Q1 2012.\nAll contributors will be acknowledged in the print and electronic versions of the game.\nYou can find more information on our official website. www.departmentoffabricantmanagement.com   \nThe Money Side of Things\nWe\u2019re raising Kickstarter funding to cover our creative costs and an initial print run.\nWe are a global team working in three countries, but our printing operations will be done in the UK.

And we never actually reveal what the exterior of the robot looks like.\nOur story unfolds through the eyes of a young woman named Erica Pratch. She\u2019s new to the Maintenance Crew, and joined up because she wanted to travel and be part of something exciting. But the reality of working inside a giant robot warrior isn\u2019t anything like she expected. This is a high-stress job done in the most ridiculous situations possible, where people routinely snap under the pressure. On top of that the pilots of the robot don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, and alien monsters run loose in the service tunnels.\nBut someone has to keep that giant robot functioning. No matter how much back-breaking, soul-crushing, life-threatening work it might take.\nGiant Robot Warrior Maintenance Crew is a three-issue mini-series that should appeal to fans of Spaceballs, Aliens, the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and of course giant robot stories. It\u2019s an idea we\u2019ve been itching to get made for several years now, and the time has finally come to make it happen.\nThough while we are working with a small publisher, we still need help to tackle production costs and marketing.

Hold on a sec'...I see you looking at those numbers up there in the corner and hovering over your browser's BACK button. You're thinking \"It's all over and they don't need me, now.\"\nWell, you're wrong, Spaceman!\nYes, we made the $5,000 goal to guarantee that Alien Frontiers will be printed. But the dirty little secret is that $5,000 is only about a third of the actual printing costs and I'm draining my savings to make up the additional $10,000\nYIKES!\nYa, that's a chunk-o-change...so every new backer we get between now and June 26th will help a lot to defray those additional costs. If you sign up as a $50 Backer right now you'll get the game when it's printed (we're hoping for August or September) and some spiffy bonuses that won't be available after June 26th. And if you REALLY want some sweet rewards, just look at the higher backer packages.\nOK, that's the pitch and the plea...now, jump in and see what it's all about. An Overview of The Game\nAlien Frontiers is a board game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.\nThe game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system\u2019s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the spaceships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.\nWinning the game requires a mix of strategy and luck as you assign your fleet, integrate alien technology and territory bonuses into your approach, and block your opponents from implementing their own plans. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier? A Few Words from the Game Designer\nMy name is Tory Niemann and I\u2019ve been designing games (with varying levels of success) since I could play them. I came up with the basic framework of Alien Frontiers in early 2009. Even from those first primordial play tests with the wife, I could see I had something good. Unlike many games I\u2019d made, it was fun. It wasn't finished, but it was fun.\nPerhaps the most unusual influence on this project was the game Kingsburg by Luca Iennaco and Andrea Chiarvesio. The influence was not from the game itself (I hadn\u2019t played it at the time), but a brief review of the game I read online. From that synopsis, I developed an idea of how the game was probably played, and I thought it sounded interesting. Later I found that my concept of this game was totally wrong because the description I\u2019d read was misleading, but the game I\u2019d thought it was still intrigued me. Another influence was the dice game To Court the King by Tom Lehmann. I really enjoyed the concept of rolling dice and then changing them in the most creative way to suit your purpose, but I wanted a deeper game than To Court the King provided. I combined these two influences to create a new, unique game.\nOriginally, the game was called Race for Mars, or, as my wife called it, \"that Mars game.\" It was printed on two pieces of cardstock and used cubes of sculpting clay for resource tokens. After several revisions and reworkings, I shifted the theme of the game to colonizing of an extrasolar planet and named it Alien Frontiers.\nNow, after extensive play testing, dozens of changes, adjustments, and tweaks, Alien Frontiers is on the verge of being a REAL game. Most importantly to me, it\u2019s a game that I really enjoy playing and others love too. This is an exciting time for me as the designer and I can't wait to get Alien Frontiers out to the public. A Few Words from the Publisher Hi...I'm David MacKenzie and Clever Mojo Games is my tiny little game design company. As a sole proprietorship, CMG has very limited funds, nevertheless, I am committed to publishing Alien Frontiers this year and I'm already in talks with a couple of manufacturers. This is where you and Kickstarter can help. The funds you pledge will go directly to offset the printing costs for a run of 1,000 copies of Tory's amazing game. Your support will insure than Alien Frontiers is published and that Clever Mojo Games is around to produce more quality games in the future.\nBy supporting the Alien Frontiers project with your pledge of just $50 you are pre-ordering the game (retail value $40.00) plus you'll receive four spiffy rocket tokens for the score track and a Kickstarter-Exclusive \"Space Crane\" Alien Tech Card. When the games are printed and delivered I will ship your copy to you anywhere in the world at no additional charge. You're definitely getting your money's worth at this sponsorship level! (Limit 700 Sponsors)\nAt the $100 level you'll get the game, rockets and card from the $50 level plus your choice of a second copy of Alien Frontiers or a copy of Ogre Castle, a fun family game that my brother, Fred, and I designed and self-published in 2009. Two games...rockets...exclusive Alien Tech card...and shipping included!! (Limit 100 Sponsors)\nAt the $200 level you'll get the game, rockets and card from the $50 level plus a sweet photo book of Alien Frontiers art showing early concept sketches and finished pieces...and it's signed by the artist, Mark Maxwell, and by the game designer, Tory Niemann, too. As always, shipping anywhere in the world is included!!! (Limit 20 Sponsors)\nAt the $300 sponsorship level you'll get the game, rockets and card from the $50 level plus a high quality giclee print of the Alien Artifact floating majestically over the barren alien planet. This 15\"x20\" print is signed by the artist, Mark Maxwell, and is suitable for framing. Worldwide shipping and insurance included!! (Limit 10 Sponsors)\nFinally, at the $500 sponsorship level you'll get the game, rockets and card from the $50 level plus an original piece of art created for the game's Alien Tech Cards. These 8x10 acrylic paintings are one of a kind originals signed by the artist, Mark Maxwell, and ready for you to frame and proudly display in your game room. We're only making five pieces available and they'll be awarded on a first-pledge-first-choice basis. The pieces are: Plasma Cannon, Stasis Beam, Alien Monument, Temporal Warper, and Orbital Teleporter. Yup, worldwide shipping and insurance included!! (Limit 5 Sponsors) Every little bit you pledge helps support the game. If you're not ready or able to pledge for a pre-order, your $10 pledge will earn you a certificate of thanks signed by the game designer, Tory Niemann, and you'll get the rocket scoring tokens, too. And remember, every person who pledges will have access to the \"Backers Only\" updates here on Kickstarter. Spread the word to all your friends and co-workers, on all your social networks, at your gaming groups and church gatherings. Alien Frontiers is coming in 2010 and with your help it will be a big success.
