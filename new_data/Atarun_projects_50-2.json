Their origins long ago lost to time, the valuable and seemingly-magical relics within are an even greater threat to all involved.\nBlood Type: O\nLikes: Exploration, cheese, frogs\nDislikes: Being lectured \nGood-natured and energetic, Mirai tries to see the best in everyone. She arrived in New Riverstone a year ago with no memory of her past life. \nAfter finding the Flowstone in an ancient ruin, she can manifest Flow into physical matter, allowing her to build and modify existing structures, so long as she has enough resources. \nAs her story unfolds, she will learn that even with her newfound power, not everything broken in life can be easily put back together.\n\u201cNew Riverstone is our home. With everyone\u2019s help, I\u2019ll build a village we\u2019ll all be proud of!\u201d\nBlood Type: B\nLikes: Cinnamon rolls, Captain Crimm\nDislikes: Bullies\nA young pirate. While hot-headed and stubborn, she is fiercely loyal to those she cares about. \nTreated as disposable deadweight by some of her crew mates, Vivian has been bullied into activities that their captain would not approve of. \nThrough meeting Mirai, Vivian finds the courage to stand up for herself, even if she must stand alone.\n\u201cI won\u2019t be part of a crew that tries to justify robbing from innocent people. I'm better than this. We're better than this.\u201d\nBlood Type: A\nLikes: Word puzzles, being included\nDislikes: Show-offs, muscleheads\nThe military outcast. Marcus has a low-ranked position in the Republic of Byzankar's naval fleet. \nSoft-spoken and reserved, he thinks first before taking action. He joined the military not out of love for country, but for his fascination with Relics, ancient technology excavated from ruins around the world. \nDistrusted by most of New Riverstone, Vivian of all people will reach out to him and help him realize that some risks are worth taking.\n\u201cThese villagers did nothing wrong. There\u2019s no reason to take things this far.\u201d\nBlood Type: O\nLikes: Poetry; hot tea\nDislikes: Anyone threatening his crew\nThe infamous pirate king. As the Scarlet Tusk captain, Borras Crimm is the most wanted man in the world. \nStrong-willed and decisive, he takes any and all measures necessary to secure his crew of people displaced by conflicts around the world. After a Byzankar ambush, his ship finds its way to Ocean's End. \nNormally not one to attack innocents despite his reputation, his desperation to save his starving crew sends him on a collision course with Mirai and New Riverstone.\n\u201cA captain\u2019s first duty is to their crew. Always.\u201d\nBlood Type: AB\nLikes: Training, collecting swords\nDislikes: Beggars, laziness\nThe rising star of the Byzankar fleet. Driven, calculating, and with a strong sense of justice, Cerule quickly reached the rank of Commander at a young age. \nLittle is known about her, besides a reputation as a fierce naval combatant. When she finally corners the elusive Borras Crimm at his most vulnerable, a deeply-sown seed of vengeance begins to bloom, threatening to consume her.\n\u201cI won\u2019t permit anyone to leave this island until I have Borras Crimm locked away in chains.\u201d\nThe town of New Riverstone\nLocated on the largest island of Ocean's End, this young town is comprised of war refugees, explorers, and those curious enough to live on the edge of civilization. Mirai has made her home here for the past year as she tries to recover her memories.\n\nThe Islands of Ocean's End\nWith sandy beaches, wooded foothills, rocky mountains, and extensive caves, Ocean's End is an explorer's paradise. \nMirai's curiosity leads through every nook and cranny of the islands as she gathers materials, evades pursuers, and looks for a way to save New Riverstone.\n\nA long-forgotten civilization\nScattered around the world are mysterious ruins of impossibly advanced technology. \nSome people revere the ruins, some plunder their secrets for their own purposes, but no one knows who the \"Panganeans\" were, or why the facilities were created. After Mirai finds the flowstone, it sets events in motion that reveals how closely she is tied to the ruins, and leaves her with a difficult choice...\n\nThe Harbinger\nThe flagship of the Mighty Byzankar Navy,  this naval destroyer is the pinnacle of Panganean-derived tech and shipbuilding prowess.  On board is a mysterious passenger, guarded by the legendary Commander Cerule, the youngest to ever earn the title. Under her guidance, the Harbinger has cornered the pirate ship \"The Scarlet Tusk\" and is prepared to use it's incredible power to end the pirate king once and for all. \nFlowstone Saga has real-time combat where your party faces off against up to 3 monsters at once. While monsters and your allies take turns attacking and using special abilities, the main character - Mirai - controls the flow of battle on the puzzle board.\nBy clearing lines, you'll deal damage to a monster with a regular attack. Clear multiple lines at once for much more powerful blows. \nSome monsters may use charge attacks which can be interrupted with your attacks. This makes it important to weigh the state of your puzzle board with the battle scenario. Is it worth it to clear some lines to defend against a special attack, or would it be better to continue to build up blocks for an even stronger counter?\nWe want Flowstone Saga to be enjoyable by everyone, not just puzzle experts. So, in addition to game difficulty options, we've created a feature called \"Hold Mode\", which is selectable before starting a new game, and anytime in-game.  \n\nIn \"Hold Mode\", battles are no longer real-time. You still move pieces around, and have access to all the same powers, but there is no 'gravity' pulling pieces down,  and enemies will not move or act in real-time. \n\nYou have total freedom to plan your next move carefully. Then, once you lock a piece in (and only then), the enemy turn gauges will increase slightly.  \n\nEventually, enemies will act, but it will be on your terms, based on the number of moves you've made - and not the passage of real time.  This way, you still have the strategy elements of where to put pieces (and make combos, use powers, clear enemy blocks, etc) and deal with enemies, but with absolutely no time pressure at all!\n\nYou can try \"Hold Mode\" for yourself in the public builds available above, or watch a quick demo in the video below!\nPLAY\n\nThere will be over 100 different foes to defeat over the course of the journey, from the adorable Beewis, to fearsome Thunder Komodos and beyond!\nJust some of the many foes you will face in your adventure\nIn addition to regular attacks, most monsters have attacks that will interact with your puzzle board. Some will drop blocks that will slowly damage Mirai until they are cleared, while others will replace her current piece with something trickier to manage. \n\nThere are dozens of different monster attacks, and each will require it's own strategy to overcome.\n\nMirai can use her powers to create or repair structures. To do this, you must fill in the overall shape of flow energy with set pieces. \nMirai creates a ladder to escape danger\nCreate objects to move to a new area, or collect an out-of-reach treasure.\nForce open locked doors, or hack computer terminals.\nRepair broken walls or barriers to defend against invaders.\nAlso scattered throughout the islands are optional ruins that Mirai can repair for bonus rewards. Maybe something special will happen if all of them are repaired...\nThough these puzzles start out easy, some are quite tricky... and equally satisfying to solve! \n\nChoose from several dozen pieces to find your perfect combination\nUnlike other falling block games, you can choose what pieces are in your \"bag\" using the power of the Flowstone. You must have 8 different pieces, which have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nSmall pieces offer flexibility and options - they fit in almost any gap!\nLarge pieces grant speed to fill the board quickly, allowing for frequent power attacks\nAlmost every piece available has link crystals that multiply damage when combined carefully. Some difficult pieces are extra powerful, so if you can use them effectively, you will reap the rewards.\nCreating a balanced loadout to suit your individual style will be the key to victory in battle!\n\n Equipment found or purchased can be enhanced with the \"Dreamcaster\", an ancient relic that allows entry into the item itself, known as an \"Item Dream\".  \nEach Item Dream is a mini-roguelike, with a small but challenging randomly-generated dungeon. The rules are simple: Defeat the boss to remove impurities, and the item grows stronger. Fail and be forcefully ejected back into the real world.\nSome gear that may appear weak initially have great power hidden within, and will require full purification to show their true form. \n\nMirai starts out with only \"Flow\" blocks, which deal physical damage.\nThroughout the game, she will harness other elements to open up new strategies.\n Fire blocks deal damage-over-time, and are a better use of small line clears\n Ice blocks freeze an enemies and prevent them from acting\n Lightning blocks have damage that scale even higher with bigger clears, and hit all enemies at once\n\nAlso, various barriers exist in the world that call for certain elements...\nNew Riverstone is always growing, and with Mirai's new powers, creating new structures is a snap...or is it?\nVillagers will have a request, and let you know what materials they need for the building to be built.\nMonsters throughout the island have stolen key items in building certain structures. Mirai will need to find the monsters and reclaim the goods!\nOnce everything has been collected, the structure can be built.\nEnjoy deliciously prepared food from Nando, once the campfire has been completed.\nBuilding some structures will provide new services or buffs to Mirai and her party on their adventure.\nSome buildings can be further upgraded to provide stronger bonuses and perks.\n\nTo help get the raw materials she will need to build the town, Mirai can team up with the happy-go-lucky but absentminded Miner, Hagan.\nThis game mode is a race against the clock, as Hagan will throw various materials onto the puzzle field. Any material block Mirai clears, she collects! \nWhen the time is up, Hagan is too sleepy to continue, and it's time to return back to town. Maybe if you can pass him a few coins, he'll extend the timer a bit longer.\nThere are many different areas to mine, each with it's own collection of resources.\nOccasionally, Hagan will find an old treasure chest filled with gold. Clearing this scores Mirai a quick payday!\n\nWhen Mirai builds the garden, it's magic somehow attracts the attention of some nearby Spirit Frogs; friendly ghosts of a legendary troupe of adventuring amphibians. \nBrave adventurer~! I lend you my power!\nFeeding them some delicious food from the garden causes them to bond with Mirai, giving her the ability to select a patron frog, who will instill in her it's Job Class abilities from it's former life.\nThe Flow-infused soil grows fresh crops remarkably fast!\nFreely swap Frog Spirits in the status screen to be able to use their abilities, based on classic Tangledeep job classes such as Brigand, Edge Thane, Paladin, and more!\nGiving Eric seeds and soil found while adventuring, or from collecting with Hagan will grow more food in the garden.\nFeed the Sprit Frogs the collected food to level them up and learn more powerful skills and perks!\nAs you level up the spirit frogs, the job buffs they provide get stronger!\n\nLater in the game, you can test your skills against mighty opponents. Start as an unranked fighter, and smash your way to the top, to claim the GrandMaster title!\nMirai and her friends will start in the Bronze league and fight their way up!\nThere are 4 fights per tier, with a final encounter to test your mettle. Win to be promoted to the next division!  \nThere will be familiar foes in the arena, but some challengers are found nowhere else. The most difficult opponents in the game await you in here.\n\nAs New Riverstone grows, Mirai helps construct a beautiful outdoor bistro! Once this is built, she can have lunch chats with the villagers to learn more about their backstories and personalities. \n\nYou can have a friend come along and endow the party with a unique buff\nFrom Hagan's ability to find extra items after battles, to Alasdair's defensive bonus, each buff is useful!\nAs you level up your friendship with each friend, buffs grow in strength, and can  further enhance your favorite strategy.\nThough many ruins are buried beneath the surface, one stands alone as the most mysterious and labyrinthine. Tangledeep is a dungeon of constantly shifting caverns and underground jungles, with fragments of civilizations nestled within. It has proven impossible to map, as its layout is constantly in flux. \n\nWhat lies at the bottom? It's up to you to find out.\n\nLike Item Dreams, Tangledeep is a roguelike mode, with randomly-generated dungeon floors. While Item dreams are smaller, with only a few floors, Tangledeep is much more extensive, and is considered endgame or post-game content\nMirai starts on the first floor with basic shapes and no gear. Defeat increasingly-difficult enemies as you explore, obtaining new pieces, equipment, perks, and more.\nEarn special items that can be brought to the main adventure, as well as special currency to buy cosmetic items and town upgrades.\n\nFlowstone Saga's soundtrack has the soul of a classic JRPG soundtrack of the 16 and 32bit eras, with the memorable melodies that classic games are known for, brought to life with modern production and performances that the consoles of yesterday could never do. \n\nThe music of a great RPG always lives on in our minds long after the credits have rolled, so we're working hard to ensure the Flowstone Saga soundtrack is perfect.\n\nFrom day 1, we've shared progress, ideas, and plans publicly and transparently, and we plan on maintaining that relationship with the community throughout development. \nWe have a dedicated channel on Discord: #Flowstone_saga.\n\nTalk to other players, give feedback, report bugs, or share memes... come on in! \n\nWe're there daily and are happy to talk shop, take suggestions, and give updates on what we're working on. Talk to us and other players about your experiences with the game! Share strategies, tricks, or awesome combos you've pulled off.\n\nIn 2017, we ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for our first title, Tangledeep, with a similar purpose: raising money to further polish art and music. We think this same approach makes sense for Flowstone Saga. While we have invested our own time and money heavily into the game, there is always more we can do to improve the game's presentation, for example:\nMore character portraits with additional moods or expressions\nProfessional mixing and mastering of the soundtrack\nAdditional live musicians to make some tracks sound even better\nA greater variety of particle FX and animations \nMore sound effects to accompany the wide range of abilities and events\nAdditional flavor text and character conversations\n... and much more!\n\nWe do not need money to finish the core game. We're doing that no matter what! We're fortunate to be in the position where income from our previous game and income from other projects is enough for us to fund the core development of Flowstone Saga.\n\nThat means no risk that we'll accidentally burn through our Kickstarter funding and be unable to finish. Instead, this funding will all go to making the game tangibly, materially better-looking and sounding. What's not to love about that?\nWe've come a long way, but we have a ways to go! Here is a look at the current state of the game. Some of these bars fill up faster than others, but we are committed to transparency in what we are working on, and keeping the community updated on progress.\nBesides a Kickstarter-exclusive wallpaper, digital copies of the game, soundtrack, and artbook, we've got lots of tempting custom rewards! \n\nGrand Champion Explorer\nGive us a name, and we put it in the game. It could be you, your pet, or your D&D character. Names could be used in special items, locations, NPCs, dungeons, monsters, etc. \nPuzzle Crafter\nPut on your puzzlin' cap! Work with us to turn your puzzle ideas into reality. Show off your cleverness by making an object outline, or make players curse your name by making something brutally difficult. The choice is yours!\n\nArena Master\n\nThe Arena is an endgame gauntlet filled with the baddest bosses around, and you can add your creation to the list of fearsome fighters. It could be a crazy creature, your pet, sky's the limit!\nWork with us to design stats, special attacks, and battle strategy!\n\nHero of Legend \nEach job class in the game will have an ultimate armor that will be obtained after a quest chain. Name and give a backstory of the former owner of one of these elite sets of gear!\nWeapon Master\nThe most powerful weapons are guarded jealously by equally powerful monsters. Work with our artists and designers to create a relic weapon that is one of the most powerful in the game\nWork with us to create a suitably-powerful guardian that must be battled to earn this weapon.\nGeomancer Explorer\nTurn your MSpaint sketch into a beautiful vista!\nWork with us to create your own special place, named after you. Using a sketch and/or description provided, we will build the area, fill it with monsters and treasures, plus a unique landmark that will only appear in your area.\n\nOC-do-not-steal Explorer\nThere are all kinds of beings in our world; bring your very own to life with this reward!\nWork with us to get  your character design in the game with custom sprites, portraits, and a short backstory for the players to learn about as a side quest.\nYour character will be able to join Mirai's party as a friend, giving them a unique buff.\n\nThe adorable plush Goldfrogs\nSmall and soft, these cute croakers are handmade by DragonAvenger Crafts and designed by Flea Circus Designs. They measure 3\" tall, 3.5\" wide, are made of soft minky fabric and feature shiny golden coin embroidery.\nOn May 16th, we reached 100% funding with 3+ weeks left to go! Here are our stretch goals to help keep the hype going and add more cool stuff to the game.\n\n$25,000: Sprig Salon - ACHIEVED!\nMirai's pet fox will be more stylish than ever! Unlock accessories, animations, and palette swaps to customize this cute fella, who is always be visible by your side. And yes, you'll be able to pet him, too.\n\n$30,000: 2nd Player Assist - ACHIEVED!\nA buddy on your couch can help out on the battlefield by providing helpful bonuses, and thwacking enemies! By connecting a second controller, your friend will get their own Mana gauge to use powers and give you an extra edge in difficult battles. \n\n$35,000: Town Planner\nTransform New Riverstone into the town you want it to be! Find or purchase decor items to spruce up and enhance the town, from natural objects like bushes, trees, and flower patches, to statues, fountains, birdhouses, and more. Place each item virtually anywhere in town with free positioning!\n\n$40,000: Battle Jukebox + 6 New Themes\nHot-blooded music for fighting! We'll add six brand-new battle themes to the game, plus a \"Battle Jukebox\" that will play random themes with every encounter.\nThese new tracks will be composed by lead designer & composer Andrew \"OA\" Luers, lead programmer and Tangledeep composer Andrew \"zircon\" Aversa, renowned electronic & soundtrack artist Jimmy \"Big Giant Circles\" Hinson, and epic orchestral composer & OST mixer Nabeel Ansari.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping a game often involves unexpected bugs and issues which can throw a wrench into even the best plans and schedules. This is especially true when porting to Nintendo Switch, which involves approvals and testing that we have limited control over.\n\nWe have made what we think are reasonable delivery estimations for v1.0 of the game, based on our experience successfully shipping \"Tangledeep\" on PC in 2018 and on Switch in 2019. We also plan on launching in Early Access before the v1.0 release in order to further polish the game based on player feedback.\n\nWe have put over two years into Flowstone Saga already, along with a significant amount of our own money. There is very little we can imagine that would prevent us from finishing and releasing the game, especially given our track record with Tangledeep.\n\nThat said, if any issues arise that might delay the game beyond our planned date, we will communicate this well in advance to backers. The most likely issues would relate to Nintendo Switch approvals, or waiting on third-parties such as localization teams.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Katie's Tip Jar", "descp": "Thank you for supporting Flowstone Saga!

The one people whisper about. The one that has gone unlived in for years. Sometimes a few hearty souls creep in, it is said, to see what treasures or secrets they can find. Most find nothing\u2014just an empty old house. Some return shaken. A few don\u2019t return at all.\nYou\u2019ve seen this house before. If not in this city, then in some other. You\u2019ve heard the rumors\u2014and if you haven\u2019t, well, someday they\u2019ll find you.\nWhat happens to a house when it sits alone for so many long years? What jealousies and hatreds does it quietly nurture? What whispers echo through its empty hallways? What waits, crouched within its dark rooms, hungering for the return of life?\nFor you.\nThe Darkest House is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) product built from the ground up for online play, with unique features that take advantage of the online environment for an awesome experience. It's compatible with the game you're playing now. In fact, it's made for it! That\u2019s because The Darkest House derives its horror from the bonds, backstories, ideals, loves, and fears your existing characters bring into it. Experiencing it will add depth to your campaign, your party, and your characters\u2014those who come out alive!\nCross the threshold. Explore The Darkest House. The experience will change and challenge your PCs, their party, and your gaming group. And you won't have to wait long: You'll  have everything you need to bring The Darkest House to your campaign in May (with extras and exclusives to follow).\nScroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House!\nThe Darkest House is a digital product designed specifically to the needs of running and playing games online\u2014and built to take maximum advantage of that mode of play. Think of it like an RPG book reimagined to make the most of the online environment. Every image and map is conveniently shareable and downloadable. Each encounter is formatted to your screen, giving you everything you need in a single view. Text for sharing with the players is easily copied with a single click. A rich network of hyperlinks makes navigation simple and intuitive. The Darkest House is as easy on the GM as the house itself is challenging to the PCs.\nUse The Darkest House in conjunction with your preferred online TTRPG platform: run your game on Zoom or Discord, or use a virtual tabletop (VTT) like Roll20 or Astral. Only the GM needs a copy of The Darkest House\u2014like a conventional RPG product, it gives the GM the information, resources, and tools to run the game, plus loads of handouts, images, and other sharable items to distribute, as appropriate, to the players.\nThe Darkest House consists of:\nThe downloadable product, containing the many dozens of rooms of the house itself. This is what the GM will primarily use during play. There\u2019s enough content for many visits to the house, and dozens of hours of play\u2014and through stretch goals the house continues to grow!\n The Darkest House: Secrets of the House in PDF, a GM's guide detailing the House's background, conversion rules, and the House Rules set you'll use as your PCs explore, and try to escape from, the Darkest House.\n The Darkest House Player's Guide in PDF, which gives players the character conversion rules and everything they need to explore (and try to escape from) the Darkest House.\nTo use The Darkest House, the GM will need a desktop or laptop computer running macOS or Windows and a broadband internet connection. Scroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House.\nHow It Works\nAlthough The Darkest House is a completely new type of product, you'll use it in basically the same way you use a typical RPG book or PDF\u2014it's just easier and has a lot more features for online play. You'll still use a VTT or videoconference platform (such as Roll20 or Zoom) to run your game. Your players won't access The Darkest House app itself\u2014like a physical adventure book, it's just for the GM. (You will share The Darkest House Player's Guide PDF, and loads of handouts, maps, and images with them, though.)\nHere's an example: Charles normally runs his games using Zoom for audio and video, and Slack for text messaging, sharing JPGs of handouts, and rolling dice. In addition, he has his game books and notes open on his desk beside him, or PDFs and other files open on his computer. When running The Darkest House, he'll use Zoom and Slack the same way, and keep The Darkest House app open on his computer in place of all those books or PDFs. He can share maps, images, and text with just a click or two, pasting them into his Slack channel as the PCs encounter new rooms, creatures, and clues.\nLaTia runs her games on Roll20. The Darkest House works the same way in that environment, with one additional advantage: LaTia can set up her encounters in advance, downloading the maps and resources before the game starts and setting them up within Roll20.\nTry It!\nWant to see how it works? Check out the preview of The Darkest House now for a look at a few of the rooms and features. Download it for either macOS or Windows (below). Open it, have a look at the intro page, and explore as you see fit\u2014or take this little tour:\nClick Explore The Darkest House Now on the right side of the intro page and you'll find yourself in the Boundless Room, just one example of the House's many, many rooms.\nSee the words Pried Up Floorboards on the map? Click them, and the description will open to the right.\nSome items aren't tagged on the map. Click The Giggling Ghost at the bottom right of the screen.\nUnder the first set of boxed text, and click the Copy Text button. Return to this Kickstarter, go into the comments, and paste. That's how easy it is to copy and paste info for the players. Features like these make the most of the online environment\u2014making it an advantage instead of an impediment!\nYou can also share images and maps just as easily. Go to The Family Portrait and click Download under the handout to download the image, or \"Copy Link\" to paste the link into a chat or browser window to share it that way. You can do the same with the room map and main illustration.\nThe portrait holds the secret to escaping this particular room. Click the link to the Interior Courtyard to continue your exploration of the House.\nContinue to explore to discover the many ways The Darkest House stands apart from conventional RPG products. This preview of the app is not final and only demonstrates a small portion of The Darkest House. The final product may differ slightly.\nThat old house that everyone whispers about. That apartment at the end of the hall where no tenant ever stays for long. That strange unit in the station quarters sector, where everything seems a bit off. These are among the many entrances to the Darkest House.\nLike an invasive vine or a creeping shadow, the Darkest House insinuates itself into any universe. It is a malignant and primal force, unconcerned with the specifics of the worlds it seeps into. The Darkest House exists in our world\u2014in your world\u2014in any world. Wherever there is hunger, the Darkest House can gain a foothold. It is perfectly happy to take root in your campaign.\nOr campaigns. The house draws from the many worlds it touches. It need not pull all its victims from the same setting. Imagine an experience that gathers your favorite characters from different campaigns to work together to survive its horrors. As a product specially designed for online play, scattered gaming groups can come back together for a unique reunion experience.\nThe Darkest House\u2019s effect on character development and backstory makes it really shine when introduced to existing characters and campaigns. It will influence the quality of play for long after the characters have escaped it. \nInject the Darkest House into your ongoing campaign as a horror interlude or as a recurring encounter. It works as a standalone one-shot, but there\u2019s far more to the house than that. With many dozens of rooms (and growing, through stretch goals) adding up to 30-50 hours of game play, PCs who escape the house might stumble upon it later, seek it out to further plumb its mysteries, or find themselves drawn into it again to free themselves and their world of its darkness.\nThe house has many aspects, and there will always be more to discover.\nThe House System\nThe Darkest House isn't just compatible with the game you\u2019re already playing\u2014it was made for it! Within The Darkest House, you\u2019ll use the House System. You\u2019ll quickly and easily convert your existing characters (it takes about five minutes) and use those stats while in The Darkest House. Once the PCs emerge, your players will return to their regular setting using their regular character sheets. The House System is a sort of RPG Rosetta Stone, allowing easy translation into and out of any game system\u2014and even letting you bring characters from different games together.\nThe House System is tailored for tension and terror. With each die roll, the players roll the House Die, which might indicate that the house itself takes an action. Players can call upon the essence of the house while they're within it to turn a failure into a success, but every time they do so they accumulate personal Doom. Escaping the house with the weight of such Doom on their shoulders, characters may find themselves scarred, cursed, or haunted in all manner of disturbing ways, carrying remnants of their experience back into their home campaigns long after they've left.\nIt's possible to launch a campaign centered around the Darkest House. But that's not what the house wants. It is strongest when it reaches into an ongoing campaign to test and challenge existing characters. That\u2019s because events in the Darkest House will change characters and alter the campaign setting. The house gets its metaphorical claws into those that cross its threshold, and the house itself changes based on who those characters are, who they have loved, who they have hated, and where they have been. Characters who explore the house and make it back out are never quite the same.\nWant even deeper mysteries? More secrets? More dangers? The Devoured Halls is a separate portion of the Darkest House, with its own rooms, its own secret entrance and exit, and its own mysteries to uncover. Within this section of the house, characters might discover that perhaps the house isn't fully in control of itself\u2026 the house itself might be broken. While The Darkest House is a complete package, The Devoured Halls adds its own flavor and offers its own experience in keeping with the rest of the house. It fits in seamlessly and offers additional depth and an entirely new mini story for characters to investigate. \nThe Devoured Halls backer level includes the complete Darkest House plus the additional content in the Devoured Halls\u2014a Kickstarter exclusive available only through this campaign. Backing at this level has even more exclusive benefits\u2014you also get:\nMonte Cook's secret tour of the Darkest House: In the style of a director's commentary track, Monte takes you on a video tour of the House covering his favorite rooms. He delves into their genesis and inspiration, gives you insights into the lore behind them, and talks about how he's used them in his own games.\nThe Darkest House digital art book: The Darkest House contains dozens and dozens of illustrations, all as mysterious as they are beautiful. The Art of The Darkest House presents all of them\u2014including illustrations from the Devoured Halls\u2014in beautiful detail. Annotations by Monte and Art Director Bear Weiter accompany many of the illustrations, and several also include details or alternate versions calling out their secrets and hidden features.\nMonte Cook has designed many RPGs over his 30+ year career, including Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, the Cypher System, Numenera, and Invisible Sun. He wanted to share why he he was inspired to create The Darkest House, and what design decisions he made. Check out his insights below.\nI'm Monte Cook, and I created and designed the Darkest House. I've been using the essence of it in various campaigns for years, and I thought I'd take a moment to describe why I designed it the way I have, and hopefully why you'll find it intriguing and interesting as well.\nWhy Focus on Online Gaming?\nAt Monte Cook Games, we're spread out all across the continent. We've been regularly playing RPGs on Zoom or Roll20 since well before the pandemic, as of course many gamers have. In the 21st Century, gaming online has become a standard feature of tabletop games, and the last year or so has accelerated that aspect of running and playing games to an incredible degree. Gaming online has its own challenges, but it has its own strengths as well. As a designer, I've been pondering how to not just focus on the needs of online play, but to in fact embrace online play, bringing the aspects of gaming that it does particularly well to the fore. The ability to share art, to share text, and to send individual players direct messages are just some of the things that The Darkest House not just enables but shines a spotlight upon. Meanwhile, the difficulties of online gaming, such as managing lots of information, maintaining a mood, and dealing with cumbersome mechanics are all facets of the experience that the Darkest House eases.\nWhy Focus on Cross-System Play?\nOne of the things that's been true of a lot of us over the last year is a desire to reconnect with old pals or faraway friends. If your primary means of socializing is a video conference, people a thousand miles away are no farther away than those up the street. Still, talking to your friends through a computer screen can sometimes be hard. With all the additional barriers that online gaming can create, why should game systems add another?\nThe Darkest House offers an easy way to quickly convert the essence of any character from any system into a simple but interesting character who operates within the house's own, specific rules, tailored to the experiences within. My dream is that people will use The Darkest House as an excuse to rekindle that lapsed campaign with their old gaming group separated by time and distance, regardless of what system was being used. Or, perhaps even more exciting, the GM who's got a selection of friends who never regularly game together and use different systems can take their existing characters, temporarily convert them to the House System, and all go on an exciting and challenging (or horrifying) adventure together.\nI believe that RPGs bring people together, and I hope that The Darkest House brings people together who might not otherwise get to easily enjoy each other's company. (And what better way to rekindle old bonds than in absolute terror?) \nWhy a Haunted House?\nInspired by games like Kitty Horrowshow's Anatomy, books like Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, and films like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, I realized that the horror genre and haunted houses in particular offer unique opportunities to shine a light on characters, and RPGs are all about characters. I wanted to create an adventure that would deepen the characters even as it put them through their paces.\nWhen PCs enter the Darkest House, they'll find far more than just a haunted house. It is a crucible of sorts, where their mettle and their minds will be tested. Those who fall short will suffer heavy consequences. Those who can hold their own, however, emerge more deeply developed with a greater insight into their world, their companions, and most of all themselves. The Darkest House forces players to think about their characters' deepest fears, dreams, their families, and their faith in their friends. Encounters are designed to focus less on damage dealt or resources used and more on the personalities, past experiences, and fundamental truths of a character. And if a character is lacking any of those, the Darkest House will enable the GM and players to work together to create them, or flesh them out, as needed.\nIf you've read this far, you've very likely picked up on the fact that within the Darkest House, it's the house itself that is the enemy. I have long had a fascination with fictional places with a mind or an essence all their own. And when that essence evolves over a long period of loneliness, neglect, and exposure to darkness and suffering, it makes for a truly unique \"villain\" far different than any ghost, specter, or demon could ever hope to be. And if that location, that house, grows and seeps in both space and time, devouring the very locations and loved ones important to those that cross its doorstep, well... I don't want to get into spoiler territory. Let's just say, if nothing else, The Darkest House certainly offers some unique experiences that will create stories your players will be talking about for years to come.\nIf you choose any physical add-on items, please check our Kickstarter Redemption page for information on reward redemption and shipping costs.\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the nineteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

Serenity. The Millennium Falcon. \nYou can\u2019t have a good space story without an iconic spaceship. Of course, more often than not, the heroes of the story aren\u2019t flying some shiny new cruiser. Those are for the wealthy, the elites\u2014not our lovable scoundrels. No, they fly the bucket of bolts\u2014the outworn, patched-up junker held together with hope, prayers and duct tape.\nThe eponymous 'bucket of bolts'\nThese ships weren\u2019t always hunks of junk though\u2014they have long and storied histories, and might even have been respectable vessels at some point. We only ever see a slice of that story though, a single captain and their motley crew. \nThis game flips the perspective.  \n\nThe Game.\nBucket of Bolts is a hack of Artefact, my game from last year's ZineQuest. Instead of creating a magical item, this time you'll be telling the story of a single spaceship. You\u2019ll create a brand new freighter, fresh off the manufacturing line, and explore its history through each of the people who captain it. Your ship will change as the decades pass - new names, new parts, fresh paint, fresh starts - until your story draws to a close.\nYou\u2019ll choose your Captains, bringing them to life with names and details, and create stories of their time with your ship using prompts and tables. When you\u2018re ready to move on, you\u2019ll choose a Fate for your ship. Maybe it\u2019s traded away fairly, but more likely it\u2019s stolen, captured or even wrecked. You might drift for a while as you wait for your next Captain, or the seat might still be warm when a new one takes over. Either way, the galaxy will change around you, and you\u2019ll see it all from the view in the cockpit.\nLike the original Artefact, it\u2019s a great way to spend an hour or two; sketching, world-building and storytelling in your own company. It's also a fantastic way to generate really unique ships for tabletop games like Edge of the Empire, Traveller or Scum & Villainy, with rich backstories, fun details and tonnes of personality.\n\nThe Zine.\nFormat \nA little paper prototype of the zine opening.\nI'll be using a new format for the physical rewards. Beak zines take an A3 sheet of paper and fold it into an 8-page A6 booklet. This process leaves one side of the paper blank, that people sometimes use to make a poster.\nOne of the things that's always bugged me about Artefact is how much flicking around the book you need to do as you play the game. I thought\u2014why not use the blank side of a beak zine for all of the game's content; the tables, questions and prompts you\u2019ll need during play. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\nIn Bucket of Bolts, you\u2019ll be able to read through all the rules in the booklet and then unfold it into a complete reference for play. Pretty neat huh?\nAnd here it is closing!\nPaper\nExtract comes in a range of lovely colours.\nOf course, I'm still taking every opportunity to make this little zine a deluxe product. I'll be using one of my favourite paper stocks, G.F Smith Extract.\nAs well as having some seriously impressive environmental credentials (it's made from recycled coffee cups), it's also just a lovely paper that comes in some great colours. I\u2019m partial to Mustard, as you can see in the prototype, but we\u2019ll see when the print samples arrive.\n\nInk\nCopies of ARTEFACT, outside on a sunny day.\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using Risograph to print the book. That means rich, vivid shades with the aesthetic of screen printing, but viable for large-scale print runs. It\u2019s also one of the most sustainable ways to print, with soy-based inks & low energy machines. It\u2019s going to be beautiful!\n\nIllustration\nTorben is very excellent at drawing spaceships.\nSpeaking of beautiful, I'm also commissioning Torben B\u00f6kemeyer again to do some awesome illustrations for the game. Spaceships are his bread & butter, and I think his sharp, detailed style is a really good fit for this game. You\u2019ll have seen his key art at the top of the page, and he's already hard at work on the game's cover.\n\nCollector\u2019s Edition\nI'm looking forward to an excuse to get wild with paper & ink combos...\nI\u2019m also offering a Collector\u2019s Edition of the game, exclusive to the Kickstarter, packed with bonus printed matter like art prints, stickers and random tables.\nIt\u2019s all paper stuff, but I think it\u2019s gonna feel pretty special.\nAny \u2019game content\u2019 (such as random tables) will be available to all as a digital download.\n\nAccessibility\nLike Artefact and Orbital, the digital edition will also be fully-compatible with screen readers. A second version will also be provided to support a range of visual processing needs. Once again, Yubi will be handling the accessibility design of the digital files.\n\nCommunity Copies\nEvery backer of Bucket of Bolts, physical or digital, will also be contributing one digital copy of the game to be available for free for those who need it. Thanks!\n\nStretch Goals\nThis is intentionally designed as a small project, but I've still got some cool things to announce if we break past our funding goal :)\n\nDelivery.\nTimelines\nI\u2019ve got a draft of the game written, and I\u2019m happy that the core concept works as well for spaceships as it did for magical items (after making a few changes to the design). I\u2019m hoping to get a playtest version out in a month or two, with the full digital version being delivered in late spring/early summer and the physical edition following soon after.\n\nBackerKit\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using BackerKit to manage fulfilment. This time, though, I\u2019m collecting shipping fees through Kickstarter so you shouldn\u2019t need to add funds in BackerKit unless you\u2019ve selected add-ons.\n\nOrbital \nOrbital header art\nMy previous project, Orbital, is going to print imminently which means that the bulk of the work for that Kickstarter is done. I\u2019m not shipping out the rewards myself, and the stretch goal content is coming along nicely. I\u2019ll continue to actively manage the project, but barring any catastrophes it shouldn\u2019t take up much headspace.\n\nARTEFACT: Reviews & Remarks.\nI\u2019m so happy with the way Artefact has been received. Here\u2019s hoping I can recapture some of that magic for Bucket of Bolts.\nIf you\u2019re a returning backer: hi, nice to see you again! I hope you also enjoyed Artefact :)\nPrint copies of Artefact\n\"It combines a little bit of writing and a little bit of drawing with a lot of storytelling to make a game that is one of the most relaxing and mindful experiences I have had this year.\" - Shut Up & Sit Down\n\"This is a great system agnostic supplement that could fit on any gamer\u2019s shelf\". \u2014 Pulp Culture Museum\n\"It was a wonderful game that once I started, I had a hard time putting down.

The tightness we experience in the shoulders and upper back is often correlated with hunching, computer/desk work, improper form while working out, carrying a child or a heavy purse. \n\nThe last group of six knobs on the TPR aim to target pressure points in the lower back (lumbar spine), which are commonly associated with: poor posture when we're on our feet or sitting, frequent bending forward, and heavy lifting.\n\n\nBelow is a table that represents what our estimated shipping costs are for this campaign. These shipping costs are based on our projections of sales amount as well as an average of ranges for shipping costs we've attained, thus these shipping costs are subject to change depending on our final results. Our goal is to make this process as transparent and accurate as possible, without any false promises or unexpected changes. After your purchase on Kickstarter, we will be sending you a BackerKit.com survey which will securely process your address and shipping payment.\nWe have been working on the Trigger Point Rocker since 2017. From 3d prints, to plaster molds to real sample molds and years of testing, tweaking and iterating over and over again until we found the perfect solution. Thank you to everyone that has helped us, from the random gym-goers to our beta-testers.

Set in the magical city of Castlecoast, readers get to know Audrey Clary, an alchemy student and heiress who secretly dreams of a different life, and Marion LaRue, a rebellious elemental magic student in search of someone she once loved.\nAs the reader, your choices affect the outcome of Audrey and Marion's day together.\n Length: 2-4 hours, depending on reading speed\n Platforms: PC (Steam/Itch.io; Windows/Mac/Linux); Mobile (iOS/Android)\n Languages: English, Simplified & Traditional Chinese\n Estimated Release: March 2021 (PC). The mobile version will follow months after.\n A WLW (women who love women) story for WLW: Follow a heartwarming, slice-of-life story between two girls as they get a second chance at love and friendship.\n 2 Playable Characters: See the story unfold through the eyes of Audrey and Marion.\n Vibrant Visuals: Immerse yourself in the magical city of Castlecoast, brought to life by animated characters, backgrounds & illustrations.\n Interactive Dialogue Choices: How would you like Audrey and Marion's day to end? Your choice will determine which of the two unique endings they will get.\n Original Soundtrack: Listen to beautifully composed music tracks that accentuates the story's most emotional beats.\n Fully Voiced: Features a cast of talented professional English voice actors to help bring our characters to life.\nAudrey Clary, heiress and LeFay Academy's brightest alchemy student, is about to have her first and worst detention experience of all time. It's bad enough that she has to stay in detention during Sunflower Day\u2014it's even worse that she's stuck in detention with the one and only Marion LaRue, the self-proclaimed \u201cChaotic Fireball Legend\u201d of LeFay Academy.\nMarion LaRue is not having a fun day at all. What was meant to be a harmless little fire turned into an explosion that has her stuck in detention, missing out on one of the rare opportunities for her to enjoy life outside the academy. And of course she just had to be stuck with Audrey Clary, of all the high class LeFay students she could be in detention with.\nDetermined to not miss out on the long-awaited festival, Audrey and Marion begrudgingly work together to escape detention and find their way to the festival. As they explore the city and celebrate the Sunflower Festival together, an old friendship is rekindled, and new feelings begin to bloom.\nWe've teamed up with English voice over veterans at Sound Cadence Studios to bring our characters to life! Check out Perfect Gold's stellar cast below:\nThe purpose of this Kickstarter is to fund the game's development with full English voice acting. The demo that you see right now is funded out of our pockets, along with the help of our generous Patrons. The pandemic has severely impacted our finances, but hitting our base goal ensures that at least we'll have enough funds to release the game by early next year.\nMoreover, our alpha demo right now doesn't feature any voices. Implementing full voice acting on a visual novel is a huge undertaking. It's expensive and requires a ton of logistics and manpower. While having it tremendously raises the quality of a visual novel, it's a feature that we cannot afford by ourselves, that's why we're asking for the community's support.\nPerfect Gold is intended to be a small project. Since we don't want to overscope due to budget constraints, we're limiting our physical rewards for this project. That doesn't make them any less cool, though!\nEven if you can't pledge to our campaign, you can contribute by helping us spread the word! It's very important for more people to know about our game. You can make fanarts, do let's plays, or tell your favorite Streamer/Press/Media about us!\nYou can also show your support by using these Perfect Gold avatars:\nClick the image to download!\nThank you so much!

You may know me from Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook as Guweiz.\nHowever you found your way here, thank you for taking the time to check out my first Kickstarter campaign to create my first ever art book, Guweiz: The Art of Gu Zheng Wei.\nOver my creative journey, I have created pieces that I am very proud of, and have experienced many wonderful moments that I would love to share. For this reason, with the help and expertise of the great people at 3dtotal Publishing, I am crafting my first book.\nAs well as resulting in an inviting and thoroughly packed book, this campaign also gives me the opportunity to offer my art to fans in another physical form \u2013 as exclusive printed gifts.\nContinue reading to discover more about what hides within the 152 pages of the book, admire the additional items available only during this campaign, and take a sneaky peek at the bonus stretch goal items that you can unlock!\nGuweiz: The Art of Gu Zheng Wei will be beautifully presented in hardback, and will explore my artistic journey, from drawing my first anime portrait at seventeen years old, to developing my own unique urban style of manga and working on big-budget films such as Ghost in the Shell.\nWith an affinity for creating gritty textures and fantastical scenes, I categorize my work into two genres I have endless passion for: \u201cfantasy\u201d and \u201curban\u201d. Within these styles, I explore the magical moments in the everyday and the edgy realism of fantasy realms. Get lost in my world of witches, warriors, and whimsical night shoppers.\nTo learn more about my workflow and thought processes, you will also find in-depth tutorials and discover a dissection of my working mindset and unique techniques. Delve into this book to understand the importance of maintaining a visual library for inspiration and reference, and how utilizing the art fundamentals can offer invaluable improvements to your design skills.\nI would love to be able to share this book with you all, and I hope you might consider backing this project to help it become a reality.\nThank you!\nBelow are the exclusive items that are available in addition to the book. Some tiers and gifts are limited, so be sure to pledge quickly if you don\u2019t want to miss out!\nPlease note that as this is a live project, all designs are examples of content I would like to include but these are subject to change.\n\n\nWe have chosen to launch this book through Kickstarter as it gives us the chance to thank those who make this book possible by adding extra stretch goal rewards to the campaign. I have designed four high-quality bonus rewards to be given away if we can meet certain targets.\n\n\n\nStretch goals are available to all backers from Tier 1 and above. Please note: final designs of items are subject to change.\n3dtotal publishing is committed to having a positive effect on the environment.

If you support this campaign we would like to thank you for helping us take on this mission.\n3dtotal Publishing is able to ship worldwide! Simply select your pledge option and your location, and Kickstarter will calculate the shipping for you.\nAll rewards will be sent out at the same time (both signed and unsigned). However, if there is a very high number of backers, please keep in mind that it will take us a few days to work our way through packaging all the rewards. 3dtotal Publishing has a fulfilment company lined up to do this as quickly as possible, so once dispatched, rewards should reach you in 10-15 working days.\nWe have fulfilled many successful Kickstarters and we have a great record for delivering parcels around the world. For this campaign we will only be offering tracked shipping to certain locations as we're really determined that you receive your parcel first time without any hiccups or problems with delivery. Parcels sent to the UK, USA and Europe will be sent using our regular and reliable service, and parcels sent to the rest of the world will be sent with tracked shipping.\nUnforeseen delays that are out of our control can occur during delivery, so please allow an additional two weeks before checking up on your package. We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!\nFor those who are not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a worldwide crowd-funding platform for artists and their creative projects. Once the funding period ends, we will start finalizing the book and the extra rewards, which will be sent to you in July. About a month before that, we will send you a survey through Kickstarter, asking for your address \u2013 the reason we wait until a few weeks before is so that we have everyone\u2019s most up-to-date details. When the survey is ready for you to fill in, you will receive an email through Kickstarter. We ask that you fill the survey in as soon as possible, to avoid any delays in sending out your reward!\nAs seasoned users of Kickstarter, 3dtotal Publishing know that a very small number of backers don\u2019t fill in the survey at the end of a Kickstarter campaign, making it impossible for us to process and ship their rewards. 3dtotal pledges to hold all rewards for backers that fail to fill in their survey for 12 months and to make multiple efforts to contact the backers in question to try to successfully deliver their items.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the biggest challenges will be producing and delivering everything to you on time.

It is a country where everybody follows the law, no matter how absurd it may be at times. You are an ordinary factory worker, who accidentally becomes a member of parliament \u2014 now it\u2019s your turn to decide where this country is headed. There are two parties at the Parliament: one always votes \"yea\" and the other \"nay\". The votes are divided exactly in half and the final decision is always up to the player. Will you earn the love of the whole nation or will it be hatred instead? This depends solely on you!\nSo, basically, Law Law Land is an open world adventure game focused on story, exploration and player decisions, featuring dozens of characters to meet and things to do.\nYour decisions shape the city and change its appearance. For example, you can choose to be a good guy and repair roads and buildings. Or you can cause an economical or ecological crisis \u2014 it's up to you whether you build your dream city or trash-littered dystopia.\nDifferent fractions in Law Law Land have different objectives in mind and it's up to the player who to support. Some of the characters will even try to bribe you in order to get what they want.\nMoney is one of the most important resources in the game: it can make your life easier. Tired of using public transport? Buy a fancy car! But you also need to feed your family and money can help with that, too. Your wealth defines your social status: many quests will be unavailable if you are poor (and vice versa). In addition, other characters will treat you differently, depending on your social status.\nWe try to make gameplay as diverse as possible: there are a lot of unique minigames in LawLawLand. From moving crates on a factory to investigating the crime scene \u2014 every major quest comes with unique gameplay mechanics.\nThe core gameplay element is lawmaking. In LawLawLand there are two parties at the Parliament: one always votes \"yea\" and the other \"nay\". The votes are divided exactly in half and the final decision is always up to the player. Sometimes the laws that pass can actually help people, and sometimes they can help you make some money. There are many factions that will try to manipulate the main character or seduce him with money. In LawLawLand money always comes first. Well, right after your decisions, of course.\nWe have a talented development team that wants to engage in the game full time. But now there is no such opportunity, so we need your help. We have relatively small requests: we work from home from different countries. We don\u2019t need to rent an expensive office or pay big salaries: we just want to be able to calmly develop Law Law Land without worrying about tomorrow. If we exceed the required amount, we can hire extra and make Law Law Land even better (we have ideas that we cannot implement in the current budget). We plan to complete the game in a year and release Law Law Land in fall 2020.\nWe have a complete vertical slice of the game on our hands: all key mechanics are ready. A script has been written, we have a big living city, and all the characters are ready - all that remains is to complete Law Law Law Land. Approximately 1/3 of the game is ready. Many quests and mini-games are ready. Almost all graphic assets are rendered. The mechanics of making laws and changing the city works. And we also have an artificial intelligence system that controls every resident of Law Law Law Land: they go to work, shop in grocery stores, eat and sleep, depending on the time of day.\nYou can also check out our stretch goals here:\nEven more minigames: even more minigames and activities! Minigames will be even more diverse and use more unique mechanics.\nConsole ports: additional finance would help us expand the list of platforms. We love consoles and dream to bring Law Law Law Land to PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.\nThe town extended: to reduce the amount of work, so far we decided to not include some additional storylines. But if we get more resources for development, the city will become even larger, new buildings and new side quests associated with them will appear.\nMore customization options: new cars, new outfits and even an ability to customize interior in your house.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur project is pretty big at scope.

If so, let us introduce you to Transport INC. a game where you can do all those things and more!\n\n  Transport INC. is a game about management, competition, economy but above all about logistics. The player gets to run a starting logistics company and skillfully maneuver it to the top.\n  Visit us on steam and join our growing community\nConnect the capitals and major cities of European or American nations. Watch the economic situation and defeat your opponents in Transport INC! You will experience what it feels like to face constantly changing traffic conditions. Is there a strike in Paris? Redirect your vehicles! Is there a football finals in Barcelona? Supply the lines with more vehicles.\n\n\n  The job of a company CEO is never easy. You'll have to deal with various unexpected events like strikes, natural disasters and more that might make or break your company. It's up to you to steer your company through these difficulties like a naturally born leader or see your company ruined and bankrupt.\nThe game world changes constantly on its own and you will feel yourself become increasingly part of it. Complain about annoying taxes and border control policies or evade them through different routes.\n\n  The whole world with its major cities will be available for you. Have you always wanted to do business in Paris? Build your first depot there and gradually expand to other cities, states, countries and finally to a world where everyone will know your company name.\n All passengers and cargo you transport will travel from one city to another. The better you know your cities, the more passengers you'll be able to satisfy. Passengers in each city have their own needs and as you keep transporting them, you will find out more about their needs. All cities also have their tags which can further affect demands or trigger various events.\n  As the director of a transport company, you'll have to provide your customers with the most modern and comfortable vehicles. A satisfied customer is a paying customer. That's why we've prepared various vehicles, from busses to aircraft to trains inspired by real vehicles. From a rattling old van to the most modern models where passengers will feel as if they are lying on a cloud.\nEvery vehicle has its own characteristics, pros, and cons.\n  As the CEO, you will have control of all the money there will be as well as an extensive overview of the statistics that will always help you know what your earnings are and what causes you the biggest losses. Consequently, it will be up to you to choose what to invest your money in to achieve the greatest profit.\n\n  In Transport INC: you will be confronted with other transportation companies. Competition can sometimes be an annoyance, especially when they offer better services than your company. Never mind if you can't catch up, there are other alternatives. Drag them to your level with industrial sabotage. You will be able to obstruct competing companies' progress and reduce their credibility and popularity. Sabotage your opponents in many ways such as puncturing tires, burning cars, staining their name with a marketing campaign or spraying graffiti on their vehicles. The ends justify the means, sometimes it is necessary to get your hands dirty.\n\nWe need your help bringing the full experience of a transportation company to life. Our stretch goals will make our game even more complex and enjoyable. With your help and support, we can make this game experience like no other. \n\n  We are a team of developers, artists, and foremost game enthusiasts. Our studio is located in Slovakia. While each of us like their own game genres, there is one we all share our love for - management/simulation games. This project is a perfect fit for mixing our own ideas (and your ideas too) with good old transport management games we played and loved as kids.\nTo bring all of these ideas into the game world, we need to grow our team. From the start of the development, our team has already nearly doubled in size. With new people that fall into our train of thought, we can bring more ideas, more know-how, and solutions to our game.\n   We're really grateful to be able to share our game with you through this Kickstarter campaign.\nVisit us on steam and join our growing community", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith a good publisher at our back and a dedicated and talented team, there are no major risks ahead.\nEvery project is a challenge and this one is no exception.

With a big ensemble cast and a vibrant colorful style, Knight & Beard is an all ages book with themes of empathy, friendship, and more.\nRead Knight & Beard on Tapas, Webtoon, and Comixology!\n Volume 1 picks up with Knight and Beard performing a series of seemingly simple tasks. Unable to be trusted with actual guard duty, the two are found performing at a puppet show, wrangling up stray pigs, and just trying to keep out of trouble. But the mismatched pair can't help but wreak havoc wherever they go! Particularly Knight who has an aggressive determination to prove herself as a hero to potential naysayers around her. \nKnight and Beard Issue One, pages 10-13\nHowever, as Friendship Day, the world's most celebrated holiday approaches, people from all over the globe come pouring into the city, and Knight and Beard have to step up to perform their duties as guards. As the festival nears, the two start encountering all sorts of people: new friends, old foes, and a legendary hero. \nAt its core, Knight & Beard is a story of empathy and love. And Volume 1 marks the beginning of this journey that our titular characters take to understand themselves, each other, and the world around them. \nKnight & Beard Issue Five, pages 21 and 22\n Knight & Beard Volume 1 will collect the first seven issues of Knight & Beard.

With this Kickstarter, we'd really like to be able to pay him a fair wage for all the work that he's done for us.\nIn addition, we couldn't have put together a book of this size to print without the help of Rhiannon R.S, who we also hope to pay through the success of this campaign.\nAny additional earnings will go towards stretch goals and to the production of future issues of Knight & Beard.\n Described as a real life buddy comedy, long time friends Tara Kurtzhals and Sarah Bollinger met during college and instantly began collaborating on creative projects. Best known for their auto-bio comic Girls Have A Blog on Webtoon, these two young women have used their experiences as friends to inspire their stories of empathy, friendship, and more.  \n Author/Illustrator of The Whatever Chronicles and This is Jim.

This venture features a balance of immersive story, as well as a mini game to progress both relationships and dialogue. But Love Mythos isn\u2019t just pure titillation (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, amirite?). As the main character, you can help guide your fellow wounded companions through rehabilitation, or let them slip into bitterness and revenge. Your decisions, your words, your actions shape the entire world and who these fey will come to be.\nThis is an indie game created from the love of a very small team. Our goal is to create a dynamic, immersive experience with story that leaves you wanting more, and enough game play to provide an engaging challenge. We hope to bring a new type of sexy to the table, one that\u2019s frank, honest and well-written. A type of sexy where fetishes aren\u2019t shamed or vilified, and there\u2019s a little som\u2019something for everyone. We believe there\u2019s a real demand out there for erotica with substance, which is exactly what Love Mythos will provide.\nYou, an independent selkie just enjoying life in the Ocean, have been captured by the strange creatures called humans. Kept in darkness without your precious skin, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s the end when suddenly a team of rescuers sweep in and take you away.\nThey whisk you off to a hidden island; but not just any island. You find yourself at a rehabilitation center for fey who have been hurt by humans. And while you are not grievously wounded, the rescuers couldn\u2019t recover your skin. You are now stranded on land, with no way to ever get home.\nFrom there you meet the inhabitants of the island, and can choose to interact with them, or not. There is a large degree of freedom in this game for you to shape the world how you want. You can pursue a character\u2019s entire story line, unlock an ending, then go back and play another. Or you can take turns engaging multiple characters, learning about their past and what brought them to Sanctuary Island. The world is your oyster.\nOur demo can be found HERE \n\n This game is centered around the story and unlocking multiple endings amongst the eight love interest. What you choose to say, or choose not to say, has more effect than you know. However, the gameplay is just as important. Losing, winning, and getting a high score in the puzzle game is what will allow you to progress and unlock more chapters.\n\u00b7         Choose how you want your main character to be represented, with Male Pronouns, Female Pronouns, or They/Them!\n\u00b7         8 love interests to choose from, 4 female and 4 male, hailing from all over the world. Craving a beefcake bara daddy? Check. Looking for a total nerd with killer hair? Check. Whatever your flavor, you\u2019ll find something you like here.\n\u00b7         25+ in-game locations that you can explore with the other inhabitants of the island. Swim in the ocean with a mermaid, run through a meadow with a centaur, go to physical therapy with a minotaur. There are even special, hidden locations unlocked through certain endings.\n\u00b7         Interact with mythological creatures from all over the world, ranging from Alkonosts to Manticores!\n\u00b7         19+ unlockable endings, with drastically different outcomes. You can save characters, or send them teetering over the edge.\n\u00b7         Friendship options in case doing the down and dirty isn\u2019t your scene. Aro and Ace are welcome in our party.\n\u00b7         A bubble-shooter game, with consequences to characters and the storylines you\u2019ve unlocked so far.\n\u00b7         A catchy, mood-driven sound track guaranteed to pull you in and immerse you in the world of Love Mythos.\nLove Mythos came into being approximately three years ago and has been in serious production for over a year. So far, we have the script almost completed, finished character designs, half of the backgrounds, most of the OST, the visual novel engine, and the core of the mini-game experience. \nWe still need to finish the ending game cards, the sex scenes, the final draft of the OST and any other last-minute additions that will let the game really breathe. Once that is completed, there\u2019s also the incredibly important bug testing, which we want to be thorough with considering we are using an AI function in our mini-game.\n Our game is Greenlit and will be available on steam when we launch! \n\nLove Mythos is a passion project of an incredibly dedicated group of individuals, being produced at our own expense. A successful campaign would allow us to focus on putting out a great product, without having to worry about the lights being shut off.\n\u00b7         Greater output of assets without distraction of other freelancing projects.\n\u00b7         Additional help able to be hired, should it be needed.\n\u00b7         Handle the expenses that come with creating a business, including release game costs and fees.\n\u00b7         Creating a one of a kind, story driven, inclusive experience with unabashedly well-written erotica.\n\u00b7         The diagram below illustrates how any crowdfunding support will be allocated for the completion of Love Mythos: Sanctuary Island:\n Of course we will be pleased as punch (you know, if you\u2019re into that) just to fully fund this project, but these goals are in case you guys take us above and beyond our original scope. After all, anything\u2019s possible with enough pr0n! \nAdditional Splash art for each chapter between main character and love interests! \n Currently our games NSFW scenes focus more on the Love Interest rather than the plumbing of the player character. However, should this goal be hit, there will be three completely different sex scenes written for each pronoun set in the game. \n Who needs more porn? YOU DO! Should we reach this stretch goal, we will include additional splash art for the NSFW scenes for every love interest. \n\nWant to find out more about your waifu or husbando? Hitting this stretch goal will provide extra chapters for each love interest, involving a flashback from their life before the island. \n As much fun as it is getting them naked, it\u2019s also fun to dress the love interests up. Should we hit this stretch goal, each character will get custom accessories and looks as prizes for obtaining high scores in the mini game. \n Although we dearly love our main cast of characters, we realize that just 8 choices may not be enough to scratch everyone\u2019s itch. Should we hit this stretch goal, all backers will be able to vote for a secret, unlockable character to be added to the game. This new character will be fully fledged, with the same amount of chapters as the original cast. The choices are:\nSkol Z\u2019kiy: This slime girl heralds from the very cold wastes of Russia. She\u2019s sweet, shy, and a bit slippery.\n\nWapenzi: This sentient, intelligent gorilla is as handsome as he is charming. The scholarly fey was brought to the island after being shot by the humans he trusted and lived with.\n (sorry no sketches for Wapenzi yet QoQ)\nTagata Tino\u2019ese: A lovely lady cyclops heralding from the Polynesian belt. She is the epitome of a gentle giant, although she carries two massive clubs. One in her hand, and the other between her legs. \nWell you did it. If you\u2019re going to have options, you want all of them, gosh darn it. All backers will vote to unlock a 2nd hidden character from the list above.\n You did it...EVEN MORE. You proved that you really can have it all. All three of the previously listed hidden characters will be fully realized and added to the game, bringing the total up to eleven possible love interests and twenty-five different endings. \n Wow, you like us. You really like us! This stretch goal will include character specific mini games for each love interest. That\u2019s 11 different games inside of a game. That\u2019s some inception-level shenanigans. \n\n\n A \"Thank You\" from the Squid Sins Squad Team on our Kickstarter page as well as a Kickstarter exclusive Wallpaper.  \nFor the first 50 at this level receive the previously mentioned rewards plus the actual game and a thank you with your name in the credits!\nSame as the early bird, just a little bit later! \n For the first 25 at this level!

We build a turtle religion!?\nRecorded 01/30, this shows early alpha footage.\nAbbey Games, the creator of Reus and Renowned Explorers, is back with an all-new single-player god game, Godhood. \nAs a tribal god, create your own religion, inspire your tribe\u2019s growth, convert unbelievers and become the greatest god of all. \nWhile channeling the titans of yore, such as Black & White and Populous, Godhood sets out to revive the PC strategy god game genre in it\u2019s own unique way: by allowing you to truly craft your own one-of-a-kind religion. \nCraft your religion as a tribal god.\nChoose virtues, vices, rituals and religious dogmas.\nInspire a group of heroic disciples to spread your will, without direct control.\nWatch your holy temple site grow over generations from an isometric perspective.\nDefeat enemy disciples in ritual conflict to convert worshippers and power up.\nEarly Access release planned for May 2019 on PC (Windows / Mac / Linux), priced at \u20ac25.\nFull release later in 2019, priced at \u20ac30, with post-release content and DLC support planned for years.\n\nPray to the Social Stretch Gods and earn their blessings!\nTo honor the Social Stretch Gods...\nTo honor Twi'Xl, goddess of Twitter, retweet this tweet!\nTo honor Rednit, god of Reddit, join the Abbey Games subreddit!\nTo honor Yutteph, god of Youtube, share the Godhood Kickstarter video!\nUnlocked so far:\n FREE copy of Reus for all \u20ac20+ backers (received once campaign ends)!!\n FREE copy of Renowned Explorers for all \u20ac20+ backers (received once campaign ends)!!\n Wallpapers of all 3 Social Stretch Gods. Find them HERE.\n Forum Avatars of all 3 Social Stretch Gods. Find them HERE.\n In-Game Dedication Statue of Rednir.\nCREATE YOUR RELIGION\nBe a war god and prove that power is the greatest virtue! Accept treasured sacrifices as a god of greed. Bless harvests as a fertility goddess. Or cleanse body, soul and sinners as a chastity god. Mix and match to create your unique religion.\nLEAD YOUR DISCIPLES\nDisciples are your most powerful worshippers. They specialize in a class and power up their abilities by performing rituals. Disciples have a mind of their own, and are not under your direct control. Use divine inspirations to sway their actions to your liking. But keep their faith high or they might ignore you... The blasphemous sinners!\nGOD COMMANDMENTS\nSelect God Commandments to set what your religion considers a virtuous ideal or a loathsome vice. God Commandments unlock unique temples, rituals and god powers, and alter the personality of your disciples forever.\nPREPARE FOR CONFLICT\nDisciples can level up stats and abilities by performing rituals. Design these rituals to develop your disciples, and inspire the construction of the elaborate temples to perform these rituals in.\nTHE SACRAMENT\nProve you are the greatest god by defeating rival deities in turn-based rpg combat. You have no direct influence on how disciples choose to fight; instead, prepare them with the right skills to create powerful combos and take advantage of opponents' weaknesses to ensure victory.\nNot all battles are won with blades: use wise words, intimidation or even songs to sway your opponent's beliefs.\nTHE WORLD OF GODHOOD\nSend your disciples out to explore the world and convert other tribes. Procedural generation of the world ensures challenging surprises each playthrough. Clash with the Mesoamerican deities that have staked their claims, and explore a mythical world of nature spirits, strange magic and gods. \nMAKE IT YOURS\nMake your religion truly yours. Design your god. Decide what your worshippers call themselves and what they believe. Customize how they look and dress. Adorn your temples with your symbolic dedications, such as bats, swords, the sun or cats.\nThe goal of Godhood is to become the greatest god of all. To do so, you must watch over your tribe and inspire them to greatness. Here's how:\nGodhood progresses over a series of in-game days which effectively act as turns. Each day your heroic disciples decide how to best spend their time at your temple site. Depending on their character traits and faith in you, they might diligently perform a ritual, laze about, socialize with other disciples, get into fights etc. Only by inspiring their actions will you make sure they act in their own best interests.\nMaking vengeance a virtue makes your disciples stronger, but can lead to fights\nEach day, use your divine inspirations and god actions to lead your tribe. With divine inspirations, inspire your disciples to perform the rituals you've designed. These rituals increase their power, gain them unique specializations and provide the tribe with valuable resources.\nDivine inspirations are only as strong as your disciples' faith, so do not be surprised when a low-faith disciple ignores or even goes against your divine word. High-faith disciples have a chance of excelling in tasks you inspire them to perform.\nTo inspire faith, take heed of disciples\u2019 prayers. Violent disciples pray for glorious victory in combat, while tired disciples pray for a well-deserved rest. Make their wishes come true and their faith will soar.\nFaith is also increased by your glory. Glory shows how great your worshippers believe you to be; high glory increases disciples' faith and boosts their rituals. Glory fades over time, and once it's gone your godhood will decrease. If your godhood reaches 0 you lose the game \nAt any time you can choose to send your disciples on a mission to neighboring tribes, to convert that tribe from their false gods and restore your glory.\nYour disciples will face off against several teams of enemy disciples; each victory granting rewards and glory. Overpower all enemy teams to convert the tribe. Defeat will lower your disciples' faith, so be careful how far you push them.\nConverted tribes will pay tribute, especially if their culture matches your religion, and become a starting point for new missions, allowing you to explore further into the world.\nThe sacrament is the turn-based conflict in which disciples prove your greatness to unbelievers through physical combat, powerful speeches or even beautiful songs.\nYou decide the abilities and specializations your disciples have through the rituals you've designed and the choices you've made when leveling them up. But the disciples themselves decide how to best use their skills; you have no direct control over them.\nAhmanu tries to work through her nerves on her first Mission\nObtain victory by preparing rituals to power up your disciples, forming combos between your disciples' abilities and taking advantage of enemy weaknesses. Divine inspirations can be used to focus a disciple on using specific abilities, but their faith will determine how effective this proves to be.\nGaining more worshippers increases your 'god level'. At certain levels you may select a god commandment which becomes a focus of your religion. Each commandment has a moral opposite and choosing one will abhor the other. Examples are War & Peace or Greed & Charity.\nCommandments change disciples' personalities, turning some into virtuous paragons of the commandment and others into viceful sinners who disagree with the commandment.\nLust & Chastity\nCommandments unlock unique structures such as War's coliseum or Greed's gold hoard. Inspire their construction to unlock their powerful rituals. Commandments also unlock new god actions, new ways for you to influence the minds of your worshippers,which open up unique new strategies. War's holy raid god action, for example, inspires the tribe to raid neighboring tribes for loot! Commandments have many more effects, from unlocking special disciple abilities to triggering unique events.\nYour warmongering disciples will pray to you for holy raids on other tribes\nDisciples sometimes argue about how to interpret your commandments. By taking sides, rewarding or punishing your disciples you can further determine the dogma of your religion and unlock even more new tools for you to use.\nDevelop your playstyle by mixing and matching commandments, expand your temple site and rituals to power up your disciples, keep their faith high so they are ready for their missions, defeat other deities to convert their worshippers and grow your power. Become the greatest god of all.\nGodhood's simulation of religion has been a truly unique and exciting design challenge. In Inside Godhood we open up about that design process and go in-depth on the game's systems. We'll continue to post new Inside Godhood's during and after this campaign.\nInside Godhood 01: Creating your Religion\nInside Godhood 02: Your Disciples\nInside Godhood 03: The Sacrament\nInside Godhood 04: Your Rituals\nInside Godhood 05: The Mission\nInside Godhood 06: The Big Idea\nWe are a small independent Dutch developer, 10 people strong, that has been making strategic management games since 2011. We pride ourselves in making management games for hardcore strategists, whimsical storytellers and newcomers to the genre alike.\nWe have released two games: Reus and Renowned Explorers, for which we made a bunch of post-release content. Over the years we've established the 'Abbey tone': a combination of colorful and vibrant look and feel with deeply engaging mechanics that take skill and experience to master.\nOf course, we've grown and learned a lot since we started so many years ago, and we're continuing to use this experience to make each of our games better than the last.\nSince Reus we haven't been able to stop thinking about making another god game. One that truly touches on the role religion plays in human culture, and makes you the creator of your own religion. We hope you'll come to share our vision and help us make it a reality.\nRight, I remember Reus / Renowned Explorers!\nThat's great! A big thanks to anyone that supported our previous games. We hope you enjoyed playing them as much as we enjoyed making them. We've learned a lot of lessons along the way and believe Godhood couldn't have happened without your support and enthusiasm for our games.\nWe've been working on Godhood for a while now. Development up until an Early Access release has been fully funded and we're working hard to release in Early Access in May 2019. A full release will follow sometime later in 2019.\nBut our vision for the game is massive. There are as many ideas for interesting religious expression as there are people. In order to allow you to live out your godhood, we want to add as many religious ingredients and mechanics as we can cram into a single game. And for that we'll need your help.\nHitting the funding goal allows us to allocate resources to create all the components required to fulfill one fantasy we've heard fans asking for over and over again: to become an ancient eldritch god with their own dark and secretive cult.\nEmbrace madness... and tentacles!\nOf course, being an eldritch horror is only one fantasy of godhood. The base game will give you a ton of other options, and if we exceed the funding goal we'll have the resources needed to create even more for you to mix and match into all sorts of unique religions.\nRegardless of the success of the Kickstarter, we want to support Godhood for years to come: expanding on its extensive base with all sorts of new systems and religious expressions.\nWe know that pledging your support now means putting a lot of faith in us. For this we offer you our utmost gratitude, and these rewards as thanks for your support.\nRewards Explanations:\nDigital copy of Godhood: This will be delivered to you as either a Steam code or DRM-free through GOG at the game's Early Access release, May 2019.\nBacker-exclusive Holy Site Centers: A visual skin for your Holy Site center to use in-game. The 'Evil' version gets you a nefarious-looking skin as well. They have no gameplay mechanics tied to them, but look real sleek. These will not be made available after the Kickstarter. \n'Art of Godhood' digital artbook: A Steam code for a beautiful artbook. Go in-depth on the creation process of the game's artstyle, marvel at stunning illustrations, and feast on hidden gems of lore.\n'Tunes of Godhood' digital soundtrack: A Steam code for the full Godhood original soundtrack. Enjoy the soothing sounds of nature and divinity at your leasure. Take a listen to a preview:\nAlpha & Beta access: We've been running a limited-invites alpha program for Godhood, but with this reward you're guaranteed to be a part of all alpha and beta tests. Take note: We can't guarantee a specific amount of alpha & beta moments until launch; we'll schedule in whatever development demands. They are time limited, and usually last about a weekend. \n3 Backer-Exclusive Dedications: Three visual skins for dedication statues: 'Kickstarter Backer', 'Golden Rivaleux' and 'Reus Rock Giant'. They have no gameplay mechanics tied to them, but sure look spiffy. These will not be made available after the Kickstarter. \nName an enemy disciple: Name one of the enemy disciples players will face when they explore the world of Godhood. We'll give you a list of enemy gods. You choose which your character worships, and give them a cool tribal name. We reserve the right to ask you for another name in case its content is not deemed appropriate for the game. \nDesign an in-game dedication: Design a dedication statue with us, to be placed in-game! You'll provide us with a couple sentence description or a sketch of the statue and Marlies will work it out to put in-game. Dedications have no gameplay mechanics tied to them. We reserve the right to ask you for another description in case its content is not deemed appropriate for the game. \nDesign an adversary deity: Design one of the adversary deities players will face to prove they are the greatest god! You'll select what type of deity they are from a list, then provide us with a name and a couple sentence description, or even a sketch. We'll work with you to make sure the deity fits the world of Godhood. We reserve the right to ask you for another description in case its content is not deemed appropriate for the game. \n\"I'd love to help out, but have no credit card!\"\nHi! Thanks so much for being interested in backing! We will set up a 'late backer' solution after the campaign, so you won't miss out. For this we'll be using PayPal, which will make pledges without a credit card totally possible. We hope to see you then!\nThank you so much!\nWhether this is the first time you've heard of Abbey Games, have been with us from our humble beginnings with Reus, or have eagerly traversed all the post-release expeditions of Renowned Explorers, we thank you for enabling us to make the games we, and hopefully you as well, have a passion for playing.\nThank you so much for checking out the Kickstarter. We plan on supporting Godhood with new content and gameplay for years to come, and we hope you'll be a part of that journey. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, but our third large-scale PC management game we release. The game's development is well underway and fully funded up until our Early Access release in May 2019.\n\nVideo game development is a turbulent process that can hold unexpected obstacles. This means there is a chance development will take a little longer than planned. If this does happen, we will of course let you know well in advance.\n\nThe initial release will be Early Access, in order to give us time to get your feedback, establish a solid base, and then expand that base with new content. We have no projected final release date, as the success of the Kickstarter could actually mean we have more funds to expand the game more than we predict, but we do know we'll be fully releasing Godhood in 2019.\n\nIn order to avoid hangups regarding reward delivery, we have decided to not include any physical rewards.

Lovecraft\nBy  night we came, descending upon the old house like the vultures that we  are. They say the manor is full of valuables and relics. They also say  Lovecraft is mad, believing his writing to be more than mere fiction.  Let's hope that isn't true... and why the front door was  left unlocked. \nAll Manor of Evil takes players inside the mind and abode of HP  Lovecraft. As players pilfer and steal ancient relics, unseen forces awaken and madness stirs. Beyond the larceny at hand, each player has an agenda of their own. Some want only to survive the night, while others wish to call forth an elder god eager to devour the players... or the world.\n \"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. \" - H.P. Lovecraft\nThe LUNATIC pledge of All Manor of Evil includes upgraded awakening and madness tokens, as well as more relics, roles, and, yes, gods. More importantly, this pledge adds monster cards and arcane relics. Monsters are added to the Manor deck during setup and trigger game-altering effects when they are drawn. Arcane relics feature a silver border. Some role and relic cards reference these powerful objects, each of which is unique. Lastly, this pledge level includes additional components to allow for up to six players to play!\n \"I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness.\" - H. P. Lovecraft\nThe contents of Madness Stirs will be comprised of stretch goals unlocked throughout this campaign. Backers will receive this expansion for supporting this campaign. It will be available in limited quantities after the campaign at a cost directly from Kolossal. This expansion will contain more complex monsters, relics, roles, and other content not available in the retail version of the game.\n \"Wise men have interpreted dreams, and the gods have laughed.\" - H.P. Lovecraft\nTake a look at what those who have had an early look at All Manor of Evil think about the game!\n All Manor of Evil is the 2nd Mikro campaign from Kolossal Games and the 9th overall campaign from Kolossal Games. While Kolossal is new to the industry, we hit the ground running, armed with the  knowledge of industry best practices, experienced partners, and  wonderful games. Our first game Western Legends   is in the process of fulfillment. We believe in open and honest  communication and will share all info as we receive it with our  backers. \nThe game is designed by Kolossal's own Travis R. Chance (Heroes Wanted, Path of Light and Shadow, Legendary: Buffy the Vampire Slayer) with haunting art from Mike Riiven (Omen: A Reign of War). Though a game in our Mikro line, it packs a punch with highly interactive play, as well as an interesting take on the very popular Lovecraft theme.\nOur team is led and supported by industry and marketing experts.  We have a machine that works, fueled by amazing games that are designed,  developed, and illustrated by incredibly talented people. The game is  easy to learn while providing interesting, diverse, and tense game play  each game, combining familiar mechanisms in a unique, new way.  \nWe are committed to begin fulfillment to backers of this game  before it is made available in retail. Components and materials for the  game are in the final stages of completion upon launch. All files will  be uploaded to our manufacturing partner within one week of the  campaign's ending. This ensures timely delivery to our backers. \n Kolossal does not sell to online discounters. Backers will receive all of our games at a lower cost and before the retail release of the game. Further, direct sales via the  Kolossal website will only be to US customers.\nBy backing at ANY pledge level through our campaign, you will receive, at no extra cost, the Madness Stirs expansion. This expansion will be comprised of stretch goals unlocked throughout the  campaign and will only be available directly through Kolossal (at a  cost) after the campaign in limited quantities. This expansion will only be overprinted by 500 units for the initial release of the game. We have many exciting and interactive goals  planned for those who are backers of Kolossal's ninth official release! \nPlayers take the role of thieves that have all broken into the opulent manor of writer H.P. Lovecraft. Upon entry, they discover valuable relics of strange origin throughout the manor. Little do they know, their mere touch has stirred ancient and otherworldly forces. At least one of them will be driven mad, but who among those remaining will escape with the most relics... and their sanity?\nBackers wanting more info about how to play the game may peruse our draft rule book link here. We also invite them to read a step-by-step description of the game below.\nAll Manor of Evil is played over a number of game rounds. Each Round has three phases.\nSelect Actions\nResolve Actions\nEnd of Round\n                                        SELECT ACTIONS\nEach player has 4 Action cards that they will choose to play one of each round. Each Action card has a Title, Initiative Order, Card Action, and Room Action.\nEach player simultaneously selects one Action card from their hand and places it face down in their play area. When a player places their Action card face down they immediately return any face up Action cards to their hand. This return step will be skipped on the first round of play.\nAll Players simultaneously reveal their Action cards. Any players who selected the same Action card as at least one other player take a Madness token from the supply. \nThe player(s) that selected the Action card with the lowest initiative number resolves their Action card first. If more than one player chose the same Action card, players with the same initiative number will resolve their actions in clockwise order starting at the Lantern token. Players that chose the same action also receive one madness token. \n                                       RESOLVE ACTIONS\nWhen resolving an Action card, first resolve the Card Action and then the Room Action.\nRoom actions require the player to steal a relic from one of the rooms on the Manor Board. Players MUST steal a relic from one of the rooms listed on their Action card. Depending on the other players actions there may not available Relics to steal during the Room Action step and in this case the player does not steal a relic.\nOnce a Relic is stolen, place or remove Awakening tokens, gain or lose Madness tokens, and resolve any indicated Special effect on the card.\nThe Madness Value and Relic Value will be considered at the end of the game. Players will only know for certain the values on the top card of each player's Cache. The uncertainty of just who has the most madness adds to the tension of the game!\n                                                END OF ROUND\nAfter all players have resolved their action cards, the round ends. Players check to see if any Elder Gods have 6 or more Awakening Tokens and if so the game ends. If not, the player with the Lantern Token passes it to the next player in clockwise order and the next round begins.\n                                                   GAME END\nA game of All Manor of Evil will end in one of three possible ways. \nDuring set up, two Clock Cards will be added to the relic deck. When the second clock card is revealed, the game immediately ends.\nIf one Elder God has 6 or more Awakening tokens at the end of a round. \nIf more than one Elder God is Awakened at the end of a Game Round, then all players are devoured and nobody escapes the Manor.\n                                   DECLARING A WINNER\nWhen the game ends each player will reveal their Role card and resolve all abilities.\nIf an Elder God was awakened, resolve any Awakened ability on the Elder God's card. \nAssuming that the thieves have not destroyed the world by awakening several ancient cosmic gods, the remaining players will total their Madness and Relic Values.\nPlayers will total their Madness tokens and the Madness Value of all cards in their Cache. The player with the most Madness has delved too deep into the dark and unknown and will never be the same. This player is eliminated.\nThe remaining players will then compare the total value of stolen relics to determine who among them was the most successful relic thief.\nIn addition to the standard game for 3 or more players, each copy of All Manor of Evil includes rules and components for a solo and 2 player variant. These Lovecraft rules can be found in the rule book.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge.

Command Points, Battle Points, Knowledge Points are always useful even in small amounts, allowing the players to take lots of actions during their turn. Cards do also possess colors that when matched together can create powerful combos and trigger additional effects.\nHowever, such mechanic is not just tied to the hand you draw! Upgrading cities with buildings is also a key part of the game: once a building is erected it both generates resources and contributes in combos every turn. More complex strategies can really push the opponent in a corner, turn after turn!\nBut, if you were to prefer more straightforward plans... spectacular head-on attacks are an option too! Isn\u2019t it nice to spend those hard-earned Command Points on top tier cards, picking them together and unleash a mighty combo to your enemy? What a better way to break your opponent\u2019s morale than directly destroying one of their beloved cities?\nOh... yes, we know, we know. Sometimes annoying things like Troops could stand in your way to victory. Or maybe you just do not like to dent your shiny weapons. We got you covered on that too, it may appear a little expensive at first, but we are talking about wiping out an entire city, buildings and troops along with it in one swift move. Condemn a City with the mark of Volfyirion and let the dragon bring fear to the heart of your rival!\nDuring our Mysthea Kickstarter campaign, we received a ton of requests from our backers wondering if there was a chance to tell the story of the Volarees Guild\u2019s Dragon. We decided to set our new game in this amazing universe to finally tell the tale of the dreadful dragon Volfyirion.\nThe process of designing Volfyirion was extremely exciting. We took this opportunity to expand game lore and Mysthea history, while also working with Travis to create a Dragon that could fit this amazing universe. \nAt first we thought Volfyirion should be represented with its head up right, to better showcase its design and shape. After working on it a bit, we decided that it wasn\u2019t dynamic enough for a dreadful dragon. We tried to move the head aside but it didn\u2019t really enhance all the features of the dragon.\nThe dragon design was solid though, so we decided to work more on the pose. At first we tried to point Volfyirion\u2019s face upwards with all its tail down on the ground and its claws up in the air. We felt it was cool, but it wasn\u2019t much of a dragon posture. Lastly, we tried to take advantage of its peculiar shape and we developed the last pose on the right.\nWe gathered a lot of feedback and we understood that this pose was really appreciated. We believe that Volfyirion with its tail wrapped around its body and the menacing look is the one that represents it better and we decided to go down this route. \nThis pose showcases all its might and how dangerous it would be to face it. It's also really easy to grip, and that's a plus since the mini gets moved a lot on the Card Game!\nPLAY\n\nCheck out the final design and zoom on every detail with the interactive Volfyirion 3D model!\nWe know that a lot of mini painters are going to work on this mini, so we decided to see what the results could be and we asked Bellerofonte Art Studio powered by Kimera Models (Francesco Farabi, Pietro Balloni, Matteo Di Diomede) to paint a resin prototype of Volfyirion. The results are amazing. See for yourself!\nVolfyirion painted by Francesco Farabi\nAnother angle of his stunning work\nWe decided to create this Graphic Novel, illustrated by Eren Ar\u0131k, to engage with our community and to create the story that would lead to the events of this campaign video. \nThe plot has been community sourced, we have been giving each week choices to our readers on how the plot should've advance. This is the final result!\nYou can read it on our website!\nSixty years before the breakthrough which brought the Champions of Ilvash to the Five floating islands, the lands of Mysthea were a radically different place: the wars of the Somber Years just ended and at this point in time only two states were ruling the lands floating above Icaion. \nThese two states were the forces which during the Somber Years conquered all other smaller states, expanding their dominion over all known land. As they grew in power, the Kingdom of Ahatils and the Kitrean Empire, remained on the brink of conflict.\nWhile skirmishes and various small battles still took place at the border between the two forces, they persisted for the moment in a kind of truce while recovering from the previous conflict, and preparing for the inevitable great war between them to come.\nKing Retudran Ahatils, being too occupied with the happenings and potential troubles at the front as he was, was not interested in managing the lands he had already conquered during the Somber Years, viewing governance as a trivial and unimportant task to be delegated. In the King\u2019s heart, he remained more conqueror than ruler.\nAdministration of the newly conquered provinces was delegated to the King\u2019s trustworthy ex-military commanders who had showed ability in the field. As a reward for their services, the King would grant them a household name, and the power to manage and rule over certain provinces- granted that the King himself would retain true ownership of the lands. But in time it became clear that the provinces were terribly unruly and unlawful, and the King was interested neither in overseeing nor imposing his will or law. Therefore, each province became autonomous in its own decision making. And moreover, each province developed to be different from the next.\nThe King trusted his men to a certain degree, but he also felt the need to establish some method to ensure they would never play clever tricks on him. So, he established that each province should act as a watchdog of its neighbors, reporting directly to him in the event of any unusual whispers of trouble.\nIn the region of Rykalad there was once a powerful and proud kingdom that fought valiantly before losing the war against Ahatils during the Somber Years. This kingdom\u2019s capital, the city of Kyradar, was built over an intensely powerful anomaly which to this day remains active deep below the city. This anomaly amplifies the way in which Qoam resonates, allowing the former citizens of the conquered city to develop peculiar abilities such as the ability to forge objects with rare properties.\nThis kingdom\u2019s heritage was uniquely shaped by the presence of such a strong power. The capital together with its six satellite provinces was once a peaceful kingdom interested solely in scholarly pursuits and the study of Qoam manipulation.\nWhen King Athalis reached the region of Rykalad during the Somber Years, it became clear to him how dependent the city of Kyradar had become on its six provinces. He henceforth decided that the best way to conquer the region would be to first overtake these satellite cities and then proceed to siege the capital. \nHis strategy was victorious and after his conquest the former city of Kyradar devolved into wild and uninhabited ruins while the King\u2019s men ruled the region from the surrounding six cities. He could restore the city to its former glory after the war ended; there was no need to waste resources now. But when the war finally ended, the King had nearly forgotten about Kyradar and forsook the city where it lay in utter ruin.\nTwo Houses were assigned to manage these lands: the Volarees House and the Rorius House, each one with three cities under their control.\nLife in these areas was not much different from life in other conquered lands, with the two Houses ruling the lands and maintaining a watchful eye over each other\u2019s deeds. This continued until the ominous day that a terrible beast never before seen glided from the sky onto the ruins of Kyradar, likely attracted by the anomaly and the power it emanated.\nThe two Houses understood immediately that the beast- an incredible and fearsome dragon- was awesomely powerful and most certainly empowered by the energy from the anomaly.\nThe dragon remained settled in the ruins of that place while the two Houses cautiously sent scouts and explorers in attempts to comprehend the beast\u2019s nature. Those first encounters with the dragon were terrible: many men lost their lives to these meetings. But the two houses understood from these encounters that it might be possible to use Qoam manipulation to have the dragon under their own control. With further encounters and experiments, the Houses discovered they could tame the beast, and each House rushed to do this, both wanting to reach the terrible beast before the other won its favor.\nThe two Houses clashed into war, trying to stop the other from gaining control of the dreadful Volfyirion.\nWant to learn what happened after these events and how Volarees become the revered Guild of Nobility?

The game is being developed for Nintendo Switch and PC. Thief's Roulette takes the narrative heavy design of Visual Novels and combines it with immersive, first person Puzzle gameplay to create a unique gaming experience. With Thief's Roulette I hope to take the player on a journey through betrayal, deception, and trust. Player freedom through choices, building alliances or creating rivals will be the driving force of the game.\nSTORY\nThief's Roulette takes place in a far off future Earth, where people are no strangers to android life, body augmentation or any of the other concepts of a high-tech society. Our characters live with it every day, to them its the way things have always been. That is simply the world they inhabit, and it all takes a back seat to the terrible events that the characters must face.\nLady Luck's sign. Will you ever see her face?\nYou awake in a strange place surrounded by unfamiliar faces. You have all been kidnapped and forced to compete for your lives in a series of challenges, hosted by a mysterious woman calling herself Lady Luck. She claims you have all been taken to her Casino. When the group is split into 3 Teams you learn the horrible truth of this game. To win means to sentence your opponents to death. \nAll 15 Strangers were chosen for a reason. Lady Luck proclaims them to all be thieves, liars and con men. All things she despises. For her, they will perform in a game of both trust and deception. To win you must deceive yet you must also work together. But in a room full of liars, who can you trust? \nLADY LUCK\u2019S GAME\nBefore the games can begin, the 15 Contestants are randomly assigned to 3 Teams of 5. From there, they will enter their respective challenge rooms and attempt to complete the task the fastest. The catch, is that both 2nd and 3rd Place Teams will have to take part in the Marking Roulette. Members of the 2 teams are randomly Marked for Death. If you are ever Marked twice, you will be Executed.\nA party of 4, nothing but death could have led to this.\nThis means that if you are Marked and your Team gets 2nd Place, being Marked again means you die, if you are lucky and are not chosen, you live. However, for the 3rd Place Team, the Marking Roulette Spins Twice. Being in Third Place doubles your chance of being Marked and Killed.\nHe's just looking out for you, right?\nAfter every Round in the Challenge Rooms, the Teams are randomly scrambled once more. So you will not always be with the same teammates. All Marks will remain even after changing teams. You must complete all 7 of Lady Luck's Challenges. Whoever remains in the End may leave this place alive.\nOne last thing! When a Team gets 1st Place, one Player from that team is randomly selected to receive the Trade Token. The 3rd Place Team will have one Player randomly selected to receive the Reroll Token.\nThe Trade Token can only be used right after the Teams have been scrambled. With this Token you may swap places with anyone else on any Team. \nThe Reroll Token can only be used right after the Marking Roulette. With it, you may choose to Reroll the Marking process. Perhaps for a more ideal result.\nThese Tokens can only be used once. You are allowed to give, trade or steal Tokens. You are also not obligated to ever use them. That choice is yours. At certain points in the game You (the Player) will receive these Tokens. How, when, or if at all you choose to use them will have a major effect on the game\u2019s story.\nA rotating number Puzzle.\nIn Thief's Roulette there is heavy emphasis on exploration and discovery when it comes to the Challenges. In the Challenge Rooms you have full control of your character in a first person view. You can run, crouch and interact with things in your environment. These mechanics and more intend to make exploring the Challenge rooms as engaging as possible.\nHand/Eye/Mouth\nThese are your means of communicating and interacting with the world. My imaginary QA Testers calls it the HEM system, for Hand, Eye, and Mouth. Upon activation, you are given the ability to perform one of these 3 commands. This system is how all of the game\u2019s puzzles and mysteries are solved. They also allow for more common interactions.\n Hand: Use to touch things in the environment. You can pull levers, open doors, grab items or tap a character on the shoulder to get their attention.\n Eye: Use to focus on points of interest in the environment. Upon usage, your character gives an analysis of what they are seeing.\n Mouth: Use to talk or make noise.This is mainly for speaking with characters, but there are more clever uses for this option as well. I won't spoil what those are, so you\u2019ll just have to trust me!\nEvery one of the HEM options have additional uses that players will discover over the course of the game.\nA simple cipher\nAlong with the HEM System, and not only in the Challenge Rooms, you have ITEMS. Items are used to solve the various Puzzles of the game. They can be examined, some items can be combined together to form a new item, and some only have use outside of Challenge Rooms. During the moments you spend outside of Challenges, you will come across unique items that can be put to use in special ways. \nEach of the game's 7 Challenges have a Room that is unique visually, and in regard to their objectives. You will be required to carefully examine your environment, use items and tools found in the room, and solve logic puzzles.The 3 Teams are competing to complete these Challenges before the others. \nIt is worth noting that as the Player, your Team\u2019s placement is determined by choices you make, rather than a proficiency for puzzle solving. I don\u2019t want the story to be led by how fast you can rush through the gameplay! \nBreak Time\nThere is a Routine to Lady Luck\u2019s Game. On the First Day, the Contestants perform in 2 Challenges with short breaks in between. After both Challenges, the Players are given the rest of the day off. During these breaks, the Player is free from Challenges for the time being. Each Contestant has an assigned Room in the Living Quarters and are allowed to freely explore The Casino.\nEveryone is given their own room in Lady Luck's Casino.\nAfter Break Time is done, the contestants will awake to a new set of Challenges. 2 More for the Day and it's back to Break. After every day of Challenges, The Casino expands and new locations become accessible\nDuring Break Times you can investigate the Facility using your full range of skills (the HEM system). You can gather bits of backstory and clues about Lady Luck\u2019s Game and the outside World.\nYou may also speak with any of the living contestants. After all, they will be taking part in the Break as well. Gather more information about the characters you\u2019re stuck with, or simply call it a Day and get some sleep.\nSpecial events can happen during the Break, as your choices can lead to unique encounters with the other Characters. \nIf you're ever in need of assistance, ask one of your Teammates.\nFEATURES\nA gripping story of deception. Who you choose to align with may either lead to your death or your survival.\nHeavy Player Choices that can alter the path of the Story.\nMultiple Endings\nImmersive and Intricate Puzzles to Solve.\nA Natural approach to Difficulty: Any time during a Puzzle, you may ask your teammates for help. Players who want to take on the challenge with no clues can simply not ask for assistance.\nFully explorable 3D Environments and VN Style Artwork.\nA cast of unique characters with their own goals and personalities. Some are only out for themselves, others may have your back when the time comes.\nThe Main Character - Lady Luck mistakenly wiped too much of his memory. Lucky you.\nI will be Showcasing the rest of the Cast as the Campaign goes on! \n*Thief's Roulette will come with Very Partial Voice Acting if we do not hit the Final Goal.\n\u201cIs this a visual novel?\u201d\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe?\n\"What do you know?\"\nThief's Roulette is a game that I've wanted to do for years. Its inspired by some of my all time favorite games so I hope to do them justice. I believe Thief's Roulette is my chance to show my skills as a game designer and story teller. The game has gone through numerous revisions along this journey, but the 2 main themes have always stayed the same: Strangers forced to perform in a deadly game, and puzzle solving through exploration and discovery. \n\"Where is the demo?\"\nCurrently, the game is in its very early stages! A demo is not quite ready, but the majority of the game's gameplay features are in place, and functional (you can see this much in the Trailer). Still, some of the core features require more attention, so releasing it right now would likely hurt me more than it would help. My optimism made me think it'd be done by the time the Kickstarter launched, but it's not. Because of that, this first Demo will be released to all backers regardless of Tier. \nThis Demo will consist of the Cast waking up in Lady Luck's facility and learning about the Game they will take part in. You'll be taken through one full Challenge Room, and the Demo will end after a Marking Roulette. You'll get to meet every character and get a feel for the game. The demo will be out 1-2 months after the Campaign. This gives me the time to use those funds to polish what I have now, and make sure your first time in Thief's Roulette is as memorable as possible.\nSome early concept art, more characters are on the way\n\"Who are you?\"\nMy name is Malik Brown, I tend to go by hiromu656 on the internet. I am an Artist and Animator from Chicago. As an animator my primary focus was short, hand drawn stories, but I also enjoy working in 3D. I have a passion for art and I've been playing video games my whole life. For some years now, I've been creating small scale games, and I think I'm finally ready for something big. I\u2019m the sole member of the Thief's Roulette team, so I am currently handling the Art, Story, and Development on my own. Music on the other hand, I am having made by my friends. They\u2019re working for free as of now and that never sat right with me. Hopefully with Kickstarter we can change that.\n\"How will the money be used?\"\nWell first, I know that a percentage of funds will go to Kickstarter. With the remainder, I will finally get to paying my sound friends. Since I\u2019m doing this solo at the moment, hiring a Programmer is the main priority. I\u2019m confident in my ability to create the Art and Assets, but handling code on top of that makes this process longer than it needs to be. A successful Campaign means I get to focus my attention on the Art, and we can get the game out much sooner. Although I am happy with the current character art, I want to have a chance to take them all under the knife once more. A full upgrade to all art assets, and especially the environment, is what I'd love to do. Success here, means that I can afford to.\nThat\u2019s about it. If you have any questions at all, ask away! Thank you for reading this far, and I hope you choose to support the project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCan't think of many risks, but challenges will surely pop up. As I've said on the main page, the Project's main hurdle is how I can balance the game's coding and all of the game's art as the sole developer. With enough funding I can hire a Programmer for the team so that I'm not wearing myself thin. The project is about 90% written out, characters sketched and all that good stuff. The hard part will be transferring all of that to the game world. I'm very well prepared on that front, but I know firsthand that things never go as smooth as you would hope.

That being said, here is what I have to show this time:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #81", "update_userinfo": "Update", "update_content": "This will be a quick rundown of the progress I've made since the last update.\nI've been doing more work on the game's storytelling and how scenes flow. I've actually been remaking the way that cutscenes work after putting out that Backer Demo. It feels a bit choppy going from the free movement sections to the literal VN style scenes. I want to find a better way to make it all feel connected. Nothing to really show there, but it will be an important change when it's done. "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #80", "update_userinfo": "Recent Progress Rundown", "update_content": "This will be a pretty short update. Much of what I've been working on isn't something that I'd like to show, so I will just talk about it.\nSince the last update I've been working primarily on non-challenge room environments. For example: what you see before you ever begin Thief's Roulette (Lady Luck's game), the facility as a whole, and the Dreams. Regarding those Dreams, if you've played or seen the recent Backer Demo, you will have gotten a glimpse of the dream visuals or at least my approach, but they do not represent the game's actual dreams. In case anyone is wondering, they are an important part of the game. The dreams have a reason and you will discover that when you play. ;)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #79", "update_userinfo": "February recap and March plans", "update_content": "This month there was a lot of work done on getting the game presentable on all fronts. I've made improvements to character art, UI/menus, and many environments. There was technically a demo release this month as well, but I had to keep it backer only. That turned out to not be the worst thing, however, because backers had some very good feedback for me that greatly improved the game. So in the end it worked out, but I still would like to get a public demo released sooner rather than later.

Looks like we\u2019re going hunting for Dooley and our Stretch Goals!\nStretch goal 2 (underway) - Honey, I Shrunk The Detective\nA poorly-picked gift by Dooley leaves McQueen to traverse the corporate jungle. How did it get so dusty down here?\nStretch Goal 1 (hit!) - The Darkside Detective Anthology\nMcQueen and Dooley aren't the only people in Twin Lakes and they certainly aren't the only ones living interesting lives. The Anthology Case consists of a number of short shorts focused on a day in the life of other characters you've met in Season 1 \u2013 The Bloodwolves, Ghouley and McScream, and Raxa.\nYou might have thought that solving season 1\u2019s nine bizarre cases would have cleared the books on spooky crime in Twin Lakes, but you\u2019d have thought wrong. Those schmucks at Spooky Doorway have crafted a whole new season of paranormal puzzles for you to investigate, starting with finding Officer Dooley!\nThat\u2019s right, at the end of season 1, everyone\u2019s favourite character named Patrick Dooley, got himself lost in the Darkside\u2026 Only you and McQueen can save him. Heck, only you and McQueen will even look.\n\u201cBut guuuUUuuuuyyyss!\u201d we hear you cry, \u201cI didn\u2019t play season 1, I don\u2019t know what any of this means!\u201d - don\u2019t worry, you can play it right blooming now! We\u2019ve even set up a tier for people who want to buy both copies. But, if you\u2019d rather skip over season 1 (for some eldritch reason) then it\u2019s worth mentioning that The Darkside Detective is modelled off classic cartoons like The Simpsons, meaning it\u2019s a series of stand-alone stories. You can dive straight into season 2 right off the bat and start enjoying the award-winning comedy that has won the hearts of many. We\u2019ll even include a \u2018PREVIOUSLY ON\u2019 to bring you up to speed. Netflix ain\u2019t got squat on us.                                                 \nTry the first 2 cases of Season 1 for free!\n                                              \nThe Darkside Detective Season 2 will be available on Mac, PC, Linux and Nintendo Switch.\n     Where cultists crawl, where demons dwell, where the occult\u2026 occults? you\u2019ll find Detective Francis McQueen, of the criminally underfunded Darkside Division. \nWhen evil darkens the doorsteps of Twin Lakes City \u2013 hell, even when it just loiters around shop fronts or hangs out in shady alleyways \u2013 he\u2019s there, ready to investigate the cases that nobody else will. He is The Darkside Detective.     \n  The Darkside Detective is a classic point and click adventure game with a distinct sense of humour. Season 1 came with six cases and had three extra cases added post launch. Season 2 will also contain 6 cases, each containing 45 plus minutes game play.  \nJoin Detective McQueen and Officer Dooley as they investigate these bizarre cases ranging from the occult to the supernatural, anything is possible in this adventure game.\nTwin Lakes is just like any other American city \u2013 mean streets, twenty-four hour diners, trans-dimensional doorways\u2026 wait, no. No, that last thing isn\u2019t right. It is, in fact, far from right. But it is common in Twin Lakes.  \nSomething is wrong in the city, an evil exists here, overlapped but out of sync with the world as we know it. A place that shouldn\u2019t exist, but does. A place that goes unwritten about in their papers, full of things that go unjudged in their courts. A place that Lonely Planet described as \u201cIndescribable.\u201d  \nWhen flesh-hungry tentacles rise from the sewers, when the moon shines extra red, and when one sock goes missing from the dryer, you can bet that somehow the Darkside is involved\u2026  \nSeason 1\u2019s nine cases brought us across the city of Twin Lakes, investigating incidents at the local library, the subway, the museum, police station, the woods, local shops, homes and more. Season 2 takes us to places both familiar and new:\n Including a trip overseas\u2026\n ...to sunny old Ireland\nAnd, of course, we\u2019ll explore more of the Darkside itself...\nThe Darkside Division\nYou might ask how a city operates when the forces of evil are around every corner and in every coffee shop (hogging the nice window seats and bathroom stalls right when you need them). Well, ignorance is bliss and the people of Twin Lakes are pretty blissful. Most don\u2019t even believe anything strange is going-on. But thanks to people like Police Chief Scully and Detective McQueen there are a few precautions against the darkness \u2013 occult items are banned, vampires are on a no-fly list and there is the Darkside Division, the two-man operation responsible for enforcing the more esoteric rules of Twin Lakes and investigates strange goings-on across the city. McQueen and his sidekick Officer Dooley are, for better or worse, the first and last line of defence against things that go bump in the night (things that go bump during the day are the jurisdiction of another department).  \nChief Scully\nEven now McQueen still isn\u2019t sure what Scully witnessed to finally open her mind to his requests to start up the Darkside Division. For months she had been rejecting it over and over and suddenly, one day she called him into the office to approve it. She never explained why, but since then she\u2019s been funding his investigations and covering for him when things go slightly awry\u2026 She\u2019s from a prominent family in the city, and in fact, she\u2019s the new mayor\u2019s twin sister. Strangely, though, McQueen could swear he remembers her telling him she is an only child...     \nRaxa Anand\nRaxa is a student in Twin Lakes University (majoring in the occult and minoring in computer science). To help pay for her tuition fees, she\u2019s become an Inspooktor - a franchise of ghost hunters, most of whom are charlatans on late night cable access. Raxa\u2019s seen things, though, real things. As a result, she\u2019s become an ally to The Darkside Division helping with technical matters on a few cases.    \nThe Brightside Division \nMost things in Twin Lakes have a Darkside counterpart and our heroes are no exception. Chief Ghouley and Special Agent McScream have their fair share of run-ins with McQueen and Dooley, usually over jurisdictional affairs.\nTheir personalities are mirrors to that of McQueen and Dooley, with Ghouley being competent but cold and McScream being unhinged, howling at the moon and speaking in riddles.\nOthers\nTwin Lakes boasts a population of 75,666 residences (nobody is sure if the Darkside has census data). Season 1 introduced us to over 140 of them, but that still leaves a whole lot of new faces for us to meet!\nWe don\u2019t want to give too much away, but there are still all manner of wibblies to investigate in Twin Lakes. Some cases we\u2019ve subtly set up in season 1, while others have freshly baked in our brains!\nWithout discussing the mysteries themselves, season 2 will see the guys taking on a fun fair, a retirement home, an amateur wrestling circuit and their scariest case yet - their high-school reunion!\nThe Darkside Detective is developed by Spooky Doorway, an Irish studio made up of three devs who met on a cursed island off the Irish coast. They formed a pact to work together on something, but had no idea what. One game jam later (and with the help of several wonderful friends) The Darkside Detective was born.\nThose three devs were (and, barring some slight loss of self, continue to be):\nPaul Conway - Art - @DoomCube\n Dave McCabe - writing - @davetheallthing\n Treasa McCabe - Development - @FarrellyTracey\nNeed something to cover up that sentient patch of mould that whispers dark secrets and keeps you awake at night? Then this fancy-pants poster is for you! For added protection we\u2019ll sign the ancient sigils that make up our names on it, too.\nStick it on your laptop, your school books or that angry child who\u2019s always looking funny at you in the mall. However you do it, let the world know you\u2019re a fan of The Darkside Detective. How else will evil know to leave you alone?\nEver look at your t-shirts and think \u201cwhat is this cotton-polyester-blended muck?\u201d Well, you won\u2019t need them once you get this exclusive shirt. You\u2019ll be the talk of the town. Which town and why they are talking about you are questions best left unasked.\nTry decipher the devs\u2019 chicken scrawl and find out what\u2019s written on your card. Is it a joke? The meaning of life? Is it part of a larger riddle that will only get solved when all cards are gathered and aligned correctly? There\u2019s only one way to find out.\nHalf art book, half lore book, half activity book, the Almanac has it all \u2013 unseen case files, new lore about Twin Lakes and the Darkside, puzzles, the Bloodwolf charter, newspaper clippings, rituals, bios on citizens, criminals and beasties and more!\nYour face, in the style of the game's portraits, printed onto a poster with McQueen and Dooley \u2013 be the pixillated criminal your teachers always knew you could be!\n *Characters appearing in the game will have your appearance and name, but final say on their actions and dialogue sits with Spooky Doorway. We'll endevour to ensure you say or do nothing embarasing or offensive, but it will be in tone with other characters in the world.\nMilestone 1 - get the cash!\nMilestone 2 - make the game!\nMilestone 3 - deliver it!\nMilestone 4 - profit!  \n\u201cHold up, chums - why are there no dates on any of these milestones?\u201d  \nOoooh, you caught us! We know from making Season 1 and the additional cases that came afterwards that each case takes the time it takes. As the world gets bigger and cases get longer, we want to make sure that quality doesn\u2019t drop. That\u2019s not our style, daddios. To give us the room to do deliver that quality we foresee an 18 month dev cycle. As most things in The Darkside Detective are bespoke - the gags, locations, puzzles, music, etc - we can\u2019t break it down more than that (sometimes a case goes really smoothly, sometimes it needs a lot of iteration ), so instead of a timeline, have this nice cakechart (we don\u2019t like pie) of where the money is going:\n \u201cYeah guys, why the Kickstarter? You already made the first one, didn\u2019t that make you enough cash? Jeez!\u201d  \nGood question, fictional friend. Yes, the Darkside Detective Season 1 made us some cash, but a lot of that went into porting the game and making new content for it. More is being invested into further ports and localisation of season 1. And, as we made season 1 with no budget, we had some debts to clear. We do however have some money left over, which is going into Darkside season 2. But games aren\u2019t cheap to make and we need a little help to bulk out what we have. That\u2019s why we\u2019re only looking for \u20ac35k. Games costs a lot of money to make and businesses are expensive to run, after all!  \nAlso, this Kickstarter will give us an idea of how much interest there is in a season 2. We\u2019re old people and don\u2019t know how much time we have left. We want to make sure that if we sink it into a season 2, that people will want to play it. Otherwise we\u2019ll just go outside and play with our families and pets.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere\u2019s not that many, actually.

Play the Demo!\nEnjoy a sneak peek of life on the mean streets of Cradlebridge...\n___\nThree months ago, you died. And in that moment you were reborn as something new. A monster. A predator. Not a creature of the night, but one of its masters.\nUnfortunately, things aren't simple as they used to be. Vampires have finally been exposed, and though your existence is tolerated, your new nature is not. You came to the City hoping for a new start, but found only suspicion and starvation. Now you stare at the ceiling of your cheap hotel room as a penniless outcast, suckling on rats and destined to wither away.\nBut every new era brings new opportunities, and in the political chaos of a world gone mad, even an outcast may rise. An outcast can change everything.\nThis is the story of how you rose.\nLatest Updates\n#10 - Nighthawks Exposed - City of Colours\n#11 - Nighthawks Exposed - Second Death\n#12 - Nighthawks Exposed - Flashbacks\n#13 - One Week Remains - Stretch Goals, The Demo, Cats\nPress?

Check the bottom of the page for assets, including a YouTube version of the trailer to share, or e-mail contact@nighthawks-game.com.\nEmbrace the Night \nYour new life begins... on the wrong side of the tracks in a city that hates you.\nNighthawks is the brand new urban fantasy RPG from Wadjet Eye Games (The Blackwell Legacy, Unavowed, Technobabylon) and writer/designer Richard Cobbett (Sunless Sea/Sunless Skies, The Long Journey Home). The initial concept for the game came when working on Sunless Skies and dreaming of seeing that calibre of interactive fiction merged with the atmosphere of some of his favourite urban-fantasy books and games, in particular 2004's Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines... and then deciding he wanted to play that new game far too much to just leave the idea sitting in the mental \"What If?\" folder.\nWhich brings us to now. Welcome to the mean streets of a city grudgingly trying to show that humans and vampires can live together, despite the cynicism and conspiracies raging on both sides. It's a place of bleak horror and dark humour, filled with monsters who don't all have fangs and a thirst for blood, and featuring new stories down every dark alley. What part will you play, and how will you turn a newly awakened world to your advantage?\nAbout The Game \nRun your own nightclub, as your personal sanctuary and a trap for unwary visitors.\nNighthawks is a mix of story-driven RPG and undead life-simulation, where every decision you make is another move in your chess game against the world. Invest your time into learning new skills or honing your fighting style as you uncover the city's mysteries and venture deep into its darkest secrets. Gather fellow outcasts to your side, binding them with favours and choosing when to cash in. Manage your eternal thirst, legitimately, or balancing the risks of being caught stalking unwary victims and working the black markets.\nAnd of course, what would a vampire be without a few secret powers? Choose from a range of dark Gifts, including Corpse-Talking, Tenebraean Form and Mesmerise. Be careful to hide all evidence of them from the authorites, while keeping them ready as your ace in the hole. Embrace your vampire side, sprinkle a little cinnamon in your blood to handle that pesky iron aftertaste, and get ready to live the nocturnal nine-to-five.\nStructurally, think a freeform RPG core, with stories branching off it - some funny, some tragic, some horrific - where your decisions are always bleeding together. Get caught lying too often and your untrustworthy reputation will follow you around, while raising suspicion will draw the attention of first mortal, and then darker authorities. Do you, for instance, break a window and hurriedly search a crime scene while the alarms wail, pick the lock and explore at your leisure, or use vampire powers to impersonate the security guard and walk right in? The choice is yours, and all part of learning the beat of the city, developing new skills, and building up favours and contacts to help seize the day by the throat.\nChoose Your Friends Carefully... \nKnowledge is power. Your bartender Rebecca hears everything that's going on in town.\nNever travel alone. Befriend and recruit a wide circle of fellow outcasts, such as Madame Lux, vampire stage magician capable of fooling any eye with delusions of light. Con-artist turned cult-leader Maze. Vampire enforcer Saiorse, as comfortable discussing great works of opera as she is getting her claws into the most dangerous dockland fighting pits. Former Queen of the Black Sea Inez, a ruthless pirate out of her time. Disgraced scientist Morgan Shah, funding her attempts to cure vampirism by selling crystal meth. Maybe even Samuel, a former doctor cursed with good intentions and a withered brain that considers no fate worse than death for patients who end up in his care. No matter how much they beg.\nCompanions here don't just fight for you. Take part in their lives as they work on their own problems, have them look into rumours with their own contacts and social circles and dive into their deepest secrets with interactive flashbacks set in locations like 17th century Nassau, Las Vegas, and the corrupt European courts of the Eternal Dynasties. Help them handle their demons, and they'll help you deal with yours. But good deeds rarely go unpunished, and everyone has their own agenda that consumes their endless nights.\nEnter The Story  \nWith every choice comes consequence. How will you live your second life?\nWhy are we focusing on text? The possibilities! Games like Sunless Sea and 80 Days and Cultist Simulator have repeatedly demonstrated this over the last few years, and we intend Nighthawks to be seen in that company - a deep, wide, replayable RPG in which a favour can be the ultimate weapon and the friendliest smiles often have the sharpest teeth.\nText-driven gameplay lets us really focus on details and mechanics, including bringing you a living city with little seen features like NPC scheduling (you might, for instance, know a guy who'll slip you blood from the hospital blood bank, but he only works Tuesdays to Fridays and it's Saturday), varied stories, incredibly reactive characters, and most importantly, player freedom. You're planning to head out on a quest you were expecting to pay for your hotel room this week, but the friend you wanted to bring along isn't available. Do you wait? Take someone else? Risk going alone? Hope for another opportunity?\nWe're drawing inspiration from a wide range of RPG classics, from Baldur's Gate 2 to Yakuza to Bloodlines to Fallout to Quest For Glory, and in particular, their sense of freedom and focus on letting you live in their worlds. In Nighthawks, you're in charge of your destiny, whether it's running your nightclub sanctuary, playing politics, or plunging into stories that range from light-hearted adventure and modern political intrigue to blisteringly bleak horror.\nMeet The Team \nJust a few of the games our team has worked on...\nAll that said, it's also going to look and sound great! Along with Richard Cobbett on words and design, we have Ben Chandler (Unavowed, Shardlight) and Ivan Ulyanov (The Charnel House Trilogy) on art, painting a 'living book' style that combines backgrounds and animated ambient effects in glorious 4K resolution.\nLast, but definitely not least, we have adventure game legend Dave Gilbert (The Shivah, The Blackwell Legacy, Unavowed) acting as executive producer and overseer of the whole project, cracking whips and ensuring things stay on track. Budget allowing, we also hope to bring in additional writers to help produce extra-varied stories and characters, as well as other experts to help polish everything up to a fine shine. On top of all that, we're bringing a full voice cast to breathe life into the characters, and of course, plenty of original music.\nThe Biz Side \nWe're looking at a development cycle of around 18 months, not including time already invested to get to this stage. We're not doing physical rewards like pins and posters, so as to be able to spend every dollar on creating the best RPG we can make. Instead, we're focusing on rewards that let backers at every level become immortalised within the game itself. Be the vampire you deserve to be... or the unwary blood-bag, or undead hunter, or crooked cop, or depraved sewer abomination. Are you ready to be killed by yourself?\nTarget Platforms and Beta Access \nA living city full of stories. Write yours.\nOur key platforms at the moment are PC and Mac. We also hope to bring Nighthawks to iOS at release, and will be looking at other platforms closer to the release date.\nAs for beta testing, we don't believe in offering it as a reward tier - you're helping us! - but there will be opportunities to sign up and take part in that during development.\nCommunity\nJoin the Discord!

We're a small team, aiming to bring you more design innovation with text, careful art and a tight budget than many AAA RPGs and developers with all their fancy polygons and resources.\n\nBut that's the fun part! And we can do it. We're all interactive fiction veterans with multiple titles to our name, using well-established tools like Ink and Unity to bring you a game we think will be both special, and the deep urban fantasy experience gamers have been dying for. The main risk is that development time is always hard to predict, save that everything always takes a bit longer than expected, and stretch goals especially always mean extra work to get things right. But we will.

However, the pieces are in place, and I think they're working pretty well.

Your deck is instead made for you based on your player state, companion, weapons (one melee, one ranged) and stats, and any injuries or similar you might already have sustained.

Keys will be given after the campaign, once the pledges have successfully been processed.\nHarem Route Successfully Unlocked!!\n  Love Esquire is a romantic-comedy visual novel/dating simulator, with a nostalgic touch of old-school RPG combat.\nIn this game, you're not a famous knight, but a good-for-nothing squire who's on a quest to find man's greatest pleasure. Getting the girl won't be easy though, since most of them are waaay out of your league!\nTo make things worse: you have a few months left before this huge war happens, and the only thing you know is how to milk cows. Good luck cramming years worth of training into four months! If it's any consolation, you get a medal if you die. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nNo one believes that a lowly squire can save the world while banging \u2013 err, bagging \u2013 the girl of his dreams... but with a shitton of dumb luck, well... you might just prove them wrong!\nWelcome to the world of Love Esquire, and may the fertility god have mercy on your virginity.\nWhose name will these girls cry out during those scenes? You decide! This is your adventure, after all.\nOn an epic quest to experience man\u2019s greatest pleasure, you get to choose from five eligible ladies. Spend time with either the local farm girl, nurse, or perhaps that troublemaker from downtown. If you\u2019re feeling a bit ambitious, there\u2019s also two princesses for you to romance. Whoever you chose, these girls have their own personality quirks and unique storylines for you to discover. \nJust like in real life, you\u2019ll have to manage your time wisely in the game. Traveling, training, socializing, and searching for the girl of your dreams all take up a big chunk of your day, so plan ahead! The life of a squire may be a busy one, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should overwork! Be careful, or else you\u2019ll wake up late the next day...\nNow that your days as a farm boy are over, you get another dirty job \u2014 being a squire! But to reach some level of decency, 'Squirehood for Dummies' suggests you train these abilities (stats):\nCharisma (CHA) - a squire should always capture everyone\u2019s hearts.\nIntelligence (INT) - a squire should always know how to keep his knight alive.\nStrength (STR) - a squire should always be in top shape.\nThese stats will have an impact on your skills during combat. In addition, they also affect your relationship with the girls (each have their own preference), and influences the ending you'll get. In other words, shape up to be the ideal man for the best results!\nStats can be trained at the Barracks (STR), Tavern (CHA), and Archives (INT). Of course, the more time you spend training, the higher the resulting experience.\nWe\u2019ve added our own flavor to the classic RPG turn-based combat system! Put your skills to the test and prove your worth by battling powerful monsters during campaigns! \nPlease wait for the image to load.\nAs a squire, you have a number of \u201cunconventional\u201d ways to assist your needy knight by healing him, boosting his morale, taunting enemies, and looting gold. Properly time your actions to unleash the full potential of your skills which are simply... out of this world!\nGet to know your waifu on a personal level by being around her and talking about stuff. Sure, she\u2019ll think you\u2019re a creep at first, but persistence is key! As she eventually warms up to you, find out how there\u2019s more to her than meets the eye.  \nGiving gifts can also boost your relationship. After all, who doesn't love a man that knows how to treat his lady right? Just remember that not everyone will like the same gift, so don\u2019t give your girl the wrong items!\nYour fate is determined by the actions you take. As such, things can either go really great... or really wrong. \nWhat's waiting for your squire at the end of four months? We hope you make the right choices to get that sweet and happy ending you deserve. If not, well... let\u2019s just see what happens!\nSo that your waifus can partially express their partially undying love for you, we've teamed up with voice over veterans at Sound Cadence Studios to bring our characters to life through partial voice acting!  \nWith their help, Love Esquire boasts a professional and equally stellar cast spearheaded by VO director, Amber Lee Connors:\nThe game contains subjects and themes your parents warned you about as a kid.\nFurthermore, even though the game features a healthy amount of fanservice, ecchi and sexually suggestive illustrations, no private parts will be shown. The game will also not have an official 18+ or h-patch due to our country's legal laws. \nHowever, since parts of the game will be moddable on release, fan-made patches are possible in the future.\nLove Esquire will support simple modding. Specific parts of the game can be altered by the players, such as:\nScripts\nCGs\nBGMs & SFX\nFurther details regarding modding will be discussed in a future update. NOTE: Modding is not yet available in the alpha demo.\nThe game houses several backgrounds and CGs, all beautifully painted to give the game a polished and radiant look. Intimately explore not only the fantasy world of Caerulia, but your waifus as well. ;)\nWe want you to experience the feels while playing this game, and our soundtrack will see to that! Love Esquire has over 30 original tracks in total, with event and character themes for Squire and the five heroines. Why don't you give it a listen?\nHaving lived most of his life as a farm boy, you take control of the inexperienced and carefree Squire. Watch him grow to become the ideal man and overcome the various challenges he's yet to face.  \nHis fate (and virginity) rests in your hands.\nThese are the lovely ladies of Love Esquire. More than just pretty faces, they have their own unique personalities, story arcs, and backstories!\nFor better or for worse, these plot-important minor characters are here to see you through your journey.\nDepending on how smooth the development goes, we're looking at a late-2018 to mid-2019 release for Love Esquire. It will be distributed on Steam and Itch.io (Windows/Mac/Linux), followed by a mobile release (Android/iOS) a few months after. We don't have any plans for a console release, but that's something we might possibly consider once the game is out.\nWe've been self-funding Love Esquire's development for a year now, along with some help from our generous Patrons. But with sales from our previous game thinning down, we need additional funding to help us survive the final stretch of production. Furthermore, we want to include several features that are, unfortunately, way out of our budget. We're hoping to gather as much support as we can to realize our dreams for the game (see stretch goals). \nKickstarter is also a good way to establish rapport and communication with our players as development goes on. We highly encourage you to be involved whenever we have an update. Your feedback is essential to ensure that Love Esquire will stay on the right track!\nTo ensure your money is handled properly, here's a breakdown on how we plan to use the funds:\nArt & Animation (40%) - we want our art assets to be beautiful and polished down to the last detail, so a huge chunk of our funding will go to this department.\nWriting & Editing (20%) - while the story in Love Esquire is relatively shorter compared to an average visual novel, we still need to ensure that it has a good flow and will have the proper editing that it needs.\nProgramming (20%) - the game is being developed in Unity 3D, and we still have a couple of systems that need to be thoroughly tested. Our programmers are working hard to ensure that the game is stable with minimal bugs upon release.\nMusic (10%) - As previously mentioned, Love Esquire will have its own original soundtrack, and at least 10 more BGMs are awaiting to be composed.\nFees & Taxes (10%) - last but not the least, we need to pay the required fees and taxes to Kickstarter and the government.\nIn exchange for your kind patronage, you get these cool and awesome rewards! Thank you so much for supporting Love Esquire! \nHere are our ambitious stretch goals for the game. These goals will surely bring out the best in Love Esquire in terms of gameplay, story and overall polish. \nBecause of their scope, all of them require substantial dev time to implement, so the game's schedule will have to be adjusted accordingly. Further details will be discussed in a future update.\nThis is the bare minimum we need to ensure that we wouldn't have a very hard time finishing the game (financially, at least). This includes all the features already mentioned above.\nThis level of support will give us enough funding to implement animated backgrounds into the game. While we don't have any samples yet to show for Love Esquire, the image above shows how we handled background animations in our previous game, The Letter. \nReaching this goal will allow us to put at least ten more juicy CGs into the game! That's a loooot more plots and backstories for you! ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\nDesigns are work-in-progress, and may change in the final version.\nOur digital dakimakuras will come to fruition! We will be able to print them in the highest quality possible (2way tricot) for your hugging comfort! They will be available as an add-on through BackerKit once the campaign ends. \nNOTE: This is a pillow case only. Actual pillow is not included. \nThis guarantees that the game will be fully voiced in English, even the faceless NPCs! Because of your support, we can now afford to compensate our stellar cast for the heavy workload!\nAll CGs in the game will be animated using Spine2D for a more dramatic effect. The animation quality will be similar to the game's main menu (see video above). \nBoob physics, here we come!\nIf you allow us to go this far, we will be able to expand, upgrade and further polish our RPG campaign by refining the gameplay and adding more enemies & levels into the game! \nSample study only. Not final.\nBut wait! There's more! You will be able to bring your waifu into your adventures! Amy as your bard, or Princess Kamala as the team's mage? What could possibly go wrong!\nWe will produce a fully animated, frame-by-frame one-minute opening trailer for the game, which rivals what we did for The Letter's (see video above). The full song used in the trailer will be included in the game's original soundtrack DLC.\nWe're Yangyang Mobile, an indie company specializing in video games and mobile apps development. Our HQ in the Philippines is run by a group of passionate individuals who live off creativity and pizza! We're known for The Letter and The Diary, both interactive visual novel games.\nThe Letter was a successful Kickstarter project and a highly-rated game; it is our validation to everyone that we're not only capable of completing this project, but also delivering it up to standards. \nWith your help, we're hoping Love Esquire to become our best game yet! :)\nEven if you can't pledge to our campaign, you could contribute by helping us spread the word! It's very important for more people to know about our game. You could make fanarts or do let's plays, or tell your favorite Youtuber/Twitch Streamer/Press/Media about us! \nClick the image to download!\nYou could also show your support by using these Love Esquire avatars, and by helping achieve our social media challenge (see harem challenge above), so the game could have an official harem route!\nThe success of Love Esquire is all up to you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough there\u2019s always a chance that the game\u2019s release might be delayed, the completion of Love Esquire is extremely likely at this point, since we\u2019re already half-way through the game\u2019s development (unless the apocalypse happens). \n\nWhile we cannot promise a smooth sailing development period moving forward, what we can promise is that we\u2019ll be as transparent as possible regarding the setbacks that we\u2019re facing, and what our plans of actions are towards resolving them.\n\nWe\u2019re not new to game development, and this isn\u2019t our first title, so we\u2019re more than ready and equipped to overcome the various challenges we\u2019ve yet to face. We hope we\u2019ve garnered enough credibility, trust, and goodwill in the past to prove to everyone that we always keep our promises to the best of our abilities.\n\nThank you so much for considering to back Love Esquire, and we hope you join us in our ride! \u2661\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge HK$ 10 or more", "title": "\u272a SUPPORTER \u272a", "descp": "[About $1 USD]\nGain access to our Kickstarter updates and BackerKit, in case you want to upgrade your pledge later on.

Although we'll continue using your money to improve the game's polish and quality, we don't feel comfortable promising any further features or additional content. So... thank you for making our dream come true! Now it's our turn to repay the favor.\n Boyfriend Dungeon is an action-RPG dungeon crawler in which the weapons you use transform into beautiful people -- take them on dates to level them up and become more powerful together.\nDate up to nine weapons, from dancing swords to heart-piercing daggers\nGenerated action-combat dunj and challenges! Stay sharp!\nVarious combat styles. For example, hit hard and dodge quickly with the dagger, or take on crowds with Lasersaber\nInclusive, tasteful approach to gender and sexuality, including male, female, and non-binary romance\nLet's get to the point: take your weapon-babes on romantic outings, such as to the club or the beach\nThe couple that slays together, stays together.\n This campaign not only supports us making our dream game, but also offers you once-in-a-lifetime merchandise, including weapon-dating-based mugs, body pillowcases, pins, and other extremely practical objects.\nAwards: Boyfriend Dungeon has already won two awards at BitSummit, and has been selected for showcases, including the PAX West Indie Megabooth and the Damage Camp Arcade 2018.  \nPlatforms: Boyfriend Dungeon is developed by us, Kitfox Games, and we already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC, Mac, and Linux! Check out our Steam coming soon page and after you back us, feel free to add us to your wishlist\u2026\nWe will also offer DRM-free versions of PC, Mac, and Linux via the Humble Store.\nWhat about consoles? Or other stores? We\u2019re not ready to talk about consoles yet, sorry! This campaign is specifically to support us being able to make the best possible desktop version and merchandise.\nKitfox Games is an award-winning game studio. Boyfriend Dungeon is the fourth title we're bringing to Steam. For more information about our past games, scroll down to the section below entitled The Team.\nAs of the start of this campaign, we've now revealed all 5 of the weapons you can date (Talwar, Dagger, Epee, Lasersaber, and Glaive).\nThis campaign, in addition to helping us finish the game, will fund a 6th weapon... the cat, Brass Knuckles!\nWe don\u2019t want to give away too many spoilers, so we won\u2019t tell you everything about the weapons, but we\u2019ve prepared these dating profiles so you can get an idea of who you might prefer! If you're more interested in their combat abilities and play-styles, scroll down to see their individual tactics.\nAlternately, you can take our Wielder Test to see which one we would recommend for you.\nThe talwar is a type of curved sword or sabre from the Indian Subcontinent. (Wikipedia)\nSunder says: \"Hey, gorgeous. I didn't expect to meet someone like you in the dunj... I hope I can keep you safe. I've been around a while but don't believe everything you hear -- some people are jealous, or don't know how to forgive. But you're the open-minded type, right?\"\nDaggers have been used throughout human experience for close combat confrontations... (Wikipedia)\nValeria says: \"Oh, hey, you're cute! So.. what's your deal? You can tell me. If you want to, I mean. What? Oh, don't worry about him. He's just an old friend, looking out for me. Let's talk about you instead. Maybe you should come by my studio sometime and I'll paint you..\"\nThe entire body is the valid target area. A successful \u00e9p\u00e9e fencer must be able to anticipate their opponent's moves and strike their opponent at the correct time. (Wikipedia)\nIsaac says: \"Goodness. Let's get down to facts, shall we? I may be new to the dunj, but I know plenty about fencing. Hold onto me tightly, but not too tight. Deep breaths. Parry, then thrust. Practice makes perfect.\"\nWhen a Lasersaber powers up, he can be dangerous, but most of the time, he prefers to recharge his batteries.\nSeven says: \"Hey. I want to keep our.. friendship.. secret for now, if that's okay with you. My agent and fans are a little high-maintenance and I just want to relax. Maybe we can watch TV together sometime?\"\nThis class of polearms [is rated] above all other individual hand-to-hand combat weapons. (Wikipedia)\nSawyer says: \"UHH! I'm late for class, but.. hi! Um. Since you seem to have your life together, maybe you can show me how to cook? Would that be okay? I wouldn't want to waste your time. Let me know, but no worries if you're too busy.\"\nAnd this Kickstarter, if it succeeds, will help fund a sixth weapon, Brass Knuckles! \nBrass knuckles are designed to preserve and concentrate a punch's force... (Wikipedia)\nPocket says: \"Meow! Mew meow meow. PRR!\" Then he curled up in a ball and fell asleep. When we tried to reach him for further comment, he growled and hissed at us! It seems he's not a lapcat by nature.. and certainly not a romantic partner. Platonic love can be fulfilling, too!\nRowan says: \"Hi? This is sudden for me. I'm going to need some time. I'm - never mind. I don't want to bother you. I'll call you, but... please be patient.\" \nThrough your support, we've funded Rowan the Scythe, our second dateable non-binary weapon! They're being designed by Hato Moa, creator of Hatoful Boyfriend.\nLeah says: \u201cHey, cutie. Thanks for including me. I usually like to train alone, but maybe we can try the dunj as a team sport. It\u2019ll be an adventure. Just promise you\u2019ll try your best\u2026 and play fair.\u201d\nYou've manged to fund Leah the Hammer as another stretch goal, our second dateable female weapon!\nAxe says: \"It's a beautiful day, so... what do you say we leave these computers behind and just go hang out on the beach? Feel free to come surf with me, but... I might not talk much. I hope that's okay. I'd still like your company.\"  \nYou funded the Axe! His name will be voted on in our exclusive Discord server (any reward tier at VIP/$35 or above). Invites will be sent out for it soon after the Kickstarter ends, so hold on tight!\nYou\u2019re free to date only one weapon if you are the monoblade-ous type of person, but nobody minds if you favor grabbing multiple hilts. As you level up your love with them, each Love Rank lets you proceed further with that character\u2019s plot line(s), and also offers combat bonuses.\nYou\u2019ve been unlucky in love, but you came to Verona Beach to learn from your Cousin Jesse, who\u2019s promised to help you out. Who are you exactly? You choose! You can customize your character, and choose from him, her, or them as pronouns. This doesn\u2019t affect who you can date or what options you have.\nFair Verona Beach, where we lay our scene, is in many ways a typical southern California town. The weather\u2019s great, the surf is high, and the slang 'dunj' is dangerous. In this gig economy, some people turn to killing monsters for a quick buck\u2026 while others discover they can transform into weapons.  \nVerona Beach is populated by various other people (baristas, security guards, shop keepers, etc). They\u2019re mostly pretty nice, and some of them even care about you!  \nBut something darker lurks in Verona Beach\u2026\nUnfortunately, kissing can\u2019t solve all of your problems. Sometimes, you need a sword. Wait, stop kissing the sword. Wield it instead!\nThese days, kids get money and meet people by killing monsters in the dunj, making the world a safer place in the process. Be brave -- local authorities are willing to give you basic medical attention afterwards. Clearing local infestations is a group effort!    \nThe first dunj is the Verona Beach Center, a mall overrun by creatures most hideous. We have two more dunjs in progress, the Nightclub and something secret! Each dunj features different monster types, challenges, music, potential romantic spots to find, and secrets to discover.    \nBoss monsters may also interrupt your dunj flow, so train up and make sure you and your weapon are both ready for a tough fight!  \nBoss concepts\nSometimes there are enemies that swarm; sometimes you need to focus your attacks; sometimes you need to move around to avoid an onslaught! Some weapons will be better-suited to some dunjs and enemy encounters than others.  \nIt\u2019s up to you to find the best tactics in each situation\u2026 or you could just get more experience and level up until you one-shot them, if you prefer. A general idea of how each weapon plays: \nLeft: Talwar | Right: Dagger\nTalwar attacks and combos tend to cover a wider area, while Dagger attacks and combos tend to be quick and focus on a narrower area. \nLeft: Epee | Right: Lasersaber\nEpee attacks and combos tend to require precision but have the capability to stun, while Lasersaber attacks and combos can be upgraded to reflect projectiles and do ranged attacks! \nAll of these (plus the development of Glaive and Brass Knuckles) are likely to evolve as we continue to work on the game. We\u2019ve made good progress, but our Kickstarter backers will help us nail down many of the details in the coming months. \nWhat if it\u2019s too easy or too hard? We\u2019ll have difficulty modes, but we\u2019d also like to offer special challenges and opt-in modifiers for folks that want to, for example, make enemies have more health, or want to fight optional bosses, in exchange for more loot. This means the game will be complete-able at a basic level even by folks who normally stick to dating sims, while also offering some \"fun\" to those poor masochists who have been damaged by Dark Souls (you know who you are). \nA good relationship with your weapon starts with a romantic date. Luckily for you, Verona Beach is filled with dreamy date spots like the local museum, sunny beach, or flashy nightclub. Make the right choices and you might find your weapons warming up to you!\nAs you date each weapon, you\u2019ll learn more about them and earn their trust, making you a more effective team in combat. \nBut, in this game as in real life, every relationship is a little bit different in its benefits and demands. Some partners will teach you how to do more damage, while others will help you use skills more effectively.\nEven when you're busy slaying monsters, the dunj will feature spots for some mini-dates, because love knows no bounds. Above all, you'll be able to cultivate meaningful relationships full of supportive and inviting weapon babes... it just might take a bit of charm to get them out of their sheathes. \nYou\u2019re probably wondering what you\u2019re going to get from backing! Well, I mean, other than the eternal love and gratitude of the Kitfox team, of course.\nReceive a dev-signed postcard from Verona Beach! Available in the Long Distance Relationship tier and above.\nThe Kickstarter-exclusive enamel pin, available in the Bae Box Set tier and above.\nThe Bae Box Set includes an elegant rose USB key, in which to hide your heart's secrets.\n  Everything in the Bae Box tier.

They're an illustrator from Toronto, currently working as a Jr. Art Director for mobile games in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their past work includes animations and illustrations for Titmouse, Studio Yotta, Konami and Penguin Random House. Jessica would transform into a Shield in the dunj.\nAnimation: Sunder Raj from Particle Beam made the beautiful animation of Talwar's transformation! We'd love to hire Particle Beam to make transformation sequences for the rest of the weapons, but we'll see what we can afford... Sunder from Particle Beam would transform into a Durian in the dunj.\nJapanese Localization & Publishing: We loved working with Kakehashi Games to bring the best version of Moon Hunters and The Shrouded Isle to Japan, so we'll be working with them again for Boyfriend Dungeon. The lead of Kakehashi, Zach, would transform into a Kusarigama in the dunj.\nMerch Design & Manufacturing: We were really impressed by the Moon Hunters indiebox, so we decided to work with them to create the Boyfriend Dungeon merch, which resulted in the luscious tiers of rewards here. If you're looking to make money from shirts & pins, we recommend Indiebox, so hit up James at ConferenceMerch.com (tell him Tanya sent ya)! The lead of Indiebox, James, would transform into Nunchucks in the dunj.\nHey, we're Kitfox Games! We're an independent Montreal-based games studio with a soft spot for exploring and discovering new, dangerous worlds. Previously, we made Shattered Planet, Moon Hunters, The Shrouded Isle, and in addition to making Boyfriend Dungeon we're publishing Six Ages.\nThe Boyfriend Dungeon team\nTanya X. Short (@tanyaxshort): Captain, Lead Designer. Led Kitfox in creating Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and wrote for and published The Shrouded Isle. Previously was a senior designer on The Secret World and Age of Conan. Tanya has never said she didn't date a weapon, so you could probably say this game is based on a true story. Nobody can prove otherwise. Tanya would transform into a Sabre in the dunj.\nXin Ran Liu (@xinranliu): Art Director. Previously art directed Moon Hunters and Shattered Planet, and illustrated tons of different things, from book covers to band posters to game concept art. Xin would transform into a Chakram in the dunj.  \nMarcelo Perez (@scientistsloth): Lead Programmer. Marcelo (almost) single-handedly coded the Moon Hunters cooking system and also ported Moon Hunters to all the consoles! Now that he\u2019s almost recovered from such a feat, he\u2019s making sure Boyfriend Dungeon is better-structured for porting. Marcelo would transform into a Meteor Hammer in the dunj.\nKira Boom (@snowkittykira): Dungeon Programmer. Kira was the primary combat programmer for Moon Hunters, and previously did lots of programming on FRACT OSC. She\u2019s also part of Mindfungus, which released the adorable Cityglitch! Kira is a wielder, not a weapon.\nVictoria Tran (@thevtran): Community Manager & Public Relations. Victoria has been managing the Kitfox events, community, press, and social media for over a year now, so if you\u2019ve fallen in love with silly Boyfriend Dungeon gifs, that\u2019s her genius. Victoria would transform into a Bread Knife in the dunj.  \nHey, I Remember Moon Hunters!\nThank you to everyone who backed our first Kickstarter in 2014! Because of their help, and other funding sources, we were able to create our first big game, Moon Hunters! Moon Hunters sold decently well and won some awards, so, it\u2019s hard to complain. Plus we released it with only a few months of delay -- not bad.\nWe learned a few lessons along the way, which we\u2019re applying to Boyfriend Dungeon, like to carefully structure support for potential future DLC. There was also Shattered Planet and the Shrouded Isle, but we didn\u2019t Kickstart them. I hope you still bought them. We sure learned a lot from those, too.\nThere are also a few Kitfoxes working on a different game (you might wonder where Jongwoo went, for example), but they are using a different source of funding, and none of the Kickstarter money will go to them. Speaking of which... \nWithout your help, we don't know when Boyfriend Dungeon will happen or when we can finish the game as it demands. Plus, with this campaign, we can add the cat as a weapon and make all of the dates, dungeons, and everything in between as polished, beautiful, and amazing as they can be. \nWe loved the input we got from Moon Hunters backers, but we felt like we didn't use it enough because we weren't ready for all of your ideas! So we want your feedback to help us shape the game in the years to come.\nWe\u2019re going to be especially interested in feedback on:  \nBalancing and pacing  \nCharacter story arcs & tone/content \nNew item/equipment ideas\nAlthough early beta-testers (from CAD$35+) will have the opportunity to give the most hands-on feedback experience with us, we will post regular updates to Kickstarter, and all backers\u2019 comments will be welcomed and shared among the team.  \nPLUS we wanted to make some unique limited-edition merch and pre-ordering those mugs and t-shirts and pillow cases makes it easier for us to see how many to make. :)  \nPlease back us so that we can get your input, and also deliver sweet merch to sweet people.\nWe\u2019ve already been working on Boyfriend Dungeon for over a year! But this Kickstarter helps us understand how many fans are out there, and how much we can afford to keep pouring our hearts (and wallets) into it.  \nThis is roughly how we will split up the funds:\nAnd, with your help, we not only reached our goal... we reached all of our stretch goals! So we decided to stop scoping up, past $200k, and make the game the best it can be, with the features and content we are already planning. Thank you so much for believing in us!\nOur current language support plans include only English, French, and Japanese, due to the amount of words. We may consider others, depending on community involvement.\nAs for the development schedule, we\u2019re currently in the midst of production that we hope will finish next year, but we will work with Indiebox to mail your physical rewards as soon as we can, even before the game releases.\nThanks for all of your excitement, enthusiasm, and support. If you can't afford to buy the game, we understand.. but please tell any friends or acquaintances you might have that CAN -- every dollar and/or wishlist helps.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKitfox Games is an award-winning studio that has released multiple games, including successfully releasing a Kickstarted game previously (Moon Hunters).

If we reach this goal, we will make sure there is a version of the game with all the potential ass, penis, boobs and vagina available. We're not sure what the Steam nudity policy will be like when we launch but we'll make sure we figure something out. (I really want to pay more artists to draw these beautiful gents and ladies naked.) \nBONUS: We'll make a NSFW version of the art book available to anyone who backs at $30+  \n$25k - Twelve characters plus all the supporting cast calls for a ton of different voices but we would love to get as much VO as possible in there to really bring the characters to life.  \n$30k - We will work on adding at least two more characters to the game. Probably to be released as DLC (for time reasons) but all backers will get these characters FOR FREE.

Now, bound inextricably to a geist \u2014 a shade, a monster, a tragic, broken soul \u2014 you stand between the world of the living and the world of the dead. You stand between the dead and the hungry dark that would devour them. You give a voice to the voiceless and tear down cosmic systems of oppression. You will make a better world, and if you die trying... well, you came back once, and you can do it again.\nIn Geist: The Sin-Eaters, you play a person who died with a powerful burden on their soul \u2014 something they didn't accomplish in life, or something they never found. On the other side of the veil, they made a bargain with a powerful being called a geist, which returned them to the world of the living and to their own body, at the cost of a permanent bond between them and the geist. Now your character stands as a medium, with one foot in the world of the living and one in the world of the dead. Will you bend your efforts toward the cosmic injustice of the Underworld, that consumes all who become trapped in its inky depths? Will you turn your wrath on the necromancers, the ghost-eaters, the two-bit frauds who exploit dead and living alike for their own enrichment? Will you reach out to the strange shade bound to you, to try to find the person beneath the inchoate fury and bring them peace? Will you bring a new faith to the masses and teach the living to welcome the dead into their lives? Or will you use all your newfound supernatural might to accomplish what you could not in life?  \nOriginally released in 2009, Geist: The Sin-Eaters was a sleeper hit for the Chronicles of Darkness, finally bringing \u201clife\u201d to the realm of ghosts and death. And now this game of second chances gets a second edition, with Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition, offering a revised and updated rules system and an expanded setting.\nThis Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a prestige hardcover edition designed to match the look and feel of our other Chronicles of Darkness core rulebooks such as Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, or Mage: The Awakening...\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, symbolic cover image printed on a metallic under layer, and featuring an emboss/deboss of the logo. We estimate the book to be more than 280+ pages, with a two-color interior and endpapers on high quality paper stock.\nGeist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition includes all the rules you need to play as one of the Bound: Five Burdens reflecting the cause that pulled you back from the grave, five krewe Archetypes for building your own mystery religion, and the Haunts, Keys, and Ceremonies that provide the Bound with their macabre powers.\nIt also includes the Chronicle of the Dead, featuring the Sin-Eaters\u2019 struggle against the all-consuming Underworld and a variety of terrifying threats. In addition, for the first time in the Chronicles of Darkness line, ghosts are presented as playable characters.\nChapters include:\nThe Quick and the Dead: the five Burdens (the reason a Sin-Eater comes back from the dead and what draws a particular geist to them) and krewe Archetypes (the common cause that draws a krewe of Sin-Eaters together). \nThe Road Back: On death and coming back, and why Bound make the Bargain, including possible consequences. \nOne Foot in the Grave: Character creation, with sections on both geist and krewe creation, Anchors, Merits, Synergy, Plasm, Abilities, Haunts, Keys, Ceremonies, and Mementos. \nOld Laws: the core Chronicles of Darkness rules, with special rules for playing Sin-Eaters, as well as information on subsystems for krewes, ghosts, and the Underworld, including Avernian Gates. \nAntagonists: villains for your Geist chronicle, including Reapers, Eaters of the Dead, necromancers, enemy Bound, and Kerberoi. \nThe Quiet Places: Setting information and story hooks for playing your Geist chronicle in specific times and places in history., from 16th-century Brazil to modern-day Edinburgh, Scotland to Mobile, Alabama in 1910, as well as information on Dominions. \nGhost Stories: Storyteller advice and information for running a Geist chronicle, including designing Remembrances, how to set theme and mood, story seeds, and various ways to play out the end of a game. \nAppendix: The Absent: This Appendix details the Absent, playable ghosts, including Memories, new Merits, and a collection of possible ghost characters to expand on and use in your chronicle. \nAppendix: Conditions and Tilts: Geist-specific Conditions and Tilts, including ephemeral Influence Conditions and Manifestation Conditions for ghosts, as well as Haunt Conditions and Tilts.\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition manuscript as backer-only updates.\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful hardcover book to all of our backers, but also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Geist, expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore this (Under)world.\nThirdly, we want to celebrate the quiet legacy of Geist: The Sin-Eaters by offering an affordable bundle of first edition PDF titles. The Underworld Reflections bundle is a quick-and-easy way to dive into the world of Geist and revisit those ideas and concepts as we move forward with our new edition.\nBeyond all of those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of giving this game physical form \u2014 and like our protagonists, we all become Bound with common purpose. When you back this project, you join our krewe and we journey into the new edition together.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($50,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to see a larger version of this chart\nTo help simplify matters, the basic reward chart lists the core reward and then combinations with each of the additional rewards offered as part of this campaign (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nKey Decision: do you stay non-corporeal with the digital PDF version only, or bind yourself to the physical world with the Hardcover + PDF reward? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Doppelg\u00e4nger and Krewe Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!)\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (\"Spectre\") will get 5 copies of the hardcover book, PDF, and Storyteller's Screen at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates once per week. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nUNDERWORLD REFLECTIONS (1E PDF BUNDLE) - A bundle of relevant PDFs from the first edition of Geist: The Sin-Eaters, the Underworld Reflections bundle can provide inspiration and ideas for your Geist game.

The Memento Mori PDF will be added to the rewards list of all backers currently set to receive a PDF version of Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition as part of their rewards. Currently, Memento Mori includes sections on the following topics:\nMementos\nKrewe Regalia & Ceremonies\nDominions\nHaunts\nHaunted Locations & Story Hooks\n\nREADY-MADE CHARACTERS - Pre-generated player characters designed for instant use in your Geist: the Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition game.

For Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the hardcover has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each reward tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run.\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will release a reward from the Underworld. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\nAt $117,000 in funding - Memento Mori: Translation Guide \u2013 A section discussing how to update your 1st Edition characters to the 2nd Edition rules will be written for Memento Mori, the Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition Companion.\n At $123,000 in funding - Memento Mori: Chapter Fiction \u2013 New frightening prose will be written for each section of Memento Mori, the Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition Companion.\n At $129,000 in funding - Memento Mori: Sample Krewes \u2013 A section on sample krewes will be written for Memento Mori, the Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition Companion\nThis is Onyx Path Publishing's 30th Kickstarter, and the company has learned how to maintain focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Geist: The Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition is finished, initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our last ship-out, for Pugmire, started a month earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support":

Now it\u2019s your turn to embark on an epic adventure and make those dreams come true.\nCatch new Temtem on Omninesia\u2019s floating islands, battle other tamers on the sandy beaches of Deniz or trade with your friends in Tucma\u2019s ash-covered fields. Defeat the ever-annoying Clan Belsoto and end its plot to rule over the Archipelago, beat all eight Dojo Leaders, and become the ultimate Temtem tamer!\nThe world of the Airborne Archipelago is filled with creatures, named by the locals as Temtem. Temtem have always been a part of day-to-day life on the islands. They live in harmony alongside humans, helping them with their chores or being loyal and faithful pets.\nThere's also a long tradition of taming wild Temtem and training them to fight in friendly battles against other tamers. In recent years, this has exploded in popularity due to a revolution in Temtem technology. Temtem scientists achieved the creation of the first Digital Temtem while studying new breeding techniques, and this has spurred the development of various commodities to help tamers on their adventures.\nEvery Temtem and every technique they know are assigned a specific type. Each type has strengths and weaknesses against other types so they are one of the most important things you need to think about when planning your Temtem squad. Each Temtem can have up to two types, but techniques can only have one type. There are 12 types in Temtem.\nTemtem battles are the form of competition between tamers in the Airborne Archipelago. Tamers can have up to six Temtem in their squad, but only two at a time will be able to battle. In Temtem, battles are turn-based, so tamers will take turns commanding their Temtem what to do in battle until all Temtem are exhausted and one of the tamers emerges as the winner.\nBattles are focused on 2v2 (although there will be some 2v1 battles against untamed Temtem or 1v1 battles with other players) and we\u2019re committed to keeping random factors out of battles. We\u2019ve seen the frustration that random elements cause, especially in the competitive scene, so we\u2019ve decided to remove them and have made the combat 100% skill and strategy based.\nBreeding is the method of creating new Eggs. Putting two compatible Temtem together will produce a new Egg, and from that Egg a new Temtem will be born! Breeding is the easiest way to create a Temtem with perfect stats, since they will inherit some of the stats of their parents. Breeding will also open the door to new movesets since some of the moves will be inherited, allowing a Temtem to know moves its species might not normally learn.\nBut don\u2019t overbreed your Temtem! Each Temtem will have a genetic degradation value that will lower each time a new Egg is produced, so you can only breed a specific amount of times. Genetic degradation will also be inherited by the new Temtem, so you\u2019ll need to plan beforehand how you\u2019re going to spend the cycles.\nTemtem features a fully fleshed-out story campaign. Journey across six vivid islands and embark on the adventure of becoming a Temtem tamer while fighting against the evil Clan Belsoto.\nOnline components of Temtem will be an addition to the adventure and will allow you to travel through the islands alongside other tamers and battle, trade, or talk with them.\nThe days of traveling solo are over; in Temtem the world is a massively multiplayer one. Tamers from around the world can join and you will be able to see them around you, living the adventure with you and fighting to become the best Temtem tamer. Chill with strangers, make new friends and battle them or trade your goodies; the dynamic online world is full of possibilities.\nTemtem\u2019s campaign will be fully co-op compatible. You will be able to join forces with a friend any time and work together towards your next goal. Catch new Temtem, complete a Route, or face off against a Temtem Leader; all while fighting alongside your friend in dual battles!\nYou\u2019ve traveled over all six islands, you\u2019ve caught every Temtem there is, you\u2019ve trained the perfect squad and defeated all the Dojo Leaders. It looks like you need a well-deserved rest! Buy your own house at Atoll Row and decorate it your way. Buy new furniture, color your walls and you\u2019ll be ready to invite your friends over!\nAtoll Row is divided into neighborhoods, acting as instances, with persistent houses from all the tamers in the game. You\u2019re going to be able to visit any house any time and inspire yourself with new ideas for your own house.\nCustomize your character to stand out from the crowd and get new cosmetics while you battle other tamers. Pick a silly hat, a comfy sweatshirt, some pants and you\u2019re ready to go! Or maybe you prefer to wear a full-on cosplay of your favorite Temtem?\nTemtem battles are the most important aspect of every new tamer\u2019s job. Competitive battles take it up a notch and let you battle other tamers with similar skill levels. Begin to plan your strategy even before the battle with pick and ban phases and escalate the ranked ladders.\nStart by choosing 10 Temtem and the pick and ban phase will begin. Take turns with your rival to pick your Temtem and ban theirs. When all the decisions are made and the turns are ended, you will end up with a squad of 4 Temtem and the battle will begin.\nWelcome to the Airborne Archipelago, novice tamers!\nThese are the floating islands where Temtem and humans coexist peacefully. Each island is a whole different world, but there is something we all have in common \u2013 our love for Temtem and Temtem fighting! Intrepid tamers like yourself travel on airships to the furthest reaches of the Archipelago to find the best Temtem. Every young tamer dreams of becoming the best\u2026\nBut not everything is fun and peace in the islands. Behind the scenes, Clan Belsoto is weaving a dastardly conspiracy against Temtem and humans alike. You will need all the friends and your best Temtem to defeat the wicked Clan Belsoto.\nDeniz is a Mediterranean paradise of glittering seas where Water and Wind Temtem abound. Walk the streets of Turquesa, explore the ruins of an ancient fort or just chill on the shores of Indigo Lake.\nArbury\u2019s pride is its University. The fierce dons of Lochburg swear by their Melee Temtem, against the sophisticated Properton academics, who favour Mind Temtem.\nOmninesia (\u201dthe Myrisles\u201d) is a cluster of tropical islets connected by rope bridges, home of Nature and Fire Temtem. Enjoy the luxury of Atoll Row and investigate the lava caves of the Anak volcano.\nCipanku dabbles in mysticism and well as technology. The labs of Nanto produce Digital Temtem, while the monks revere the Electric Temtem in remote hills among rice paddies.\nTucma, \u201cThe End of All Things\u201d \u2013 a vast desolation of ashes, noxious lakes and Toxic Temtem. Under the surface, the mining city of Quetzal is home to artisans, rock-hoppers and Crystal Temtem.\nKisiwa is a sun-drenched savanna. Eastern Kisiwa boasts an unrivalled variety of Neutral Temtem, while the western deserts are home to the best Earth Temtem.\nClan Belsoto is a shady and enigmatic organization. Nobody knows who its true leader might be, but some of its captains are well-known:\nLady Lottie is an arrogant Arburian aristocrat, with the aloof manners of an exiled queen. Her delusions of grandeur conceal her dangerous skill in Temtem battles.\nGeneral X is a stern Denizan officer, fond of strict discipline and blind obedience. He is using Clan Belsoto to realize his own dreams of conquest and domination.\nDr. Hamijo is a disgraced Cipanki scientist, who now applies his knowledge to the advancement of the wicked plans of Clan Belsoto, using genetically modified Temtem when challenged to a duel.\nCrema is a game studio based in Madrid, Spain. We\u2019ve been making videogames for almost six years now and we\u2019ve always been focused on delivering great gameplay experiences.\nOur previous productions include:\nInstant Buttons: Our first app, which to date has over 20 million downloads.\nOh My Goat: Featured by Apple and amassed over half a million downloads.\nRidiculous Triathlon: Also featured by Apple and publicly and critically acclaimed.\nImmortal Redneck: Our first foray into the PC and console market, with over 94% positive feedback on Steam.\nWe\u2019ll be working with the award-winning composer Damian Sanchez for all of the audio requirements of Temtem. Damian is an amazing composer who has worked on games like Rise & Shine, Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days, and Blues and Bullets, and has become one of the most renowned composers in the Spanish gamedev community.\nDamian has been working side-by-side with us on most of our games, and our collaboration with him goes back to 2015 when we were working on Ridiculous Triathlon. Since then he\u2019s been our music guy for every project we\u2019ve had, and most recently he\u2019s been responsible for the awesome Immortal Redneck soundtrack.\nAs an exclusive reveal, you can now listen to the first theme on Temtem\u2019s soundtrack:\nOur company has been self-funded for almost 6 years while making our previous games, and now we have most of the funding for Temtem already on our arks. The Kickstarter will help just a bit on the financial side, but we especially want it for the community creation aspect. We really want to develop the game around the community and open the development.\nWith our previous game, Immortal Redneck, it became clear that we should have involved the community early on in development and not have waited for the game\u2019s release to start receiving feedback. We made some assumptions that led to us not putting enough effort into certain areas of the game, and that ended up hurting the game\u2019s perception by the public and got us off to a not-so-great start.\nWe want to change that, and Kickstarter is the perfect way to do it. We want our backers to be involved in the development, watch our day-to-day updates and provide feedback along the way. We plan to maintain an open development through our Discord server, especially with our Alpha Hero backers (and above) that will be testing the game from a very early stage and will help us shape the future of Temtem.\nLastly, since Temtem is very influenced by a well-known franchise, we aren\u2019t really sure how positive the public reception is going to be. Kickstarter allows us to show the game to the public and gather feedback early on. We want to expand the well-known franchise and add features requested by its users for years, but we need to see if there\u2019s enough interest in that before embarking on this massive adventure.\nSince August 2017 when development began, we\u2019ve been focused on laying the foundation of every aspect of the game and creating content for the Kickstarter campaign. We\u2019ve been defining the pipeline for each area of development and we\u2019re now ready to begin full production and start creating the final content for the game.\nWe\u2019re currently focused on creating a first Alpha, and from there we plan to iterate with the community.

A day-night cycle, a dynamic weather system, random encounters and sector-wide anomalies drain your stamina and resources as you go places. \nGuided Randomization - Each playthrough consists of multiple 'sectors' which are created via a complex combination of presets and procedural generation, making no game ever the same. \nEach Action Card represents a tactical opportunity. Use them wisely!\nTrading Card Game - You also have access to 'Action Cards' - a game element that only strengthens the tabletop feel of Pixel Princess Blitz. You can play them to escape a tight spot, increase your odds of survival and bend the rules! For example, you can play 'Stealth' to move safely through a chaotic battlefield, or play 'Instigation' on a town to raise a militia when monsters are nearby.\nThe town is besieged by Ratlings! Don't just stand there, do something!\nA Living World - The world is populated with towns, monsters and factions that all follow their own agenda. Armies fight over vantage points and supply centers, Monsters sprawl across the land and towns deploy guards and adventurers to defend themselves.They are playing an RTS among themselves, and you possess the power to be a game changer. Protect towns, sabotage supply lines, take out commanders and solve problems(and more).\nImagine two factions having bases around the sector and sending out patrols and armies to outdo the other one. If you sabotage one faction by taking out their outposts and patrols, this will naturally lead to the other faction gaining the upper hand, quite possibly leading to their victory.\nWhether you intervene or not is entirely up to you. The factions will engage each other no matter if you're there or not, so if you don't care what they do... then don't get involved. This is YOUR JOURNEY.\nRandomized Loot & Arms Race\nAn Innovative Character Customization System!\nLoot Generator - Acquire and trade in a huge variety of weapons, gears and items which are all generated at random! An item could have multiple positive and negative attributes, be upgraded or degraded in quality, enchanted or cursed, common, rare, or unique - You won't see the same equipment twice.\nAn Arms Race - Utilize your limited time and resources carefully to keep your arsenal up to date, as your enemies keep getting stronger and the environment more dangerous as you progress. Falling behind in this ever-intensifying arms race will only mean your death.\nDungeoneering like Never Before\nIn PPB, we treat dungeons not as a static collection of rooms, but like a board game played against another player. AI-controlled Dungeon Overseers are put in charge of each dungeon, taking every available step to kill the intruder - reparing rooms, facilities and sending out hunting parties after you. You must think strategically and act tactically to overcome this cunning opponent.\nMind the Gap\nImmersive Storytelling\nA Meaningful Adventure - experience a non-linear gameplay enhanced by a elaborately prepared narrative told through long campaigns and random events. We believe that even the best sandbox game would soon run dry if it doesn't tell a meaningful story or give you context to your efforts. \nTrue Role-playing - I believe that a good RPG is not about letting you choose your sex or change your looks, but enabling you to make meaningful choices that result in logical consequences! Most encounters in PPB will offer multiple choices and different solutions. Like in Tabletop RPG, the game will role a die to determine your success, adding relevant modifiers such as equipment, skill or stats. \nSoundtrack - Pixel Princess Blitz's gorgeous high-quality music, composed by Ethan Jeffrey, does a fantastic job of setting the tone of the adventure, quickly becoming an integral part of the world of PPB.  \n<Main Theme of Pixel Princess Blitz>\nSound Effects - The often overlooked silent laborers. We are working with Aaron C. Edwards, a professional sound generalist with more than 12 years of experience, to create hundreds of SFX for Pixel Princess Blitz.\nthe game boasts a huge cast of high-quality pixel art characters, crafted and animated the traditional way by Japanese artists without relying on visual tricks, just as those classic JRPGs, fighting games and Beat'em-ups were made back in the old days.\nErin is fighting the air for some unknown reason...\nWe start with the first sketches...\ncontinue filling the frames in between...\nAnd brush it up!\nThe pixel art of PPB distinguishes itself with its crisp shapes and clear colors. We've also taken extra time and effort to come up with new and elaborate designs, instead of filling the game with just floating enemies or washed-out shapes and fuzzy details.\nKnight Mantis\nSwamp Lord\nWe have removed most physical rewards so we don't get distracted off the actual development. Though high amount of pledges would help us for sure, I believe that finishing this game should be our top priority, and the fulfillment process of physical rewards introduces a new risk that could topple the entire undertaking.\nEarly Access Key :\nGet a DRM-free copy of the game via Steam when we enter Early Access. You'll retain your access even when we move to full release of version 1.0. (You can also choose to receive a key for the platform of your choice)\nInvitation to Closed Beta :\nYou will be invited to test out the beta build many months before we hit Early Access - and retain your copy of the game through Early Access and the full release. During Closed Beta, we will reflect your feedback and keep updating the game, so you'd be practically building the game together with us.\nDigital Official Sountrack :\nThe talented Ethan Jeffrey is writing every piece in the magnificent soundtrack of PPB. The digital OST will come with an exclusive cover art that you can admire on your player. Here is another full song from the soundtrack; please enjoy! :)\nOST Booklet :\nA digital booklet with exclusive illusts, sketches, a comic in color, plus an insightful developer commentary about the music and sounds of PPB.\nPPB Guidebook : \n \nThis traveler's guidebook will contain stories, diary entries and interviews written by common people of Verad. It contains a bestiary, information about main factions and characters of PPB, exclusive illusts, comic pages and more.\nDigital Art Book :\nThis gigantic art book will allow you to look behind the curtain, bringing you tons of visual materials, including sketches, concept arts, colored in-game art assets in their original size, pixel-art sprites and more. We have so many materials to show off - you'll like it!\nYour Name in the Game :  \n\nThe name you give us will be put into the random generator to be used at various places. It may be found on the board at a adventurers' guild house, maybe among the 'Heroes of the Month'. The player can compete against other adventurers on that list by racking up renown, and you could be one of those names.\nYour name may also be on the 'Injured Adventurers' board, where the player can donate a few coins and get a better rep. These are great roleplaying opportunities for the player, and you can be a part of that fun experience.\nYour Story in the News :  \nThe game will generate newspapers that report about recent events. Think up a fictional story to be featured on its front page. It can be about yourself, or even just a funny story. Imagine other gamers reading about the discovery of a dangerous ruin, and finding the story about your heroic act beside that: \"Steve from Bullworth wins the annual eating contest for the third time in a row.\" Also, you will be credited as 'Guest Creator'.\nDesign a Unique Item:  \nEquipment items in PPB, such as weapons, shields, armors etc. are randomly generated, but there are also 'unique items' that can look different on the inventory screen and have a few special properties that make them stand out. Work with us to design a unique item with special properties, and if you wish, a lore the player can read after identifying it. You are also free to include your own name in a lore-friendly way.\nThe VAT Incident\nWe ran our first Kickstarter campaign back in 2017 and got funded successfully thanks to the help of our backers, raising 132% of the actual funding goal. We've economized and used the pledges carefully to pay the members of the team for their ongoing effort, and to hire additional members who proved themselves crucial to the project very soon.\nThe post-funding development went pretty smoothly, but we had to spend more time than we had originally allocated because we had to add, remove, remaster and rectify big features, graphic assets and codes while Pixel Princess Blitz kept evolving. (This is the usual process of game development) And that led to a delay with which we were not happy.\nAnd in January 2018, we learned that we have to pay 19% of the funds raised on Kickstarter as VAT(Value-added-tax). This was unexpected because Kickstarter's Q&A section stated that there would be no taxes on the money we spent.\nTaken from the Q&A Section.\n(In retrospect, the article seems to apply to the US-residents only - but this was hard to grasp at that time. It also sounded pretty convenient to me, so I'd stopped bothering from that point on. It's my fault.) \nSolution\nWith that, most of the remaining budget that we'd saved up for the final spurt was gone, and as you could imagine, it's been very stressful. I hope that the uniqueness and the high production value of our game could get you interested enough and maybe convince you to back us in this final Kickstarter campaign before the release of PPB.\nOf course, I've consulted our backers from the first Kickstarter campaign first before considering this. Thankfully, they liked how I've handled the first campaign. To me, the single most important thing is not to disappoint my backers - I wouldn't be attempting this without their blessing.\nI hope that you've enjoyed reading the campaign page and that you will keep our game in a corner of your heart, should you decide to pass on our Kickstarter campaign. Thank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt this point, nothing could threaten the completion of this project. \nUnforeseen delays are still possible, but they won't be due to any grave issues like a team member bolting out, or mismanaging the budget.\n\nSoon we will enter the closed beta phase where we will keep fixing bugs and reflect your feedback in the game through updates, so you'll be able to follow the progress even if our plan to enter Early Access gets delayed.\n\nNo matter what happens, we'll finish this game and keep expanding its contents even long after the release of version 1.0!

Around 18 months ago we challenged ourselves to create a tool that would be light, practical and affordable. \nThe Wootz EDC is the ideal tool for any adventure where weight and space are a consideration. Its versatility makes it a must-have companion for every adventurer, or eighter you\u2019re just grilling in the backyard with a cold one.\nIt's manufactured from the highest-carbon stainless steel and weighs just 1.9 ounces or 55 grams.

Once the campaign is over, we'll collect your color choices in a survey\n                     THE WOOTZ EDC IDEA\nWootz EDC (Every Day Carry) founders wished to reduce the amount of gear you would need when heading into the wild, knowing that every ounce on your back becomes a kilogram when carried over the distance. We began with a simple keychain as a jumping-off point but also wanted to design a tool that would handle every step when preparing a meal around the campfire. \nEvery function of the Wootz EDC had to work great in its own right. For durability, stainless steel 440C was a perfect choice.\nKeep things slick while getting more than just a traditional money clip\nCracking Open A Cold One With The Boys > Tag Your Friends <\n                                                       DESIGN  \nAfter 18 months of design work and hundreds of different prototypes, the Wootz EDC was born. Wootz EDC makes a unique gear, based on our love for barbeque and beer. \nWhether you are backpacking around the world or spending a day in the woods, we want to be with you. \nOur team consists of curios-minded mavericks, creating unique products that are practical, functional and aesthetically pleasing in the real world. \n3D CAD drawings along with 2D dimensions\nComputer-aided design and drafting\nSPECIFICATIONS  \nLight Weight: 1.9oz (55 g)\nBlade Length: 2.3in (5.5 cm)\nBlade Thickness: 0.09in (2.3 mm)\nOpen Body Length: 5.5in (14 cm)\nHandle Length: 3in (8 cm)\nClosed Width: 0.8in (2.2 cm)\nBody Materials: 440C heat treated stainless steel \nHardness: 58-60HRC \nColor: Grey, Matte Black \nLock: Linerlock\nSome of our valued early members have suggested a Tanto blade option for their Wootz EDC.

Set in Aughmoore, the world of Tiny Epic Kingdoms and Heroes of Land, Air & Sea.\nHOOK: Fast paced, portable co-op, with a unique turn-deck mechanic.\nWIN: Defeat the Epic Foe!  \nLOSE: Let your Capital City get destroyed!\nBASE STORY: After the Great War (Tiny Epic Kingdoms), many of the factions, shattered and defeated, looked for something to cling to. One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions\u2019 leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace\u2026 but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.\nEXPANSION STORY: Aughmoore is in ruins. The evil could not be contained and its darkness has spread to every region of the world. Shattering villages and infecting all forms of life. There has never been a more dire need for Heroes. Everyone who remains must rise up, must unite, and must risk everything to preserve what little spirit remains.\nTiny Epic Defenders: The Dark War, an expansion to Tiny Epic Defenders, is the latest installment in Chronicles of Aughmoore. It introduces new Heroic characters like the Lionkin Charioteer and the Birdfolk Shadow Walker. It also introduces new Epic Foes, new Dire Enemies, and new Artifacts, but more importantly, it introduces new and exciting features that keep players making difficult choices from the edge of their seats.\nThese new features include a Campaign Mode with Enemy Generals, Skills that Heroes can learn, Advanced Regions and Caravans.\nCaravans represent the shattered homes of villagers during this dark time and are spread across all the Regions. Players are faced with the additional challenge of rescuing these Caravans and escorting them safely to the Capital City before they are can defeat the Epic Foe.\nSkills are useful abilities players can assign to their Heroes and require Experience Points to activate. Experience Points are now earned during play by making meaningful decisions that help the party reach their goals.\nThe Campaign Mode plays like an evolving gauntlet challenge, where players must play through the game multiple times, facing Generals at the intervals instead of the regular Epic Foe. The different abilities players will have at their disposal, as well as the threats they face, are unique to each Campaign and evolve with the choices players make during each Campaign. If players can survive long enough, they will face an Epic Foe at the conclusion of the Campaign.\nThe Advanced Regions introduce new threats and also new abilities to aid the players in The Dark War. These new threats and abilities come in the way of 3D constructs like a giant Tree Heroes can hide in, a flying Manticore Heroes can ride, or mysterious Sandstorms! They play a big part in the evolving Campaign Mode. Each Advanced Region features a dark, harmful, side and a light, helpful, side. As players progress through the Campaign Mode, they will work to restore the dark regions to their helpful side. Making the right choices to restore these Regions and rescue the Caravans is critical to achieving victory in Campaign Mode.\nOwn the original Tiny Epic Defenders and curious about what the changes are? Here's what's changed: \nAll new art, component upgrade to include ITEMeeples\u00ae, gameplay changes to give players more control over the outcome of the game, and as a result, it's more fun!

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played.

This is a must-buy!\u201d\nJamey Stegmaier \u2013 Stonemaier Games\n\"The 7th Continent is quite simply a watershed moment in enthusiast gaming. Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder.

Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials.

When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper.

It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse!\n\"Satchel & Journal\" Binder\nThis new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal!\n1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters.

Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1.

Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings. Rolling dice, pushing toy soldiers and trading sheep for many a moon now, Jamie is, just like you guys, a gamer at heart. He\u2019s also a publisher himself with his own company, Holy Grail Games. Some of you may recognize him from the first Kickstarter campaign.\nTo our families and friends for their incredible support and patience as we created the cursed land of the 7th Continent.\nTo our proofreaders and translators who did an outstanding job!\nTo Olivier Nkweti for his great work on miniatures.\nTo the amazing Gary Chalk, Joe Dever, Didier Guiserix, Gary Gygax, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone for their inspirational work.\nTo all the backers of the first campaign who helped us make this dream a reality.\nTo you, previous and first-time backers, who will allow us to keep on dreaming!\nThank you all!\nWe wish you a not too gruesome demise in the land of The 7th Continent!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe re-printing of the base box does not pose any issues. \n\nWork on the new expansion has already begun and we are confident in our ability to meet the announced deadlines.\n\nWe will, of course, be keeping you updated about the state of the project through each and every stage. \n\nREFUNDS\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf the refund is requested more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Stripe.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAll prices shown in \u20ac (Euros) are based on the conversion rate in effect at the start of the campaign (09-25-2017) which is $1 = \u20ac0.84\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information, and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

This patent pending device brushes all your teeth at once, fully automatic, and finishes in just ten seconds. All you have to do is press a single button, wait ten seconds, and you\u2019ll have perfectly clean teeth!\nLet's face it: brushing your teeth is not exactly the sexiest thing on Earth. You have to squeeze, scrub, gargle, spit, rinse and floss every morning and evening, every day of your life. Many of us hate brushing our teeth so much that we avoid doing so whenever possible\u2014even though we know we shouldn\u2019t... Brushing our teeth at least twice a day maintains good dental health. This is why we invented Amabrush\u2014a device three years in the making with a single goal: to make toothbrushing quicker, automatic, and more efficient so you have more time for the relevant things in your life.\nAmabrush is not meant to be better than your regular toothbrush. Wait, what? That's true! Regular toothbrushes (manual and electric) are tools. And tools are only as good as the person using it! The key thing is that most of us use them wrong, or even worse, are not using them at all. \nBrushing teeth is a job where you must be highly concentrated. Toothbrushes should be held like pencils, so that pressure is as light as possible. The bristles should be soft, in order to not damage your gums. And you should just wiggle the toothbrush with subtle vibrations, instead of doing long strokes. Electric toothbrushes are handled differently than manual ones. With them, you shouldn't stroke at all. These toothbrushes are designed to be held in place, so that the micro vibrations of the bristles can do their job (they wiggle for you).\nAmabrush covers all of the recommended methods. The bristles are aligned in a 45\u00b0 angle against the gum line, and are soft enough in order to rub instead of scratch (like nylon bristles). And the pressure against your teeth is light. Subtle vibrations move the bristles back-and-forth, which allows them to remove plaque and keep your gums undamaged.\nAmabrush is for people like us - who just brush their teeth because they have to, and not because they want to.\nAmabrush was designed to make toothbrushing less annoying. Some of us hate toothbrushing so much, that we brush not concentrated enough, not long enough, not good enough, or not at all. And some of us simply can not brush correctly at all, because they are not able to do so. It is still under development, and currently for people with healthy gum and teeth. This is our goal. Right toothbrushing for everyone and automatically!\nAmabrush is made out of three parts:\nThe Mouthpiece\nThe Handpiece\nThe Toothpaste Capsules\nAntibacterial Material\nThe flexible mouthpiece has built-in micro-channels that transport the toothpaste to your teeth. The mouthpiece is made of antibacterial silicone that kills 99.99% of all bacteria and features 3D-arranged bristles on both sides to clean your teeth. It\u2019s soft enough to prevent gum damage but strong enough to clean your teeth precisely. It can be cleansed by normal rinsing, as you would do it with regular toothbrushes.\nBrushing Technique\nThe bristles are directed in a 45\u00b0 angle against your gingival cuff. This simulates the Bass method, which is recommended by dentists and experts. The bristles are comparable to soft-bristled toothbrushes. This ensures the most comfortable, safest toothbrushing and makes gum-damage impossible. We work closely with dentists and dental universities to address two concerns: clean teeth and no gum damage.\nSingle Size\nWe analyzed over 2,000 different jaws from adult females and males. The small difference between both genders is smoothed out by the flexible material of the mouthpiece. The used material has the characteristic to fit every jaw with no abnormal teeth displacements.\nReplacement\nAs with regular manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrush heads, the mouthpiece should be replaced every 3-6 months. Many studies prove that used bristles are not as effective in terms of plaque removal, as new ones. A single mouthpiece will cost \u20ac6.\nElectronics\nThe handpiece contains all of the complex technology. It creates strong vibrations with an amplitude of 9.5G to oscillate the bristles and clean your teeth. A clever algorithm ensures the generation of different vibrations. This results in a coordinated movement of the bristles, which are designed to have different resonant frequencies.\n10 Seconds\nAmabrush can brush your teeth in just 10 seconds, because all your teeth are cleaned simultaneously. Even in this 10 seconds, every tooth surface is cleaned longer compared with common toothbrushes. If you brush your teeth for the recommended 120 seconds with a regular toothbrush (manual or electric), every surface gets brushed for just 1.25 seconds (given the fact that you have 32 teeth and every teeth has three surfaces). Amabrush brushes all your surfaces for whole 10 seconds. This means: every tooth surface gets brushed 8x longer and the total toothbrushing duration is 12x quicker.\nPump, Battery & Charging\nA built-in mechanism foams and delivers the right amount of toothpaste to your teeth, and the integrated battery lasts for 28 sessions of toothbrushing. So if you go on vacation without the charging station, you can brush your teeth for at least two weeks twice a day.\nThe handpiece also comprises a low-energy wireless charging module (Qi). So yes, you could even use your wireless smartphone charger to charge Amabrush.\nSharing\nA magnetic connection on the handpiece gives you the opportunity to use Amabrush with different people. Simply put the mouthpiece near the handpiece, and the strong magnet will automatically do the rest for you. We were told that \"it really works like magic,\" and we think the same.\nNotice: if you want to share Amabrush with different people, you just need a single handpiece! Everyone needs their own mouthpiece, but you don't have to get a separate handpiece for every person!\nReplacement & Varieties\nThe toothpaste capsules are simply placed into the handpiece, automatically providing the perfect amount of toothpaste each time you brush your teeth. A single capsule lasts for more than a month, costs \u20ac3 and is available in three different, FDA-approved varieties: Extra Fresh (blue), Whitening (white) and Sensitive (rose - without fluoride). The toothpaste is specially formulated as it needs to be more liquid than regular ones.\nManufacturing\nThe toothpaste is formulated and produced by a major toothpaste manufacturer with a history of over 100 years. This manufacturer fulfills the quality norm DIN EN ISO 13485 and the requirements of IFS Household and Personal Care Products, and was one of the first manufacturers in Europe retrieving the IFS-HPC certificate.\nMagnetic Connection\nToothpaste Foam\n                                   Magnetic Connection\nVideo of using Amabrush prototype. Plaque was buildup on teeth by not brushing them for 30h. This is not meant as a proper clinical trial or plaque test, but as a demonstration of brushing teeth with Amabrush.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n          \n           Amabrush with Wireless Charging Station (included in Amabrush Pro packages)\n                                                                                                                           Further questions?\nPlease feel free to contact us any time via email or Facebook.\nPlease choose your package on the top right of this page.\nUSB-C instead of micro-USB! We got this request really often, and we too think that this is a great way to build Amabrush with top-notch technology right from the beginning. Many of you demanded such an upgrade, and your request is our command!\nFurthermore, we will offer a lid with integrated UV light as an add-on. This protects the mouthpieces of Amabrush from dust and other environmental influences, and sanitizes the mouthpieces with UV light. This is able to store and sanitize two mouthpieces. This is an accessory for the mouthpiece-storage-attachment (that comes included in the pro version). It features a door with a hinge, a mirrored interior panelling in order to get the most out of the UV lamp, and is a great addition in order to keep Amabrush hygienic and clean. You can add the add-ons to your order after the campaign ends.\nChoose between various different add-ons. The images above shown are for illustration purpose only! We'll offer a traveller case in order to store your Amabrush conveniently and hygienic when you are on vacation. Furthermore, our charging station will be modular. That means, if you use Amabrush on your own, you can simply detach the mouthpiece slots that are designed to store additional mouthpieces. All pro versions come with a charging station and two slots included. What's more, we will offer a tongue cleaner made out of the same antibacterial material, in order to keep your tongue smooth and clean. You can find additional details and choose these items after the Kickstarter campaign.\nYou requested this, we deliver it. All Amabrush units come equipped with a sound and light indicator, that is able to signal various different information about the current battery status, finished toothbrushing sessions, errors and other scenarios! Furthermore, we'll offer our specifically formulated toothpaste in big bottles, along with more durable and stable refillable toothpaste capsules. This will save shipping fees and total cost for you. Please have a look at our add-on section below the reward section for further details.\nYour request is our command! We will integrate Bluetooth to all of our rewards at no additional cost. With our Amabrush App for iOS & Android, you are able to connect to your Amabrush unit and make use of various possibilities. You can set different vibration modes (gum massage, whitening, burst mode, ...), configure cleaning time, reorder replacement parts and do many things more!\n                                                                                                 We truly believe in Kickstarter as a platform, where like-minded entrepreneurs and early adopters bring together innovative, disruptive and sophisticated projects to life. We already supported a dozen projects from other people on Kickstarter on our own.\nAmabrush is a completely new device and needs to be \"understood\" in the first place. Kickstarter connects us with people like us; fact-interested, early-adopting and technology-enthusiastic people.\nAmabrush needs your help to fully come to life. Prototypes and pre-production units were financed by ourselves. But the time has come, that we currently face high upfront expenses regarding tooling, certification, studies and minimum quantity purchases. \nWe strongly believe that we've created a product that many people are craving for, ourselves included. Without your support, we can not achieve the vision of future oral care.\nWe do also highly appreciate every feedback and requests regarding Amabrush. If you have something you want to share with us, please feel free to write us any time at feedback@amabrush.com\nWe came up with the idea of an automated toothbrush, simply because we are annoyed by brushing our teeth. Standing in front of the mirror for at least two minutes twice a day, was not really satisfying for us.\nMarvin Musialek, the founder, came up with the first prototype in 2015. Together with Martin Forstenpointner, a talented mechanical engineer, and Alexander Stummer, a sophisticated biomedical engineer, we brought the project to life. Advised by Dr. Hady Haririan, a professional dentist and member of the Medical University of Dentistry in Vienna and Austrian Society of Parodontology, we developed and tested Amabrush to the form it represents now. We've established an enthusiastic and interdisciplinary team, and we work closely with medical universities, dentists, and a lot of test customers, in order to make Amabrush as perfect as it can be. We are supported and funded by the Austrian government, private institutions and the European Commission.\nOur core team:\nWe at Amabrush love high quality products. They are durable, simple and \"just work\". We are proud to say that Amabrush is designed, developed and produced in Austria, Germany and USA. This ensures high quality, quick development and low delivery costs.\n                                           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne part of Amabrush is highly complex; the mouthpiece. Such a form is not available on the market, as it is build out of a single material and the sophisticated arranged bristles can not be produced by every random injection molding company. We have a close dialog with our suppliers, who have a lot of experience with such complicated structures, and we implemented their feedback early into our development process.\n\nDespite that, we kept the internal parts simple.

His temples bulged, and his eyes were bloodshot with concentration as he ranted. \"Take one step toward me, and I will obliterate you with my mind!\u201d  \nHalo kept her martial stance, her eyes never leaving the rat\u2019s. \u201cThen do so,\u201d Halo said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d The rat didn\u2019t seem to have anticipated this.  \n\u201cDestroy me,\u201d Halo pressed. \u201cWith your mind. Go ahead, magician.\u201d\n\u201cI am no magician!\u201d the rat screeched. \u201cI am a scientist! I have studied the ancient records of the Old Ones, and I know the true power of the universe! I have mastered 47 of the 100 Theories!\u201d During his tirade, the rat\u2019s bulbous eyes began to water, and he finally did what Halo was waiting for.  \nHe blinked.  \nWhen the rat opened his eyes a fraction of a second later, Halo had leapt into the air. Her foot glowed with a blue aura as she kicked him in the snout. The pain was intense, and the rat could feel his fur and flesh becoming bitterly cold as the blue energy enveloped him. He tried to speak, to unleash his mental attack, but he couldn\u2019t move. The ice cracked and popped as his eyes froze solid. \nHalo nodded in satisfaction as the frozen rat fell over the side of the roof, and turned away from her opponent. She needed tell the Ruling Council that the cult of Labo Tor had infiltrated the monarchy of Korat.\n  \"Welcome once again to a world of fantasy adventure in the ancient future. I\u2019m Eddy Webb, and this is Blayze Rex von Rex. Lurking behind his experiments over there is Sabian Sphynx von Angora.\"\n\"We want to talk to you about Monarchies of Mau. It\u2019s a complete tabletop roleplaying game that acts as a companion game to, and is totally compatible with, my first RPG, Pugmire. The Monarchies of Mau is a nation of cats tenuously comprised of six city-states.\"\n  \"Anyway, they live in the ashes of our world far in the future, seeking danger and mystery. Think Three Musketeers meets Planet of the Apes, but with cats.\"\n\"These cats have been uplifted to use technology and language. Some cats acquire the remnants of human technology, believing them to be literal gifts of magic from ancient, god-like servants. Others seek to create an ideal civilization, using the Precepts of Mau agreed to in the heat of a terrible war.\"\n    \"Enemies of Mau can either be monstrous, like demon-possessed zombies, or simply other misunderstood people, such as the dogs of Pugmire.\"\n\"The world is dangerous and mysterious, but the instincts of a good cat will always be true.\"\n      \"My company, Pugsteady, is working with Rich Thomas at Onyx Path Publishing to expand on our Monarchies of Mau Early Access version (see below).\n\"We\u2019re running this Kickstarter so we can make the best version of Monarchies of Mau that we can, adding more art and writing to make this a complete and amazing product. If funded, we will produce a full-color 7 x 10 hardcover book (about the size of a graphic novel), with around 200+ pages.\n\"One of the highlights of the Monarchies of Mau game include this evocative, mysterious, and family-friendly setting, presented from the perspective of iconic characters like Blayze and Sabian here.\"\n  \"Monarchies of Mau uses a customized version of the 5th Edition rules from the world's most popular fantasy RPG. It's been redesigned for streamlined play, with an emphasis on cooperation and action over competition and violence. Creating heroic and cunning cats is easy, and there are a variety of callings and noble houses that give focus to a cat\u2019s role in society and in the adventuring party. To help you with your decision, I\u2019m providing a copy of Monarchies of Mau Early Access. It\u2019s a playable version of Monarchies of Mau that has over a third of the material you can expect in the final book.\nMonarchies of Mau is totally compatible with Pugmire and uses the same rules system. Mixed cat and dog games are entirely possible and can provide some great roleplaying opportunities!\n\"Once you pledge, you'll be able to look at the very first Backer Only Update here on this site and get the link to download the Monarchies of Mau Early Access PDF so you can start playing right away!\n\"As you can see, this is more than just a bare-bones document, but a glimpse into what the final book could really look like.\"\nTwo Page Spread from the Monarchies of Mau Early Access PDF\n\"With your help, we\u2019ll be able to make a game that not only adults can play among themselves, but also something that people can play with their families.\n\"More than that, we want this Kickstarter to help us put Monarchies of Mau into stores. We love retailers, but we know that modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With Monarchies of Mau, we want to try and get at least one print run of the game into their hands, so everyone can get a chance to experience it.\"\n  Eddy and Rich will be discussing Monarchies of Mau on various blogs and podcasts as this Kickstarter runs. \nKeep on the Heathlands\nGeek Cast Live (around 46 minute mark)\nThe Red List\nAnd here are some links to many of the Pugmire and Monarchies of Mau articles and interviews and gaming sessions in the US and around the world that Eddy has been able to amass:\nMedia from Pugmire: https://www.pugsteady.com/pugmire-media/\nOur friends at Geek & Sundry covered us again! http://geekandsundry.com/monarchies-of-mau-brings-cats-into-the-world-of-pugmire/\nAs did our friends at The Arcade! http://www.the-arcade.ie/2017/05/monarchies-mau-tabletop-rpg-pugmire/\nNerd Approved talked about Mau: http://nerdapproved.com/gaming/monarchies-of-mau/\nMonica Valentinelli did a wonderful spotlight of Mau and Eddy on her blog! http://www.booksofm.com/2017/05/friendly-friday-cats-dogs-and-the-imagination-of-eddy-webb.html\nGameosity named Mau as one of Jess's Fav Five Kickstarters of the Week! http://gameosity.com/2017/05/19/jesss-fav-five-kickstarters-of-the-week-51917/\niCv2 mentioned Mau! https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/37585/feline-action-takes-center-stage-monarchies-mau\nTerrible Warriors did a spotlight episode on us! http://www.terriblewarriors.com/episodes/spotlight-monarchies-of-mau-kickstarter\nAcross The Board Games mentioned us as part of their Fund It Friday! http://www.acrosstheboardgames.net/luke/fund-it-friday-may-26th-2/\nMore Gooder Than podcast mentioned Mau (near the end of the episode)! https://soundcloud.com/moregooderthan/goodie-bag-episode-23-appetizer\n  Contribute any amount you want, bearing in mind the levels of contribution and their commensurate rewards over there on the right.

This knowledge has been applied to Onyx Path's partnership with Pugsteady as well as the FAQ below:\nhttp://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: Monarchies of Mau isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped fifteen Kickstarter projects, Pugmire is being printed, and several more KS projects are headed to completion as you read this. All those books have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, sometimes painfully, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The Early Access PDF is finished and playable and we will be expanding that into the full book\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of Monarchies of Mau.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise dramatically, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges. Both methods allow us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing. Because of Kickstarter adding the option to their tools, we are able to be more specific as to shipping costs based on your country. These costs will be added to your pledge automatically by KS if you are outside the US. As always, local or VAT style taxes will need to be paid by the backer when appropriate and are not included in these costs.\n\nRisk: The project will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for several of our last KS projects several months before the estimate, and recent Kickstarters started shipping in the month or the month before we estimated. That being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process.\n\nWe've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver regular Updates on progress via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Mau Supporter", "descp": "You or your cat's name will be listed on the credits page as one of our supporters: our Clowder of Mau.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Wallpaper Fancier", "descp": "You'll get digital wallpaper featuring a collage of the evocative and beautiful art from Monarchies of Mau.

You only have once chance, so don't waste it.\nHowever, not everything is about shooting enemies. By completing each mission, you'll be rewarded with credits that you can spend to improve your characters' skills, upgrade and buy weapons, get better and fancier buildings for your town and improve your whole society.\nA spaceship crashes into an unknown planet. Nomad, the only survivor, wanders in the nearby area looking for food and shelter, however, he runs into a mysterious and broken black stone, hidden under sand dunes. Intrigued, he starts to unbury it and recognizes the stone immediately: It\u2019s The Void, a monolith he\u2019s heard about in ancient legends which talked about the primal power that resided in it.\nSuddenly, The Void activates causing Nomad to enter a state of trance. A vision crosses his mind where the Universe is destroyed. It has communicated with him and has shown him the Truth, but he\u2019s also shown him the way to avoid it. He must rebuild The Void to restore its ancient power, and he\u2019ll need help for that.\nAs if he knew what he should do, Nomad places his hand over The Void, which makes it emit a bright, reddish light ray which seems to split into many into the sky.\nHelp is coming now, and Nomad is the chosen one to drive them through as their leader. \nThe Call has begun.\nNow, he\u2019s got a new purpose.\nThose attracted by the Void\u2019s Call are considered Sons of the Void, or, simply put, Voidlings. Their Calling is considered mysterious as if they suddenly turned conscious about The Void and the fact that It needs their service.\nThey start in the lowest rank of the Sons of the Void Society, and they work their way up by completing missions for it. Their main goal is to investigate throughout the universe in order to track down and get Core pieces that will restore a part of The Void\u2019s power. Power and glory are promised to those who succeed.\nEach Voidling has a different play style and skills that contribute in different ways to your squad, which make them unique and valuable. Therefore, your gameplay experience is different depending on your squad members selection. Find a way that suits you!\nWe'll have at least 9 different Voidlings at launch.\n          Although you have to select your squad, you\u2019re only able to play as one of the members at once. However, you can swap between characters at any given point!\nThere are two kinds of members swap: simple swap and skill swap.\nThe first does as advised, a character will swap for another one instantly.\n\nThe latter, however, will trigger a skill for the swapped in character, for example, The Spike will bounce off incoming bullets for a short period of time, making you invulnerable to bullets (but not to explosions) for a brief time. On the other hand, when swapping The Chevalier in, he'll fall from the skies, stunning all smaller enemies around, letting you move to a safer position or take advantage of the situation. This kind of swap is limited.\nYou can also swap to exploit certain game mechanics: Killing enemies with The Chevalier can cause enemies to explode on death. If that effect is triggered and you swap to The Vermikaze before the explosion, its radius and effectiveness will increase... but only if you've learned those passive skills via the Monolith!\n  The Society asks you to complete several tasks to prove you\u2019re worthy. Tasks for which you\u2019ll have to visit dangerous but intriguing planets, in order to know more about The Void and any clue you can get to restore its power.\nThe Society always offers you three different missions in three different locations, and you can take whichever you prefer.\nTo get to the mission's location you\u2019ll have to use your spaceship, though. Thanks to the LHVC (Large Hadron Vortex Collider) technology, great distances can be covered in a matter of seconds, however, this can cause several secondary effects, although not all of them are necessarily bad.\nThese effects last just for the time you\u2019re doing the mission. They change several aspects of the core gameplay, so you will have to adapt to the new conditions.\nFor example, Oily Feet will make you slide through terrain, but Security will increase every squad member\u2019s life.\n  Although playing Sons of the Void alone is fun, playing it with friends is even funnier!\nIt works like this: Let's say you have 8 available characters to form your mission squad from, with their respective levels, skills tree developed, etc.\nYou friend joins you; Now, both of you can form your squads but with 2 members each, instead of the usual 3. When you both go on missions, your friend will be developing the characters he/she's chosen, too, leveling them up, keeping the weapons he/she get, etc.\nYou are able to prevent progression by simply activating/deactivating an option, if you just want it to be that way.\n  Among all the planets in the universe, there is one you can now call your home. And also you operational base. Here you will be able to manage the Voidlings, upgrade their skills, buy new gear, and many other things.\nYour town will evolve as you play and complete missions.\n  The Void is the one granting you powers as you find different Core pieces throughout the universe. These pieces will recover part of its power back, allowing you to become stronger.\nInteracting with it, the Voidlings can learn and upgrade different skills which turn them into unique characters.\n    Here you can deposit weapons you find during your missions, which allows you to equip them with any character.\nWhen you die, every squad member\u2019s equipped weapons are lost, so the stash is also really useful to hoard weapons in case this happens.\nOur Guardian Dog will be watching over them, so don't worry!\n  Progressing into harder areas might be difficult, but fear not! The Blacksmith will let you upgrade your weapon categories, so you\u2019ll get various bonuses with them.\nYou can also specialize into three weapon for each category, which will turn you into a killer machine with them!\n  Now and then she'll have a bunch of weapons to sell, too!\nThe Sons of the Void Society works with a rank system. You start being a Novice and will have to complete missions to rank up. Higher ranks open new mission types and environments, as well as more difficult ones, and new secondary effects for them. Various weapons drop only on certain rank missions. Also, to progress with the story it\u2019s imperative you rank up!\nThis is how the ranking system works:  \nOn each mission, you receive or lose rank points depending on how well you performed. To rank up you need a specific number of points. If you achieve those required points, you will receive a higher rank badge. If you lose points you may rank down and lose your actual badge.  \nFor example, we need 200 points to be an Apprentice (rank 2). You have 180 points and you just completed a mission which rewards you with 20 points. 180+ 20 = 200, thus you are now an Apprentice. But what if you fail your next mission and every squad member dies on it. You will lose 50 points, and you will be descended to Novice again (rank 1).\n                                              We are Grogshot Games and we\u2019ve been developing games together since 2012!\nAlong these years, we\u2019ve released two mobile projects, the multi awarded Learn Japanese with Tako and Clicker Pirates.\nWe truly think it\u2019s time to focus on PC development, which has always been our one objective.\n  We would like to let you know why we\u2019ve decided on Kickstarter.\nEven though we have some savings and we\u2019ve been working on our own cost for a while, these are limited and unluckily we wouldn\u2019t be able to dedicate full-time to this project otherwise, as we would like to do.  \nWe\u2019re sure this would affect the final quality of the project, so we decided to run a Kickstarter campaign for that matter. This, added to our own savings will let us work full-time on the project and launch it the way we always dreamt of.  \nIn case the funding wasn\u2019t successful, its development would have to be delayed until we were able to find steady, sustainable income.  \nThis funding money will be used for development costs and to pay for the music and sound effects, as we don\u2019t have an in-house sound designer.\nThe distribution would be as this:\n             \nFollow us onTwitter, Facebook, our Web, or check our DevLog in Gamejolt!\nWhat platforms is the game being released on?\n\nIt is going to be released initially on PC/Mac/Linux.

Use a combination of gravity manipulation mechanics, rolling and gliding to build momentum and soar across a wide array of exoplanets. Follow the story of mankind's first, ill-fated mission outside the solar system.\n  EXO ONE has been described by some as \"Kubrick's Tiny Wings\" and \"Journey meets 2001: A Space Odyssey\". The gameplay mechanics are inspired by games like Tiny Wings (iOS), Journey (PS3), and Tribes Ascend (PC). Every aspect of the game is laser focussed towards delivering an entrancing, flowing and exhilarating feeling of movement across a range of utterly alien exoplanets.\nWind down and travel at your own pace. There are no challenges, time limits, wars or enemies.\nAs you traverse these planets, an otherworldly, reverberating, electric guitar-laden soundtrack plays, while a far-future historian narrates and presents clues as to what happened during humanity's first, ill-fated mission outside the solar system.\n  EXO ONE's story is told partly through the player's strange encounters on the surfaces of each exoplanet, and partly through a future-historian, who delivers smooth voice-over narration interspersed throughout the game.\nOur pilot, flung to an unknown corner of the universe and utterly alone, has only the enigmatic alien structures on the horizon to aim for. Where they lead is up to the player to find out.\nEXO ONE glows red on a frozen world\n\"In the early 21st century, mankind received a signal from a distant point in empty space, light-years from any star. The signal contained plans for an alien craft, which humanity soon built. We called it, 'EXO ONE', 'Exo' meaning 'external' or 'from outside', 'One' referring to the first craft of its kind.\nDuring a regular trial run in a hidden, underground facility, the test-pilot inadvertently triggered a wormhole to open, pulling EXO ONE through to places unknown.\nThe alien technology was so advanced, humanity had barely begun to understand how the craft worked, its full potential and abilities were yet to be charted.\"\n  \"The alien craft appeared to be a marvel of high efficiency, momentum-based transportation. \nThe outer shell was completely frictionless and seemingly impervious to harm, while somehow also highly malleable and able to change form. The craft could transform easily between a sphere and a disc, the former used to traverse the landscape, the latter to glide through the sky and maintain altitude.\nA gravity drive enabled the pilot to shift between high gravity and low gravity. In high gravity mode, the craft becomes incredibly heavy, dropping out of the sky at great speed, or rocketing down hillsides. In low gravity mode, the craft was able to maintain momentum and speed, quickly racing up hillsides and launching off into the sky.\nIn combination, these forms of movement enabled EXO ONE to reach colossal speeds, reach great heights and cover vast areas in little time, and without any discernable power source. \nThese were just the first discoveries of what EXO ONE was able to achieve.\"\n  It's all about the exhilaration of movement. Increase the gravity of EXO ONE to send it rocketing toward the ground, hitting a downslope to build energy before launching off hillsides and soaring into the air and through thunderclouds. \nA simple, yet evocative and mysterious story, told by voice-over narration. Players are left to contemplate strange and perplexing events as they move from planet to planet.\n12 procedurally generated, endless, open alien worlds to traverse. Choose your own path, go in any direction. Landscapes are crafted for their beauty as well as their form, to allow maximum satisfaction of movement.\nA wide array of alien worlds, from terrestrial (desert, sand, rock) to water planets, to gas giants and more. Each has its own unique geology, providing you new, otherworldy playgrounds, with different landforms, atmospheres, skyscapes and other features.\nThe mysterious craft that is EXO ONE. Master the movement, discover its quirks and uncover new abilities as you progress.\nVisually striking graphics, with vivid colors and dense atmospherics puts you right on the surface of space's wildest locations.\nA reverberating, ambient, and electric guitar laden soundtrack by Rhys Lindsay completes the meditative and entrancing experience of EXO ONE.\n  EXO ONE features fully 3D, procedurally generated planets as the star feature of the game. \nEach planet consists of several biomes, mixed together to create subtle, but endless variation. Many planets also contain 'feature' locations that are placed by hand among the procedurally generated terrain.\nHaving worked as a photographer and 3D artist, I've worked on everything from low polygon racing tracks in the 90's to sprite-based characters to VR environments. As an HDRI photographer, I have worked with an 'image based lighting' pipeline, giving me a solid understanding of realistic lighting and physically based shaders.\nProcedurally generated terrain. Game view left, scene view right.\nComing aboard the team is concept artist Tim McBurnie, who has worked at companies such as Blizzard Entertainment, Blur studios, Relic Entertainment, and Wizards of the Coast. Tim will be working with me to flesh out the remaining planets in EXO ONE.\nTim's EXO ONE poster designed for EGX Rezzed\n  Players will journey across 12 separate planets. Each is a new sight to behold, with its own unique set of features, weather, and geology.\nPrepare for terrestrial planets, water worlds, ice worlds, tidally locked planets, gas giants and more!  \nWe've left some room in planning for backer suggested planets, so this is an area we'd feel particularly happy to get backer feedback on!  \nThe completed planets so far are:  \nSagan 4  \nThe snow covered hills and cloud filled skies of Sagan 4\nA gentle and relaxing introduction into the worlds of EXO ONE, Sagan 4 features rolling hills, sweeping mountain faces and thunderclouds lit by a slowly setting sun. Mostly a desolate place, but there are still traces of life to be found...  \nGnowee  \nGnowee, a cold, dark and icy rock with incredibly fast moving clouds.\nOn the opposite end of the color palette, Gnowee is dark, and frozen solid... Winds whip across its surface, driving high speed clouds through the sky, which EXO ONE can surf like waves.     \nEXO ONE wouldn't be complete without its signature, hypnotic, ethereal and reverbing electric guitar soundtrack, written by Rhys Lindsay.\nEach planet features its own custom track to suit its personality and further bring the player into the alien environment.\nPLAY\n\n  While I've worked on the game on my own now for over a year, I've also had help from Rhys Lindsay with the game's soundtrack, and occasionally, with some sanity-saving coding help when I get stuck! \nTim McBurnie is also coming on to help with some planet concepting, and was kind enough to create the Rezzed poster I took to London. With these guys on board, the game development studio is called Exbleative. \nI'll continue as the mostly sole developer, unless the game reaches 2 or 3x the campaign funding goal, in which case I may recruit someone else full or part-time.\nJay Weston -  3D Art, Code, Sound, Story.\nEXO ONE's development is lead by myself. I write code, create the artwork, write the story and produce the sound. I have a 3D art and photography background, and worked as an artist then game designer in a AAA games developer (Ratbag) for 5 years before working as a photographer for over 10 years. I then joined forces with a former work colleague to create the zombie games, Class 3 Outbreak and Zombie Outbreak Simulator. Later, I created my first solo iOS title, Unknown Orbit. EXO ONE is my second (mostly solo) game.\nRhys Lindsay - Musician, Code Consultant\nRhys is crafting the hypnotic soundtrack for EXO ONE. He did the music for Class 3 Outbreak, Zombie Outbreak Simulator and Unknown Orbit, and has been programming in Unity/C# for over 5 years. He will also be helping me with some coding as required. \nIf you like the music in EXO ONE's trailers, check out Rhys' YouTube channel.\nTim Mcburnie - Concept Artist\nTim Mcburnie is a concept designer, illustrator and author based in Australia. He works in the French comic book market as well as animation and video games. His client list includes companies such as Editions Delcourt, Gunfire Games, Ankama, Blur studios, Blizzard Entertainment, and Wizards of the Coast.\nYou can find Tim's amazing work on his website at www.timmcburnie.com\nWhy Kickstarter? \nFull-time work on EXO ONE began early 2016, and since then, all basic systems have been implemented. I've perfected the gravity and gliding movement mechanics, and created numerous planets, including many prototypes and tests. From this point on, what remains is mostly content creation (planets, music, narration, story) and optimization.\nI showcased the game at this year\u2019s EGX Rezzed in London in the Leftfield collection with great success, and prior to that, at Australia's local AVCON Indie Games Room. The version I brought to Rezzed included the game intro, tutorial, first and second planets, complete with voice-over narration and other story elements.\nJay showing EXO ONE at EGX Rezzed, Leftfield\nWe are asking for $35,000 to complete the core game, which includes 10 more planets, a similar number of music tracks, story refinement, concept art, and the voice over narration. \nCost Breakdown\nExo One cost breakdown in AUD $\nStretch Goals\nWe have a number of stretch goals that, if met, will allow EXO ONE to further push the boundaries of representing highly varied, fantastical planets, atmospheres and generally improve quality in all areas. We will be unveiling stretch goals as we approach them, and plan to aim first and foremost for stretch goals that won't push project release dates back too far.\nEXO ONE will be a predominantly digital-only reward campaign. As a mostly 1-man team, and in line with keeping things simple, we've opted to do minimal physical shipping to take as little time away from actual game development as possible. \nWe've tried to provide options, for example the print-it-yourself, high resolution poster files, to fill the physical gap. Most people living in a metro area can get posters printed very cheaply, and we feel this is a decent alternative.\nBacker Preview Build\nCurrently at an early alpha stage, the backer build is included as-is, and is unoptimized. You may encounter bugs, frame rate issues and other problems that make this build unplayable for you, especially if you own an older computer. There are however quality options available to cater for a wider range of computer specs. It contains the intro, tutorial and first two planets. \nYou'll receive this at the end of the campaign in the event of successful funding. \nBacker-Only Polls\nTake part in backer polls during development to help influence things like planet types and other features that will go into the game.\nSoundtrack\nContains 1 song and one song variation per planet, provided in mp3 format.\nBeta Version\nUnlike the above alpha preview build, the beta is a mostly completed game, which requires testing and optimisation before the final game is released.\nPDF Art Book\nI'll will be working with the concept artist, Tim, to come up with the visual appearance of each planet prior to work commencing. This will include work such as thumbnail sketches, color studies and variations, and more detailed work ups, which finally inform the look of the in-game planet and the self-print posters.\nSelf Print Posters\nThis is a digital reward, a JPG file that you will use to print your own EXO ONE poster at home or at your local printer shop. Resolution will allow printing up to A0. We had a lot of positive feedback on the poster at Rezzed and I'm excited to do more!\nStrange Sounds Tier\nI'll work with you to come up with and record either your voice, a message, instrument or generated sound, 3 seconds maximum length. Must be an original recording. \nYou could submit one 3 second clip or a number for me to choose between. Without giving too much away of the story, most of these sounds will appear somewhat randomly, and could be quite heavily distorted.\nNaming Rights Tier\nWork with me to name one of the planets featured in EXO ONE. You choose the planet, and based on its characteristics and theme, we come up with a suitable name. The narrator will speak it's name! Included in the credits are a super special thank you letter for your support at this tier.\nAdd-Ons\nIncrease your pledge by the following amounts to receive these add-ons.\nNote - you must be at least an Early Bird reward tier level to gain access to add-ons. \n$2 each \nDownloadable \"Rezzed\" print-it-yourself poster \nDesktop wallpapers \n$4 each \nSoundtrack \n$7.50 each \n12 self-print posters  \nPDF Artbook\n$10 each \nBeta access (must be EXO ONE tier level or above) \n$16 each \nExtra copy of game \nHow do I get these add-ons, you ask? \nPress the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d button (top right). If you haven\u2019t pledged yet it will say Back this Project. Increase your pledge in the Pledge Amount box by the amount of the add-on/s you would like. For example, say you\u2019re an EXO ONE tier backer ($17), and want the pdf art book (+ $7.50). You\u2019d increase your pledge to $24.50 \nDon\u2019t change the tier you\u2019re pledged at, unless you\u2019d like to do so while on this screen. \nAfter the end of the Kickstarter, you will receive a survey that will ask how you would like your add-on money assigned. \nPlatforms  \nEXO ONE will be initially available on Windows to download on Steam (the game has been Greenlit). Other platforms, including consoles, Mac and Linux will be evaluated after the campaign and game's launch, and most likely in that order. \nPress Kit \nWant to help spread the word about EXO ONE?

I'm fully prepared to do whatever is necessary to reach completion. I wouldn't be asking for your support if I hadn't already invested my own time and money to create a fun and proven game (see the quotes above). With your help, I can begin working towards completion.\n\nSCHEDULE RISK: The most common risk factor in any game. The completion date for Early 2018 is based on my experience having completed numerous planets already, with the core of the game now mostly complete. Should the game take longer than expected to complete, there is a chance that the release date will slip. If I feel this is necessary for the good of the game, I plan to be fully transparent with the reasons behind the decision and will notify backers to explain the situation.\n\nFUN RISK: Having developed numerous prototypes in the past, I'm fully aware sometimes game concepts just aren't as fun as expected. However, having built out and polished the core gameplay loop for EXO ONE over the course of a year, and taken the game to two events locally and overseas, I can safely say gamers thoroughly enjoy playing.\n\nFinally, while I live and work in the small city of Adelaide, I frequently meet and talk with other similarly sized indie developers who have successfully brought games to Steam, and often seek their advice. Furthermore, as a game made with Unity, the huge community of developers is a big help. I am in personal contact with the developers of plugins I'm using, and for anything else, I have the support of experienced developer, Rhys Lindsay among others.\n\nThank you for helping EXO ONE reach its full potential by backing my dream sci-fi, space exploration game!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "Remote Viewer", "descp": "Sit back and watch the EXO ONE project unfold with the knowledge you played a part!

On the journey to find justice there are multiple paths and dozens of endings. Will you solve the murder, or stumble into a larger conspiracy at play? Stepping on the wrong toes or turning into the wrong alley could send you to an early grave, and this city's full of em.\n  You'll investigate crime scenes, track perps, and interview witnesses with a number of tools at your disposal, including multiple modes of vision that can expose additional leads and multiple hacking tools for when you log into the GRID-- a vast virtual network where you physically travel through data at blazing speeds to grab encrypted files, hack nodes, meet with clandestine avatars, or even find gateways into the illegal, crime-ridden UnderGRID. \nOn the hunt for the truth, you can completely miss a lead while investigating a scene as you only need one to move the story forward. Often the evidence you can find will give you multiple leads you can investigate next, however time passes which each choice you make and choosing to follow one lead could result in another disappearing. Weather is washing away evidence, people are coming and going inadvertently corrupting clues in their everyday routines, and criminals are cleaning up the trail behind them at the same rate you're making your way forward. \nI believe in order for a player to have a sense of discovery, there has to be the possibility they can miss something completely. That's what truly makes it an adventure- without that you're just on a ride with someone else at the wheel.\nAs for conversations, you'll use Personality Profiles to interview witnesses and suspects in the direct dialog system, where the things you say irrevocably effect your relationship with that person as well as the information they give you, and possibly even what actions they take next. They can lie to you or lead you into a trap if you're not careful with your words. And you only get one shot to get that intel. No info-dumps here.\nYour hard-boiled protagonist's mental state effects the game as well. If there's time, going by Sue's Coffee in the morning will make you more perceptive the rest of that day, and you might be able to find more leads. However, there's a darkness in this detective's past as well, and the cure lies at the bottom of a bottle. If the Chaser doesn't drink for too long, the nightmares come back and interfere with the investigation in detrimental ways. Too much drinking has its obvious drawbacks as well and could draw the ire of Chief. Other vices can be found downtown if you need that extra, not-so-legal perk. Finding a wellness balance is key to staying sharp for this case... or perhaps falling off the deep end is just the edge you need to get things done?\nAs you investigate Sector city you'll be updating your internal database, and even if you reach an early ending (or grave) and start again, the dossiers and other data you've collected will carry over. You're better equipped with the data you need each time you play through, with campaigns lasting anywhere from half an hour to 6 hours. Having late game data early could even unlock new avenues of investigation. So don't be afraid to piss of that gangster- he might tell you something real important before strapping on those cement boots and you'll be able to use it on your next play to get even further down the rabbit hole. Why are you able to recall these things? Who can say, perhaps if you do a bit more digging...\nWith the sometimes lowkey, sometimes uptempo synth heavy music of SectoR I intend to invoke a time and place you've never visited, yet are nostalgic for nonetheless. With enough funding I'm also hoping to licence or even have original music composed by modern musicians leading the way in bringing 'wave music back in fresh new forms.\nBelow are a few early, unfinished samples that should give a good idea of the type and range of music the final product may have.\n  Sector is a world with a rigidly defined class system, so much so that those living on the top floors have different sets of laws than those at the street level, with strictly guarded vertical borders. And when a crime is committed that overlaps these borders, you call a CSR agent.\n   Because Sector is a post-singularity city, 5 tiers of artificial intelligence are used to categorize the different functions and abilities of its robot and computer inhabitants.\n Sector is not only a post-singularity city, its also a post singularity reaction city. On the ashes of a divisive law that made illegal several million self-aware citizens, tensions have never been higher between biological and artificial. Several new industries have escalated in kind, identity alteration and trafficking as these former citizens attempt evade decommission with the help of their neighbors, and in response, bounty hunting and spying from the morally dubious types looking to make a little money, or with the promise of citizenship upgrade. A Chaser agent can't help but get involved, in one way or another.\nTech advances far faster than people are willing or able to adapt, which creates further conflict. Tech progress coinciding with social regress. Cavemen fighting with laser guns. How did it get to this point?\nFollowing an unexpected meteor shower, a mysterious dust appeared in the air all over the world, clouding the atmosphere and killing 70% of all plant life and that which depended on it to live. Radio and satellite signals were unreadable.\nWorldwide chaos.\nBut then, a discovery- this dust could be easily harnessed into a source of power, and seemed to be endless. Rich or poor, power was now everywhere and free. Nations of the world turned inward for a time as a 2nd Renaissance brought forth new technology quicker than ever before in history. Flora was dwindling but food could now be produced artificially. The rain and air was tainted, but most states had purification plants.Most, but not all. Plants couldn\u2019t be built fast enough to prevent a worldwide famine. People were desperate.\nOn the ashes of The War, nations fell and in their place, thousands of micro states, densely populated cities built around essential water resources, formed. One of the larger city states in the Northern Hemisphere is SectoR City. The year is 2026. The world has ended twice in 40 years and been reborn twice.The world will end once more,\nBut until then...\n The Creator\n I'm Ryan Hall, formerly an animator at OffBase productions. While there did contract modeling, rigging, and animation work related to such marquee titles as Dark Souls 3, Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness, and Dragonball Xenoverse 2 in addition to some VR stuff I'm not at liberty to discuss in detail. \nLater once my contract ended I began work on an updated show reel and had the idea for a futurist city that could act as the connective gateway for my portfolio pieces. But the more I worked on it, the more I realized this could be the genesis of a more ambitious idea; that eventually became the Kickstarter I've shared with you today. \nWhile I am doing just about everything solo, Id be remiss not to thank a few groups that helped pick up the programming slack. Thanks so much to Panda Studios and Heads&Brains for the use of their code in that regard. And of course, none of it would be possible without Unreal Engine 4, and big thanks to the fine folks constantly tweaking it at Epic Games for making something user-friendly enough for a right brain type of guy like me to throw a demo together.\nBacker Rewards\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing the sole creative drive for a game is a double edged sword, but enough people in the last decade have shown it can be a successful endeavor and often creates a game that feels unique in a way a large team game tends not to.\n\nAdditionally, with middle-ware development kits like Unreal 4 as well as marketplace blueprints and plugins, which were developed by teams of professional programmers and experts, you're never truly making a game on your own. And they'll be picking up the mechanical slack here while I focus on the rest; visuals, storytelling, modeling, rigging, texturing, animation, sound, music, etc., all the competencies of which can be assessed in the demo I've provided.\n\nMost of the game's story and visuals have already been mapped out, as you can see in some of the pre-rendered cut scenes; its just a matter of being able to put the time in to get this stuff running in UE4, and that just leaves covering expenses along the way.\n\nBranching off from a big Bay Area company and doing your own thing is a risk, but it avails you of risk-averse politics.

We\u2019re very much interested to release Unformed for portable devices (PSVita / 3DS) and Nintendo Switch eventually after the game is out for main platforms, but this is not set in stone.\nCurse Devices System \nCharacter development in Unformed works with help of unique Raw Stones - Curse Devices system; it\u2019s a complex system that was inspired by Sphere Grid system from Final Fantasy X and Equipment Skill system from Monster Hunter series. In order to become more powerful, players will have to upgrade variety of curse devices with raw stones, finding those through variety of tasks on their journey through Dvipa. If done correctly, the link between curse devices will strongly increase the power of both curse devices and raw stones inside them. Players will be able to acquire raw stones randomly throughout the game and will be able to improve their quality by upgrade and synthesis process. Curse devices are widely spread across every corner of both planes; players will have to explore locations and complete various tasks to get curse devices of the rarest quality.\nExploration / World \nUnformed will offer players a large number of distinct level settings. From underground mines to mountain salt lakes, locations not only look different, they each have unique gameplay features. These include but are not limited to:\nDynamically changing levels\nForeground and background binding \nMirror principle Illusions \nPuzzle solving by changing level structure.\nCombat \nUnlike the majority of 2D action games, the combat system in Unformed is very challenging, heavily inspired by Dark Soul and other games in the Souls series. Creatures attack in an unpredictable manner, making players think several steps ahead of every engagement in order to overcome their foes. Should they fail, they\u2019ll have to start back from the checkpoint. Even though Unformed isn\u2019t a reenactment of Souls games in 2D form, our designers are fans of the series and took inspiration of the combat style inherent to it. Take every fight seriously, carefully balancing between aggression and stamina. Use various magic spells, karma-infused weapons and enchantment to overcome the toughest of foes or to cop out of a bad situation.\nTeam Overview \nUnformed is being developed by Blackfire Games. Core members of our studio have years of international experience in the development of AAA games, have been involved in the design and production of a variety of Console/PC/iOS/Android games and have ported and localized many well-known titles, such as Rainbow Six, Rayman, Bioshock, FarCry, XCOM, etc.\nQuests \nPlayers will be able to acquire quests from NPCs; these quests may result in changing the game world or provide interesting fluff pieces of the world of Unformed. Some quests will have branching storylines; players will have to replay the game several times to fully experience sidequest's storylines. Unformed will consist of about 8 -10 secondary story arcs in addition to the main quest.\nWithout YOU, our dream will undoubtably be dashed on the jagged rocks of reality. Help us to create Unformed and we all will have a shot at living forever. We are all in this journey together and we promise to hold you tight the entire way (but not TOO tight).\nIf, by the will of the gods, we somehow achieve immortality and reach our goal, there is the possibility of an even greater treasure beyond the $20,000 mark! Vast amounts of glory and pleasure await backers with our Stretch Goals.\nSurely we will all live in bliss if the first goal of $30,000 is met. Once unlocked, the first Stretch Goal will enable backers to explore the expanded world of Unformed with an enlarged map, unveiling new levels and areas to make your mark upon.\nEternal glory will fall upon each head that contributes to the second Stretch Goal! Once the mere $50,000 mark is unlocked, flesh and bone will meld together to produce a new hero with whom players can control. While on the same level as our heroine, this new hero will possess different abilities and skills the likes of which have never been seen! Become accustomed to him! Control him! Additionally, players will experience the aesthetic power of more beautifully illustrated and animated scenes within Unformed!\nHelp us unlock both Stretch Goals and we will all reap the benefits and bounty that awaits! We are truly grateful to each of you for walking hand-in-hand with us down this long and perilous road.\n                   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re 100% confident that we can finish this game, but as we\u2019ve yet to become immortal, there are always risks. We promise you that we will do whatever we can to nail down all the problems. All of the money accrued will let us cover development costs, such as paying salary to our development team (we do have to buy groceries and pay rent with something), acquiring equipment and such. But because our staff is made of up angels and saints, we would be remiss if we didn\u2019t recommend that you back Unformed at your own comfortable level (if you don't want to donate, just spare a word. That will also help us tremendously!) To be brutally honest, we seriously need your help! We don\u2019t want this campaign to become another Kickstarter failure, so we hope we can generate and share huge-ass smiles of glee with everyone who helped us from now until the day we unleash Unformed out into the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Blackfire Games\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nBlackfire Games is committed to creating new original IP.

The entire game focuses on survival and exploration gameplay in a hand painted watercolor world created from the memories of Grinny's victims.\nSoul\u2019s Light is inside all of us. It is the driving force that keeps us moving. It\u2019s also a source of power that Mr. Grinny seeks to steal so that he can enter our world. In the game, all Soul\u2019s Light is hidden in items of meaning to the characters. You must find these items to collect enough light to defeat Mr. Grinny. \n     During my childhood, I was often plagued by the same nightmare. A shadowed creature with a hideous sharp-toothed grin would come to my room at night. I would throw my sheets over my head or hide under the bed, but he would always find me and flash that hideous grin, as his long sharp claws grasped me.\nI began to call him Mr. Grinny. \n As I grew up, I forgot about him and the nightmares stopped, but he was still lurking around deep in my subconscious. As an adult, I learned that my nightmares as a kid were actually sleep paralysis and that many other people experiencing it also see a shadowed figure, shadow people, or a man in a hat. Mr. Grinny floated to the top of my memories, and an idea began to form in my mind. \nNow I can share with the world the terror of Mr. Grinny...\nSoul\u2019s Light is all about Exploration and Survival. Gameplay is kept simple so you are drawn into the game's characters and story. You can harness the power of your Soul\u2019s Light to distract and in some cases destroy shadow creatures if they are not too powerful. As you use your Soul\u2019s Light, the world becomes less saturated as your light dwindles. You must find Soul Light orbs before it goes out for good. During the game, you will come across other lost souls searching for their Soul\u2019s Light, who you will join to take a final stand against Mr. Grinny.\nHand Painted 2D watercolor world.\n5 different Locations to Explore and discover their secrets.\nSurvival style gameplay, with classic platforming elements.\nShadow Creatures whose only goal is to find and destroy you.\nAn engaging story with an emotional core. \nQuirky characters you meet along the way that need your help. \nRandom Game Over animations that change with every death.\n       I have spent the last 10 years working in the animation industry as an animator and producer. 4 years ago I started to learn game development, and became hooked. I started Soul\u2019s Light 2 years ago by writing the story and fleshing out the character of Mr. Grinny. I created a 360 short introducing Mr. Grinny last year using Unity3D.\n               Use Google Chrome, Android, or iOS to watch in 360.\nI\u2019m leaning on my vast experience as a visual artist and storyteller to create a vivid world that will fill you with dread, but also compassion, courage, and ultimately forgiveness in yourself. I love to tell stories with emotional depth, and I wanted to cross that over into the video game world for a more visceral interactive experience. \nWatercolors are used to create the assets and levels for Soul\u2019s Light by hand. All animation is hand drawn and then painted before being added to the game engine Unity3D. This makes the world feel like a watercolor painting that has come to life. It also creates an impressionistic look to the game unlike anything before.\n               PC, MAC, LINUX\nI have been working Soul\u2019s Light for 2 years. The characters and story have been developed, and I have the main game functionality and mechanics running in the prototype. This Kickstarter is to allow me to move into production with the watercolor art assets for the different levels of the game, be able to have help on Unity3D coding, painting, and animation. \nWith your help, we can make Mr. Grinny\u2019s world come to life!\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk is that this is my first game. Because of this, I made the conscious decision to keep the scope and gameplay of Soul\u2019s Light very simple. By doing this, I\u2019m confident in my ability to create a game where I can use my 10+ years experience as an Animator, Storyteller, and Producer. During that time I have delivered more than 40 projects, including Commercials, TV Shows, and Animated Feature Films.\n\n I didn\u2019t jump into this campaign lightly. I have used my production experience to make a solid schedule and budget that I have been following. Soul\u2019s Light has 2 years of development, so there is a strong foundation for this game to sit on, along with the support structure I have to help me get to the finish line. \n\nI decided to start this Kickstarter at this point in development to help the game through the rest of production, polishing, QC, and the final release. In my entire 10-year career I have delivered all projects on schedule without quality suffering. While timelines can shift due to unforeseen circumstances, I am dead set on releasing a quality game in September of 2018.

If you manage to survive its inhabitants, your skills will be challenged by the enormous and fierce creatures that rule this damned universe.\n  Explore a huge land, a universe that feels as open as it is oppressive, delivered through a non-sequential level design that puts you in control of where to go next.\nWe are putting great focus on achieving a very satisfying combat mechanics with very responsive control, smooth animations and lots of blood and gore.\nHandmade pixel art, with large sprites and super smooth animations, created pixel by pixel, frame by frame.\nEvocative narrative: Blasphemous\u2019 levels are not just platforms; they tell a story to those who are interested, but don't get in the way if you just want the action.\nFind your personal combat style by equipping rosary beads, or carrying around relics that boost your abilities.\n  Inventory and player progression\n      We\u2019re proud to announce that we have teamed up with a very experienced development partner to be able to release the game simultaneously on all these platforms!\nSet in the savage land of Orthodoxia, a place where religion is of the utmost importance in the eyes of the populace, superstition runs amok, and churches outnumber people two to one. You will find yourself in this hellish territory in the wake of the Age of Corruption.\n...The High Pontiff was entirely transformed into a great, withered and barren tree and burned for ninety days and ninety nights...\n...Riddled with frustration at their insufficient devotion, The High Pontiff heaved his golden throne with and turned the entire throne back. Years passed and all of a sudden it appeared something was beginning to change in the state of the High Pontiff. Dried out, dying branches began to emerge from the ends of his fingers and slowly started growing out from all over his pallid, immobile body. The High Pontiff was transformed into a great, withered and barren tree and began to burn for ninety days and ninety nights...\n...A huge mountain of ash stood in its place, topped by the infamous turned throne, unoccupied and unguarded...\n...Once the tree had been entirely consumed by the flames, a huge mountain of ash stood in its place, topped by the infamous turned throne, unoccupied and unguarded. The remaining church leadership scrambled upwards to reach the top and assume the throne. But the mountain begin to shift beneath their feet and before long the mountain of ash had swallowed up each and every soul who had been present in the Cathedral. From the ashes rose those poor unfortunate souls who had been swallowed up, transformed into horrible, deformed and bloodthirsty beasts, wildly aggressive and violent in nature, but with their faith intact...  \n  In Blasphemous, you will play as The Penitent One, a rogue nomad tackling the evil of this world alone with only its trusty sword by their side.\nThe Penitent One is the last survivor of a congregation called The Silent Sorrow. The whole group was punished to be thrown to the great Abyss of the Eternal Grief.\nHere you will see some of the horrific and inhuman enemies our pixel artists came up with over the last few months. More scarier and larger creatures will follow soon!\nAcolyte\n  Flagellant\n  Sister of the Our Lady of the Burnt Face\n    Weight of her burden\n  Condemned\n  Processioner\n    The Penitent One\n      Procession of Flagellants, 1793 - Francisco Goya\nIn Blasphemous, we\u2019ve set ourselves an artistic challenge: Can we create a dark fantasy world that is universally appealing, but also deeply inspired by the most meaningful icons of our local folklore? If you play Blasphemous, chances are that you may want to visit the city of Seville (Spain) in the future, to see the locations, traditions and culture that inspired the game.\nSkyline of the city of Seville (Spain)\n  We are lucky to have Carlos Viola\u2019s mastery on board. He's the award-winning composer of 'The Last Door', and other remarkable indie titles like 'Pharaonic' (by Milkstone), 'Six sides of the world' and 'Rotor'scope'.\nThis time around, he will be directing the work on both the Original Soundtrack and the audio design.\nListen to the first theme of the soundtrack:\nIf you don\u2019t know the works of Carlos Viola, we recommend you start by checking out his amazing work for \u2018The Last Door\u2019, available on Spotify.\n  We\u2019re a tiny development studio that focuses on creating meaningful playable experiences. We proudly specialize in delivering great games, despite operating with scarce resources. Maybe, you've heard about our previous work, a playable homage to classic horror writers (Lovecraft, Poe, & Machen):\n'The Last Door' is an award winning point and click horror adventure. It\u2019s a series of 8 playable episodes, developed using crowdfunding between 2013 and 2016. Initially, they were launched for browsers, but now you can enjoy them in their Collector\u2019s Editions for PC, iOS, Android and Windows Phone.\nOur previous title, \u2018The Last Door\u2019, was developed together with its community, with frequent discussion, beta builds, and incorporating community feedback in every possible way. For \u2018Blasphemous\u2019 we want to take this concept even further.\nWe offer our backers several levels of involvement with the project\u2019s development:\nThe Penitent (20 $) an up: We love transparency! Any pledge that includes the game will give you access to frequent development updates.\nThe Follower (25 $) and up: This pledge will grant access to a private development forum, where you will be frequently asked for feedback, participate in polls and help us with decision-making, plus access to the game's beta.\nThe Disciple (40 $), The Immortal (200 $) and up: you\u2019ll get access to our private channels on Slack/Discord, where all the design discussions will take place, one-on-one conversation with the development team, enjoy monthly (unfinished) builds and all future prototypes of the game.\n      The work on Blasphemous started in November 2016. The first stages involved the creation of the first bunch of concept art, to explore the artistic themes we wanted the game to feature. We\u2019ve been working non-stop since then, and indeed completed some key milestones along the way.\nWe are now preparing to switch from pre-production to production, and that\u2019s when we need you on board!\nWe\u2019re currently prototyping the second layer of gameplay, involving narrative and exploration mechanics. We're in the process of measuring the production scope and testing every required production pipeline. After that, we will confidently enter the production stage!\nFrom there, we have laid out a roadmap of frequent milestones (please note these dates are subject to change, although we are confident in our production dates):\nJune. 2017 - Aesthetics prototype (If the campaign succeeds, available for all backers, for Win/Mac/Linux!)\nSep. 2017 - Win/Mac/Linux Narrative prototype (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nNov. 2017 - Win/Mac/Linux Player\u2019s progression prototype (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nQ2, 2018 - Win/Mac/Linux Alpha (The Disciple pledge or above required).\nQ3, 2018 - Win/Mac/Linux Beta (The Follower pledge or above required).\nQ1, 2019 - All Platforms Global launch.\n                      So far, this project has been completely fueled by our own money. Bringing the game to Kickstarter now will enable us to get the extra funds we need to fully realize our artistic goals while retaining full creative control. For us, and particularly for Blasphemous, this is critical because of the potentially controversial topics we are featuring in the game.\nAt the same time, it creates a community around the game we can rely on to make the game truly awesome! While creating our previous game \u2018The Last Door\u2019, we experimented with opening the development process to the community. It was not only the most amazing experience, but it also helped the game become really extraordinary, reaching quality standards that we never hoped to achieve on our own, thanks to the collective intelligence.\nLet's make another game together!\nEngage the developers in our DISCORD server\nFollow us on Twitter:\n@BlasphemousGame\nFollow us on Fadebook:\nFacebook.com/BlasphemousGame\nOfficial website\nPresskit()\n This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen you are about to embark on any project there will always be a certain amount of trepidation. You can list all of the \u2018What ifs\u2019 until you\u2019re blue in the face. There is a long road ahead of us from our current development stage to our final product release and it would be foolish to assume it will all be smooth sailing. However, we are experienced developers, having successfully steered a three-year development project right before this one, so we feel confident we will know how to manage the unexpected.\n\nSome of the areas of expertise required for this project are beyond our skill set, particularly the ones related to porting the game to consoles, and the ones related to marketing. We will seek strategic partners to go where we cannot go on our own. \n\nFinally it\u2019s worth mentioning that due to the controversial and mature nature of some of the themes and visuals, we may have to prepare ourselves to fight a couple of battles against censorship, political correctness or etiquette here and there, but we\u2019re confident that if we have the support of you backers, we will be able to manage it in a way that it is satisfactory to most parties.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "The Thankful", "descp": "Not sure if you'd want the game, but you still want to give a hand to the developers, be kept in the loop and receive the backer-exclusive campaign updates.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["283 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "The Penitent - EARLY BIRD", "descp": "Be among the first backers to receive a 33% discount on The Penitent reward tier!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital download (Steam or GoG/DRM-free) for Win, Mac & Linux\nInstructions on PDF\nWelcome kit: wallpapers, ringtones and other digital goodies", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["499 backers", "Limited (1 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "The Penitent", "descp": "Get 'Blasphemous' the game when it's done!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital download (Steam or GoG/DRM-free) for Win, Mac & Linux\nInstructions on PDF\nWelcome kit: wallpapers, ringtones and other digital goodies", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["2,146 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "The Follower", "descp": "Get the soundtrack, access to the Beta and have a significant impact in the game's final form by participating in development discussions and polls.

Or just do nothing when facing evil?\nTrauma \nIntense stress and guilt will impact your heroes. \nNo one knows how they will react when pushed to the edge. Bursts of anger, depressions or betrayals: everything is possible. Try to keep them alive and sane...\nReplay value\nDepending on the choices you make, some situations will or will not happen further in the game. Play it several times to discover them.\nPlus, an additional Story + mode will make the adventure even more unpredictable. \n    My name is Thierry and I\u2019m an independent gamedev from Brussels, Belgium.   \nAfter my studies in Corporate Communications -Yes, I know. Please don\u2019t judge me- I decided to follow my dreams and start creating games. I learned to program and to draw -or at least I pretend I have- and started working full time on The Man Came Around.  \nSo, instead of telling you to buy useless stuff, I\u2019m telling you to buy entertaining stuff made by my tiny hands. Hooray!  \nI\u2019m also an incorrigible leftist.\nOne year and a half ago, as I started working on this game - a simple plane crash story then called To the Sky- I asked myself what I could to do to make the world a better place. \nI decided to use my games to relay progressive values and express some of my frustrations about the system. \nDon't get me wrong, I like explosions and stuff in games, but more variety cannot be a bad thing. All movies are not action movies, are they ? And if a game talking about politics and social issues can impact only one person positively, it\u2019s definitely worth a shot. \nSince I made that decision, a lot of things happened. 2015 and 2016 were pretty f****d up.  Scandals, protests, bombings - sometimes close to home -, elections\u2026 Some made the game looks more like a documentary than a dystopian fiction.\nSo Pipette Inc., my studio, will only produce games containing a meaningful critique of society.  It\u2019s not just about The Man Came Around, but the entire studio\u2019s philosophy. So here's my whislist for our poor world and the values that Pipette Inc will defend and promote : \nLet\u2019s stop discriminating people based on their race, gender or sexuality. And I\u2019m a cis white male, so to all my counterparts around the world : stop being douchebags.\nSociety should work for all of us, not just a greedy minority. Life is not about productivity and money. You also need to have the time to play games.\nI don\u2019t want polar bears to die. Oh, and no climate wars, droughts, floods, massive pollution and the end of the world either. Climate change is real. Deal with it! \nWe should always fight fascists. Insert a whiny \u00ab Aren\u2019t you a fascist because you want to beat fascists, you fascist ? \u00bb comment here. Well, sorry alt-right nazis, but \u201cWe don\u2019t like your kind here.\u201d \n\n   \nI've been working full time on The Man Came Around for a year and a half now. I learned a lot in the process, and I\u2019m finally sure to have all the tools and abilities I need to finish the game. Which is why I dare bring this project to kickstarter.\nAs you know, an artist doesn\u2019t live from just love and fresh water. We also need some dry bread, a cardboard house and a wifi connection. I\u2019m currently financing the game with my savings and the support of my family, but I need a little help in order to make the game better and replenish my pasta stock. \nAnd since The Man Came Around criticizes a lot the political corruption and the neoliberal greed, chances I\u2019ll get money from a bank or my right-winged government are \u2026 hem\u2026 pretty slim. \nSo I prefer to ask progressives from around the world to back the project, if the idea of a studio producing entertaining and committed games appeals to them. Call me a crazy socialist, an anarchist or a fool, but that\u2019s the way I roll! \nI\u2019m asking for ten thousand euros. It\u2019s a lot, and at the same time, it\u2019s not. To be honest, making games cost a lot of money, especially if you want to pay talented people to work and eat pastas with you.\nThe developmental cost of the game is much higher than what I ask here. The budget of an independent game can vary a lot, but it varies between 50 and 100K. So, I\u2019ll combine the Kickstarter money with my own savings to make it work.\nThe initial ten thousand will serve to pay :\nThe sound and music of the game \nMy food and my rent (let\u2019s be honest)  \nAnother starving 2D/3D artist to help me\nAny stretch goals attained will help me make the game better and finish it faster. Mainly be hiring talented people to help me improve some parts of the game.\nHere are some graphics to explain the whole thing. Everybody loves graphics! (Damn you, marketing :'( )\n    Some concepts and production processes from The Man Came Around. Thank you to Mary for her work on the HUD and some levels of the game, and to No\u00e9 for the concepts!\n         Poster, Artbook and T Shirt etc.\nI don't need to really explain those ones, so FEAST YOUR EYES ON THE MAGIC.\nThe Artbook, Poster and T Shirt. Also known as THE DREAM, people!\nThe Many's Manual for Revolution vol. I\nA booklet wrote by the activist organization known as \"The Many\" to oppose their corrupt government and greedy corporations. The manual is filled with good advices to protest and challenge the oligarchy. And also with dank memes.\n  The Man Came Around Boardgame prototype\nPlay The Man Came Around with friends with this experimental and yet highly promising version of the boardgame. Playable from 3 to 6 players, TMCA the Boardgame is a semi-cooperative adventure where your group has find a way trough the murderous borders and face multiples dangers.\nBy taking all those decisions almost democratically.\nIndeed, players can use card to influence votes, steal objects or just send someone else to a probable death...So, what will you do when the food runs scarce and Walt spent the whole game backstabing you?\nSometimes, you need to save your own ass. No hard feelings, Walt!\n    Tables of rewards\n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- Create a game\n\n\nCreating a game alone is quite the hurdle. So, how can I be sure I\u2019m gonna make it? \n\nWell, first of all, I\u2019m passionate and motivated. It sounds like a bad cover letter, but it\u2019s true!\n\nSecond, I\u2019m not truly alone. I have the chance of having great friends helping me on the project. And to be part of small-but-thriving belgian indie game scene, with a lot of great artists and coders always ready to share their knowledge\n\nThird, I spent a lot of time on the pre-production phase to be ABSOLUTELY certain I would be able to finish the game. Now it\u2019s just a question of time, and ability to live afterwards without being super-hyper-mega broke. \n\nDon't hate monday folks, hate capitalism.\n\n\n- Create a political game\n\n\nDoing anything political is risky, especially in video games. The internet is vast and full of trolls. But I don\u2019t really mind what alt-right nazis will think of me, so if you don\u2019t like the project, too bad!\n\nAnd If you do like it, then thank you.

You\u2019ll take control of the almighty ship Chukaru and its three unique weapons! Shoot wisely to either do double damage, heal yourself or charge your Super Attack! Inspired by the classics of the Dreamcast era, the Manufacture 43 team is making bold choices to modernize the genre and pushing it further while staying true to the legacy of games like Ikaruga or Zero Gunner.\nThis game is offering will offering an experience that will please newcomers with instant fun and challenge experienced players with a deep mechanic and tightly crafted level design.\nDiscover more details about our game below, and help push the limits of the genre by supporting us!\nPLATFORMS\nAs we are going to release for PC Mac and Linux first , we are currently doing everything possible to release on console as well. We already started the procedure to get Xbox One devkits and that should not be an issue. PS4 and Switch ones are a bit more complicated to obtain but with your support we can make it happen more easily.\nWe will keep you updated on this !\nupdate: Pawarumi will now be available for xbox one.\n  Join us on Discord all along the campaign and beyond !\n\nOur Greenlight campaign was validated in less than a week. Because of that we didn't have much time to interact with you! we are now opening a free to join Discord server to bring Pawarumi community in one place. We want to have a straight relationship with our players to get suggestions and feedback directly from you.\n\nFrom now on we will hang out on the server, so we can answer any questions you might have about Pawarumi !\nWe want this platform to be a place of love for shoot em up and arcade games in general.\n      Pawarumi is inspired by arcade legendary shoot\u2019em ups as well as Dreamcast\u2019s classic. And like every other shooter you\u2019ve got a full set of weapons with different characteristics. \n\nAll of them are mapped to a different input and are available at all time with unlimited ammunition so you can rain divine fire on your enemies !\nThe green weapon, known as Serpent Gatling got a large scope as close range and get more precise at long distance.\nFor example ,this allows you to kill a lot of small ennemies from upclose or do tons of damages on a single enemy if you anticipate it\u2019s movements enough.\nThe red weapon or Jaguar Missiles is an auto-locking one. Every enemy crossing the target area will receive a terrible blast, but be mindful of the range limitations because the missiles will loose target acquisition.  \nThe blue weapon also called Condor Laser is a concentrated beam of pure energy that does continuous damage and go through everything in a straight line. You will have to be precise with your placement to be fully effective and deadly.\nTHE TRINITY SYSTEM\n\nIn Pawarumi, the gameplay loop is centered around the Trinity System, which adds a tactical layer to the overall experience. Each facet of the system is triggered simply by shooting with the appropriate weapon on the right type of enemy.\nIt's a bit like a super rock-paper-scissors where every combination is beneficial to you.\n\nThe wheel of the Trinity below shows the different relation between the player weapons in the center and the enemies type on the outside.\nCRUSH to inflict double damage.  \nFor example shoot with the red weapon to crush blue enemies.\n\nBOOST to heal your shield while also making your opponents more agressive.\nFor example shoot green enemies with the green weapon. They both use the same energy and so you're both powered up ! \n\nDRAIN to charge your Super Attack! It will wipe the screen of most of your opponents.\nFor example shoot red enemies with the blue weapon and charge up your supper attack so you can unleash it several times in a level. \nMastering these three mechanics will be key to success in Pawarumi. It offers a lot of strategic opportunities and allows you to fall back on your feet even if you make a tiny mistake.\n\nThe more you'll play , the better you'll juggle with the weapons to find your own style, finish the game and eventually reach the top of the leaderboard !\nSCORING\n\nThe scoring is based on 3 types of points : Destruction, Charge and Combo. Each one is tied to one of facet of the trinity mechanic. \nCrushing will give you Destruction bonus points when you kill an enemy using a Crush\n\nDraining will grant you Charge bonus points and Boosting will grant you a bit more of them.\n\nCombo is the super attack scoring modifier. Each tic of every single bullet you shoot will add a number to the combo meter. At the end of the super attack you'll be granted with all the points corresponding to the damage you've done multiplied by the combo score ! \nMaximizing usage of all three mechanics throughout the game will lead you to the top of the leaderboard! \nFor example you can leech on a strong enemy with a Boost (and so facing a stronger foe) and finish him with a Crush to maximise the score ! \nBOSSES\nTroughout your journey you will encounter massive bosses. Each boss will offer a unique & intense experience and we crafted all of them to give you the challenge you craving for.\nYou will have to learn how to dodge their patterns and find your own strategy to defeat them.\nLet\u2019s meet the cast of Pawarumi\u2019s most dangerous foes :\n            You will live through the journey of Axo the godsend warrior. In this adventure she will travel the world fighting for the fate of humanity.\n\nOn Earth, in another universe, the Spanish invasions that decimated the pre-columbian civilizations never happened. Those civilizations then flourished, evolved exponentially and soon conquered the rest of the world with their technological superiority and their divine powers. Las, not unlike in our world, the omnipotent members of the Council that ruled the world became corrupt and the civilization was being drown into decay.\n\nThen came Axo, pilot of Chukaru, chosen by the gods to bring balance but also driven by anger against the Council for leading the world into chaos.\nPawarumi is her story, her legend. Live through her fight and discover the truth behind her actions.\n   \nUnique Artistic Direction: Set in a unique pre-columbian inspired retrofuturistic sci-fi universe and served by 3D graphics that give opportunity for glorious cinematic staging! \nFive Unique Levels: Happening in different parts of the world and inspired by classics from the 1990s and 2000s pop culture, like Indiana Jones, James Bond, Stargate or Star Wars\u2026 \nCrafted for replayability: Each level has a particular gameplay twist that will slightly change the way you look at the game. Study every possible options to reach the end of the game your own way! \n\nTrinity Game Mechanic: Three fused mechanics that enable infinite strategies! \n\nMany different enemies : And by many we mean a LOT ! Each with different patterns to dodge or behaviour to learn ! \nWeapon Mastery Scoring System: Build up your own scoring strategy with careful weapon juggling. With no long standing combos to maintain, scorers will never be frustrated! Are you ready to challenge the top of the leaderboard ?\nDynamic Layered Music: Awesome Electro Metal Peruvian soundtrack carefully crafted by our man Gregory Desmurs. You can be sure that you never heard anything like this!

Through the years, we forged a solid knowledge of game development and decided that it was time to make our own thing.\n\nLet's meet the team !\n      The sound and music of shoot'em ups helped define the basics of today's video games sound design. Like with every aspect of Pawarumi, we wanted something respeting that legacy as well as bringing something else to the genre.\n      Today Kickstarter is a milestone and a tool for us. It offers us an opportunity to get a strong support from the players and our community, while giving you access to our behind the scene and key informations about our journey. By doing this campaign, we are bringing you exclusive rewards that will not be accessible ever again.\nCheck it out !\n  REWARDS DETAIL \n\nThe digital copies of Pawarumi will be sent by email on release date. The physical elements will come a few weeks later depending on your location.\nThose of you that took the Raging Pilot pledge will also have access to a digital manual telling a bit more about the universe of Pawarumi and giving some gameplay tips and tricks to help you reach the top of the leaderboard faster!\nWe love game boxes! Our shelves are crowded with all kinds of them, from cartridge to CDs, collector editions of all sizes, and we\u2019re proud of our collections! We know that we\u2019re not alone in this case, that\u2019s why we are proposing a physical edition of Pawarumi to people who took the Born Legend pledge. It was important to us! And we want it to look awesome next to your other games! \nNot final design.\nFor people that will took the Knight of Xibalba pledge or higher we will send you regular exclusive beta build of the game! Test it and give us feedbacks on discord!\nThe collector edition of Pawarumi will contain exclusive ex-libris cards, as well as cool stickers to decorate your gear or just to collect!\nOver the Legendary Trainer pledge you\u2019ll get a kickass tshirt to show the world your love of shoot\u2019em ups and Pawarumi and show off with with friends !\nWe love figurines as well, even if our girlfriends don\u2019t ! The 3d printed version of Chukaru will be a beautiful asset and will be a collector piece that will stand proudly next to your other awesome dust gathering toys :)\n\nupdate: new exclusive in-game skin for all backers.\nExclusive backer golden skin\n    Pawarumi's development started in January 2016. At this time, the goal was to make a small shoot'em up with minimal risks and a very classic gameplay. This developement intention was safe but after a few prototypes we found out that the game could be more challenging and creative.\nThe goal of our journey as indie developers was to create content that will bring something new to players. We decided to create a game that will push the genre further as well as bringing a fresh experience to players that played shoot'em up or used to play them.\nThe Trinity System was created from this motivation. It is bringing more to the genre by adding a tactical layer to the standard shooter. We also get rid off additional lives, powerups and focus the user experience on player skill improvement only, as some modern games like the DarkSouls series tends to do. And player feedbacks were amazing.\n\nWe decided that the meso-american setting will give Pawarumi a unique identity. Mayan and Aztec culture, with their unique architecture style, mythologies and art are giving us a really good starting point for our visuals. Mixing this with 80s and 90s aesthetics allowed us to go bananas on the universe and create something that feels unique with a tiny bit of our teenagehood inside.\nFor the past year we have been developing Pawarumi. We are now around 70% of project completion. All the gameplay is well implemented and the scoring system is complete even if we are still tweaking it. Three out of the final five levels are complete and a fourth one is currently in production and should be done during this campaign. The fifth one is going to be quite different from the other ones but we will tell more about this later.\nThe release date is planned for May. And all five levels will be there at launch. Extra content is going to be added freely via updates. You can expect more game modes and better story development, and maybe ideas that will emerge from exchanges with our community on Discord.\n    Pawarumi is our first project as indie game developers. Making a game is a long and difficult process.\nOur initial plan was to publish by ourselves the best game possible in the short time allowed by our resources. The three of us left the industry to start this journey fulltime, being funded only by our savings.\n\nPawarumi was born from our envy to push the genre further. It does bring its original look, feel and mechanics that offer a lot of varieties in terms of level design, gameplay and replayability. We now need support from creatives to bring the final touches to some aspects of the game.\nWe also need support from the community to give Pawarumi the final impulse to bring it to its final release and even push it further. Coming to kickstarter is also a step toward the community that supported us for the past year and bring them physical rewards.\nBy backing this project you will take part of this journey.\nWe are now looking for 15000\u20ac, it corresponds to our needs to finish the game. funds raised by this campaign will be used for specifics purposes:\nPaying outside contractors - we needs an illustrator for in game and out game artworks, a narrative designer to bring Pawarumi characters to life. Add more music in the game.\nCovering company costs - Publishing a game is not just about coding and modeling. Your support will help us covering our company fees and have access to development software and hardware that we need. \nImproving and fixing - We need time to bring the game to a polish state. Your support will help us in those final moments. we would be able to push features up and bring to you a bug-free game.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter a year of development, Pawarumi is almost done, we just need few months of work to finish it. Our objectives are now simple: make the best game we can with our ressources and release the game. \nBut these ressources being our savings, we're now running low of them. Without this Kickstarter we will have trouble paying for the creative people we want to hire to make the game better.\n\nThe three of us have a cumulative experience of more than 20 years. For Pawarumi we capitalize on this experience to break any wall coming at us. We already have passed some key moments: closed alpha test, journalists reviews, showcasing in multiples festivals and creating the company. The most important left is to finish the game in time for the release in May and for that, you can count on us to work even harder.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Young warrior", "descp": "Manufacture 43 team will be forever grateful of your bidding.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac17 or more", "title": "Chukaru's Master", "descp": "Get a digital copy of Pawarumi!

Yet, it is the only way to reach a world long-forgotten by time. Will you heed the call of adventure and face the challenges that await within?\"\nTangledeep is an upcoming turn-based, dungeon crawling, roguelike RPG for PC, OSX and Linux. Its gorgeous 16-bit aesthetic is inspired by some of the most classic RPGs of the SNES era, such as Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger, while its deep and strategic gameplay combines elements of modern titles like Diablo and Rogue Legacy.\nLike what you see? Play the game yourself! We've been releasing public builds for 6 months now and lots of people are already playing and enjoying the game, even in its pre-alpha state! If you like what you see, remember that we have over 8 months of additional development left - think about much greater the game will become!\nNote: These are PRE-ALPHA builds and may have bugs, placeholder content, and gameplay balance issues. They're still fun, though!\nLatest Builds\nDownload for Windows\nDownload for OSX\nUpcoming Builds\nWe will be releasing new public builds through the end of APRIL, at which point builds will only be available to $15+ backers!\n  Tangledeep is designed with all the depth that is the hallmark of the roguelike genre - wonderfully diverse items, monsters, procedurally-generated locations, strategic gameplay, endless replayability, and deep customization.\nAnd just like console RPGs in the 16-bit era brought accessibility to an often dense and arcane genre, so too does Tangledeep offer a portal to the incredible depth of roguelikes with beautiful, easy-to-understand presentation and gameplay.\nOf course, this is not to say the game is easy! The trials will be great, the battles intense, and you will surely die. But you will see every challenge coming - nothing is unpredictable or hidden - and come away from each playthrough with more knowledge and better strategies for the next one.\nA surprise encounter with two deadly Panthox!\nIf the concept of 'permadeath' is intimidating, fear not - Tangledeep also has elements of metagame progression, inspired by such games as Rogue Legacy, Dungeonmans, and Shiren the Wanderer. For example, through the memorable and lovable Banker character, you'll be able to store items for future heroes to use in their journey.\nNo two adventures in Tangledeep are the same! Each time you play, the dungeon, its monsters, and items are all procedurally generated. The challenges you'll face will always be fierce, and it's up to you to build the character you want to play, with a highly flexible job system and 12 unique jobs planned.\nLearn skills in any order - mix and match to create custom characters!\nWant to sneak up on monsters, catch them by surprise and use dirty tricks like bombs and backstabs? Try the cunning Brigand!\nDo you prefer to carefully plan your encounters, laying down traps and dispatching enemies before they can get close? The swift Hunter is for you!\nOr how about using powerful elemental magic, modding and manipulating it to create custom spells? Give the Spellshaper a try!\nNot only does each of these jobs (and all the rest) have a distinct playstyle, but you can also mix and match skills from multiple jobs, along with hundreds of items and magic properties to completely customize your character! \nCast of Characters (So Far!)\n\nTangledeep has been in development for just over a year, and has been entirely funded out-of-pocket. Everything is budgeted and planned so that the core vision of the game can be completed no matter what. \nHowever, there are some visual and musical elements that I think would truly make the game look & sound amazing. \nOn the art side, I want to implement more character animations like walking, attacking, or using items. Since every piece of art is hand-drawn pixel-by-pixel, doing this requires significantly more art budget. For example, drawing 2 extra animations per character with 4 frames each requires 8x as many frames as the original character (and thus, 8x the time required!)\nThe Hunter's default idle animation\n  Prototype movement animation!\nMusically, I want to expand the score with special guests contributing to the soundtrack. One such guest is composer Hiroki Kikuta, best known for his work on Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, and one of my personal musical heroes!\nIf the Kickstarter succeeds, Kikuta will be writing a track!\nWith your help, we can expand the art and sound budget to create new sprites, write new music tracks, and make the game look & sound truly amazing.\nThe soundtrack of Tangledeep is a particularly important and special task, as the music of classic 16-bit RPGs is among the very finest of all video game soundtracks. Given that I'm a composer, I'll be writing the whole score and paying tribute to these soundtracks I've been listened to for so many years.\n\nAll the music is being written first using an SNES-style sample set, via the Super Audio Cart virtual instrument I designed with OverClocked ReMix. Then, I'll be taking these nostalgic chiptunes and turning them into fully-produced versions of all tracks with modern production!\n\nWith your help, I can also budget for more live musical performers (like Jeff Ball and Jillian Aversa) to help make these modern versions truly shine.\n\nCheck out the player below to see how the soundtrack is shaping up!\n\n  Could there be MORE guests...?!\n  Single Player\nPlatforms: Steam (PC, OSX), Linux forthcoming\nOther Platforms: Possible, as we are developing in Unity!\nControl: Keyboard only, Keyboard+mouse, Mouse only, controller\nMSRP: $15-20\nRelease Date: Q4 2017 (see Roadmap below for details!)\nFor the rest of the year, there will be ongoing work creating new content like items, monsters, NPCs, side areas, art, music. We're also constantly doing bug fixes, balance tweaks, polish, and optimization.\nThat being said, there are some major milestones and features planned which we've outlined in this handy roadmap below! \nNOTE: As is the case with game development, all features and dates are subject to change!\n   Andrew Aversa (@zirconST) - Programming, Design, Music\nHello! I'm a composer, and the owner and lead developer at Impact Soundworks, a music software company. So, when I'm not writing code for Tangledeep, I'm writing code for virtual orchestras, guitars, world instruments, and unique tools like Super Audio Cart. Since 2008 I've worked on and shipped over 30 software titles.\nYou might also know me as the electronic artist zircon (YouTube / Facebook), an alias under which I've released about a dozen albums and 30+ game remixes! I've also been part of the game industry for over 10 years, writing music for both AAA productions like Soulcalibur V as well as mobile games like Tap My Katamari, and indie titles. I've seen games through from conception to completion and I couldn't pick a better industry to work in.\nPersonally, I've had a very close connection to games for as long as I can remember. Besides playing them avidly in the 16 and 32-bit eras, I started creating games using QBasic, Klik n' Play, and mIRCScript (text-based IRC MUDs!) while growing up. I'm also a huge of tabletop gaming, especially pen & paper RPGs (I've been running a Pathfinder campaign for over 2 years now.)\nAndrew Luers (@OceansAndrew) - Environmental Art, UI / UX\nAndrew Luers (a.k.a. OA) is a UX designer, pixel artist, star musician and fitness guru hailing from Minneapolis! (He's also the beautiful and handsome face of OverClocked University, a kick-ass video game cover band you should check out.)\nFervir (@BlankTheVidya) - Character & Monster Art, Icons, Combat FX\nFervir has infused the world of Tangledeep with personality through awesome characters, sweet monsters and stylish animations. And while he's a true specialist in pixel art and animation, he's also a seasoned one-man game developer with skills in code, music, sound and design.\nLachlan Cartland (@AlcopopStar) - Item and Equipment Art\nLachlan is a freelance pixel artist from Melbourne, Australia who previously worked on Dungeonmans, among other projects - a game I worked on as well! - which was Kickstarted and launched to widespread acclaim in 2014. \nNo physical rewards?!\nI've been involved with 4 Kickstarter campaigns to date - three music albums, and one game (Dungeonmans!) All were successful, and all of them shipped. But all of them showed me that physical rewards are some of the most difficult things to manage of any campaign. They always end up more time-consuming than you would think, between manufacturing, approval, packaging, shipping + handling, not to mention more expensive.\n\nI would rather spend that time and money on making Tangledeep the best game possible. I hope you'll agree! \nThat being said, the digital rewards we've created are pretty awesome too. In the place of things like shirts, books, and posters, we've got things like immortalizing your name or handle in the game itself all the way up to collaborating with us to design new items and monsters. How cool is that?\nChief Chance Kisaragi could be YOUR NAME!\n  For 6 months now, Tangledeep has been in 'public development', and I intend on keeping it that way! This means you can always:\nChat on Discord - Talk to me and other players about your experiences!\n\nRead the Dev Log - See what goes into the game every build, and contribute your own suggestions or feedback!\n\nWatch Development Live - I'm shooting to stream development a couple times a week, always announced on Twitter (@TangledeepGame) first!\n\nAs mentioned above, public builds will continue to be available through the end of April, 2017. After this, builds will only be available to $15+ backers.\n\nOn 3/27, thanks to the generous support of over 500 backers, Tangledeep was funded! And that means there is even more we can do to make the game as awesome as possible!\n\nI'm acutely aware of how stretch goals can cause a project to balloon out of scope, delaying the whole thing or using up more budget than expected. I've carefully planned future development to avoid this sort of thing; so while I'd love to list something like \"Full overworld map with 50 new locations!\" as a stretch goal, I know that with only one programmer (me), that could be really risky.  \n\nInstead, I've created a bunch of stretch goals that really benefit the game in other ways - art, music, writing - without running the risk of delaying the project. I think once you see them, you'll agree: they're well-worth it!\nI'm very proud of how colorful, diverse, and creative the cast of Tangledeep is shaping up to be. We've got fat raccoon mechants, literal casino sharks, seven playable jobs, cat people... It's great. But while their in-game sprites are great, it would be even better if we could show their personality with pixel portraits!  \n\nThese would appear in things like your character sheet (changing based on your job), the upcoming in-game Compendium, and during conversations with NPCs.\n\nFrom GoldenEye, Perfect Dark and Banjo-Kazooie to Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, Desktop Dungeons and the upcoming Yooka-Laylee, Grant Kirkhope has created some of the very best scores to the most classic games of the last two decades. \n\n...and if we hit this stretch goal, we can add Tangledeep to his incredible body of work! \n\nI've got an outline for the story of Tangledeep, and while I'm going to expand on it in-game, the time I can spend is limited. That's why with this stretch goal, I can recruit the help of a great writer to flesh out the lore and world of the game! This would be done by way of: \nMore interesting flavor text for various items \nVarious \"lore drops\" like journal entries, books, historical records\nExtended dialogue with NPCs \nStory quests, key items \nIn-game compendium entries\nThis way, people that want to learn more about the world of Tangledeep will have a rich variety of sources to do so. (Of course, if you want to do nothing but hunt for treasure, that's fine too.)\n\nThe OC ReMix community is responsible for thousands and thousands of amazing, free video game arrangements and over 50 album projects. It's where I got my start, met my wife Jill, and many of my closest friends. \n\nI would like nothing more than to see (and hear) the community create a remix album of the Tangledeep soundtrack, and pay all the ReMixers for their hard work! This album would no doubt feature an amazing range of musical styles and interpretations. \n\nIf you want an idea of what these awesome musicians are capable of, you might start with the Final Fantasy VI: Balance and Ruin album project I directed, and which is available for FREE.\n\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been working on Tangledeep since February 2016 and the game is already in a very playable state with PC and Mac compatibility. You can play it for yourself now and see that the game is coming along quite well! \n\nI'm fortunate enough to have financial stability through my music software business Impact Soundworks, and royalties through my artist career. Thus, there is no risk that I'll lose my job and be unable to continue working on or investing in the game myself.\n\nI've also been careful in planning the scope and budget of Tangledeep, implementing all core features and systems already. All new content and work is iterative: more and better art, more items, more skills, more areas, better balance, etc. \n\nHowever, there are always unexpected challenges in game development. Here are a few:\n\n* Bugs can arise that take a long time to solve.\n* System-specific problems can occur, which often take the longest to diagnose and fix.\n* Porting to new platforms (in this case, Linux, which is planned) can be difficult.\n* Changes to Steam or other actions by Valve can make it take longer to get a game on the platform\n* Health or family issues can affect anybody working on the game.\n\nI've done my best to plan for these risks as best I can by allowing 8+ months and leaving an entire month (November) for bug fixing and polish.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Moss Jelly", "descp": "Thank you for supporting Tangledeep!

Through solving environmental puzzles and defeating formidable enemies, you will come to explore the millions of possible spell combinations on your path to becoming a real mage! \nThe story is being written by bestselling author Ed Greenwood, creator of the Forgotten Realms fantasy world for Dungeons and Dragons, which served as the basis for games like Baldur\u2019s Gate and Neverwinter Nights, as well as about 170 other fantasy books. \nThis epic adventure has an immersive soundtrack that was recorded live by the Video Game Orchestra and orchestrated by Shota Nakama (Final Fantasy XV, Kingdom Hearts II.5 HD Remaster).\nFeel free to listen to a mash-up of our original OST while reading!\nMages of Mystralia was created around a new and innovative spellcrafting system that allows you to create millions of new ways to fight enemies and solve environmental puzzles!\nTo accomplish this, you are given a spell book with four basic spell types:\nYou can modify these spells by adding and combining different runes to them.\nBehavioral runes: Adds a specific behavior that stacks with other behaviors attached to the spell.\nAugment runes: Modifies the runes to which they are connected, changing the variables of the behavior.\nTrigger runes: Nests additional spells within the current spell when certain trigger conditions are met.\nAs the game progresses, your spell book's contents will grow, opening up an exponentially growing number of options. You can then mix and match runes in order to create mega-spells that are greater than the sum of their parts. For example:\nIf we start with an Actus Orb of Fire...\n By adding the 'Move' behavior rune, we get a fireball.\n And adding a 'Duplicate' behavior rune gives us a triple fireball.\nNow if we attach the 'Duplicate' behavior rune to an Ice Ego spell instead, it gives an ice sculpture that can be used as a decoy to escape enemies.\nThen, we can add the 'Periodic' trigger rune to our ice sculpture to nest another spell. When prompted, we select the triple fireball. This creates an ice turret!\nFinally, attaching the 'Right' augment rune on the turret will make it turn clockwise, shooting in 360 degrees.\nYou can also use 'Rain', 'Impact', 'Teleport' and many more amazing runes to create even crazier spells!\nFour spell types, four elements and eighteen runes can be placed on the spellcrafting grid in order to create tons of incredible combinations! Whenever we put the spellcrafting system in front of new players, someone invariably comes up with a new spell we've never seen before!\nSo you're not constrained by what we, the game's creators, put in the game for you to discover. Instead, you are limited only by your own creativity and imagination.\nAt PAX East, PAX West, PAX South, PAX East again, SXSW and the PlayStation Experience, the reaction to our spell system has been incredible! But don't take our word for it, here is what the media had to say:\nLearn more about our unique spellcrafting system!\nWant to learn more about Mages of Mystralia's unique approach to spellcrafting? We've got you covered! The following video combines parts 1-3 of our spellcrafting tutorial, narrated by none other than Dan Adelman himself.\n\nKeep in mind that this video only gives you a (very) small insight of all the possibilities offered! What spells will YOU create?\nMages of Mystralia has responsive action-adventure controls that have been perfected to feel intuitive and fun.\nBut be careful... The world of Mystralia is a dangerous place. Monsters roam freely in the wilds and you never know what enormous creatures lurk in the shadowy corners of the realm... \nThis polished gameplay, combined with the moving soundtrack and beautifully rendered cel shaded graphics really allowed the team to bring this immersive game to a level of quality that they are extremely proud of.\nIn Mages of Mystralia, you play as Zia, a young woman who discovers that she has been born with an innate sense of magic. Unfortunately, arcane powers have been banned from the kingdom, forcing her to go into exile and learn the ways of magic as she looks to gain some control over her powers and stumbles into a story of epic proportions!\nOn her journey, she meets other exiled mages and discovers runes with magical properties, realizing that she can combine these in different ways to come up with millions of new spells!\nWhen Ed Greenwood set to the task of writing the story of Zia\u2019s adventure, he couldn\u2019t help but flesh out the entire world and its lore. The history of the kingdom of Mystralia was an interesting enough story in its own right, so we worked with acclaimed webcomic creators Brian Clevinger and Carey Pietsch to tell that story in comic book form.\nThe more you know your Mystralia history, the better you\u2019ll be able to identify the subtle references to these events of the past and how they\u2019ve come to shape Zia\u2019s present.\nA wide range of different environments are spread out across the vast world of Mystralia, where villagers, merchants and mages live. You will explore the many different areas of the game in order to find epic treasure, solve mind-bending puzzles and experiment with spells in order to become a true mage!\nMages of Mystralia\u2019s original orchestral score was performed by the Video Game Orchestra and orchestrated by Shota Nakama, one of the masterminds behind the scores of Final Fantasy XV and Kingdom Hearts II.5 HD Remaster.\nFurthermore, the music in the game is dynamic, meaning that depending on the setting and the actions a player makes, the music will adapt itself, adding instruments, accelerating or slowing the pace and basically modulating to fit every in-game situation!\n Some of the projects our team members have worked on previously :\nBorealys Games is made up of experienced developers who\u2019ve spent years working in the AAA industry, which really allowed the team to add that extra layer of polish to the gameplay and visual elements of the game.\nThe game is already a lot of fun and the players' response at events has been heartwarming, but we still have some polish (improved animations, particle effects, and enhanced sound effects - among others) that we think will really take the game to the next level. In addition, we also have a few features up our sleeves as stretch goals that we would love to obtain.\nMore importantly, we want to get feedback on the game from our most ardent supporters, who will get the beta immediately after the campaign is processed!\nAlthough the team has had years of experience in the industry, Mages of Mystralia is the studio's first public appearance and we are coming to Kickstarter to find and grow our core player community.\nWe want fans of magical action-adventure games to join us as we look towards the game's official launch in Q2 of 2017!\nRecently there have been several Kickstarter campaigns that have raised an amount of funding to prove that the concept is viable, but then seek publisher or outside investor support for what they really need. We are taking the opposite approach. We built our proof-of-concept, got investment, and made our game. It is fully playable beginning to end, and many would consider it complete.\nBut as we\u2019ve observed our playtesters and gotten feedback, we\u2019ve generated a ton of ideas that would not take too long to implement but have the power to take this game to the next level. Adding all of those little tweaks and extra polish will only add a couple months to our schedule, so for a relatively modest sum, we can have a huge impact.\nOf course, we already have plans for how we\u2019d like to expand the game post launch with new game modes. If we exceed our goal, we\u2019ll be able to staff up more aggressively and deliver those new features sooner than if we had to wait for the game to launch.\n Adding digital copies to your order is simple:\nSelect your preferred pledge tier from the right of the page.\nAt checkout, add 25$CAD ($19 US) for each extra digital copy you would like.\nAt the end of the campaign, you will receive a Backer Form to confirm your add-ons and preferred platform(s) for your digital keys.\nAdding a physical add-ons to your order is simple:\nSelect your desired pledge tier from the right of the campaign page.\nAt checkout, simply add the value of your desired Add-on(s) and the shipping fee that corresponds to your location.\nAt the end of the campaign, you will receive a Backer Form to confirm your add-ons, address and T-Shirt size(s).\nBox Art shown as reference only and subject to change.\nThe Silver Treasure Chest contains:\nOne Mages of Mystralia pin\nOne Mages of Mystralia t-shirt\nOne soft-cover copy of the 64-page Mages of Mystralia comic book by Brian Clevinger and Carey Pietsch\nOne full-color 11x17 Mages of Mystralia poster\nThe Golden Treasure Chest contains:\nOne Mages of Mystralia pin\nOne exclusive Mages of Mystralia dev team t-shirt\nOne soft-cover copy of the 64-page Mages of Mystralia comic book by Brian Clevinger and Carey Pietsch\nOne limited full-color 11x17 Mages of Mystralia poster, signed by Ed Greenwood\nOne double-vinyl version of Mages of Mystralia's original OST, orchestrated by Shota Nakama and performed by the Video Game Orchestra\nFinal Week Standalone Add-ons!\nDue to popular demand, we've also added the following standalone physical add-ons.

We made a short video to express our appreciation and show you some new alpha gameplay. Look for Cattails on Steam in late 2017. You guys rock!!\nPLAY\n\nMissed the Kickstarter but interested in Cattails? Check out our website for more information or keep reading!\nBecome a cat! Hunt, fight, explore, and socialize in an expansive open world. \nCattails is an indie game made by a husband-and-wife team.\nIn Cattails, the player takes the role of a feral cat that roams an expansive open land. The player hunts for food, combats cats from other colonies, and develops valuable relationships. The player can also romance one of many eligible cats and raise a family!\n    Track down creatures for a satisfying snack! Cats of the wild must eat to survive, so be sure to pounce stealthily to catch your prey.\nHunting is a careful balancing act; get close enough to pounce, but not too close or your victim may flee!\n  Cattails uses a unique real-time skill-based hunting system that allows you to stalk your prey anywhere throughout the open world. Find mice, rabbits, frogs, birds, squirrels, and more!\n  Each cat belongs to one of many wild cat colonies. Cats are very territorial creatures! \nThe colonies have territories that they protect and maintain; if you wander too close to the borders or into the unclaimed regions, get ready for a fight! \nGain dynamic territory throughout the world by battling off enemy cats or by invading another colony's land. \nUnlock new and exciting fighting skills to help you survive battles and master the art of feral combat!  \n  Explore the forest to find the best spots to hunt. Gather herbs and berries that can give your cat many different advantages such as healing or speedy paws! Sell them for some extra money or give them away as gifts.\nSwim the mighty rivers to reach new territory. Discover rare prey and bring back exotic gifts to give to your friends!\nSeasons pass and each day is different. Cattails features a dynamic and meaningful weather system, generating everything from light snowfall to blizzards and from sunny days to thunderstorms. Prey, herbs, and other cats react to the shifts in climate and the forecast. \n  Become friends, lovers, or enemies with dozens of unique cats. Befriend or battle the other inhabitants of the forest. \nWork for the glory of one of the great cat colonies or set out to adventure on your own!\nTalk and give gifts to the many cats that inhabit the colonies to unlock unique dialog options and become good friends with them. \nMany of the cats are marriageable, allowing you to start your own cat family!\nSurvive in style with hundreds of fur and eye color combinations.

He has professional experience with web development and has fostered community management skills for many years, but his true passion is game development. He started making video games when he was 10 years old, and hasn't stopped since. Tyler is working full time on Cattails to bring it to life!\nRebekah Thompson - Marketing Coordinator\nRebekah is Tyler's amazing wife and leads all aspects of social media and marketing. She has a strong technical background and uses her skills daily for software development contract work. She provides constant feedback and helps manage the Cattails project. She also acts as the front-end for all professional inquiries.\nThe money raised through Kickstarter for Cattails will go towards making the game as best as it can be. Out of the initial goal, here's the percentage breakdown:\nYour help will allow us to commission the rest of the fantastic soundtrack (see above for a sample,) fund development costs such as product licenses and fees, and finance more incredible artwork for Cattails. \nThanks so much for helping us bring our project to life!\n                                                                                                                                         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFirst and foremost, making a game takes a lot of time. We fully expect to have Cattails ready by the end of 2017, but for a variety of reasons it may take longer to complete if art, music, or programming work meets unexpected challenges.\n\nAdditionally, Cattails is our first commercial release for PC, and our first game that includes paid work from independent contractors. We have full confidence that everyone we are working with is fully capable of getting the work necessary for Cattails done by the end of the year, but again, it is possible that it may take longer depending on a multitude of factors.\n\nDespite these risks, we are certain that we will be able to finish the game and get it out to the backers. Our lead developer, Tyler, has a proven track record of finishing games and iterating upon them for many years after completion to ensure that they're as good as they can be. He left his job as a software engineer to work full time on Cattails and will devote all his effort and energy into completing this ambitious project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "~ Kind-hearted Kitten ~", "descp": "Thank you for supporting Cattails!\nINCLUDES:\nName in credits\n\"Thank You\" email with cute cat gif", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "~ Courageous Cat - STANDARD ~", "descp": "Get a digital copy of Cattails on Steam for all supported platforms when the game launches!

The game will adapt to your play-style, giving you tailored rewards and changing the main plot as you define what kind of a God you are. Benevolent rulers will get better, more specific options to convert civilizations. A crewel God will unlock more sophisticated tools of manipulation. There are 4 different endings to find, each requiring a different style of play!\nUpgrades cost you souls PER SECOND!\nPREMIUM galaxy generation\nEach new game creates a galaxy generated from a seed. thousands of stars with tens of thousands of planets. Each one with ore to mine and air to absorb. Each planet with life has their own unique set of socio-economic problems that grow more complex as they advance through 10 different civilization stages.\n  Thousands of living, evolving civilizations\n  Stars have planets, planets have aliens!\n Deep, reactive, simulated societies \nBehind every civilization is a vast network of variables interacting with one another in real-time. A change in one will set off a butterfly effect that ripples through the entire population. \nBehind every great civilization...\nIt's how all these variables interact with each other that forms a working society, and determines how ready they are to be converted. To convert a planet, you have to choose a Promise, and a Threat. The system then determines if those choices properly reflect their current situation, and if the people like you enough, they'll be converted!\nEvery religion has a Promise and a Threat\nCrafting\nEvery planet can be mined, and every atmosphere can be absorbed. The extracted elements can be crafted into goods and then transported to the surface of a planet to influence the population! Give them gold and stimulate their economy! Give them TNT and encourage their military! With over 75 different substances to create, you'll find endless ways to spread your influence. \nCombine elements and create compounds!\nThe more technologically advanced a civilization is, the harder it becomes to convince them you're a god. Could you imagine if a ball of light came down to earth today, gave us a pile of salt, and then claimed to be an all powerful ruler? Maybe a stone aged civilization would fall for it, but it wouldn't convince a suitably advanced society. \n75+ Compounds to create!\nLasers\nSometimes you need to destroy stuff. Say a planet has too many unemployed people. What are you to do? You could stimulate the economy to create more jobs, or you can simply kill all the homeless with lasers. Problem solved!\nSo many targets to choose from!\n  With dozens of targets to choose from and various levels of intensities, lasering a population is a totally valid way to show em' what kind of god you are. \nSo many targets to choose from!\nHuge amounts of content\nWith Over 30 hours of audio recordings, graphics for 40+ alien species, 40+ planet types, 75+ compounds to create, 25+ elements to extract, and infinite ways to play, Passenger can be replayed over and over again without seeing or hearing the same thing twice. \nAlien Species\n Micro-Managing\nThe game doesn't stop at simply converting planets. Master manipulators will stick around and continue to influence the species. The planets that generate the most souls are ones that have large populations and high death rates. The trick is to help them until they are suitably advanced, without them getting so smart they don't need religion anymore. Luckily, once you convert a civilization you unlock the Core menu, which gives you an at-a-glance overview of all the stats of the planets you've converted. \nView stats about converted planets\n    Why Kickstarter?\nIt has a global reach, and gives an amazing platform for new indie game developers to show what they've got. It's a whole new age where people get to take risks with unconventional genres and play styles, and in many ways I believe kickstarter is to thank for that. It's given funding and legitimacy to strange and amazing ideas.\nWhere will the money go?\nIf funded, the money will go towards paying for more voice actors, paying for a musician, and paying for our living expenses while we drop every other obligation in our lives to finish the game.\nIs this just a concept, or what? Like, how far along is it?\nPassenger is already 50% done.\nIt has already been in production for the past year and a half and almost ready for alpha testing. \nAll that is left is to record more audio, finish drawing the hundreds of images, and inputting the quests and anomalies. The entire universe works and lives and evolves. Everything is balanced and working, so basically we need to populate it with CONTENT. \nHow will this be released?! Will I be able to play it on my Mac?!\nYOU ABSOLUTELY WILL! Passenger will be released on PC, MAC, and LINUX. The only thing holding us back from exporting it to consoles is licenses and money. (Stretch goals)\nMotion graphics for days\n  Our team is made up of some super serious talent.\nJesse Miki - Developer\nNoah Hurley - Creative Director\nSam McLean - Writer\nRobYn Slade - Your ship's voice\nThe dream team\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf one of us dies, that would be a problem. \nAsides from that, we have already agreed we are finishing the game no matter what happens. If we don't get funding, the game will still be made, just in 5 times the time.

Shishimai Rinka was just an average high schooler, until an accident makes her a participant of a ritual known only as Divine Selection. What answers await her...?\nThis is your chance to help fund the development of a new marvelous visual novel by the team who brought you Sound of Drop - fall into poison -.\nNot only is this campaign set to fund the development of this new title, but it\u2019ll also fund voice acting with top caliber voice acting talent ready to bring each character to life.\nShishimai Rinka was a high schooler who ran a small caf\u00e9 named Lion House in place of her grandmother. She lived her life much like any other person her age, but one day, she was caught up in an explosion while returning home on the train alongside her friend, Hitsuji Naomi. In an attempt to save her friend's life, she shields her on instinct the moment the explosion goes off, losing her life in the process. However, before she knew it, she was back at Lion House, happily chatting with her friends as if nothing had happened in the first place.  \n\"Good evening, my lovely little slaves to fate.\"  \n A few days later, she found herself in a strange world. Here she met Parca, an odd girl claiming to be a goddess. It turns out that she had somehow become a participant in Divine Selection, a ritual carried out over twelve weeks by twelve people, which allowed them to compete in order to undo their deaths. Yet, what shocked Rinka most of all, was the presence of her friend Mishima Miharu amongst the twelve.  \nIn order to get through Divine Selection, one must eliminate others by gathering information regarding their name, cause of death and regret in the real world, then \"electing\" them.  \nThis turn of events would lead to her learning about the truth behind her death, as well as her own personal regrets. She would also come to face the reality that Miharu was willing to throw her life away for her sake, as well as the extents to which the other participants would go to for the sake of living through to the end.  \nFar more experiences than she ever could have imagined awaited her now, but where will her resolve lead her once all is said and done...?\nWe at aiueoKompany are currently hard at work on Fatal Twelve, our upcoming game. While our previous game Sound of Drop - fall into poison- received praise for its focus on the fickle and unseemly side of humanity, we plan on having Fatal Twelve show that people can also be resolute and courageous when the time calls for it. \nFurthermore, we chose to challenge ourselves even further through the inclusion of voice acting this time around, in the hopes of delivering further emotional impact.  \nThat being said, in order to accomplish this goal, we've chosen to ask for the backing of our supporters through Kickstarter. We have a number of rewards prepared for those who do help us, including access to the game on Steam, physical copies of the game alongside an artbook, OST, drama CD, and much more.\nOf course, the main reward for everyone though will be the inclusion of the voice acting itself. We've prepared plenty of reward tiers for those who wish to provide their support, so make sure to check them all out before deciding! We have every desire and intention of living up to the expectations of those looking forward to Fatal Twelve.

Additionally, we'd like to launch it on Xbox, PS4, Nintendo Switch and PS Vita - but ports for these consoles will only be possible after achieving labeled stretch goals!\nChris Carter of Destructoid\n                                                                                                                                The team has many ideas on where to expand, but first thing's first. If we achieve our base funding we will begin updating the goals as fast as you can fund them. Further down the line you may see expansions the include: more levels, guest appearances from game industry veterans, console ports, new game modes, and maybe even a collaboration with more friends.\nPrisma follows the adventures of a young explorer named Ray. In the middle of one of her expeditions, she finds herself in a peculiar situation with a mischievous girl named Fractal.\nFractal seeks Ray\u2019s help to find and destroy magical masks that are spread throughout the world of Aura. The masks have a malevolent influence upon powerful creatures across the land, and so the masks must be destroyed to restore order. Since Fractal cannot accomplish this task alone, she lends Ray her dimension shifting powers to help Ray overcome the many obstacles on their journey. \nFractal Swooping In\nAccompanied by Ignus, Fractal\u2019s silent confidante, Ray and Fractal set out on a worldwide adventure to destroy these mysterious masks, and free the ones under their power.\nWe encourage the player to experience Prisma to their liking. The story of Prisma is optional for those who wish to focus on gameplay. Story elements will be shared through cutscenes, environmental storytelling, and through the ability to converse with characters throughout the game.\nDialogue System Example\nFractal gives Ray the ability to switch between four dimensions, three of which harbor unique abilities: the ability to jump higher, the ability to run faster, and the ability to break obstacles. The fourth dimension, \u201cNeutrality,\u201d does not provide any special powers, but is just as important as the other dimensions to master.  \nIn the finished title, each dimension will give Ray a different outfit that compliment her toggled power. Additionally, her personality differs between dimensions slightly when talking to NPC's in the world in her reactions and in what lines the NPC delivers.\nRay's Different Planned Dimension Outfits\nThe player will find that specific objects exist and act differently in one dimension and not the others. It will be necessary to switch between the four dimensions in order to make use of platforms to overcome environmental challenges.\nSwitching Between 2 Dimensions\nIn the example above, Ray is switching between the 'Neutral' dimension and the \u201cGrace\u201d dimension. Two platforms can be seen coming in and out of existence that never exist at the same time. The player must figure out a way to clear the obstacle by switching between the dimensions and determining how to proceed.  \nSwitching into a specific dimension is not only important to reveal certain objects within that dimension, but also to utilize that dimension\u2019s unique ability.  \nIn the \"Grace\" dimension, Ray can jump much higher, allowing her to reach unattainable heights.\nIn \"Will\" she can run faster, allowing her to jump across wider gaps.\nIn \"Strength\" she can punch though blockades, allowing her to open new pathways.\nThese three abilities can also be combined. For example, the ability to run faster carries over into other dimensions. When the player has started to run fast, they can switch into the \u201cGrace\u201d dimension in order to run fast and jump higher. Additionally, the player can switch into the \u201cStrength\u201d dimension while running fast, and punch through obstacles while running. We encourage the player to get creative with how they choose to combine these powers.\nOn her journey, Ray will meet a colorful cast of characters, both friend and foe. Her adversaries will challenge her mastery of the dimensional powers, while her allies will teach her about the vast world of Aura and its many distinct regions.  \nThere are five main regions to overcome, each with a boss eager to challenge Ray\u2019s skill.\nThe inhabitants of Aura are a colorful lot concerned with maintaining their ways of life. With the threat of the mysterious masks, they are willing to do everything in their power to support Ray on her journey.\nThe Boom-Men of the Kasteel Desert\nHowever, not everyone is so happy to lend a helping hand. Some creatures will present themselves as additional obstacles to overcome. Not only does Ray need to worry about navigating the dangerous terrain of Aura while also switching between four dimensions, she must worry about these sometimes aggressive creatures as well.\nOwpeck enemy from the Yokiburu Mountains\nEach region of Aura also contains hidden masks to collect. The discovery of these hidden masks will unlock a secret sixth region, where Ray can experience more unique creatures and challenges.\nYukiburu Mountains\nTuambood Archipelago\nHruan Ruin\nMuch like talking to the characters of Aura, the collection of these hidden masks is optional. Taking on this additional challenge is up to the player.\nPrisma will feature a full soundtrack with original compositions for each region of Aura, including a special theme song for each boss!\nIn addition to all the wonderful music by our composer Alex Liberatore, we have arranged to collaborate with artists established from some of the classics we grew up with. Composers from the Metal Gear Solid series and Final Fantasy have already been arranged as stretch goals to the project. So it is up to you for us to have their hands included on our final game.\nWe are introducing backer achievements to gamify spreading the word to as many eyes as possible.

We want to make stylish and memorable games that respect and challenge players. With your help, we would like to bring this vision to life beginning with Prisma.\nSo far we have all core mechanics and technical challenges programmed, as well a most of the pre-visualization for the rest of the game. While we only have the 1st world of 5 polished, production as a whole stands at around 40% complete with the whole game.\nAllocation of Funds\nAny money gained will be going directly into development cost to bring the rest of the game to completion sometime at the end of this year unless we push past our 40k funding goal. After which we begin adding features and the scope changes (for the better).\nWe are currently aiming for a PC & Mac, but are hoping that we can raise enough money to be able to post to consoles like the Xbox 1, PS4, PSVita, and Switch.\nOur base Kickstarter goal will allow 3 of us to work full time for 8 months on the game. At base funding, We plan to release episodically per world. All episodes will be included for anyone who backed on Kickstarter starting at the $10 tier. If we exceed our goal to our 40k stretch goal, we will instead release Prisma all at once in a single non-episodic release.\nWe are looking to secure money so that the team can work on Prisma full time. Kickstarter would allow us to finish Prisma in a timely fashion and support the livelihood of the team. We also hope to give Prisma the full attention it deserves in terms of polishing art and features. For example, fleshing out a \u201cSpeed Run\u201d mode that allows players to test their skills against a timer for bragging rights among friends or to collect in-game trophies.\nThe Team. Not Pictured: Hank, Kevin, & Khoa.\nWith a collective 14+ games shipped amongst us, Shiny Bolt is a diverse team with backgrounds ranging from mobile, MMO's, AAA development, and film. But the team's focus lies on one thing- making great games that WE like to play. More specifically, we strive to make games that respect and challenge the player while paying ode to many classics from SNES, Gamecube, PS2, and others where our golden era of gaming gripped us. Before we banded together to form a company, we became friends and came up with Prisma in college. Since then, members of the team have been working in the entertainment industry while developing Prisma on the side as a passion project. Many honors later the team has scattered around the world, but our common passion still binds us together. We can not wait to share Prisma with you in the future, as near or far as that may be.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPrisma has been in some form of development for many a year at this point in time. Our biggest challenge since we've began has been purely contributed to growing pains. Since the project's infancy, the team has collectively gained almost 30 years of experience. What we can (and have) created now is so much further beyond what we even thought was acceptable years ago. Our standards are higher now than ever.\n\nWith that polish comes checks and balances that we need to address in management. Our business and production plans are written in their entirety, but the tides of development challenges move back in forth in unpredictable ways. We have a projected launch window and plan to hit it hard, but this is only with the minimum amount of funding.\n\nAny funding further beyond our base goal will be great and truly make Prisma greater than we can dream. Stretch goals do adjust the goal post for our release depending on how much of a full-fledged realization our final goal determines. Ultimately this will lead to a much greater final product.\n\nBeyond the game itself, we are very confident in delivering all of our tier rewards in a timely fashion. We want all of our backers to enjoy and celebrate their love of the game. That said, only a small number of the team will be responsible for delivering and mailing out the rewards. So we are limited in our resources, but fully committed to the backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Creator-tier", "descp": "A DRM-free digital copy of Prisma & The Masquerade Menace is yours to master!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["74 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Classical-tier", "descp": "DRM-free copy of the game, PDF instruction booklet, and a set of Backer-only wallpapers.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Gamma-tier", "descp": "EXCLUSIVE Alternate player skins for Ray available only to Kickstarter Backers.

With this game, we are merging a deep turn-based tactical game with an elaborate RPG experience that takes players on a journey to reclaim a lost kingdom.\nAt it\u2019s core, Forged of Blood is a 3D isometric tactical game that will force players to think critically and creatively both in and out of the tactical combat phase. Positioning, build efficiency, and tactics can mean the difference between victory and defeat in battle, while managing your characters outside of combat poses new and interesting opportunities.\nDeveloping Forged of Blood has, and continues to be a labor of love that turned this passion project into the sort of game we\u2019ve always dreamed about making. From tabletop to the classic RPGs of old, our\u2019s is a project in which we plan on merging the elements of classic RPGS and tactical games into a contemporary take on the genre. \n Game Summary:\nThe vision for Forged of Blood has always been to create a deep tactical experience currently in development for the PC. That means character building customization that will have tactical consequences in as many ways as possible and setting it all against a brand new fantasy backdrop. So far, we\u2019ve created an experience for our game that, while focused on the tactical experience, will develop interesting choices on and off the battlefield.\nA Fantasy World Afire: Our game introduces a morally grey hard fantasy world on the cusp of a predestined upheaval. Forged of Blood will throw you into a beautiful new world filled with both monsters and men across multiple environments in 3D; in a world that has a richly developed history.\nMeaningful Choices Throughout the Game: This is a design philosophy that we\u2019ve truly hammered into every facet of the game. Whether it be the branching narratives, the tactical combat, or the minutia of character building, every choice will have meaningful consequence.\nBuild Your Characters Your Way: With 9 weapons and weapon ability trees, 6 general ability trees, a vast magic crafting system, the characters under your command are yours to build from the ground up to fit any tactical need.\nA True Spellcrafting System: This is the spellcrafting system of our dreams, with a staggering 3822 unique effect combinations and an incalculable number of permutations when you account for effect and global modifiers.\nAll Things (Tactically) Considered: Once on the battlefield, players will have to take into consideration a plethora of tactical factors. Will you have the right composition of characters to take on a particular challenge? Is the high ground worth taking or would the costs be too high? Build efficiency, positioning, and turn order all matter - will you be able to take advantage of it?\nForged of Blood is a decidedly ambitious project for a studio for our size, but we have lived up to our wildest expectations in each build we push out. We\u2019ve committed our own money to not only start the studio, but to finish the game, but we\u2019ve taken the project to Kickstarter to make the game even better with your help.\nIf we\u2019ve piqued your interest so far, keep going and check out the full breakdown of our game below.\n  3D Fantasy World:\nSpecific to our game is a brand new hard fantasy world with rich histories, horrors, and mysteries for you to explore. Central to this world will be the unique creatures and races you will face. Monsters and men come to life in Unreal Engine 4 as Forged of Blood takes you across the beautifully imagined continent of Attiras.\nFace tribal giants, strange creatures, and quell the fires of a world that is slowly tearing itself apart. Forged of Blood will take you from ancient ruins and castles to deserts and snowy mountains, we are excited to take you on an adventure that spans the varied biomes of our world.\nIn the case of some of our larger creatures that cover multiple tiles, each creature will feature a unique set of strengths and weakness. These multi-tiled creature will also involve unique strategies to deal with as attacks on specific tiles (or body parts) will have different outcomes. We won\u2019t go into too much detail here as we really do want players to experience the surprises for themselves, but we\u2019ve really focused our efforts into making each monster tier a unique experience in and of itself.\n  Nine Unique Weapon Trees:\nEach of our nine weapons not only come in different materials, tiers, and special quality modifiers, but also feature their own ability trees - both passive and active. Our focus on player freedom means: no classes, just weapons and their ability trees - and every weapon tree can be leveled up and built to fit the character build you want. With 9 different types of weapons to chose as primary and then 8 weapon options for secondary, the players can effectively make 72 different weapon combinations, not counting the variations that come from dual wielding, shield options, and magic.\nOn the battlefield, the primary and secondary weapon sets can prove vital in taking on a fluid tactical situation, as players can switch from between their equipped weapons to fit their needs.\nMeanwhile, crafted and enchanted armor and weapons can further refine your character builds or open up new possibilities.\nIn addition to the various weapon combinations and weapon ability progressions, weapons can be crafted from 5 different materials, have up to 4 distinct quality modifiers selected from 13 possible quality modifiers, and imbued with 6 distinct possible enchantments from level 1 to 5. To give a sense of the variations possible, each weapon can be created 169,415 distinct ways, allowing for further refinement of your playstyle.\nFor those who want to understand how I got that, you can have between 0 and 4 quality modifiers chosen from 13 different quality modifiers, 5 different materials, and 6 different enchantments as well as unenchanted. So each character will have 1,524,735 primary weapon options to start, but when you consider the variations in primary and secondary weapon choices, you have 2,066,503,840,200 distinct weapon combinations (excluding dual wielding & shields).\nSix General Ability Trees:\nEvery character and build can be further customized through the six General Ability trees designed to allow the players to hone in the build they want to make. Each tree will offer players a range of unique passive abilities that add (or potentially detract from) the efficiency of a character\u2019s build.\n  Comprehensive Magic and Spell-crafting:\nNo fantasy game would be complete without some awesome magic spells to cast - and we may have gone a little overboard. Even as we tried to constrain ourselves to fit within the lore of our world, we knew we wanted to create a spell crafting system that would let players truly craft their own spells.\nIn Forged of Blood, spells are cast by using stones called Magurite. Each can be attuned to one of three elemental energies, known as Primordials. If you like, you can think of Magurite as charged batteries. You cast spells by either drawing energy from the surrounding area into the stone (Drain) or releasing stored energy (expel). Combining these two will gives us the 6 Primordial energies: Thermal Expel, Thermal Drain, Arcane Expel, Arcane Drain, Spirit Expel, and Spirit Drain.\nStill with us? Great! This is where it gets a little more interesting. There are ten unique effects that vary by these 6 primordial energies. Let\u2019s take one effect as an example, Entropy. A Thermal Expel Entropy will be different from Thermal Drain Entropy.\nThat means that we have a total of 60 options for effects (3 Primordials x 2 Charged States x 10 Effects). Players can add up to five Effects for any spell (provided they meet their control requirements) and can then further customize each Effect through eighteen Effect Modifiers that can alter the trajectory, power, or even targeting of the Effect. With the Effects and Effect Modifiers in place, they can then add a further eighteen Global Modifiers that will shape and customize the entire spell.\nNow, we could say something along the lines of there being 216,600 distinct spell effect combinations, (ignoring that the order of the effects often makes spells effects distinct) making 80,243,201,286,758,000 distinct permutations for 5 distinct global and 5 distinct effect modifiers, spread among all active Effects - and remember that you can have more than 5 of each - the reality is that the majority of those would be trivially distinct. As there is no realistic means for us to give a reliable value of the number of meaningfully unique spells, we\u2019ll simply leave it as \u201ca lot.\u201d\n  Meaningful Choices, on and of the Battlefield:\nWe harp on about \u201cmeaningful choices\u201d pretty much throughout this wall of text and it is absolutely something we\u2019ve pinned on the forefront of every decision. While character builds and tactical decisions have been explained above, we have yet to properly show you how this will affect the narrative.\nAs with any good RPG our\u2019s is a story that will be reactive to player input and, to that end, we\u2019ve incorporated narrative choices that will directly affect the tactical battles as well as the overarching story. This means that the order in which you complete objectives in a single quest can determine the number of enemies or allies you will have on a tactical map. While on the larger scale, your decisions in completing a particular quest could potentially open up or close of other quests down the line. This is of course just a small example of the ways in which the game can react to player decisions both on and off the battlefield.\nWhen not in combat, players will see the world through the Strategic Layer - large map on on an ancient table in which objective markers, party pawns, and faction held territories are held. Here they will command up to three parties that will roam the world, take on quests in their efforts to reclaim the kingdom. Each territory will provide the player\u2019s faction with gold and other unique resources that can be used for crafting our array of unique weapons and armor. While we are still a tactically focused game, our strategic layer gives players the bigger picture at stake, and offers them an additional gameplay layer.\nAdditionally, our Castle Layer will provide players with a reprieve from the combat while offering more gameplay mechanics to tinker with. Whether it be crafting weapons and armor, researching the mysteries of our magic system, or even casting judgments on past foes and fallen allies, Genevan Castle will serve as the player\u2019s base of operations. Players will find that choosing the right upgrades that suite their play style will integral to their progress in the game - potentially giving players access to new missions, unique quests, and the ability to recruit more soldiers to their parties.\n  Morality beyond Good and Evil:\nIn keeping with our aim to push a grey world with meaningful choices, we\u2019ve really tried to implement a morality system that goes beyond our anachronistic notions of good and evil. There will not be a single bar with good on one end and evil on the other, light versus dark, or any sort of coy delineations of those concepts (here\u2019s looking at you Paragon vs. Renegade). Instead we\u2019ve created a system in which player actions will be plotted on a Personality Index comprised of Empathy, Hedonism, and Wisdom.\nMost actions taken by the player will have a corresponding movement along the three axes that will effectively move the player\u2019s Personality Plot. This plot will also have an area around it that will be the player\u2019s Personality Distance Threshold, which will affect the relationships with other characters in the game.\nThis system allows us to create actions and events within the story that will not necessarily be either good or bad. We can explore the motivations of each action and have them be perceived on a scale that isn\u2019t binary - and ultimately create an experience that will be new in the RPG genre. Our personality system is ultimately a more realistic expression of perceived personality and morality than what we\u2019ve often seen in previous games in our genre.\n  Forged of Blood is currently being developed of PC, though we will not rule out additional platforms as we progress.\n  For Forged of Blood, we wanted to introduce a Hard Fantasy world that has specific rules and lore elements to adhere to. Heavily inspired by great fantasy stories with detailed and, perhaps more importantly, rational worlds, we set out to build the world of Attiras into a fully fledged world, complete with a rich history and a unique magic system.\nAttiras is a harsh world filled with strange and powerful creatures, that vary in sentience and behavior. The primitive tribal giants called Sataures, the thick skinned and tempermental Gurrahog, and the ore ingesting Sacer are just some of the creatures players will face - each with their own unique combat characteristics and behaviors.\nBeasts aside, perhaps the true monsters in this world are the sentient denizens who call the world of Attiras home. At the onset of the game, Attiras is a world ruled by a hybrid race of humanoids who have supplanted the former dominant race through sheer brutal conquest. The world we\u2019ve imagined for the game is one that doesn\u2019t pull any punches; genocide, murder, and backstabbing are all par for the political course of this world - as in our own.\n  The story of Forged of Blood takes place a few thousand years after the genesis of the current world order and centers on the actions and relationships of two brothers as they work to reclaim the world. Key to our philosophy is that we create situations that should not be judged by our modern sensibilities and morals.\nIn keeping with our tactical focus on the game, we wanted to keep the story centered around combat but driven by actions. Our biggest challenge is keeping the scope and reactivity of our story within manageable bounds so that we can deliver a consistent narrative throughout; so, we\u2019ve really narrowed our focus on the relationship of the two brothers: the heir, and the player character.\nWithout giving too much away, the story will start with great upheaval that forces the brothers to flee and take refuge in old family estate. From here comes the challenge of reclaiming the world for themselves, while dealing with the differences in opinion that they might have.\n    Critical Forge was born from gamers - tabletop, PC, console, mobile, you name it\u2026 we\u2019ve devoted thousands of hours into each platform. The genesis of our studio really started with a few offhand remarks over various meals about a side project Joe wanted to do: making a tactical game using Unreal Engine 4. As the conversations became a little more detailed and more friends became involved, it quickly blossomed into a project that we all wanted to devote more time into.\nWhen we finally decided to put it all on the line and make this game we know that the adventure will not come easily but decided that the risks are well worth it to pursue this dream of making our own game. We got a small space above a dusty warehouse, begged and borrowed furniture, and finally put together a studio to call our own.\nWith so many things at stake, we decided to take a more cautious and pragmatic route with our production: starting very small both in team size and scope to prototype and worldbuild before expanding into full production. We had tested our base mechanics and ideas tirelessly in the early days and by mid-2016 grown to our full team of ten, who have since pushed Forged of Blood to the game you see today.\nKeep in touch, and don't forget to follow us on:\n  So, you\u2019ve gotten a glimpse of what we\u2019ve done and what\u2019s to come - why should you believe that we can do it?\nEach and every one of us here at the Forge are gamers and we\u2019ve all had the pleasure of working together on larger scale project before striking out on our own. We have a combined three decade\u2019s worth of experience in the industry and the team is so committed to bringing this game to life that we have devoted both our time and money to bringing Forged of Blood to the pre-alpha state it is in now (with a vertical slice and large number of assets completed) to showcase the project to the world.\nWe formed the studio in February 2016 to prototype and begin production on Forged of Blood and we\u2019ve already committed almost $400,000 to see the project through completion. That means, we will see this project through to the end and risk it all because we believe in this project - but that\u2019s where you come in.\nWe want to make this game shine:\nWith your help, we can make this game even better than what we\u2019ve envisioned and scrounged for. That means giving us the breathing room to make more maps to do battle on, a more reactive storyline and world for you to explore, and more unique models to really bring to life this world we\u2019ve made for you. Additional funds will also help us expand the limited budget on VO work and music, and allow us to explore even more possibilities to make Forged of Blood a vision of dreams.\nAs of March 2017, we\u2019ve taken the game from a fleeting idea in our heads to a pre-alpha state with our core game loops implemented in the first year. We\u2019ve put our hearts and souls - and our savings - to bring this project to this stage in development and we need your help to push us over the final hump and see us through to 2018 - and hopefully into other platforms with time.\n    We cannot fully express in these pages just how grateful we are for your time in reading through our hopes and dreams for Forged of Blood. Everything we are and everything we\u2019ve developed so far has been at the largess of our friends, families, and fans who have supported us through this process. Getting this chance to share this project with you and the rest of world is something we do not take lightly. So thank you for reading, thank you for your time, and please never hesitate to reach out to us!\n- The Critical Forge Team\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie game development is, without a doubt, a risky endeavor, and we know that there will be plenty of unforeseen challenges ahead of us as we continue to develop our game. We\u2019ve aimed high and we\u2019re shooting for the stars with Forged of Blood, that much is clear, but we believe that we have the talent and passion needed to see this project through. To that end, we have committed to fully fulfilling our budget that will see the game to completion - veritably putting the majority of the risk on us as the developers.\n\nThe biggest risk we face will be in delaying the release date. As often goes in software and game development, it is difficult to predict how everything will go and often times our gantt charts and reality don\u2019t quite match. \n\nOur second biggest risk will be the implementation of features that may be different from what we\u2019ve described; this is due to the iterative design method we have adopted to ensure the best gameplay. That means that while we may have an idea in our heads as to how a particular mechanic should work, the mechanic itself might not work as intended, be less fun than expected, or something better just comes along. When these things happen, we will adjust to make sure that the mechanics work for the betterment of the game. Things will undoubtedly change as we testplay our features rigorously, and when we open up our game to our fans in Beta, their (and your) inputs will be crucial to the final output. \n\nThat said, barring a devastating force of nature, Forged of Blood will indeed see completion.\n\nSo what does this Kickstarter campaign actually do for us? First and foremost, it will give us the breathing room to make the game the way we want it to be. We are near our personal financial limits in making sure we have budgeted for the game fully while providing the team a livable wage. The funds we raise here will allow us to expand our team and outsource work to exceed some of the limitations we\u2019ve placed on ourselves. Whether it be expanding our music and VO work, making more unique assets and features, or making the game\u2019s stories and quests even more reactive than we currently have planned, the funds we raise will allow us to truly enhance the game experience. Furthermore, with all the depth and complexities of our game, time is our biggest enemy that can only be alleviated by a larger budget, which just might relieve some of the immense pressures placed on the team.\n\nAt the end of the day, we have been truly blessed to be able to work on Forged of Blood - this is a dream come true for us as a studio and we are humbled by the process. Ultimately, our commitment is to the game and the gamers out there. With our original financial commitment to the game, we believe we have a game worthy of any Tactical RPG fan, but we know that with your help, we can make this the game that Tactical RPG fans must have.\n\nThank you for your support.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Critical Forge\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nCritical Forge is a young studio with a old soul, looking to make games we grew up playing.

This venture features a balance of immersive story, as well as a mini game to progress both relationships and dialogue. But Love Mythos isn\u2019t just pure titillation (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, amirite?). As the main character, you can help guide your fellow wounded companions through rehabilitation, or let them slip into bitterness and revenge. Your decisions, your words, your actions shape the entire world and who these fey will come to be.\nThis is an indie game created from the love of a very small team. Our goal is to create a dynamic, immersive experience with story that leaves you wanting more, and enough game play to provide an engaging challenge. We hope to bring a new type of sexy to the table, one that\u2019s frank, honest and well-written. A type of sexy where fetishes aren\u2019t shamed or vilified, and there\u2019s a little som\u2019something for everyone. We believe there\u2019s a real demand out there for erotica with substance, which is exactly what Love Mythos will provide.\n  You, an independent selkie just enjoying life in the Ocean, have been captured by the strange creatures called humans. Kept in darkness without your precious skin, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s the end when suddenly a team of rescuers sweep in and take you away.\n They whisk you off to a hidden island; but not just any island. You find yourself at a rehabilitation center for fey who have been hurt by humans. And while you are not grievously wounded, the rescuers couldn\u2019t recover your skin. You are now stranded on land, with no way to ever get home.\n From there you meet the inhabitants of the island, and can choose to interact with them, or not. There is a large degree of freedom in this game for you to shape the world how you want. You can pursue a character\u2019s entire story line, unlock an ending, then go back and play another. Or you can take turns engaging multiple characters, learning about their past and what brought them to Sanctuary Island. The world is your oyster.\n  This game is centered around the story and unlocking multiple endings. What you choose to say, or choose not to say, has more effect than you know. However, the gameplay is just as important. Losing, winning, and getting a high score in the puzzle game can all influence your experience in different ways.\n          \u00b7         Choose how you want your main character to be represented, with Male Pronouns, Female Pronouns, or They/Them!\n\u00b7         8 love interests to choose from, 4 female and 4 male, hailing from all over the world. Craving a beefcake bara daddy? Check. Looking for a total nerd with killer hair? Check. Whatever your flavor, you\u2019ll find something you like here.\n\u00b7         25+ in-game locations that you can explore with the other inhabitants of the island. Swim in the ocean with a mermaid, run through a meadow with a centaur, go to physical therapy with a minotaur. There are even special, hidden locations unlocked through certain endings.\n\u00b7         Interact with mythological creatures from all over the world, ranging from Alkonosts to Manticores!\n\u00b7         19+ unlockable endings, with drastically different outcomes. You can save characters, or send them teetering over the edge.\n\u00b7         Friendship options in case doing the down and dirty isn\u2019t your scene. Aro and Ace are welcome in our party.\n\u00b7         A bubble-shooter game, with consequences to characters and the storylines you\u2019ve unlocked so far.\n\u00b7         A catchy, mood-driven sound track guaranteed to pull you in and immerse you in the world of Love Mythos.\n  Love Mythos came into being approximately two years ago, and has been in serious production for seven months. So far, we have scripting, character designs, backgrounds, the visual novel engine, and the core of the mini-game experience.  \nOur game is Greenlit and will be available on steam when we launch!\n            Love Mythos is a passion project of an incredibly dedicated group of individuals, being produced at our own expense.

After all, anything\u2019s possible with enough pr0n!\n  Additional Splash art for each chapter between main character and love interests!\n  Currently our games NSFW scenes focus more on the Love Interest rather than the plumbing of the player character. However, should this goal be hit, there will be three completely different sex scenes written for each pronoun set in the game.\n  Who needs more porn? YOU DO! Should we reach this stretch goal, we will include additional splash art for the NSFW scenes for every love interest.\n  Want to find out more about your waifu or husbando? Hitting this stretch goal will provide extra chapters for each love interest, involving a flashback from their life before the island.\n  As much fun as it is getting them naked, it\u2019s also fun to dress the love interests up. Should we hit this stretch goal, each character will get custom accessories and looks as prizes for obtaining high scores in the mini game.\n   Although we dearly love our main cast of characters, we realize that just 8 choices may not be enough to scratch everyone\u2019s itch. Should we hit this stretch goal, all backers will be able to vote for a secret, unlockable character to be added to the game. This new character will be fully fledged, with the same amount of chapters as the original cast. The choices are:\n Skol Z\u2019kiy: This slime girl heralds from the very cold wastes of Russia.

We are limiting this to 4 amazing people!\n   Spend a weekend with the Squid Sin Squad at Katsucon 2018! You'll receive a badge and one fully catered dinner at the Gaylord restaurant and an exclusive karaoke party. We are limiting this to 4 amazing people!\n  This level is for someone who\u2019s always wanted to play a game with a certain character, but never got the chance to. This includes all previous rewards plus a Custom Love Interest. You pick the species, the characteristics, the personality, the name, everything! Of course, our writer will work with you to bring your love interest from just an idea a fully realized character that fits into the Love Mythos universe, but the world is your oyster. Heck\u2026 you could even create an oyster. We\u2019re limiting this to two awesome people, as this would bring the game to 12 possible love interests and 27 different endings.\n  This is it, the pinnacle of possible participation. We are only opening this to one backer, and it is for a custom Main Player Character to be added to the game, with full art specific to their physical and personal description. You could literally be in this game. Of course, all previous rewards are also included.\n  Writer and Creator:\nHailing from Hawaii, Alanaleilani is a Hapa Haole that knows a thing or two about living on an island -granted, her neighborhood was lacking in both Minotaurs and Harpies.\nHousing a passion for reading from a young age, that thirst quickly turned to writing. Starting with short stories and quickly progressing to full length novels, she continued to practice her craft until one of her scripts was picked up by a Visual Novel company. After producing three different games with them, she realized she had an idea of her own she wanted to pursue, one that featured people of all races and body types, one with real personalities instead of cardboard cut outs and archetypes. Something that reminded her a bit of home, with a bit more fantasy thrown in there.\nAlanaleilani hopes you enjoy the adventure Love Mythos takes you on, as it\u2019s certainly one from her heart.\n Programmer:\nMuelsby was introduced to programming as a Catholic schoolboy in the 90s, where he made Choose Your Own Adventure games in Basic.  Little did the nuns know that he would grow up to make video games where you can totally get it on with a minotaur. \nWhen Muelsby is not creating bugs out of thin air for Love Mythos: Sanctuary Island like some sort of reverse-exterminator, he works for a tech company in NYC where he helps companies leverage cutting-edge software to make lots of money (that he'll never get a cut of).\nWhen he heard that Alanaleilani was assembling a team to make an adult VN full of heart, with a fresh, inclusive approach to sex and relationships, Muelsby knew that he wanted to write the code to help bring that world to life.  He's grateful and excited to be involved with a project like this, and hopes that the player will have as much fun exploring the story as the Squid Sin Squad had putting it all together.\nMuelsby is having fun making the game right now, but that could definitely change when he has to QA and fix bugs in the final build.  Just wait.\nHis favorite character is Semira, and he dreams that she'll one day roll her eyes at him in disappointment. Until then, he invites everyone else to roll their eyes at him in her stead.\n Character, Background, and UI Artist:\nMeet our Artist, a talent with an eye for backgrounds and mythological creature anatomy! Sandy Hong grew up in Northern Virginia, and quickly fell in love with animation. Whether it was captivating movies on the big screen, or goofy episodes on her television, Sandy ate it up. When told she needed to grow up, she did, and made her way to the Big Apple in 2005 to pursue her dream of studying animation at the School of Visual Arts.  Probably not what the original speaker intended.\nAfter graduating in 2009, (and some solid convincing herself that her degree was not a waste), Sandy ended up at her dream job at Nickelodeon as a background designer. There she excelled and found her true talents in composition, creating breathtaking backdrops, and even won an audience choice award in a Film Race. With plenty of growth under her belt, Sandy left her Nickelodeon family and decided to focus on her passion for video games.  She is now contributing as a freelance game artist assisting various indie game studios.\n Composer:\nAfter recently graduating from UC Davis with a B.S. in Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity, Steven decided to put his true passions to work, and joined the SquidSinSquad to create music for a unique and truly interesting addition to the Visual Novel genre. Steven has interests in most genres of music, and has been influenced by various artists and composers, including:  Nujabes, Shoji Meguro, Takeharu Ishimoto, Yasunori Mitsuda and Nobuo Uematsu.  Steven has incorporated his most keen interests  into the sound and music of LoveMythos in the hopes of giving it a fun and inviting audio aesthetic that compliments the mood and cadence of the story. When he\u2019s not writing \u201cdulcet tones\u201d for games, Steven is often lost in the dense haze of an anime and/or video game bender that can last anywhere from hours to the rest of his adult life. \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all games, there are certain risks. Biting off more than we can chew is certainly one of them, as we are a small team, but we are determined to bring this game to fruition. Delays will be the biggest hurdle we have to face. Each of our team members works full time jobs outside of this game, and life often has unplanned surprises that like to jump out along the way. Ideally, this game will be released the summer of 2018. However, should the highest tiers of stretch goals be reached, that could add additional time and complications to the project.\n\nIn the event of any extensions, we are going to have both the beta, and a free to play demo prologue for our backers to keep everyone involved with the Love Mythos family.\n\nGetting through steam Greenlight could also pose some hurdles. Should we not make it through that process, we will need to research other ways to distribute and publish the game to the public.\n\nShould our kickstarter go unfunded, we will continue to find other ways to procure funds for our game. This might extend the deadline, and remove some features, but we are determined to bring Love Mythos to reality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Squid Sins Squad\n2 created \u00b7 1 backed\nWriter and Creator: Hailing from Hawaii, Alanaleilani is a Hapa Haole that knows a thing or two about living on an island -granted, her...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Happy Supporter Level", "descp": "A \"Thank You\" from the Squid Sins Squad Team on our Kickstarter page as well as a Kickstarter exclusive Wallpaper.\nINCLUDES:\nWallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2017"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "See Your Name in Lights Level", "descp": "The previously mentioned rewards plus the actual game at launch and a \"Thank You\" in the credits!\nINCLUDES:\nWallpaper\nName in Game Credits\nGame at launch", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}], "stat": ["97 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Music to Your Earholes Level", "descp": "Wanna listen to them sweet tunes even when you aren\u2019t flirting with mythological creatures?

Will she do whatever it takes to climb up the economic and political ladder? Can she balance the nature of the brothel's business with a desire to help the men, or will they merely be pawns to continue that climb?

The design pillars are:\nBase & team management\nTurn-by-turn combat\nSanity loss & perma-death \n   Our project is somewhere at the crossroad between XCOM: EU, Eldritch Horror and The Call of Cthulhu. We seek to design a game that has the accessibility of a video game, the tactical challenge of a board game and the flavor of a good old-fashioned tabletop RPG. \nPlanned release : October 2017\nGame mode: single-player offline\nLanguage: English (more languages to be announced)\nSupported platforms: PC, Android, iOS \n     The year is 1929. A dismal Cult is sprawling around the world. Blinded by their folly these madmen seek to awaken one of the Elders - an alien abomination buried deep below the sea.\n   You control a secret society whose sole purpose is to prevent the awakening. Send your Investigators to travel the world, study ancient texts and forbidden relics, find a way to contain this evil. \n   Do not linger, your time is running out!\n    We want to make this game because we believe there is another angle to Lovecraft's works. Indeed, if you take Lovecraft\u2019s books one by one then you might see a series of horror tales. But if you look at them as a whole, the global picture becomes way more epic: you will find yourself contemplating an alternative universe with its own mythos and lore, an encyclopedia of bizarre creatures, a pantheon of alien gods, a fragile mankind perpetually on the brink of destruction\u2026 And that\u2019s the angle we want to capture. A game in which human life is ephemeral, where madness is lurking at every crossroad, where a strange Mythos is developing in the shadows. \n      The game is organized around two game phases\n  You control several Investigators that you can send all across the world to investigate strange cases and establish new contacts in your headquarters.\n   Each Contact gives you access to a specific action. For instance, the Sanatorium will allow you to recover from Insanity, the Underworld will give you access to the black-market shop and the Airfield will give you access to air routes.\n    The essence of each Investigator is its Occupation. As of now, we plan to have 9 Occupations, but make sure to check out our Stretch Goals for more!\n  The Occupation defines the overall balance of your Investigators:\nDreamers are fragile but have a high Sanity. That makes them excellent spell-casters, but vulnerable to mental disorders.\nEnforcers are of strong Health and good Dexterity. They are good at taking and dealing physical damage.\nScholars have average stats except for their outstanding intelligence. Their rationalism protects them from Sanity damage.\n  Every Investigator has a highly functional character sheet, giving you a quick and clear overview of its core stats (Health, Sanity, Dexterity and Intelligence).\nInventory on the left. Character Sheet on the right.\n   Each Investigator has 15 open slots that will be filled progressively with Afflictions, Skills and Spells. These attributes will define your character's personality and create endless gameplay possibilities.\n     The game is built around a turn-by-turn combat system. Every Investigator has a pool of Action Points that can be used to move, attack and interact with the environment.\n   To prevail against the wicked Cult, your investigators will have to use Artefacts and blasphemous Spells at the cost of their Sanity.\n       If your Investigators take too much damage they die permanently. Damage can be dealt both physically and mentally. If either your Health or Sanity reaches zero, your character is gone... forever.\n     Sanity is a crucial resource, that your Investigators spend whenever they face nightmarish creatures, investigate terrifying facts, study abnormal relics and cast blasphemous spells... But manage them wisely, for loosing too much Sanity could result in a mental Disorder.\n   Each Disorder has the ability to trigger disruptive random events. Here are a few examples:\nAn Investigator who suffers from Gambling can potentially be ambushed by Loan Sharks in every city he sets foot in, resulting in a dangerous combat situation. \nAn Alcoholic Investigator can end up in jail if he stays idle for too long which will require you to post bail!\nTreat disorders rapidly to avoid misfortunes.\n         We have plenty of content to add to our game, in case we exceed our initial objective: new Occupations, exclusive Weapons, new Environments... And ultimately, the cross-platform cloud saving.\n   Introducing new Occupations: the Inspector, the Writer, the Architect.\n  Gain access to exclusive WW1 military supplies: the Stick Hand Grenades, the Heavy Machine Gun and many more!\n   Introducing new Occupations: the Boxer, the Priest, the Librarian.\n   Explore a new environment - the Tropical Jungle! It comes along with 10 new turn-by-turn adventures.\n   Introducing new Occupations: the Thug, the Musician, the Archaeologist.\n Enhance your thriving headquarters with additional contacts.\n  Explore the oneiric world of the Dream Lands! This new environment comes along with 10 new maps for turn-by-turn adventures.\n Create a secured cloud account to store your save file so you can share your progress between PC and mobile! This requires a lot of front-end and back-end work. It's a complicated task that comes with high cost, but we would love to make it happen.\n         All backers will appear in our game's Credits. The position of the names will be based on the different pledge tiers.\n   Minimum Requirements: Android 4.0.3, 1GHZ Dual Core, 1GB RAM, 800*480 pixels screen resolution\n   [Edit: we added 2 pledges specifically for iOS versions. Check out this update to know more about them]\nMinimum requirements: Graphics card: DX9 (shader model 3.0) or DX11 with feature level 9.3 capabilities and 128 MB, CPU: 1.2 GHz Dual Core, RAM: 2GB, Storage: 1GB\n           Depending on your pledge tier, the Art Book comes in digital version or printed version (softcover or hardcover).\n               If you took one of our regular pledges and wish to order additional copies of the game, simply add the cost of the following add-ons to your pledge (without changing the pledge tier):\nPC add-on : $15 or \u20ac15 for an additional PC version\nAndroid add-on : $10 or \u20ac10 for an additional Android version\n   If you took the Traveller [iOS] pledge: add $25/\u20ac25 to receive all the extra rewards of The Epicurian, and $49/\u20ac49 for the Archivist.\n   If you took the Committed Writer [iOS] pledge: add $111/\u20ac111 to receive all the extra rewards of The Stylish Muse (and its super cool hand-drawn portrait!), $444/\u20ac444 for The Fearless Explorer, and $777/\u20ac777 for The Generous Patron (and its exclusive signed hardcover Art Book!)\n    Our vision is to make a new kind of game that really fits our modern lifestyles. We love playing good games but we rarely have the time to do so. This has two negative consequences:\nWe unwillingly cut down on good gaming experiences because they are too time consuming. \nWe find ourselves playing more and more mobile games not necessarily because we like them, but simply because they are convenient to use.\nTherefore, we built the DNA of our games around a blend of both platforms:\nFast to load: we want the player to be able to dive into his game as quickly as possible and resume his progression. That\u2019s why we chose 2D graphics over 3D graphics.\nFast to play: we avoid huge chunks of dialogues and replace text with icons whenever we can in order to make our User Interface as intuitive as possible.\nA short but extensible game loop: we are putting together small bits of adventures so you can play the game for several minutes or a couple of hours.\nHighly replayable: instead of a complicated one-time story line that\u2019s hard to keep track with, we want you to experience your own stories by creating a dynamic sandbox. As your characters progress throughout the game, this sandbox will fill with unexpected events.\nFully mobile friendly: most games are either designed for mobile-only or ported to mobile after being successful on another platform. We are designing this game to work on both PC and mobile right from the start \u2013 hence the top view for instance.\nPremium model: no advertising, no in-game purchases, you can play offline and never need to wait for long downloads to finish. \n     Francois has been around video games for over a decade, working in various management positions for Ubisoft, 2K Games and Gameloft. He is the twisted mind behind this project so he is the one to blame! For his defence though, he\u2019s been under the influence of role-playing games and board games ever since he was old enough to read rules and throw dice.\n   David is a veteran coder who served 10 years in the industry working for Ubisoft and Rockstar Games. He contributed to worldwide successes like Grand Theft Auto and Assassin\u2019s Creed. His love for the code can only be matched by his love for outdoor activities\u2026 If he doesn\u2019t answer your mail then he\u2019s probably out there, camping somewhere in the wilderness.\n   Robin is an experienced coder who started on the wrong side of the force, making tools and algorithms for Financial institutions. Thankfully, he turned Jedi 4 years ago when he joined 2K Games to produce the mobile versions of XCOM Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. After that, he started coding his own games among which some interactive adaptations of child books\u2026 Now he is all about making the world a better place!\n   Like most artists Seb has been drawing ever since mother nature gave him two arms and a consciousness. Most of his craft has been channelled towards fantasy books and RPG artworks which is a perfect match for the art direction of our game. In his free time, Seb likes to chain-watch movies and worship the eighties\u2026 One day, he\u2019ll make one of these pixel-based games full of flashy colors and synthesizer sound effects. Check out his work at http://www.sebastienecosse.com/\n   When you look at Ben, you are looking at 16 years of professional experience in the field of graphic design and menu navigation. Websites, flash games, mobile apps\u2026 He\u2019s seen it all! Needless to say that he is the mastermind behind the User Interface of our game. Thankfully his current work is not impeded by his passion for red wine. Check out his work at http://frak.fr/\n   Brice is a our fearless young blood, coming straight out of the game design school. As a student, he contributed to many indie projects and board game designs, and even worked on Fear Effect Sedna during his internship. His obsession for meticulous game mechanics and his fresh ideas are invaluable to keep the project up-to-date with our time. He is not only a fan of game jams but also of musical jams and owns enough instruments to equip a whole band!\n     The whole audio (SFX and musics) will be produced by Red Forge. Check out their work at http://www.redforgemusic.com/ or https://redforge.bandcamp.com/ \n     Rise of the Elders: Cthulhu has been in development for a full year already. Like most indie game projects we got this far by tapping our own personal savings. We are now reaching out to Kickstarter in order to produce the remaining content.\n   Our studio Strange Matter is full of new ideas and original concepts. But in order to continue, we need Rise of the Elders: Cthulhu to be a success. So if you want to inject some new blood into the gaming industry thereby refreshing your gaming experiences, then now is the moment to mobilize! \n   Whether you can afford to pledge or not, we would like to thank you for your interest in our project. We would be even more grateful if you could spread the word to help us reach our funding target. Let them know we're here!\n   Thank you so much.\n  To follow the development of our project, join us on our Facebook page or follow us on Twitter @EldersRise.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have set the funding goal to \u20ac51.000, a value that we have carefully calculated to allow the completion of the project and that ensures our unconditioned dedication to the release and beyond. That said, game development is always full of challenges, sometimes unexpected ones. But looking at the current shape of our project after a full year of development, we are highly confident that we will successfully deliver a good game.\n\nThis confidence also stems from the combined experience that our team members have gathered in the industry over the last decade. We feel enthusiastic as \u201cRise of the Elders: Cthulhu\u201d is our launch pad into independent game development and we feel motivated as it will guarantee the forthcoming of our freshly formed company.\n\nWe\u2019ve set the estimated delivery to September 2017. Although estimations are a difficult topic in the software industries, we\u2019ve done the uttermost to set the right release date for our game. The estimation will slightly vary based on the amount of stretch goals achieved.

The exhilaration and intensity when playing racing games are unparalleled, especially when playing next to your opponents. So we studied our favorite parts from our favorite racing games and boosted it up a notch to give you SmuggleCraft. We want it to be as engaging, beautiful, and aesthetically marvelous as possible. Gameplay reminiscent of the best parts of Wipeout, Crazy Taxi, and Pod Racing while inviting you into a rich action/adventure narrative. Fast and customizable hovercrafts, a new and beautiful world, and an immersive narrative with lasting consequences.\nBranching Narrative - Become the most famous, or infamous, Smuggler in Dirahl. Use your hovercraft to smuggle contraband, evade the authorities, and take offensive measures against other smugglers. Discover new upgrades and build the most powerful hovercraft on the planet. \n\nAccept Smuggling contracts from the many inhabitants of Dirahl - some legal, some not so much. The contracts you accept will effect your reputation. Choosing to follow through with your word or stealing the cargo for yourself will effect your rep as well.\n\nWhich factions will you choose to align with? \n\nA Beautiful, Evolving Environment - The unique world of SmuggleCraft is packed with life and personality. Explore the great terrain of Dirahl and interact with its many inhabitants to improve your reputation as a Smuggler. Every track you traverse is randomly generated, and with over 160 different track pieces, no two races are ever the same. Races become more about skill and adaptation, rather than track memorization. \n\nEasy to Learn, yet Difficult to Master - SmuggleCraft is an homage to old school racing games, merged with modern mechanics and gameplay. SmuggleCraft is a RogueLite, meaning your death will result in starting over at the beginning of the narrative, but your Hovercraft's upgrade and progress will still be there. Master unfamiliar terrain and the maneuvers of a pro Smuggler to prove you are a force to be reckoned with. \n\nSynth Inspired, Original Soundtrack - Happy Badger Studio collaborated with Bravendary to reflect the essence and world of SmuggleCraft in the game's soundtrack. Get a sneak peak of the soundtrack on Bravendary's Soundcloud!\n   Your Hovercraft - A smuggler is nothing without their Hovercraft. Composed of an Engine, Body, Cockpit, Nose, and Stabilizers, your Hovercraft is your tool, weapon, and life. As you progress as a Smuggler, you will discover different parts to upgrade your hovercraft with. With each new part comes new stats, increasing or decreasing your hovercraft's Aerodynamics, Stealth, Thrust, Acceleration, Shields, and Handling. Craft and customize your Hovercraft to suit your smuggler playstyle.\n\nShields - The terrain of Dirahl is unforgiving. All Hovercrafts are equipped with shields to add durability. However, shields deplete if your hovercraft clashes with mines, caltrops, or other hovercrafts when traversing at high speeds. Dirahl and its smugglers can be dangerous, so shields are a must.\n\nBoost Orbs - Unfortunately, hovercrafts consume an immense amount of energy. Drive through Boost Orbs to refuel your hovercraft's engine. Not reaching a boost orb before your fuel reaches zero will leave you stranded in the Dirahl Sideways (roads in which the Smugglers traverse). Trust us, you don\u2019t want that to happen.\n\nDrift Boost - Every Smuggler\u2019s secret weapon. Drift Boosts gives your hovercraft a short thrust, something that takes a bit of practice at the get-go -- this will prove the Smugglers from the Sunday drivers.  \n    Customization is Key\n   NOTE: All tiers above $25 will automatically get BETA ACCESS\n      The game is currently in Early Beta phase. The core mechanics and loops are built and playable, and we have been greenlit on Steam and cleared for a PlayStation Store release. The main story line and its many endings are outlined, but the Final Act has yet to be implemented in game. \nThe larger task ahead is the online multiplayer. We are aiming for 16-player max online race mode, and we aren't moving away from that goal. This includes online hovercraft customization and matchmaking lobbies (both private and public).\n$20,000 Stretch Goal - We will update the game with new single player AND multiplayer game modes FREE after launch!\n\n$27,000 Stretch Goal - We will make the world of SmuggleCraft more alive by adding cutscenes. Happy Badger Studio is a small team, so reaching said stretch goal will let us find outside help to aid us in making SmuggleCraft as amazing as possible.\n\n$30,000 Stretch Goal - Smuggler's Stash DLC will be made available, bringing even more upgrades for your Hovercrafts!\n\n$35,000 Stretch Goal - We will implement the Track Editor. This will allow players to build their own tracks using any of the 160+ pieces in the game, with more to come in future DLC!\nSince we began development for SmuggleCraft, it has swiftly spun into a much larger world and gaming experience that needs the help of the community in order for it to thrive.\nWe aren't searching for a lot, we're searching for enough to get the game to the state we've envisioned since Day One: A unique and exhilarating hovercraft racing experience with an immersive world and captivating narrative.\nTo complete this game by Spring 2017 will take immense time and focus. The initial goal will grant us just that. The higher stretch goals will allow for the fully realized version of SmuggleCraft.\nPaying Outside Help - SmuggleCraft has been a work of love and passion for Happy Badger Studio, but we have reached out to other talented artists to help bring our game to life. Reaching our goals will help compensate the amazing artists who've helped us on this journey.\nCompany and Operations Cost - Happy Badger Studio is a small independent studio located in St. Louis, MO. Our team dedicates themselves to making this game as fun and as clean as possible, and we wish to continue making games long after the release of SmuggleCraft. \nImprovements and Updates - QA testers, community feedback, and allowing the Happy Badger team to make our dreams a reality.\nContinue the conversation and chat with us on:\n  MEDIA AND CONCEPTS\nBring back couch multiplayer!\n  Race against your friends!\n    The caves of Dirahl are wondrous!\n  Dirahl: The beautiful world of SmuggleCraft\n  The unmatched speed and maneuverability of a hovercraft!\n  Sweet tricks!\n(All Media and screenshots were taken in engine)\n    Happy Badger Studio\n Happy Badger Studio is a small team of independent developers proudly located in St. Louis, MO.\nBen Triola - Game Director/Problem Solver\nDana Huth - Studio Manager/Lead Designer\nJoey Paniello - Lead Developer\nTJ Hughes - Lead Technical Artist/Meme lord\nRichard Nava - Community Manager\nPenny - PR", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Kickstarter could fail. We have put too much love, dedication, and hard work into this project to not let it happen. A failed Kickstarter means heavily reduced funds for SmuggleCraft, and Happy Badger Studio may need to go into hibernation. This would result in a SmuggleCraft game that wouldn't meet the full vision we have originally intended, and Happy Badger Studio closing its doors.\n\nGame development is a risky business, even more so as an indie developer. After almost two years of hard work and development, we decided that it is now time to give our passion project its final push. Our aim is to make this the best game possible and your help is needed to help us reach our goal. \n\nThe genre and core loop of the game is racing, which is not the most popular genre of gaming. The top racing games, such as Forza, Need for Speed, or Mario Kart, tend to do below average when compared to the other top titles on the market in terms of sales. Since SmuggleCraft takes the racing genre a step further by giving the world and your races meaning, other than just \"Finish in 1st place\", we hope to change the way players see racing games and revive an underdog genre. \n\nHappy Badger Studio is an Indie Game Studio and sister studio to Rampant Interactive. Our team is composed of dedicated and hard working artists, programmers, and gamers. The founders of Happy Badger Studio also founded Mauhaus, a cat cafe and lounge, located in St. Louis, MO. We are constantly completing client work, managing cat cafe's, and working on smaller personal projects on top of our game development, so reaching our Kickstarter goal will enable us to put forth extreme focus and effort into SmuggleCraft.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "ROOKIE SMUGGLER", "descp": "You'll receive the SmuggleCraft PS4 Theme/Wallpaper Pack (3 Desktop Wallpapers and 3 Mobile Wallpapers) and your name in the credits.\nINCLUDES:\nWallpaper/PS4 Theme Set", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "TRUE SMUGGLER", "descp": "Receive a copy of SmuggleCraft at release (PS4 or Steam).\nINCLUDES:\nGame at release (PS4 or Steam)\nKickstarter Exclusive Hovercraft\nWallpaper/PS4 Theme Set", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["103 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "BETA SMUGGLER", "descp": "You will receive access to the SmuggleCraft Multiplayer Closed BETA.

A unit of magical energy\nBodge: (verb). To hack or kludge\nEric Knight was a child prodigy who was featured on the cover of Invent! Magazine at the age of 13 for his invention of an anti-stain chemical treatment.\nUnfortunately, he hasn\u2019t invented anything since and now, at the age of 23, he has a strong case of imposter syndrome. He feels like a failure.\nFor the past few years he has been given laboratory space in a start-up incubator, but as the game opens, he is holding a letter from IncuLab threatening to pull the plug if he cannot demonstrate within a day that his latest invention works.\nAs he thinks this over, an energetic stranger named Jack bursts into his lab and says, \u201cI\u2019m your wake-up call, dude. You feel like you don't quite fit in, right? Weird things happen when you're around? Traffic lights turn red just as you get to them. Elevator doors don't close when you push the button. Your alarm clock randomly fails in the morning. There's a name for people like that. We're called Bodgers. I'm one, and you might be one too.\u201d\nEric soon learns that Bodgers are a group of people through whom magic flows into the world. Some Bodgers aren\u2019t aware of this ability, and they come to regard themselves as accident-prone, jinxes, or jonahs. But Bodgers who realize their identity can learn to channel this mischievous magic. The aim of a Bodger is to make a small thing go wrong in order to make big things go right.\nIs Eric himself a Bodger? Through the course of the game he tries to find out. But first there is an imminent danger that must be dealt with. Another inventor has created a thaumeter \u2013 a device that measures magical energy. Its unveiling is planned for the end of day, and if that happens then the existence of the Bodgers will be exposed, and mass persecution will follow.\n \nYears ago, I wrote text adventure games for Infocom. And then I wrote text-and-graphic adventures, like TIMEQUEST and Eric The Unready, for Legend Entertainment.\nAnd then, sadly, the genre lost its commercial potential and I had to move on to making different kinds of games for a living. But I was always looking back over my shoulder to the games that used only words to fire players\u2019 imaginations, games where the person playing the game felt an intimate connection to the person who designed it.\nI believe something was lost when our industry moved away from parser-driven games. Players lost the feeling that we could try anything we could think of. Games became more claustrophobic. And we especially lost the feeling that we were playing with the person who wrote the game.\nSo eleven years ago, I decided to return to the genre I love best. The task was daunting \u2013 to design, write, and code a game all by myself. I had to select and learn a development engine. I could only work nights and weekends. I had to battle orcs and balrogs\u2026 no, wait. That was a WoW raid last weekend.\nYears passed, but now the game is coming to life. With it, I hope to restore that intimate connection. I hope that each player feels they are playing with me. That we can have a conversation. That we can have fun together.\nLast May, I held a closed alpha test. Twenty players sent me their transcripts, and by the end of the month I knew for sure that the game will be up to the standards of a classic adventure game. It is a full-size, comedic, puzzle-driven, text adventure of the sort we would have been proud to publish at either Infocom or Legend.\nSo, having self-funded the game for so long, why am I now coming to Kickstarter and asking for your help in getting the game out the door? The answer is time, technical help, ports, and music. At the rate I\u2019ve been going, it will take several more years to complete the game. But with a successful Kickstarter, I can devote more time to the game now and get it out the door within months, rather than years.

Classic Metroidvania elements such as backtracking, secrets and unlocking new abilities that open new regions are at the core of the exploration experience.\nFight.\nConfront hordes of dynamically spawned eldritch monsters. Put your skills and reflexes to the test through furious melee combat and epic boss fights against uniquely designed enemies. All monster spawns are dynamic, constantly keeping you on your toes.\nDie.\nDesigned as a challenging adventure for seasoned gamers, frequent deaths are part of the Sundered experience. But taking our inspiration from our favorite rogue-like games, death in Sundered is only the beginning.\nUpgrade.\nWhen you die, you respawn in the Hub, where you level up and customize your character. Equip and upgrade a host of unique Perks, stats and special Abilities hidden throughout the world.\nAll the skills!\n  We announced the game with our marketing partner, Sony, at the end of September 2016:\nThe trailer received wide-spread praise and showed that there was definite interest for the game!\n  Sundered simply wouldn\u2019t be a Thunder Lotus game if we didn\u2019t have larger-than-life boss fights. There are six massive boss fights in the game, each providing epic confrontations that truly test your mastery of the game.\nWakey, wakey!\n  Sundered\u2019s tag line, \"Resist or Embrace\" is key to the experience. The Metroid-style abilities you find in the Shrines can be corrupted, but at a cost.\nSmash attack > Corrupted smash attack!\nAfter defeating a boss, you receive an Elder Shard. You can choose to bring this special relic to a Skill Shrine on the world to corrupt a specific Ability. A Corrupted Ability is a much more powerful version of the same gameplay mechanic, but it comes at a cost to your humanity.  \nThe tragedy of Eshe's gradual, voluntary corruption is eloquently illustrated in our second trailer, Embrace:\nThere are seven major abilities in the game, each corruptible into a more powerful eldritch version:  \nShield \nDouble Jump \nGun \nDash \nSmash \nHook Shot \nWall Run \nUltimately, corrupting your abilities has important gameplay repercussions and even changes the game's ending, as how corrupted you are defines which boss you'll face.\nSundered tells the story of the mysterious Terror, a cataclysmic event that causes the undoing of society and plunges the world into madness. You play Eshe, a scavenger who becomes trapped in a strange sandstorm which drags her into a mysterious cavern. You have stumbled upon the source of power that led to the world\u2019s destruction centuries ago. \nA derelict shrine hides massive power.\nThe backstory tells the tale of how this strange power attracted the Valkyries, an armed group of scientific revolutionaries, and the Eschaton, mad cultists following the teachings of an obscure god, to this place. As she picks up the pieces, the player uncovers the conflict that sundered the world. \nThe choice is yours...\n  We want the monsters in Sundered to be unpredictable, for you to feel like madness is just around the corner. To achieve this, all the monster spawns are dynamic.\nSlashing through a horde.\nLike in Left 4 Dead, the monsters spawn based on a number of factors (time, difficulty level, current region). This creates hordes of eldritch horrors that lurk within the shadows, waiting for the player to fall into their trap.\nRun, Eshe, Run!\n  When we announced Sundered, many players argued that a Metroidvania could not be procedural. We respectfully disagree. Though the overall structure of the world is set in stone, sub-sections (the green and grey squares on the map below) are procedurally generated every time you die. This allows us to make design choices which are core to a Metroidvania experience, like backtracking and unlocking new abilities that unlock new sub-sections, while keeping the experience fresh.\nThe structure of the world stays the same. Purple, red and blue rooms are always there.\nSub-sections in action:\nThis adds a multiplicative layer of uncertainty, since the layer of randomness of the dungeon gets added over the random monster spawns. The final game will have three unique regions, each with a multitude of monsters, secrets and challenges.\nSundered builds on Jotun's foundation and maximizes our team\u2019s visual talent through our signature hand-drawn art style, creative characters and impressive vistas. \n  A selection of concept sketches\n  As with our previous game, immersion is key to the experience and having an original soundtrack composed by Max LL is essential to the player experience.\nFor sound design, we'll be working with the amazing Pixel Audio team who worked with us on Jotun.\n  Back in 2014, with the generous help of many friends, we put together a Kickstarter campaign with very few resources. And thanks to our amazing backers, we were able to make a great game: Jotun. \nOur award winning hand-drawn Viking game!\nJotun was a critical and commercial success. We are proud to say we released Jotun on time and on budget, while still releasing an award-winning game. We learned so much during the process and are already applying it to Sundered!\n  We\u2019ve come to Kickstarter to put the game in your hands and make it the best it can be. We know how important feedback is and Jotun\u2019s alpha and beta backers transformed the game into something special. We need you to tell us what we can do better. It's about polish, feedback and using Kickstarter funds to make Sundered the best it can be.\nHere is a sampling of things we want to improve with your help:\nOverall balancing and pacing\nSpecial nodes for the Skill Tree\nDifferent ideas for Perks\nWhat exactly defines the core gameplay experience and how we can improve it\nThis also explains why anyone backing at the $15 or higher tier will get an automatic invite to Sundered's Beta. Yes, we want your feedback, but we also need the money for development time to implement that feedback. The July release date reflects this extended timeline.\nWe've been hard at work on Sundered for just over a year. All the money we raise during Kickstarter will be invested in the game's production, which will allow us to extend the game's production until June, for a July release.\nSundered's total development budget is $700,000 CAD, coming from Jotun revenues and a loan from the Canadian Media Fund (the same entity who helped fund Jotun). Sony is acting as our marketing partner (which explains why we are only releasing on PC and PS4 for now), but is not funding the game.\nHere is how we're breaking down the months until release:\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDelays are one of the biggest issues in game development. Bringing so many different aspects together in an innovative product necessarily brings its own set of challenges. With Sundered, the complexity and amount of systems we're bringing together can cause our heads to spin, requiring a ton of balancing and polish. The amount of feedback we get from you guys can also impact our timeline, as we want to make sure that our backers are happy with the game before we ship it to the masses.\n\nThis leads into the other major risk: game quality. Most people making a game are trying their best to make a great game. No one enters this industry while thinking \"Let's make some very average games that not too many people will like\". There is always the risk that the game doesn't turn out as good as you hoped it would. However, we are 100% focused on delivering an amazing gameplay experience, building on what worked and didn't work with Jotun. We also believe that with your help in alpha and beta, we'll be able to mitigate most design/fun issues and polish the game until it is great.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Sundered Advocate", "descp": "The heartfelt gratitude we feel towards our more frugal well-wishers will shine through every lovingly crafted pixel of their exclusive Sundered digital wallpaper!\nINCLUDES:\nOur heartfelt thanks!\nKickstarter-Exclusive Digital Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 20 or more", "title": "Sundered Core", "descp": "A digital copy of Sundered on Steam, PS4, or GOG (Windows, Mac or Linux), plus access to the exclusive beta test version of the game!\nINCLUDES:\nSundered Digital Copy (Steam, PS4 or GOG)\nClosed Beta access\nAll previous rewards", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["2,190 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 30 or more", "title": "Corrupted Core", "descp": "Enjoy Sundered's haunting digital soundtrack!

As the captain of a spacefaring locomotive you'll behold wonders and battle cosmic abominations in the furthest heavens. Stake your claim. Fight to survive. Speak to storms. Murder a sun. Face judgement.\n  Sunless Skies is set in the Fallen London Universe, a deep, dark and marvellous world that we\u2019ve been creating for seven years. In our games, hand-crafted narrative and emergent gameplay create compelling stories for your character.\nWe launched Sunless Sea two years ago, after a successful Kickstarter and fruitful Early Access period. We were overwhelmed by the critical and community reception!\nOur influences include the science fiction of H G Wells and C S Lewis, the planetary romances of Leigh Brackett, Art Nouveau and Planescape: Torment. \nThe rails fall away. The Wilderness is wide before us. \"Where to?\" asks the Navigator.\nSunless Skies tells the story of one possible future of the Fallen London Universe. Ten years have passed since Sunless Sea, and Queen Victoria has led an exodus from London to the heavens. There, a revitalised British Empire - ambitious and authoritarian - begins to expand across the skies.\nTravel between distant ports, unravelling stories, bearing passengers and news, and trading in exotic celestial cargoes.\n  The High Wilderness is space, but not as we know it.     \nThe stars are alive. They are the Judgements: vast intelligences that govern all things. But they are dying. One by one, something is snuffing them out, leaving their thrones empty. An opportunistic Victorian Empire is colonising the domains they leave behind, painting its industrial vision upon the fabric of the heavens.  \nDespite the deaths of stars, the Wilderness is not dark or empty. It is harried by strange winds, coiled with mists, and traversed by improbable beasts.\n  The Reach is, from London's perspective, the frontier: a vast territory of untamed wilderness ripe to explore, to colonise, and to exploit. Here, the Empire is opposed only by the uncompromising environment and a growing movement of independent settlers determined to rule themselves. \nThe Empire's interests are represented by the great trading companies: Murgatroyd's, The Windward Company, Leadbeater & Stainrod. They are well-armed and well-connected. The Independents are a quarrelsome coalition of pioneers. Some believe they need to unify into a new nation to resist London. Others think that's trading one master for another. Can this rag-tag assortment of rebels resist Her Majesty's attentions?  \nYour captain's actions could tip the precarious balance of the region. Will you run guns for the Independents? Or spies for the Empire? Choose wisely \u2013 your decisions will affect the fate of the region; not just for yourself, but for your future captains as well.\n  The heart of London's celestial empire, illuminated by the greatest feat of British engineering to date: a clockwork sun! While the cream of society enjoy tea in their salons and scandal in their newspapers, the wheels of British industry thunder.  \nThe Empress Victoria reigns from her Throne of Hours, exerting authority over time itself. Her favourites are rewarded with freshly-minted months to prolong their lives, while those who displease her are condemned to the Midnight Cells, where every minute lasts a day, and no one leaves until their hair is white and their bones are bent.  \nNew industries flourish. Unseasoned hours are mined in the Reach, then shipped to Albion to be refined on soot-choked workworlds. Casks of stamped and seasoned hours are then delivered to Her Majesty, to be dispensed at her pleasure.  \nThe Windward Company maintains a stranglehold on the trade in hours; but a bold captain could make a tidy living running unlicensed hours to interested parties...\n  Port Prosper is the stronghold of the Windward Company and the terminus of the Isambard Line, London's railroad to the Reach. The Independents call it 'Little London' \u2013 it's a caricature of its mother-city: all twee tea-shops, doilied salons, and gaudy theatres. \nMeanwhile, in its smoky factories, hours mined from the Mother of Mountains are distilled, stamped and shipped to Albion. A daring captain might want to visit to the Chairman of the Thoroughfares Committee, who offers bounties for ridding the skies of \"pirates, smugglers, insurgents and undesirables.\" It is a generous remit.\nIn Sunless Skies, you will leave your mark on the universe, and be marked in return. When you are creating your captain, every decision is a story, and every story has a consequence.\n    Choose your origin: were you a cunning street urchin, a condemned scientist, or a starving poet? The first favours the skill of Veils, used to deceive and evade. The last increases the skill of Hearts, used to convince and endure.  \nYour decision will also affect your Affiliations: the circles you move in. Do you surround yourself with well-bred society? Or do you prefer the company of more honest villains?\nChoose your Ambition and set your own victory condition for the game. Perhaps you want to retire to a life of luxury, or chart the farthest corners of the Wilderness. Perhaps you will not rest until you have won a throne of your own.  \nAs you play the game, your progress through stories will be tracked in your journal, showing at-a-glance the steps you've taken and your next goal.  \nAs your captain increases in power you'll choose new Facets. In addition to affecting your skills, each Facet reveals more about your past. Did you learn the importance of subtlety because of a Feud with your Mentor? Do you still bear the scars of the Battle of the Horizon?  \nSometimes, your accomplishments in the game will unlock new Facets. Perhaps you will become the Hero of New Winchester, or a Bloody-Handed Murderer of Suns.\nThe vessel with which you'll brave the heavens is a (distant, more sophisticated) relative of the steam-powered locomotives that once thundered through the British countryside. Its plating protects you from the killing cold of the High Wilderness. Its engines devour the endless leagues of the sky.\nAccumulate enough money, and you can buy a new vessel, something more attuned to your particular tastes. Something nimble, perhaps, that packs a punch? Or something built for distance, with plenty of cargo space?\nEquip your vessel as you see fit. Would you benefit more from reinforced armour plating, or the additional manpower allowed by external crew pods? (\"Soundproof! Cosy! Detachable!\")\nRecruit a gallery of unpredictable characters to crew your locomotive as First Officer, Chief Engineer, Signaller, or Surgeon. Each brings their own skills and stories to your adventures.\nThe Clay Conductor \n\"Excuse me. I must polish the brasses.\" \nThe clay men provide tireless, unacknowledged labour in countless factories. You saved this one from an eternity on the workworld, and now he seeks the Forge of Souls. \"There is someone who does not exist. Therefore it is necessary to invent them.\" \nThe Incautious Driver \n\"It's tight, but I reckon we can make it.\" \nTheir steering is at best reckless, and at worst deranged. But they're still alive, and luck is a more precious virtue than caution, out here. How did they get the scar? \"In Her Majesty's service\" they say, and then speak no more.\nThe Fatalistic Signalman  \n\"Should've turned left, there.\"\n\nA clerical error consigned him to a distant signal-box on the Trevithick line. Unfortunately, the Trevithick line was never completed, and he spent years alone, drinking pots of Murgatroyd's tea and watching for trains that never came. But when the Wind of Words tore through his boxy home, what it said led him to abandon his duty. Now, he seeks passage to ever-further corners of the sky.\nThe High Wilderness is unconcerned with your tiny life and the lives of your crew. Your every foray into space is as precarious as a Polar expedition. You\u2019ll need to balance your resources carefully and keep an eye on your crew\u2019s Terror to avoid mutiny and death.\nIt is not safe in the skies. A captain will need to defend themselves against pirates, scorn-flukes, the Cyst of Faces, and worse. \nCombat takes place in real time, and requires tactical positioning and planning. Fortunately, you have at your disposal an array of the finest locomotive-mounted weaponry Victorian ingenuity can devise. \nHarry your enemies with a fusillade from the popular Caminus Yards 'Brassraven', or fire a round from the less reliable (but profoundly satisfying) Leadbeater & Stainrod 'Pachyderm'.\nThe pace of combat will remain measured and deliberate. It will be more viable for captains to outmanoeuvre their opponents for tactical advantage than it was in Sunless Sea, and there will be more scope for player skill.\n\nWe want combat to be challenging, but we know that means different things to different players. So we'll provide a range of settings to adjust its frequency and difficulty, meaning that players can customise the experience to be right for them.\n  The Aeginae\nLeviathans that dwell in the belly of the heavens. Usually, they are only glimpsed as sliding shapes \u2013 grand as mountain-ranges \u2013 in the fogs below. It is said that the suns have an ancient pact with them. That they are watchful. That they eat time.\n\n\nThe Scrive-Spinsters\nThey drift like manta rays through the mists. These are the survivors of the Pergamon Manse \u2013 a house of records, destroyed by treachery \u2013 and their gowns are stitched from the pages they managed to salvage. The spinsters can pry locomotives apart with their bronzewood fingers. They harbour a particular hatred for devils.\nThe skies are dangerous. Arriving at the major port in each region will save your game and your progress up to that point. If you set off to explore a new area and die before making port, you\u2019ll be reset to the last major port you visited.\n  Choose to accept your death, and the map ahead will reshuffle for your new captain\u2019s first voyage. Your next captain will continue the legacy, inheriting a portion of their predecessor's wealth and experience.\nBe warned, though \u2013 a captain\u2019s actions are not erased when they die. Unlike in Sunless Sea, not all stories reset for a new captain. Many of the effects you've had on the world are remembered, and the achievements and follies of your earlier captains may haunt those that follow.\n  We are delighted to be partnering with Gametee to create and deliver our physical rewards for Sunless Skies. We have a lot in common as independent British businesses, and we admire not just their design aesthetic, but their whole approach - from their remuneration of artists to their environmental policies. When looking for a partner, we were especially impressed with the quality of their products and the creativity of their designs.\n  Gametee's premium t-shirts are individually silk-screened in Great Britain. Inspired by the world of Sunless Skies, each tee is a limited edition collectible piece of wearable art, available exclusively in this campaign.\n\nPrinted using the finest quality non-toxic water based inks, the design is long lasting and soft to the touch. Included with every t-shirt is a selection of unique printed collectibles.\n\nThese t-shirts are the highest quality, lightweight and tailored in a unisex fit, and available in up to 3XL.\nWe\u2019re delighted to be continuing our tradition of offering backers the naming rights to geographical features. \nCrafted using the finest archival quality cardstock, each magnificent astral map measures 42cm X 59cm (16.5 X 23.4in) making them an exquisite companion piece for navigators. Included alongside the star chart will be a selection of unique collectibles and a hand-numbered certificate of authenticity commemorating your special investment in the campaign.\n  We've completed 25 social goals, unlocking all of the social rewards! Congratulations, everyone! Some rewards will follow during development, the rest are here for posterity.\nHere are three cups of Darkdrop Coffee for your Fallen London character\nWe've released the Sunless Skies avatar generator as a stand-alone toy for you all\nClaim your free Judgemental Hat in Fallen London\nReward for 25 Social Goals: BLEMMIGANS!\nBeloved, beaked, sentient mushrooms with a taste for the written word! You\u2019ll recognise a Blemmigan by its delicate violet colour and desire to see the world - and possibly write poetry about it.\nYour final social reward comprises three Blemmigans, who will become pets or companions in three games:\nThe Blemmigan Gallivanter, a mascot for Sunless Sea\nMy, what a keen little mushroom! Raring to go, and eager to see every soggy corner of the wide, wide zee. But is it too young to be a zailor? Because you're pretty sure it drew that moustache on itself with a pen.\nThe Blemmigan Tourist, a companion for Fallen London\nIts adventuring days are behind it now, but this plucky mushroom can still enjoy a leisurely excursion. One with a sensible itinerary, and plenty of stops for cake.\nThe Blemmigan Voyager, a mascot for Sunless Skies\nThis grizzled Blemmigan has seen all the world can offer. It has been a warrior - a poet - a king. But it finds no pleasure now in war, nor words, nor reign. Only a final voyage remains; beyond the arch of the world, across the windy wastes of heaven. It does not mean to return.\nThis final social reward will be available to all players of Fallen London, Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies, at the earliest after Sunless Skies enters Early Access.\n\"TAKE NO ONE'S WORD FOR IT\"  \nThe once-moribund Royal Society of inventors, explorers, and scientists has received a generous grant from Her Enduring Majesty and a renewed mandate: to unravel the mysteries of the High Wilderness!\nInvigorated, they established their new headquarters deep in the frontier. Were they eager to be at the forefront of new discovery? Or were they keen to be further from the Empire's control?  \nAll five parts of the Royal Society port have been added to Sunless Skies thanks to your support! We've collected information about all five parts on the Failbetter blog.\n  Three new origins to choose for your captain! An origin determines your character's background, affects your initial skills, and unlocks a new Facet to take during character advancement.\nA Zee-captain: Once, you zailed the Unterzee. From Old London to Irem; from Port Carnelian to the Avid Horizon. Why did you abandon the seafaring life? Because of a zee-god's curse? Or the promise of a new horizon?\nA Revolutionary: You fought against oppression and the establishment. Feet on the cobbles. Slogans on the walls. Bricks through the windows. And when that failed, bombs in the night. Liberation!\nAn Auditor of the Ministry: The censors of the Ministry of Public Decency have a duty to protect Londoners from material of a distressing nature. For years you served, but were ejected in a purge. Were your detractors correct to accuse you of 'uncensorious sympathies'? Or were you the victim of Ministry politics?\nThree legendary wrecks for your captain to discover, each a storied locomotive that met a tragic end. Will they contain treasures? Dangers? Or the answers to mysteries?\nThe Wreck of the Berrenger: an experimental vessel designed to protect its crew from sky-madness, the Berrenger  strayed where it should not. Now, it has been converted into a secret lecture-hall, where masked revolutionaries gather, and argue, and plot.\nThe Wreck of the Parzifal: the Parzifal was Her Majesty's pride, the first locomotive constructed at the Avid Horizon. But despite the pomp surrounding her launch, she never returned from her maiden voyage. What grim fate did she meet?\nThe Wreck of the Boatman: London has no room for corpses. The Boatman was a necropolis train carrying (for the standard price of a first- or second-class ticket) the coffined bodies of the dead to a distant cemetery-world. The stories say the dead awoke, commandeered the train, and set course for more pleasant climes. Nonsense, of course.\nBe a smuggler! Trade in an enticing assortment of contraband goods! Demand exorbitant prices! Discreetly elude the ungentle attentions of Her Majesty's Customs Service! Enjoy a life of exciting illegality and occasional bombardment!\nWill you outfit your locomotive with hidden compartments in which you can safely stow a Collection of Ministry-Condemned Literature? Or will you brazenly carry Illicit barrels of Unmarked Hours in your hold, placing your faith in bluffs and bribes?\nPlayers of Sunless Sea may recognise a key figure in the smuggling trade: the Blind Bruiser returns, with his earthy aphorism and propensity to egregious violence. His attempts to go straight have not been entirely successful.\n A beast of brass and steam! A midnight miracle of hydraulics! Furnished in the most indulgent luxury, with carpet so thick you'll lose your toes in it, and mahogany as dark as the inside of a confessional.\nManufactured by refugees from Hell, the Moloch is an experimental engine available only at the Royal Society. Devils are no strangers to locomotive engineering - in Old London, trains departed Moloch Street Station for Hell with absolute punctuality. If a train was delayed, the damned were released, and the devils took their timekeeping seriously.\nThe Moloch is a new locomotive chassis for captains who believe in faring the stars in comfort and class.\nWho's this, freshly arrived at the Avid Horizon? Why it's your Aunt, eager to see all the High Wilderness has to offer! A formidable woman whose only weakness is scones, she will undoubtedly get herself into no end of trouble if you don't keep an eye on her.\nShe served as a nurse during London's campaign against Hell in '68 (\"back when I was just a slip of a gel\"). Her will is iron; her needles are sharp; she is accustomed to running a well-ordered household. Perhaps she'd make a good quartermaster? You'd better like scones, though.\nAn Inconvenient Aunt is a new officer who will occupy your quartermaster slot, and comes with her own questline.\nThe Guests are recent arrivals to the High Wilderness. They keep to the skies, avoiding ports. Some say they are cunning; others that they are shy. Some say they are drawn to mirrors. Probably best to turn yours to the wall, just in case.\nThe Guests crave the particular warmth associated with places that have been lived-in - they like stoves, and keepsakes, and knicknacks. A wriggling colony of them will fill a locomotive like a snail fills its shell. Be careful. That Windward Company trader that refuses to answer your signal might be hosting a writhing community of Guests, growing ever-more frantic for a new home as theirs grows cold.\nThere is at least one more stretch goal after these, too, so let\u2019s keep our upper lips stiff and momentum up!\nThis stretch goal adds an advanced Ambition to Sunless Skies. Ambitions are victory conditions you choose at the start of play. This one unlocks a tale of folly, obsession, and myth, aimed at players who enjoy mystery and ambiguity in their stories.\nIt is only a story told on windy nights, while the coals burn low in the engine and the stars wink upon their mantle:\nA wounded king.\nA wasted land.\nA quest.\nA cup.\nSome say the cup holds life; others say grace; still others, poison.\nA pretty romance! Only a fool would believe it. But fools do, of course. And invent elaborate, chivalrous rules to govern their pursuit of a quest that will lead them into ruin. It is the obsession of lunatics, captains-errant, and dreamers.\nBut what if...\nOver the last few months, we've been developing our vision of Sunless Skies \u2013 drawing concept art, writing the lore, designing and prototyping gameplay. We think it's going to be something special and we're excited (gleeful, even) about making it. Before we enter production, we'd like to take the opportunity to confirm that this is also a game you want us to make, and to begin gathering feedback that will help us make the game better.  \nWe're asking for \u00a3100 000, which is around what we raised for Sunless Sea. The game's actual budget is higher \u2013 \u00a3330 000. If this Kickstarter succeeds, we'll fund the difference ourselves, using the proceeds from Fallen London, Sunless Sea and Sunless Sea: Zubmariner.\n\nAll funds raised via the Kickstarter will go directly on game development, Kickstarter fees and fulfilling the physical rewards. Other costs, like marketing the finished game, will come from our other income.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe now have a lot of experience with the main technologies we'll be using to make Sunless Skies \u2013 Unity and StoryNexus, our in-house storytelling engine. We have a firm foundation in Sunless Sea, and will be able to draw on the lessons we've learned about open development. We've prototyped the riskiest elements of the design to prove feasibility over the last few months and carefully planned out production, so can be fairly confident in our timeline. \n\nThe biggest risk is that we'll decide to expand the scope of the game during early access, or budget more time than currently expected to address feedback or improve features (as we did with combat for Sunless Sea).

Our human connection to these fantastic beasts that have been worshiped and feared is universal.\nQuetzalcoatl\nCome with me as we explore the differences between western and eastern dragons, unearth dragons who ferry souls to the underworld, and look up to creatures of infinite wisdom and benevolence.

Since, the press has expanded into a full-service design, editing, and publishing shop for artists across the United States, collaborating with musicians, painters and tattoo artists, and nonprofit art centers. Authors have embarked on tours behind collections that have been distributed internationally and featured on year-end lists next to New York Times bestsellers.\nPrinter: Bookmobile\nWe have chosen Bookmobile to produce the physical copies of the book. Not only is it local to us in Minnesota, but they just installed a Xerox 1000i color printer specifically geared for art book printing. I also admire their attention to detail: books are never produced sight unseen, and each Bookmobile book run includes exceptional quality control standards, ensuring that each book meets over 60 criteria during the production process. These stringent production standards produce the highest quality books.\nCover Design: Dirty Inks\nI'm happy to announce the cover will be designed by Joe Rheault of www.DirtyInks.blogspot.com!

We're mad about old school games that are a challenge to play. We're passionate about pixel art. We really love Roguelikes and classic RPGs. And we sincerely believe that every good game should be a piece of art, not just business. As a result, we're creating UnDungeon to reflect all of our principles.\nEvery gamer probably has their own perspective on what the ideal game is, but as developers we're in the special position of being able to bring our ideals to life. So, UnDungeon introduces a mix of Action, Roguelike, and old-school RPG styles and wraps them in a gorgeous pixel skin. And now, we\u2019d like to share it with you!\nUnDungeon will be released for PC/Mac/Linux on Steam and GOG (DRM Free). Additionally, we'd like to launch it on PS4, Xbox, Nintendo Switch and PS Vita - but ports for these consoles will be possible only after achieving corresponding stretch goals!\nSince our childhood, we've always been told that the universe is endless; that there are billions of worlds and that it's impossible to reach any of them. They\u2019ve been telling us we are billions of light years away. But what if they haven\u2019t told us the whole truth?\nWhat if we live in a multiverse of parallel worlds which are separated by nothing but a thin membrane. And what if this membrane is not impenetrable?\nThe moment in history, known as The Shift, not only made the Earth absolutely insecure, but destroyed it as a shelter for mankind. The reasons for the cataclysm are still far beyond human understanding, but its consequences have essentially changed scientific dogma related to the structure of the Universe and the position of the human race within it.  \nA small failure in the Multiversal mechanism combined seven parallel worlds together. Inhabitants of these very different civilizations suddenly became neighbors... against their will.\nThe game world is based on the Multiversal principles. This means that all dimensions which exist in the Multiverse are parallel. Therefore, multiple variations of the same place, such as Earth, are possible.\nThe affected worlds are not aliens to one another. They are just different variations of the same planet; variations where something went wrong in the past, causing unusual scenarios to develop.\nWhat if one variation of our Earth was inhabited by aliens long before the appearance of homosapiens? What if, in another dimension, the evolution went a completely different way? And somewhere else again, common physical laws don't work as you'd expect? \nNo matter how dissimilar they are, The Shift brought them all together into a single melting pot.\nRight after The Shift took place, seven Heralds appeared in different parts of the world. Each one is a keeper of the artifact called The Core.\nThe Core does not let its carrier die, instead causing him or her to be reborn again and again - changing the surrounding world each time the Herald resurrects. This artifact is a clue to the nature of the Shift. Each Herald feels a craving for a certain location of the newly-created world, where the power of the Core can be revealed.\nThe Herald moves across a procedurally-generated map which is divided into regions relating to the different worlds. He or she visits various locations communicating, fighting, and trading with other inhabitants.\nThe Herald desperately explores the environment trying to obey the call of the Core. Mistakes are not allowed because the score is ruled by permadeath. \nAlthough the Core will resurrect the Herald, the old world will be lost forever, and you will have to start the exploration of a completely new planet - the equivalent of a new game beginning.\nAll combat takes place in real time. A character uses artifacts and amplifiers that can be combined, enabling the Herald to adapt to all possible threats.\nTraditionally for top-down games, UnDungeon provides fast-paced combat with dodging, reflectors, frequent change of positions, etc. We rely on realistic physics to create more spectacular projectile trajectories, debris scattering, bouncing, grenade throwing, etc. \nEach action performed in a battle, except movements, consumes a certain amount of energy points (EP).\nThe energy is an alternative to the traditional weapon-recharge mechanic, which makes combat more comprehensive and helps avoid mindless ability-spamming.\nAs a player, you act as one of the seven Heralds, each of whom comes from a particular world destroyed by the Shift. The Heralds are not ordinary creatures; they are absolutely unique in comparison with common action\\RPG heroes. So let's get to know them better.\n            It's necessary to mention one important aspect: all characters in UnDungeon are not going to save innocents or fight for love and peace. Some of them are willing to destroy humanity and other competitors in order to gain new territory for their race.\nThat said, you will certainly play as a positive hero as well, but don\u2019t hope for any privileges as with most RPGs. There's no way to solve quests the 'right' way in UnDungeon, because each solution leads to different consequence... and there is always someone who will disagree with your choice.\nExploring the world, the characters will find various supernatural objects and artifacts. There are two types of objects: passive and active. The passive ones alter various characteristics, add small additional properties, and can be stored and used in an unlimited quantity. As for active objects, they provide new features or essentially change the existing ones. \nSince such objects are placed in special slots, it is possible to mix all the available character's abilities, forming a huge variety of combinations.\nEach Herald has a unique pool of objects which is not available to the other characters. Consequently, each one has an exclusive playstyle and development path. What's more, each artifact provides an impact on characters' appearance.\nAnd since the order and number of objects are totally random, each new trial is characterized by a unique character's look. Plus, each equipped artifact provides the influence on the character's appearance (sometimes these changes are vital). See the examples below:\n  UnDungeon is created in the isometric perspective: hand-drawn pixelart is combined with a large number of animation frames and extremely high detail.\nWe also plan to create a set of pixel cutscene movies that would illustrate some key events of the game. 90% of our art is drawn by hand. Seldom, we use 3D-workpieces as a basis of large objects.\nThe graphics were inspired by such projects as Hyper Light Drifter, EITR, Dungeon of the Endless and a mix of different genres - sci-fi, fantasy, steam and cyberpunk. Since we think that pixelart, like any branch of art, should evolve, we use features that are not common to pixel games: glowing, gradients and various colors blending modes, unlimited palette. Plus, glitch art is used to emphasise the Shift.\nAll game graphics and animations are made manually. We have set a goal to make the visual aspect of Undungeon as bright as possible preserving the vibe of hand made pixel art in a top-down perspective.\nMusic and sound design for UnDungeon are created by our good friend and experimental musician stonefromthesky. Both music and sounds are two very important components that affect the gaming experience. The sound designer's goal is to emphasize the game atmosphere. Therefore, music varies from ambient to sludgy electronic depending on a surrounding world and situation. For instance, The Wasteland Law was written for the exploration of a post-nuclear desert world. We are trying to make more studio and live sounds, because we don't want to use common chiptune soundtracks. Below, you can listen to several songs that will become the game soundtrack.\n    Currently, UnDungeon is situated at its pre-alpha stage of development. The working prototype has been already developed. It includes the combat system, map and local level generation, ability combination system, loot, and other aspects. The next one is a quest system.\nAt the same time we work on sound design. A part of OST is finished and the work on sounds is in progress.\nIt is hard to estimate the volume of work on art, texts, and level design - the game requires as much content as possible to become more flexible and saturated. But we are going to finish core of the game by the end of the year.\nDuring the year, we plan to release an exclusive demo for backers - and we're looking into the possibility of creating a public demo after this.\nWe started working on UnDungeon more than a year ago, just as a hobby as a change from the boring office routine. The history and concept elements of the game were combined from lots of various notes, sketches, ideas (that were impossible to release during a full-time at office), and all features that other games lack.\nNone of us believed that the game would become such a big project. We were confident that it was impossible because of our daily jobs. Meanwhile, our idea was getting more concrete and detailed, the first animations appeared, and the first line of code was written.\nLater on, we realized that we loved this game and wanted to finish it at any cost. But to implement all our ideas we needed financing.\nAll that we have so far has been achieved without any financial support. And we don't want to find an investor or become a part of an already existing studio, because it seems vital to make the game as we see it. Therefore, Kickstarter is the only opportunity to get the necessary finances and not to lose the game of our dream. \nScout -  \u20ac10\n *EARLY BIRD* You become a part of the Shift!

Survive against all odds, and shape the fate of this realm!\nSupported Platforms : Windows / Mac / Linux\nDRM : No\nController Support : Yes\nPrimary Languages : English, \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4, \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\nNumber of Players : Single-player\nPlanned Final Release Date : Mid 2018\nDescriptors : roguelike, sandbox, action RPG, simulation, dungeon, romance, multiple endings\n                  Drawn by @hepari00\nOverworld Survival - Turn-based, exploration survival on a large hex grid map without hand-holding.\nReal-time Action - A huge motion palette including melee and ranged attacks, spells, dodging, blocking, deflecting and special moves.\nHuge Arsenal - A minimum of 4 weapons types, different armors, accessories and items that can be upgraded, repaired and enchanted.\nDynamic story - Each move and interaction with factions and characters has a huge impact on your multi-ended journey. Gain respect and affection of NPCs that inhabit the dynamic world.\nWe believe that having a game with good combat mechanics isn't the goal to strive for, but only a starting point. That's why we've decided to go beyond the common action RPG. We've put a heavy emphasis on bringing you a dynamic and autonomous fantasy world.\nYou can deal with this world in many ways: You can take up quests, break sieges and stop raids, work for or against a faction, find and explore deep, devious dungeons, meet interesting NPCs and even engage in romantic relationships. \nLet this world feel your presence, and watch as your actions lead to logical consequences and unexpected twists. \n  The once great Kingdom of Verad lies in total chaos. Verad was invaded and conquered by Irsil 12 years ago, but scattered sections of the Resistance army is still bringing the fight to the Irsilian oppressors.\nBut according to some rumors, the insurgency isn't the only thing to be concerned about. There is talk of undeads creeping across the lands, and monsters from old fairy tales returning to this realm, sending their Wildren minions ahead to spread panic, and even a dark ritual to bring doom upon the world is going on in the heart of Verad...\nAnd as always, not many believe these stories.\nIn this grave age, you assume the role of Kuruna, a young strider who travels far distances on a regular basis to help people in need.\nOne day, you receive reports of suspicious Wildren activities in the province of Hummingwoods, and venture out to investigate the situation. What has started as a simple patrol mission for Kuruna, would soon turn into an epic journey that would decide on the fate of the realm.\nKuruna - your avatar in this epic journey.\n  An Authentic world\nYou will travel through many sectors of different settings and types, Explore vast lands with a day&night cycle and weather conditions (fog, rain, snow...) that can make or break your journey.\nYou can't admire the landscape on an empty stomach.\nResource management\nEvery activity drains your stamina, and each battle will exhaust your fighting capacities. Low stamina exposes you to infections and diseases! Therefore manage your resources well, and plan your journey ahead. Take a rest where you can.\nSet up camp to get some healing.\nBalanced Perma-death\nDeath is irrevocable, but there are reasonable ways to prepare for an unforeseen failure. For example, if you fall in a dungeon, someone who holds you dear might come to your rescue.\nThe simple rule is \"I am hard, but I am fair.\" \nAction cards - Use them wisely!\nDynamic AI\nYou are not the only one to roam the world. Various NPCs and combatants fill the sector, playing by the same rules as you.\nThey will chase, fight or flee from enemies, reinforce friendlies, return to base and refit, besiege settlements and do anything that helps themselves or the faction they belong to.\nThe Pale Horde has an endless supply of recruits...\nDynamic Settlements\nSettlements can accommodate different vendors and buildings, and serve as your main source of quests and supplies. As they are necessary for R&R, you might want to protect them from raids and sieges.\n\"A room for two knights, please\"\n  Dynamic Dungeons\nDelve into forgotten ruins, cursed catacombs, lairs, nests, military outposts and more. Special rooms in dungeons are designed to boost each other, filling different roles.\nExamples:\nGuard Room: The guards stationed here can flip a switch to trigger an alarm. A guard that slips away will also alert the dungeon.\nTrap Room: A room designed to kill intruders more easily. Pitfalls, arrow-shooting slits, giant metal ball of death, and many more.\nGenerator Room: Shutting down the generator can also bring the trap rooms offline, making your life much easier.\nTrap Workshop: But if the workshop is still up and running, other facilities such as the generator room will be repaired again.\nAvoid guards by taking a hidden route.\nvs Dungeon Master -- A smart AI is in charge of each dungeon, and it will try to best you by spending its own resources, powering up traps and sending out underlings. If you don't play well, it can become impossible to beat the dungeon... in which case, you should turn around and flee.\n  Fast and tactical real-time battle -- Dash, dodge, block, reflect and use a myriad of special moves against your opponents equipped with dangerous abilities and a smart AI that's capable of great teamwork. And you are not alone - You can also side with other NPCs or have them join you in your fight.\nCritical hit!\n  Countless enemies and bosses -- This is not an empty promise, but something mandatory due to the number of factions that populate the game. We estimate over a hundred enemies and bosses at the start of Steam Early Access.\nThe Hollow Colossus - a walking disaster.\nHuge Selection of Items -- Item and gold drops are random. Weapons, armors and other items come in various qualities and levels, and can be upgraded, enchanted or cursed. \n  Random Events --  Roll a dice! Traditional Pen and Paper-style encounters \n'Strength' : Intimidate people or be the force of nature itself. \n'Agility' : Sneak past enemies, evade traps and find secrets. \n'Constitution' : Withstand poison and survive the worst wounds.\n'Wisdom' : Resolve conflicts without spilling blood!\nKuruna - your avatar in this epic tale.\n  Multi-Ended Dynamic Story -- Sandbox-style gameplay allows for a multitude of possibilities. Each of your actions will lead to various outcomes, and these will, in turn, cause new events to occur. The multi-structured ending will reflect your journey, instead of just forcing you to our will and disregarding the things you've done.\nI believe that just writing a branching story doesn't make it 'dynamic' or 'emergent'. My only solution to make that happen, was, as you can see, 'simulating a world', however small.\nTalking to Liselotte, a knight gone rogue.\nCharacter Interaction -- You will meet a number of interesting characters in PPB. As part of the dynamic world, they are not mere objects of your will, but autonomous personalities that act in their own interest.\nAn example: In the undead-infested sector, you might come across Liselotte who's trying to evacuate all civilians against all orders. Even if you decide not to assist her or don't meet her at all, she will pursue her own honorable goal.\n Attitude System - the main NPCs will make their own judgement on you, depending on how you approach them and how the game plays out for them and for you; under certain circumstances, you might even be able to win their heart. There's no sex and nudity, but there are a number of sweet bonding moments as logical consequences of prior events - in conjunction with characters of both genders.\n Update : About Dynamic Narrative and Romance Options\nPixel Princess Blitz isn't just some side project for fun; it's my passion and hope.\nFor two decades, I've been honing my craft through sleepless nights and restless days - All I've done, all that I am, builds up to this game. That's why not in my faintest dreams would I let this game fail or be abandoned! And the entire team shares this dedication of mine.\n\nPlease have a look at what we're doing, and how far we've come; and imagine how much we could accomplish with a financial help from backers. Perhaps I'd even be able to get more than 5 hours of sleep a day, live longer and make many more games in the future!  \nHelp!!\nYour pledges will go towards everything that puts us a step closer to the goal. With your help, I can:\ncompensate our team for their ongoing effort \ncommission qualified outside help (This would enable me to spend more time on drawing and writing.) \ncover license fees and business costs \nIt would mean the world to me if you would put your trust in me and back my bold attempt of making something that has never been done before.\n Stretch Goals\n#1. Alternative In-game Retro Soundtrack : We will provide an alternative soundtrack that you can switch to in the option screen. Below you can listen to a demo of the main theme's remix track.\n#2. Settler Campaign : This is an additional game mode, separate from the main campaign. You will settle down in a town of your choice, and help it flourish by erecting and upgrading new buildings  with accumulated resources, increasing the population and training town guards. To keep your town happy and well defended, you would have to venture out into the wilderness to find and destroy mob-spawning dungeons and fulfill quests. There could be a deep dungeon with an ever-increasing difficulty. You would be heading there to obtain unique / rare items to equip yourself with, or treasures to boost your town's wealth. There will be a predefined goal in this mode as well, but you will be able to keep on playing after the ending. \n#3. Multiplayer Co-op Mode (Local or Online): You will delve into a gigantic dungeon that consists of randomized and handcrafted floors alongside a friend, either local or over  This dungeon will have exclusive puzzles, death traps and extra enemies and bosses, and you can only hope to overcome them by looking out for each other. \nI have tried to design the tiers in a way that you can find your sweet spot under 50 USD, as we don't want backers with small budgets feel deprived of rewards that are only given for ridiculously high pledges.\nWe have also removed most physical rewards so we don't get distracted off the actual development. Though high amount of pledges would help us for sure, I believe that finishing this game should be our top priority, and the fulfillment process of physical rewards introduces a new risk that could topple the entire undertaking.\nPPB's estimated price at release is 25 USD, so grab a copy before it's too late!\nRewards Overview.\n  Early Access Key :\nGet a DRM-free copy of the game via Steam when we enter Early Access. You'll be able to play even when we move to full release.\nAt the point of Early Access, the game will be as good as finished. We intend to keep improving this game even after its completion, by adding new contents and fixing issues without getting lazy. I've seen great games that could have used a final sprint being abandoned after release which is always disheartening to watch.\nInvitation to Closed Beta : \nYou will be invited to our beta build approx. 4 months before we hit Early Access, and you will retain your copy of the game through Early Access and the full release.\nThe project plan.\nDigital Official Sountrack : \nThe talented Ethan Jeffrey is writing every piece in the magnificent soundtrack of PPB. The digital OST will come with an exclusive cover art that you can admire on your player. Here is one full sample of the soundtrack, please enjoy! :)\nOST Booklet : \nA digital booklet with exclusive illusts, sketches, a comic in color, plus an insightful developer commentary about the music and sounds of PPB. \nPPB Guidebook : \nThis traveler's guidebook will contain stories, diary entries and interviews written by common people of Verad. It contains a bestiary, information about main factions and characters of PPB, exclusive illusts, comic pages and more.\nDigital Art Book : \nThis gigantic art book will allow you to look behind the curtain, bringing you tons of visual materials, including sketches, concept arts, colored in-game art assets in their original size, pixel-art sprites and more.\n    Your Name in the Game : \nYour name may be on the 'Adventurers of the Month' board, found in the Adventurer's guild house.The player will compete against other adventurers by racking up renown, and you can be one of them.\nYour name may also be on the 'Injured Adventurers' board, where the player can donate a few coins and get a better rep.\nThese are great roleplaying opportunities for the player, and you can be a part of that fun experience.\nBe in the Newspaper : \nThe game will generate newspapers that report about recent events. Think up a fictional story to be featured on its front page.\nIt can be about yourself, or even just a funny story. Imagine other gamers reading about the discovery of a dangerous ruin, and finding the story about your heroic act beside that: \"Steve from Bullworth wins the annual eating contest for the third time in a row.\"\nAlso, you will be credited as 'Guest Creator'.\nDesign an Event : \nWork with us to design an event based on your ideas. It can be for the sector map, for dungeons or settlements. Also, you will be credited as 'Event Designer'.\nDesign a Unique Item :\nEquippable items in PPB, such as weapons, shields, armors etc. are randomly generated, but there are also 'unique items' that look different on the inventory screen and have a few special properties that make them stand out. Work with us to design a unique item with special properties, and a lore the player can read after identifying it. You are also free to include your own name in a lore-friendly way.\nDesign a Quest Line :\nWork with us to design a quest and a string of events tied together with it. Do you want a quest that starts out as a simple fetch mission, but later turns out to be a plot designed to benefit a supervillain? It's your choice.\nYou will be credited as 'Questmaster'.\nDesign a Monster :\nCome up with an idea of a regular monster, first. If we agree that it's viable, you can give us some visual cues to make the monster that looks as you envisioned and acts as you've ordered. If you ever wished the monster of your imagination to enter a real video game, now is the chance!\nYou will also be credited as 'Monster Designer'.\nDesign a Faction :\nBeside the major factions such as the rescue force led by Liselotte of Falkenheim, or the resistance led by Erin 'the Lion', there will be a multitude of minor factions, too. (Imagine the smaller houses in Game of Thrones.) Come up with such a minor faction, and be a big part of the game. We will accept your request to modify your faction even after the game is out.\n\n1. First, decide on which side you want to be on.\nDo you like the mighty Irsilos Army? Resistance forces that fight to restorate the Kingdom? Wildren? Shady cults? Healers? We will introduce you to the world of PPB and show you the wide range of your choices, trying our best not to spoil the game's story! :D\n\n2. Name the faction and its leader, and give it a background story.\nIs it a small section of the Resistance that tries to hurt the Irsilos in any way they can? Is it a band of monsters gathered under the command of a crazy mage?\n\n3. Finally, suggest a behavioral pattern of the said faction. Do they keep to themselves, or do they venture out far and often? Do they raid villages, or ambush soldiers?\n   We need your help, but don't want to take them for granted. You can reach these small milestones pulling it with us together! Share the story and join us on Twitter or Facebook, make fanarts and publish them, send tips to reviewers and journalists to get PPB noticed.\nThe rewards are as following.\n6 gems: 16-bit remix soundtrack is added to the OST, and we will reveal one of the remix tracks right away. (Unlocked)\n12 gems: I will draw a comic booklet which will be added to all pledge tiers. (Unlocked)\n18 gems: I will draw a new big illustration for Pixel Princess Blitz, and make a lengthy drawing tutorial with tips and tricks, easily accessible for you.

Our bodies weren't designed for it. Check your posture right now \u2014 how're your back and your shoulders? If you had to adjust upright, you're on a path whether you know it or not. Slumping turns into aches, which turns into pain...and then chronic pain (seriously: 4 out of every 5 people you know will have back pain in their lives). \nIf you\u2019re slumping, sore, stiff or in pain, BetterBack Therapy can help (scout's honor). \nHighlights\nRetrains your posture in just 15 minutes a day.\nHeals + relieves back pain naturally with heat and cold therapy.\nMake every chair ergonomic. Great for the office, on an airplane, watching TV or even when you meditate.\nYou can put BetterBack Therapy on in 5 seconds flat... for 10/10 comfort :) \nPLAY\n\n We grabbed strangers off the streets of New York, tossed them a BetterBack Therapy and hit record.\nPLAY\n\n          You can also read full + honest reviews of BetterBack right here.  \nBetterBack Therapy is made from ridiculously high quality material that will last you for years, and yet costs less than a single doctor\u2019s visit, massage or chiropractic adjustment.\nBrand new features and materials\nBetterBack Therapy is therapeutic in a few different ways: \n1. Sitting in proper alignment stops slumping stress on your body\n2. Heat therapy accelerates healing bringing rich nutrients to your back, relaxes tight muscles and spasms, and offers natural pain relief\n3. Cold therapy is excellent for acute injuries, inflammation and natural pain relief\n We set out to make the best thermal packs on the planet + deliver the most convenient way to heat or ice on the go.\nAlmost all thermal packs made today use PVC, which is deeply harmful to the people who make the packs + to the planet when you toss them. We worked long and hard to build premium thermal packs that performed better and kept our people and our planet safe.\n...And nurses, physical therapists, yogis and trainers too! Dr. Craig Antell (and his wife and son) wear BetterBack. Hear more...\nPLAY\n\n BetterBack Therapy fits in your bag. Whip it out wherever you sit! \n****BetterBack Plus is also AMAZING for pregnant women!****\n  Hi! I'm Katherine. My journey started in 2012 when I was hit with terrible sciatica pain and was desperate for relief. I began tinkering, prototyping and beta testing what became first gen BetterBack, which I launched last year on Kickstarter. It was an over the moon DREAM COME TRUE!\nBetterBack went on to be featured on Shark Tank and became a #1 Best Seller on Amazon.  \nMost importantly, we received hundreds on hundreds of love notes and 5 star reviews from amazing people just like you, who's lives were changed from wearing BetterBack.\n I even got a marriage proposal :)\n I've spent the past 397 days listening and learning from our backers who generously shared their ideas, feedback, frustrations and hopes with me. I took all of the INCREDIBLE feedback and worked with our super talented industrial designers + doctors, physical therapists, trainers + scores of beta testers + manufacturers to get to this moment right here, where BetterBack Therapy is truly brought to life. \nAndy & Josh, the amazing BetterBack Industrial Design team :-)\nI'm so excited to be back on Kickstarter, giving first access and special discounts to the amazing backers who made BetterBack, because BetterBack Therapy & BetterBack Therapy Plus were truly made by the community, for the community. \nIf you can\u2019t financially support our project, share it on Facebook and we'll send you Posture 5: the very best routine you can do in any chair in just 5 minutes a day to improve your posture and decrease back pain.\nNow we need you.

Check out raw and honest reviews.\nThe keystone to posture is actually your pelvis. BetterBack supports your low back (it feels like the most comfortable hug), but it's most important job is making sure your pelvis is stabilized. On a neutral pelvis, your spine rests in alignment and it stops slumping stress on your body that leads to the vast majority of back pain.\nIt's a posture trainer so you're not stuck using it forever.  Wearing BetterBack for just 15 minutes a day helps you improve your posture when you stand or sit without BetterBack. \n Which new in BetterBack Therapy (compared to BetterBack)?\nNEW \u2014 Heat or ice your back while you wear BetterBack, with a world class therapy pack (great for pain relief and to promote healing for your lower back) \nNEW \u2014 NASA memory foam padding that contours to your back for delicious comfort \nNEW \u2014 Two types of sitting support: BetterBack Therapy for targeted lumbar support and posture training or BetterBack Therapy Plus for broader all day sitting support \nNEW \u2014 Mesh pocket to insert your straps for quicker zipping NEW \u2014 Fits tall and plus size folks with up to a 55\u201d waist \nNEW \u2014 Eased comfort corners for a more comfortable fit\nNEW \u2014 Vegan for the win!

Since you're only charged if our goal is hit, you should sleep easy on this one.\n\nCHALLENGES\nEvery single production run comes with some surprise explosion or headache. Last year, for our first Kickstarter, the manufacturer we were working with literally mutinied in the middle of production and we had to simultaneously try to negotiate with them AND come up with a James Bond plan for getting our materials back if negotiations broke down. Thankfully we worked it out. We thought we would be producing ~500 BetterBacks and ended up making 30,000 gems because of our success on here \u2014 and we still delivered on time. \n\nWe have padded our timeline to account for some unexpected hiccups and feel confident we can problem solve whatever comes our way and still deliver the highest quality product to you.\n\nIf we hit a big speed bump, you'll know about it. \n\nWe believe in under-promising and over-delivering, and we will do everything in our power to do that here.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "YOU'RE SOMETHIN'", "descp": "THE BIGGEST HUG for helping bring this project to life.

It is coming for PC (on Windows, Mac and Linux) as digital download via steam, as we are got greeelit!\n   After the mysterious events of the last month, mankind has practically disappeared from the world. Instead, the mysterious dreamers now populate the desolated cities, where they dwell in the dimness of the urban canyons. A group of four survivors have met up by chance in the aftermath of the calamity, and they have taken refuge on the light-flooded spires of the cities skyscrapers.\nHere, they desperately work on a way out of the city, ever dreading nightfall and what it might bring up from the lower levels of their building.\n\nTake a look at the four survivors, their background and some of their skills and their crafting options:\nPLAY\n\n    PLAY\n\n    PLAY\n\n    PLAY\n\n      Without the comfort of a functioning society, cities start becoming a harsh and hostile environment very quickly. In order to survive and find a way out, the team must search every nook and cranny of the building, and scavenge everything they can get their hands on - including the kitchen sink. Furniture can be disassembled for building material, and each new floor might just contain what they are desperately looking for - but the lower they get, the more danger awaits.\n  From simple clubs over crossbows to improvised firearms and explosives: with the right materials, tools and a good amount of ingeniousness, the survivors can craft an arsenal to be reckoned with.\nAnd it's not just weapons: barricades, workbenches, tools, machinery, medicine, food...\nIn order to survive, they need to make the best of what they have.\n  Before crafting comes research. Many of the more advanced inventions require certain skills. And while there is quite a lot of useful knowledge to acquire, the survivors don't have the time to learn everything. So they have to decide: Medicine or Mechanics? Construction or Chemistry? Electronics or Engineering? With the right combination, they might make it through another night. And if not... well, then they might wanna try somethin else next time.\n  Luckily, the survivors can pool their resources, their skills and their knowledge. If they work together and combine their abilities, they increase their chances of survival tremendously. The question is: Will it be enough?\n      Thank you.\n  Quite intriguing.\n  \u2665 \u266b~\u266b~\u266a \u2665\n  *meow*\n  *drip* *drip* *drip*\n  It works... IT WORKS! Just got no idea what it actually does...\n    Nico has been working as a game designer in the industry for years. When deciding to form Solar Powered Games, it was time to hone those good ol' coding skills a little.\nMarkus can look back on a long and successful history as a entrepreneur. An architect by trade, he is excellently equipped for designing those skyscrapers of Highrisers.\nBesides the core team of Solar Powered Games, a wild bunch of art and audio freelancers regularly works on Highrisers.\nDesiring to bring our vision of Highrisers to life while at the same time keeping the creative freedom in our hands, we seek out to the community for funding and feedback. Solar Powered Games is fueled by the sun, and as long as it shines, Highrisers will one day see the light of the world.\nThis is less esoteric than it may sound at first - Solar Powered Games sells clean electricity generated through photovoltaics as a second source of income, so we would be able to continue development even if the campaign fails.\n\nHowever, without additional funding by the community, we would have to settle for a version with reduced content and minimal scope, which would still take a long period to develop, staying far behind the possible potential of the game. We hope that we were able to show you a glimpse of that potential here and could convince you to support our project!\n\nThe funding we receive (after fees and taxes) will be used 100% for development, mainly payment of our wonderful art, code and audio freelancers.\n If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us:\n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNearly all core mechanics of Highrisers are already implented and tested, so we are pretty sure that there will be no big, nasty surprises waiting for us in the core concepts. \n\nHowever, a huge part of the game content is not yet fully included and balanced. This is prone to performance issues once we implement all the graphical assets. We adress this issue by closely watching the performance at all times and by optimizing the game code from early stages on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Thank you!

We present to you, the Impressions Racing Ed. deck. Enjoy!\nThe MPC Impressions Racing Ed. playing cards\n  Introduction\nImpressions Cardinal Edition Playing Cards is designed and manufactured by MakePlayingCards.com (MPC\u00ae), a renowned custom playing cards printing and manufacturing company. This is our fifth Kickstarter project. Following the monumental success of the Impressions playing cards series as from our previous projects, we are now introducing one of our favorite decks to date, another astounding deck of playing cards which we are very proud to add to the MPC Impressions series, the Cardinal Ed. playing cards.\nThe MPC Impressions Cardinal Ed. playing cards\n   The Cardinal Ed. deck\n  MPC Ace of Spades\n  The MPC Impressions Racing Ed. playing cards\nThe Cardinal Ed. Deck  \nThe Cardinal deck is a continuation of the wildly successful Impressions playing cards series which saw the release of the Stealth Ed deck.\nListening to all the feedback that we got from our previous backers and our customers, we created the cardinal deck where we use a very bold blood red and white to create the card face artwork applied onto the cards with a black background.\nCardinal Ed. Hearts Card\n\nCardinal Ed. Spade Card\n   King of Hearts\nThe combination of these colors used with our MPC Impressions high gloss embossed technology is truly astounding and mind-blowing but aside from the cards being admired, an newly added dimension to experience the touch and feel of the artwork, more importantly, the Cardinal Ed. deck can be played and handled like a normal deck of cards. \nTechnology\nThe Cardinal Ed. deck is made using a smart arrangement of state of the art printing and production machinery which together, can produce amazing results. We use premium playing cards material, 310gsm German linen air card stock which we then apply selective UV with pinpoint accuracy, to certain areas of the playing cards to produce a sleek raised gloss embossed effect called virko.  \n310gsm German linen air card stock\n      The MPC Impressions Racing Ed. playing cards\nThis high gloss is very different from traditional spot UV as this revolutionary technology can achieve up to 250 microns (braille effect) in polymer height which is 100 times higher than selective varnish. We can also control the density of polymer applied ranging from 1-100%. The gloss applied is rated at 99 Gloss Units which is the highest there is for printed materials, meaning that the artwork really stands out and looks very impressive.  \nWe also apply this glossed raised embossing onto the tuck boxes too to complete the deck.  \nHig Gloss Embossed Tuck Box\n  Racing Ed. tuck box\nFurther to our previous Impressions decks, we have been actively developing and made even more improvements in the printing and manufacturing process to provide even sharper colors and smoother handling for playability.  \nDesign\nThe design on the card faces are unique to the MPC brand. Our signature back consists of a symmetrical illustration of a fully grown tree as the focal point since playing cards are essentially paper which originates from trees, hence the inspiration for the design.  \n  Tree back\n   Cards front\n  Racing Ed. front and back\nThe finishing touch of the high gloss embossing that is applied on the graphics of card fronts creates a very stand out design. We at MPC, introduced this new technology to the gaming world in 2014 and we have since seen massive growth on the use of this method on many game designs.  \nKing of Diamonds\nThe Cardinal deck takes on bold colors, a cardinal red and white on black card. Great for collectors, enthusiasts, cardists and more importantly, can become your everyday deck of cards for games, entertainment and performances. \nHalf/Full Brick\nThe MPC Double Deck Set \nWith this project, we are also releasing a double deck box for encasing 2 decks. We use a special material to project a luxurious feeling upon touch.\nDouble Cardinal Ed. deck set\n   Black tray inside\n   Uncut sheet\n  Uncut sheet\nPlayability   \nAdding the special raised embossed gloss effect to the cards will essentially increase the height of the deck ever so slightly and will in theory disrupt the smoothness of the cards which is needed for cardistry such as shuffling and fanning. But through continuous improvements, changes and new developments, we are able to achieve a very high degree of playability that has to be handled to be admired. The Impressions cards can be completely bended as normal and are absolutely playable as well as can offer an exceptional handling experience for those of us who need it such as magicians and cardistry enthusiasts.\nCards table spread\n  Racing Ed. table spread\nStretch Goal \n$10,000: Impressions Racing Ed. deck released.\n  Pledges Breakdown\nPledges breakdown\nAdd-ons \nAdd-ons\n\n  About Us\nWe are MakePlayingCards.com, a professional custom playing cards printing service, owned and run by QP Group, a major high street board games printing and production company since 1982.

They all feature exciting plots, dangerous monsters, unexpected twists and \u2013 above all else \u2013 fierce heroes.\nThese heroes all happen to identify within the LGBTQIA spectrum, but that is not the main focus of their stories. It's simply part of their lives and personalities \u2013 just like it is in real life.\nWhy is this book important? \nIt is hard to grow up with questions about your identity and part of the challenge is struggling to find heroes that are \"just like you\". \nWe believe that all children, teenagers and young adults deserve to find characters they can identify with. This is our first anthology, and presents LGBTQIA-identifying characters.\nBut I'm not a young LGBTQIA person, nor do I know anyone who is\u2026?\nThen help us spread the book to those who need it! \nBesides, reading about characters that are different from ourselves helps us develop empathy and understanding. We hope to spread this book to as many schools, libraries and organisations as possible \u2013 not only for those who identify as LGBTQIA themselves, but also for those who are their allies, partners, friends and family. \nWho are the authors?\nWe are lucky enough to present you with stories by: Claudie Arseneault, Kayla Bashe, Natalie Cannon, Tyler Gates, Kelly Matsuura, Tash McAdam, Kirstie Olley, Lewis Rees, Helle Reiersen, Abigail Rosenhart, B R Sanders, E H Timms. Some of them are seasoned veterans, while others are making their debuts in this anthology. We are excited to share them all with you!\nThroughout the campaign, you will find author interviews, tidbits and teasers on our website www.inkandlocket.com   \nWho are we?\nInk & Locket Press is a small publishing house, running mostly on volunteerism, idealism, love and caffeine. We do not work for profit: all our funds are circled back into the distribution of our books and the funding of new projects.\nHow will you spend the money raised here?\nMost of your money will go towards the printing and shipping of books and rewards, paying the authors for their stories, and compensating the editor and artists for (some of) their time. We also pay our volunteers in copies of our books.\nWhatever is left will be used to donate more books and fund the beginnings of new, exciting heroes. \nAre there any stretch goals?\nYes!

Should the campaign go exceedingly well, we may not be able to fulfill all the backer rewards in January. We will do our ding dong darnedest, but we're only human \u2013 and all volunteers. \n\n3. Should the campaign be fulfilled exclusively by 'Saint Warrior the Generous' perks, we will not be able to pay our authors! Our editor and artists are willing to forfeit their payment in such an eventuality, but we would have to cut 10 books off each bundle to be able to pay our authors the minimum agreed fee. In other words: if no other perks are sold than the 'Saint Warrior the Generous' perk, this bundle includes 90 books, not 100. \n\n4.

His injuries are serious and there is virtually no hope of him waking up. \nHis dog sleeps by his side, dreaming of strange and mysterious lands filled with canine wonders. It is Balthazar - Dustin's best friend and there is no way in the world he will move even an inch away from his owner. \nIn his dream Balthazar senses a presence of two entities. Recognizing one as Dustin he uses his nose to follow him, while the other presence lurks menacingly in the darkness. Balthazar is sure that it is here to take the boy away.\nWith a loud bark Balthazar embarks on a quest to save his owner, venturing through the dreamscape with love and determination only a dog can possess.\n  Balthazar's Dream is a platformer game in which you control a dog. In order to save your pal you will have to platform your way through several dreamlike levels packed with puzzles and perils.\nThe House - first level of our game\nBeing a dog has consequences. Your attention span is limited and represented by a 'smarts bar' in the game. Various objects (squirrels, toys, baths) exhaust your focus. If you run out of smarts you'll lose control.\nSmarts bar - our unique dog themed gameplay mechanic\nVacuum cleaners will make you run away in panic. Toy balls will make you chase them frantically. In order to proceed further into the dream, you will have to use your dog psyche to your advantage. For example you can jump further when you get scared or run faster while chasing a squirrel. \nFear fueled jump!\nThere are many ways to die in our game. The Dream is filled with objects lethal to dogs - grapes, chocolate... even Canadian legislation! \nSo many ways to die!\nWe plan the levels of our game to be diverse. As you progress you will be constantly introduced to new gameplay mechanics, dog themed tools and hazards. We've even envisioned an entire level in which you fly on a frisbee!\nFrisbee fun!\nEnemies will try to hinder your progress and jumping on their head will only make them more angry! Fortunately Balthazar is smart enough to use tools. Roll a rubber ball into a cat's face! Put a stick between the mailman's bike spokes. Knock out raccoons with a dog disc!\nUse the ball to eliminate enemies!\nBalthazar's Dream will also be filled with classic platformer elements such as bouncy objects, moving/falling platforms and climbable ropes.\nClassic platformer fun!\nWe love boss fights. There will be several in our game and we promise that they will be as fun as they will be challenging. You'll have an opportunity to dodge the Fat Cat's butt, engage in a highway chase with the Mailman and finally to defeat the Evil Presence with your love. \nCathulhu\n  4 levels with different gameplay mechanics\ncute pixel art cutscenes\n8 track soundtrack\n3 bosses\n10 distinct enemies\ntons of beautiful pixel art objects\na variety of dog tools (frisbee, stick, ball, squaky bone)\n3 hours of gameplay\n2 difficulty levels\ndialogue driven narrative\nchallenging puzzles\nStretch goals!\nActive - Space level! A tribute to Lajka!\nA short mini-level taking Balthazar into space. Combine dog psyche and microgravity to beat it! \nP.S Someone threw that frisbee too far!\nUnlocked - Playable Shiba Inu\nWe've reached #3 goal! Now you'll be able to meme away as a Doge in Balthazar's Dream.\nMuch fun!\n Unlocked - Dustin as a companion\nWe feel that Dustin could have a more active role in the first level and if we reach $3750 we'll make him float around our hero and interact with the environment more!\nUnlocked - Playable Pug: if we raise more than $3k we'll be adding new features to the game. First one : new playable dog! \nYou will be able to choose the dog breed at the beginning of the game so you can immerse yourself in our story even more. Every new dog will have unique animations and gameplay mechanics. \nFirst on the list: pug, chosen in our twitter poll. You can tell us which breed should be next here. \nWe are fortunate enough to work with Taylor Ambrosio Wood, an amazingly talented and versatile composer. If we succeed and raise enough funds for our game, you will be able to enjoy an eight track soundtrack. \nStay a while and listen:  \n      Sawa Bialczynska is in charge in our (one person strong) art department. She has invented a new style she dubbed pigcel art (while working on Pigsodus) and is constantly learning new ways to deliver beautiful, cute graphics. \n    Our game studio is tiny. Just three people and a dog. For now. It is our dream to become Studio Ghibli of video games and Balthazar's Dream is the first step. \n         Connect with us:  \n       Send an email to peter(at)psilocybegames.com to join.                      \n Why Kickstarter?\nIt is our dream to make games.

Wohoo!\nThe team sat down to brainstorm stretch goals that would both encourage continuing pledges but also make a significant impact on the visually impaired community. \nAnd with that, we give you two of our new stretch goals:\n- Stretch Goal 1 - $12,000 - 100 copies of Audio Game Hub will be sent for free to foundations around the world! As a pledger, you will have a say in which foundations will receive our games.\n- Stretch Goal 2 - $18,000 -  The team will create 1 extra game out of the list of 12 possible games. This way, instead of voting for 5 games, you will be voting for your top 6 favorite games for us to create!\nWHY?\n Good question!\n\u201cNobody makes games for us.\u201d were the words that launched this collaborative project, aimed at bringing the fun of video games to the nearly 300 million visually impaired around the world, as well as the many more who want to play by sound rather than sight.\nPut simply, most of the games made for the visually impaired currently in the market are much more simple than traditional video games and unfortunately, many audio games are not as developed in terms of depth, diversity, multiplayer functionality or good replay-ability.\nClearly, there is a need and a responsibility to provide the visually impaired with richer gameplay than what is currently available. And this is where we come in to continue this good deed and expand on our original project.\nHere at Audio Game Hub, we believe games should be for everyone! We specialise in using sounds and music to create a world for our players to immerse in without any limitations.\nWHERE WE HAVE BEEN\nThe original Audio Game Hub was released in April 2016, and it is an application that contains eight audio mini-games, designed for both non-sighted and sighted users. Multiple genres of casual video games were adapted into accessible audio equivalents, each designed with unique interaction patterns and gameplay mechanics. \nClick below to preview gameplay from the already created games:\nSince our original launch, the application has gathered over 30,000 downloads, excellent reviews, ratings and feedbacks and have even received awards from the Play by Play Festival and Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB).\nWHERE WE ARE GOING\nWe have gotten over a hundred requests to make more games and many of you suggested that we should go for a Kickstarter campaign and so, we are doing just that. \nWe want to add another 5 brand new games to our hub on all 3 platforms: PC, Android and iOS. \nWe have loads of ideas to narrow down from but why let us decide when we have awesome people like you who can have a say in it all? \nBy pledging at any level, you will have the ability to vote for your 5 favorite games out of the ones listed below:\nFrogger - Left? Clear. Right? Clear. Cross! Listen for oncoming vehicles, dodge traffic, and mind any obstacles in your way.\nCricket - There is no longer a need to wait for a sunny day to play a good game of cricket! Put yourself in the shoes of a proffesional cricket player and test your reactions and reflexes by batting using your device just as you would if you were on the field!\nBoxing (Punch-out) - Get ready to take on the world! Fight it out with boxing champions from across the globe, here to challenge you for your title!\nBowling - Ten pins, one ball. A classic game of knocking things over.\nRunner - Through rain and snow, run for as long as you can! Duck under or jump over obstacles as you make your way through the course!\nMinesweeper - Clear and mark each section of a grid, until you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve taken care of all the mines\u2026 or have you?\nRoad Race - Put pedal to the metal as you race from coast to coast, making sure to pick up fuel and smooth over any mangled metal along the way. A racing game based on arcade classics.\nPoker - Texas / Poker - Classic - Just like in the casinos! Play either classic or Texas Hold\u2019em poker in single-player against multiple AI personalities. \nBlackjack - 21 - The most widely played casino game in the world, blackjack is a race to reach 21, but don\u2019t go over! \nEggs - So many chickens, so many eggs and only one basket. How many eggs will you let break? A remake of the classic portable 1986 'Nu Pogodi' arcade game.\nRoulette - Place your bets and spin to win! A longtime classic from casinos all over the world. \nCraps (Roll the Dice) - Kiss your dice for luck, then shoot some craps to see what you win! \nSimon + Super Simon - A game in the style of Simon, where you have to remember an ever-growing sequence of commands. Too easy? Switch to Super-Sequence in which you have to juggle multiple sequences to advance through the levels!\nWHISPERING TUNNELS\nA Diablo like audio role playing game speacially tailored for the visually impaired! Packed with interactive non-linear plot, character development, NPCs, quests and complex dialogues, create your own story as you escape from the whispering tunnels and the devious traps, monstrous creatures and puzzles that it may hold. Find a variety of weapons, tools or magical items to use at your disposal, and picklock a door or simply attempt to break through it with your own strength; the choice is yours.\nYou wake up.\nIt is pitch black and nothing can be heard but the echo of gentle drops and what seems to be a whisper\u2026\nIs it calling your name?\nYour lips are cracked and broken and your mouth dry as a desert.\nHow long have you been asleep for?\nYou feel the coarse ground beneath you as you attempt to stand on your feet and almost collapse from weakness.\nYou need to get out of here. Now.\nDuring the development of Whispering Tunnels, the team has expanded the scope of the game to a size much much bigger than we had originally planned. So much even that we have decided to release it as a stand alone app!\nWith all the new functionality, story and mechanics we have added, Whispering Tunnels could easily become one of the best Action, Hack and Slash, role playing games available for the visually impaired! Just think about the first time you played Diablo or a similar dungeon crawler game. We are bringing this level of quality to provide the best possible experience for our players.\nThe team has been busy working on the engine of Whispering Tunnels and are around 70% through in a lot of the mechanics such as navigation, combat, inventory and map systems which means a working demo should be here sooner rather than later!\nOriginally we had planned to give this game out as an exclusive for Kickstarter backers only. However, we started this project with the belief that games should be for everyone and so making our biggest game exclusive to only about 100 people is not staying true to who we are or what we want to do. \nThis was not our goal and we are aware of our mistake.\nBecause of that, we have changed our approach of exclusiveness in a way that will still reward Kickstarter pledgers/backers but also will allow people from all over the world to purchase and experience the Whispering Tunnels in the future.\nPledge at a Gentle Whisper level or above and receive exclusive content for the Whispering Tunnels in the form of:\nAccess to Whispering Tunnels 1 month before release to public\nAccess to Whispering Tunnels at a lower price than public release price\nExclusive Kickstarter Backer Achievement\nExclusive Kickstarter In-Game Weapons and Items\nand more to come\u2026\nWHERE YOU COME IN\nWe love what we do and want to create more high quality audio games for our players to love too. Unfortunately, as with everything, there are some costs involved in the project. These can be summarised to:\nHiring professional voice actors\nPurchasing sound effects and music\nPizza costs for the team\nThese costs however, can be heavily reduced with your help.\nHelp - verb - to make it easier or possible for someone to do something by offering them one's services or resources.\nThat's right! Either pledge or spread the word about Audio Game Hub! Or even better, do both!\nWe believe games should be for everyone and the more people we have alongside us, the faster we can move and the bigger the impact we can make.\nMILESTONES\nOur goal for this Kickstarter is $6,000 as this is the minimum we would need to cover the costs of voice actors, sound effects and music.\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign, the games would then be sold separately (except for the 'Whispering Tunnels' game) via in app purchases to the general public.\nTo summarise:\nOur Goal - $6,000 - REACHED\n- 5 new games will be voted on and then created.\n- The Whispering Tunnels will be created.\n- Games will be released and sold separately via in-app purchases for non-backers.\nTESTIMONIALS\nWe have received a lot of touching feedback both supporting our cause and encouraging further development; but don\u2019t take our word for it:\n \u201cHi, I wanted to write this email to express not only my thanks and gratitude but also my complete amazement of your Audio games hub app. \nI am partially sighted and my wife is fully sighted and to be able to play games with her is just fantastic. You made possible something I thought I wouldn't ever see. \nIt's about the games yes certainly, but the experiences, the laughs and fun we can have because both sighted and visually impaired people can play these set of excellent games together. \nSo for the fun we have had so far and the fun we will have in the future I can't thank you enough. I hope more games will be on the way!\" - Riz\n\u201cHello, I'm writing to tell you how much I love this app!

Not only did we hit our original funding goal in 22 hours, but we made it through a full four stretch goals beyond that.  \nWe'll continue providing updates through kickstarter -- of course -- but if you want up to the minute communications, please head over to our forums for the game.\nRight at the end we hit one last stretch goal with the help of paypal backers: Interplanetary Weapons. (It's the only way to be sure.)  That goes along with the awesome Nemesis, Spire, and music goals that were already hit.\nYou've all been amazing, and we look forward to a fantastic 2017 with you. :)\n-- Chris and Keith\nAI War II is a grand strategic RTS against an overwhelming, inhuman enemy who has conquered the galaxy.  The enemy has made only a single error: underestimating you.\nYou must steal as much technology as you can, and take enough territory to fortify your bases and launch your attacks.  But every conquest you make turns the attention of the AI ever more in your direction... so choose your targets with care.\nMultiplayer!\nWe designed AI War II from the ground up for both solo and co-op play (up to at least 8 players), and put the emphasis on your smarts instead of your reflexes.\nWhat Makes The AI Awesome?\nThe AI has a distinct advantage over you in a grand strategic sense, but when it comes to combat and tactics it plays by the same rules as you... and it's very devious.\nThe core conceit of the AI is that most of the time it's not aware of you.  But pieces of its empire become aware of you at various times, and you have to then deal with those pieces in battles ranging from tiny skirmishes to thousands-strong epic encounters.\nWe've written in depth about our core approach to emergent AI, which keeps it from becoming predictable.  However, on top of that we've layered a lot of specific tactical tricks to counter a wide array of player tactics.\nVariable Difficulty!\nThe game has options to tailor the game to your skill level and playstyle:\nWhether you're a masochistic ultra-hardcore grognard\nSomeone who enjoys RTS games.\nOr just a space game fan!\nGenerally speaking, if you're winning all the time, the usual suggestion is to 'up the difficulty a notch.' Most players tend to enjoy the game best when victories are hard-fought or just barely lost. It's not about winning or losing, but about finding the right balance so that each campaign is an epic story of accomplishment.\nSidebar: The very highest difficulty is meant to be unwinnable -- and so top players enjoy their occasional victories at that level, then help us update the AI to prevent their prior tactics from working.  We have a super fun time with that arms race, and it makes the AI at the lower difficulties more interesting, too.\nKey Design Shifts From AI War Classic (The Original Game)\nThe Ark: your central command is now mobile, and can directly hack the AI. What could go wrong?\nMaking the AI's responses more fluid and aggressive.\nReworking armor and attack multipliers into new, intuitive defense mechanics.\nSplitting Energy: globally-held Fuel drives your fleets, while per-planet Power allows for meaningful planet customization.\nReinventing Cloaking: the old long-term stealth ability becomes a dangerous assault mechanic.\nDesign Documents:\nFirst of all, we have the  Design Document, which outlines what the launch build of the game is intended to be.  This is useful even if you've never played AI War Classic.  Notably, this explains the Key Design Shifts above in considerable detail.\nThen we have a separate Appendix A - Relationship To AIW 1 document detailing specific differences from original to sequel.\nFor those considering the Personable AI reward (and for those who are simply curious) we have Appendix B - AI Traits, detailing the currently-planned traits that can be mixed and matched to create new AI personalities.\nKey Technical Mumbo Jumbo\nLots and lots of multithreading to make awesome use of modern computers.\nXML modding for game content, and advanced C# modding for several key logic zones.\nMisc:\nDRM-free copies also available on launch, and day-one OSX and Linux in addition to Windows.\nRobust scaling of the 3D graphical complexity so that it can look great while running well on older machines, and look even better on newer ones.\nAlready approved for Steam -- no Greenlight needed.\nCome chat with us and other backers on our Discord server!\nFeel free to sign up for our mailing list if you'd like the occasional update about new games or other major happenings.\nThanks to fixing up a ton of usability issues, AI War 2 is well placed to deal with the first game's most common complaint: the killer learning curve. AI War is meant to be a hard but fair game, and the start menu should not be enough to defeat new players.\nWe\u2019re coming at the problem from a few different angles. Usability changes will help smooth the difficulty curve once they\u2019re in-game, as will quickstart options that allow you to jump into the game without fiddling with settings.\nOne thing we will not be doing is dumbing the game down.  The point is to remove your need to fight the interface, so you can focus on fighting the AI.\n  We are pleased to announce that AI War 2 is built from the ground up to be open and easy to modify, while still maintaining multiplayer stability. Players can modify ships and structures, the design of AI personalities, and create tutorials, scenarios, and vignettes of their own.\nYou can write your own C# code (just as we do) to hook into various parts of the game, such as map-generation, which allows for much more robust modding than we had originally planned. Modders asked for this, and we listened!\nThe design document has a list of modifiable components that we identified before we even started making the game.\nThe project hit 100% funding in just 22 hours -- WOW!  And our awesome backers carried us through a further FOUR stretch goals by the end.  We have full writeups for the Spire, Nemesis, and Interplanetary Weapons if you want more details.  We'll see what we can do about those solar systems post-campaign. \nBear in mind that the project funding total listed doesn't include the paypal contributions, which are what pushed us the last bit over the finish line.\n  Please note: rewards for backer tiers are as-shown in the sidebar.  If you increase your pledge for the purpose of add-ons, that does not increase your baseline rewards.  THAT said, if you pledge at least $260 through any combination of tiers and add-ons, we'll send you a copy of Stars Beyond Reach.\n  By popular request!  Simply add an extra dollar amount to your pledge equal to the addon(s) you want, and then in the backer survey we'll ask you what exactly it is that you were adding on.  Note that you can choose multiples of individual items (three cyber cyphers, etc) if you wish.\nExtra Launch Copies\n$20: One extra copy of the game at 1.0 release.\n$35: Two extra copies of the game at 1.0 release.\n$50: Three extra copies of the game at 1.0 release.\nAdd an extra $15 per extra such copy beyond the first 3.\n\nExtra Early Access Copies\n$30: One extra copy of the game at the Early Access release.\n$58: Two extra copies of the game at the Early Access release.\n$85: Three extra copies of the game at the Early Access release.\nAdd an extra $26 per extra such copy beyond the first 3.\n\nExtra Alpha Copies\n$48: One extra copy of the game at the private alpha release.\n$94: Two extra copies of the game at the private alpha release.\n$138: Three extra copies of the game at the private alpha release.\n$180: Four extra copies of the game at the private alpha release.\nAdd an extra $40 per extra such copy beyond the first 4.\n\nExpensive Oddities \n\"Personable AI\": If you've backed at a tier that is at least $160 (taunts), then add $40 to your pledge and you can note in the survey that you also want the \"Personable AI\" rewards in addition to whatever your chosen tier rewards are.\n\"Cyber Cypher\": If you've backed at a tier that is at least $160 (taunts), then add $40 to your pledge and you can note in the survey that you also want the \"Cyber Cypher\" rewards in addition to whatever your chosen tier rewards are.\n\"Bronze Merc\": If you've backed at a tier that is at least $100, then add $70 to your pledge and you can note in the survey that you also want the \"Bronze Merc\" rewards in addition to whatever your chosen tier rewards are.\n\"Silver Merc\": If you've backed at a tier that is at least $250, then add $170 to your pledge and you can note in the survey that you also want the \"Silver Merc\" rewards in addition to whatever your chosen tier rewards are.\n\"Gold Merc\": If you've backed at a tier that is at least $350, then add $270 to your pledge and you can note in the survey that you also want the \"Gold Merc\" rewards in addition to whatever your chosen tier rewards are.\n    Arcen (that\u2019s Ar-KEN) Games started in 2009 with a lone programmer on a mission. Most real time strategy games at the time lacked artificial intelligence worthy of the name. Once you understood how the AI worked, the challenge, and most of the fun, disappeared. So Chris Park decided to make his own.\nIt would promote strategy over tactics, reward players for experimenting, and constantly surprise them. The game needed to be fun for Chris even if he knew the game backwards and forwards.\nFrom its origins as a one man product, AI War Classic morphed into a community driven cult classic. Critical praise for the original is glowing, and it was one of the best-reviewed PC games on metacritic in the year of its launch.\nSeven years, ten games, ten expansions to those games, and hundreds of patches to those games later Arcen Games is a proud independent game studio with fans all over the world.\nPablo Vega joined very early on and provided an awesome musical score for the game. He has since scored every other game we have put out.\nKeith LaMothe is helming this new vision of AI War 2 as both lead designer and lead programmer. Fans of the original game know him well, as he basically was the force of nature behind AIW Classic from 2011 onwards. Chris may have started the AI revolution, but Keith gave it many of its most dangerous weapons.\nDaniette \"Blue\" Mann has been with the company since 2013, and her graphic design talents are behind our increasingly-awesome interfaces in years past, as well as some of the coolest bits in our move to 3D.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nArcen has spent over seven years making AI War Classic. We\u2019ve patched it, improved it and expanded on it enough that, short of the AI rising up and destroying humanity, if we get our funding we can all but guarantee we'll release AI War 2.\n\nThat said, things change during development. Ideas can need more time, or not work at all. Miss a milestone and the game gets delayed. Programming challenges could push features intended for 1.0 into the post-release period. And this is before getting into acts of god and personal tragedies.\n\nAI War II is set to avoid issues common to Kickstarted videogame projects. Our finished design document is hugely specific. The funding we need for the project has been carefully considered, and we're being utterly ruthless with the scope to make sure that it fits within the time budgets of the staff (primarily Keith) who will be working on this.\n\nGiven that this is a re-launch of a much higher-target kickstarter, a lot of the staff that was slated to work on the first one has to find other work elsewhere. Some of us are still with the company, but we'll have to fund ourselves via other projects either on kickstarter or otherwise.\n\nWe have carefully planned all of that out in such a way that none of those projects will AT ALL impact AI War 2 -- in terms of finances, schedules, or otherwise -- and we will not mix funds between any projects. We are adept at running multiple projects with separate teams, having done so for a number of years in the past.\n\nAs with anything else, we're open to any and all questions or concerns you might have, though. We understand that various other developers have done some shady things in this area, and we want to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.\n\nIn terms of design itself, we have two more secret weapons: AI War Classic and our community. Almost everything in AI War 2 has an equivalent in AI War Classic. If we run into issues implementing a feature we can look back to the original version. For everything past that point, we rely on our fans, always a source of ideas and creative solutions to problems. We have a reputation for speaking with our fans and listening to them in return.

Go through all kinds of absurd and funny situations to raise your stats and seduce one of your classmates. Beautiful art, witty dialogues and hard choices are the main ingredients of this local competitive/cooperative (1-4 players) dating sim.\nDo you know how to conquer a monster\u2019s heart? ;D\n IMPORTANT! - All rewards (except the postcards) are digital! \n\u201cMonster Prom\u201d is a local multiplayer game (Windows, Mac, Linux) meant to be played from 1 to 4 players (but trust us: the more, the merrier!) that mixes \u201cchoose-your-own-adventure\u201d stuff with dating sims\u2019 mechanics.\nYou are a student at a monster highschool. Being a monster can be hard, but getting a date for the monster prom is even harder!\nYou will have a limited number of turns to explore a school full of weird and amazing events that will let you meet 6 of your classmates. Each event (full of beautiful art and funny dialogues) will lead you to an absurd bifurcation where you will have to make a choice. Each event will raise or lower your stats and improve or mess with your relationship with your classmates. Choose wisely! Are you charming enough to go with a certain answer? Are you bold enough to follow a specific choice? Each option can be a potential success or failure.\nTry to do your best at each situation and enjoy the ride\u2026 but don\u2019t forget that, in the end, prom night will arrive and you will have to go all in\u2026 but with whom?\nIt surely could be the night of your life\u2026 but that will depend on you.\n1. COMPETITIVE DATING SIM  \nFeel like fighting for love? Compete against others to win the affection of the same love interest! Will you come out on top?\n2. LOTS OF FUNNY SITUATIONS\n300+ events, each with four possible outcomes, totaling over 1,000 different scenarios. Discover new content in every playthrough!\n3.  UNIQUE CHARACTERS\nMeet six larger than life objects of affection, each with gorgeous art illustrated by Arthur Tien and hilarious personalities developed by Juli\u00e1n Quijano and Cory O\u2019Brien.\n4. CHOICES THAT MATTER\nYour decisions affect the outcome of each scenario, allowing you to unlock an array of funny endings. Sometimes, you may even come upon decisions that affect your friends' journeys -- will you aid them or screw them over?\n5. ABSURD ITEMS\nEarn all kinds of achievements to unlock new items in the shop, which can help you in your highschool adventures or even unlock new and absurd events. A penguin mask, a spork, a slave, an erotic fanfic about dragons\u2026\n6. MONSTER FASHION\nEach monster has different outfits to show. We wanted a true and absurd slice of life game, so we wanted our characters to display different clothes according to their style.\n7. SECRET ENDINGS\n The game will have a good amount of endings depending on your choices during the game. But there will be secret endings too. Secret endings will be unlocked by successfully navigating crazy plots that include a bunch of events. Our main goal is to include at least 2 secret endings per love interest; but we have a lot more in mind if we get enough funding. Each secret ending has its own unique illustration. \n8. MODERN LOVE&POST-MODERN HUMOR\nWe wanted to reflect and parody how love, flirting, relationships, life and sex have change in the last years: selfies, dating apps, crowdfunding, dickpics, raves, emojis\u2026\nAlso, to be clear, Monster Prom NEVER takes itself seriously. It\u2019s fully aware of its own parodic nature and it\u2019s able of laughing at itself. We just don\u2019t care. \nTo sum it up, some of our dearest references are Rick&Morty, Archer, South Park, Man seeking woman, Master of None or Scream Queens. Let\u2019s celebrate post-modernism! Let\u2019s laugh at everything with no shame!\n9. TRUE HIGHSCHOOL FLOW\nWe're trying to make the experience as funny and creative as possible. You will have to explore your highschool, but some turns will take place in the cafeteria, where you will have to choose which seat to take, depending on which of your classmates you want to romance.\nAlso, we didn't want all players starting with the same stats, so we came up with this minigame at the beginning of each game session: a crazy pop quiz question will always be the opener and the answer you take will shape your stats. \n10. NO ONE'S OFF LIMITS: A NON-BINARY GAME\nDon't worry if you want to romance a certain love interest as a certain character! In Monster Prom characters don't like boys or girls... they like people. Turns out, monsters don't really care about sexual orientation. They are probably not even the same species! We'd hate to obstruct your great Casanova challenge by making additional rules, so there's no gender/sex/species/planetary/dimensional limitations in the game whatsoever. In fact it's less work that way. So we decide you can just romance anyone with anyone. There. Being lazy rules.\nOur chars don't like someone for being male or female, but because of their traits: being fun, being smart, being bold, being charming or being creative. \nBeautiful Glitch is a videogames studio based in Barcelona.

The first player to complete the puzzle by positioning their heroes accordingly collect the quest card and its benefits. \n  Each round is broken down into two phases, the day phase and the night phase.\n  In the night phase, players will roll adventure dice in a communal press-your-luck fashion to try to accomplish the tasks at the locations they ended at during the day phase. This could be fighting a goblin, learning a spell, or delving into a temple. But be careful, if you take too much damage you may exhaust and lose all that round's progress and more! \nPlayers keep track of their heroes' collective health, power and progress on personal adventure logs.\nAnd when you acquire powerful items, you equip them right to your ITEMeeples\u2122! \nPlayers keep track of their spell progress, and the rounds magic level on a community magic mat.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete.

It\u2019s a GM-less game for 3-5 people that runs in 3-4 hours. The game\u2019s core spark comes from gradually build\u00ading up elements of language among players, who gain fluency in their own dialect over the course of play. Words are built off of the fundamental traits of the community, the pivotal events that have defined their lives, and how they respond to a changing world. Players use the language and explore both their characters and the world by asking what this new language really means to them. A new word is made, the language grows, and the community is tightened.\nFrom age to age, the Isolation changes and we see those changes reflected in the language. In the end, you'll define how the language dies and what happens to the Isolation. Players take away both the story they\u2019ve told together and this new language. \nDialect has been our passionate work for the last 14 months. We\u2019ve played it far and wide with different groups of people to great reception. Now it's time to share this language-building storytelling game with you, playful language-loving human.\nDialect is a role playing game where we define and explore an isolated community through its beginning, rise and end. Language is the lens. \nThe first step of any game is creating our community. At the start, we pick a backdrop which forms the world in which the Isolation exists (more on backdrops below). Next, we make the world our own by defining three aspects for our community. These will be the touchstones of our society, and will be the initial seeds from which our language grows.\nHere are some example aspects for a game set in the Martian colony:\nFinally, we each choose characters to be our voice in the Isolation. Each character has a unique relationship to the aspects, which means each has a unique relationship to the language.\nEach turn in a game of Dialect is divided into three simple stages.\nMAKE A CONNECTION. On every turn, players generate a new piece of language by picking a concept from a hand of cards and tying it to one of the defining aspects of the community.  We describe why this concept and aspect are linked, which tells us a little more about the world and our place in it. Perhaps our word for a BAD OMEN comes from our aspect WE ARE ILL-PREPARED because of a terrible accident in our past that we still haven't been able to explain.\n BUILD A WORD. Now, with the help of the other players at the table we determine what this new word will be based on what we've now learned about the community. In this example, the table decides that the terrible accident was when STATION SIX mysteriously blew up, for reasons that no one still fully understands. With time, we shortened STATION SIX to STAYSIX which has become our new word for any BAD OMEN or related concept.\n HAVE A CONVERSATION. Finally, we have a short conversation where we explore what this language means to two of the characters at the table. Characters aren\u2019t carbon copies, and not everyone identifies with all of the Isolation\u2019s aspects equally - so a word that one character uses casually, may be deeply meaningful to another. We define flavors of language at the level of the world and the individual. Who sees a major STAYSIX on the horizon that the others are ignoring? Let's play to find out.\nPaired with this DNA of forming language and exploring characters, the game takes place over three ages. Pivotal events happen as time passes and the Isolation is faced with hard choices that will change it in deep ways.\nWill our Isolation end because it\u2019s ultimately assimilated, will we be forced to give up who we are in order to survive or does collapse come from within?\n    Making and using new pieces of language is the heart of Dialect. To that end, we're thrilled to be collaborating with the most prolific and prominent creator of languages today, David Peterson. David will be writing a chapter for Dialect that highlights his experience in constructed language and how he tries to bring out a culture's unique aspects while inventing his own languages.\nDavid's chapter will help enhance your game of Dialect by giving you new insight into how language is invented and creative inspiration for a richer and and more evocative experience. If you aren\u2019t already an avid conlanger, you'll get a taste of a beautiful sciency art form. If you are, then you totally know what's up. We\u2019re stoked to be working with him!\n  Backdrops are the world from which the Isolation emerges. They are the starting line, the playset, the point where we grow apart and begin distinguishing ourselves. They are an ideal way to shape your game to explore different themes and experience a different world. The game comes with a set of core backdrops: The Martian Outpost, The Compound, Archipelago, and The Network.\nOutside of the core settings, we have a set of incredible contributing writers -- world-class game designers, linguists, language creators, and generally-formidable humans -- who will be making additional backdrops for the game. Here is a taste of what you can expect from these fine minds.\n    Backdrop ideas are subject to change according to whim and inspiration.\nDialect comes as a book and language generating deck, both gorgeously printed with professional layout and beautiful art. To play Dialect, all that is required is the rulebook, the language generating deck and some index cards. With these three ingredients and a friendly gaming circle, you are set for a storytelling, language-building good time.\nPlay takes place in a space lovingly referred to as the the Language Tableau. The Language Tableau is the home to aspects that define the community, the events that happen to shape the Isolation, and most importantly, the language that evolves from them.\nA Language Tableau can be clean and simple or optionally more adorned. We enjoy the adornment ritual: dividing ages with strings, stones or any other creative options you have available. You're welcome to customize your playspace or keep it au naturel.\nDialect has been being playtested regularly for the last 14 months: at conventions around the US, home gatherings, festivals, bars, classrooms, forests, even in a chapel. It\u2019s been a blast. Here are a smattering of publicly-accessible reviews and play reports.\n    From Linky to Linker: Dialect Play Report\nNarrative Control Podcast: Language in Games\nGen Con Play Report: Dialect, Language Coming out of Isolation\nBackstory Podcast: Kathryn Hymes and Hakan Seyalioglu\nThe Gauntlet Podcast (video)\nJank Cast: Language in Games\nLegal Moves Podcast\nRewards, oh, the rewards. We believe in a simple-but-spectacular reward structure. Spoiler: it's linguistic play all the way down. On tap at Thorny Games are the following:\n    For the keen lover of play and language, we have a second offering. To mark the occasion of Dialect\u2019s debut, we're making a first print-run of our game Sign: a game about being understood.\nSign is an award-winning live-action game about the incredible story of Nicaraguan Sign Language: a language born in modern times from the hands of children. Pro-tip: if you are having a doubtful day about humanity, this story is worth knowing. Pass it on!\nSign has been played the world over and featured at many conventions around the US. It\u2019s also been the kind recipient of heaps of praise (Indie RPG Awards, Indie Groundbreaker awards, The Golden Cobra). Sign is freely available as a PDF right here from our website, and will always be free online. But a special game deserves a special touch, and for that, we\u2019ve got some amazing collaborators to make this game shine.\n  For this Kickstarter, we\u2019ve worked with the prodigiously-talented artist Miranda Meeks to illustrate the spark of emergent language. She's done a spectacular job. The game will be lovingly and gorgeously crafted as a boxed-set of tarot-sized cards, so you, too, can live out emergent language through play. We're so looking forward to sharing it with you!\nAny and all profits from Sign will be donated to the Nicaraguan Sign Language Project - the organization devoted to increasing resources for Sign Language education in Nicaragua.\n Dialect is a collaboration of some very passionate folks. \nThorny Games. An indie game studio out of San Francisco specializing in quirky and thoughtful games about language and cryptography - Thorny Games is the work of Kathryn Hymes and Hakan Seyalioglu. \nKathryn specializes in teaching robots about human language so we can all be friends some day (in other words, a computational linguist). She owns a theremin and plays it badly. Hakan helps computers keep secrets and crack codes (a genuine cryptographer). He really enjoys breakfast. In the past, they both did a lot of math. In the present, they play games, design games and spread the good word about RPG.\nAlso part of Thorny Games are minority shareholders and paradoxical kittens Banach (.003%) & Tarski (.003%).\nBrennen Reece (Layout). Having brought some of the most evocative storygames in recent memory to print - Night Witches, Carolina Death Crawl and The Clay That Woke - Brennen\u2019s skills are peerless and we're thrilled to have him on this project. See more of his work here.\nJill DeHaan (Art). Art for Dialect (including the illustrations in the Kickstarter page) is thanks to the masterhand of Jill DeHaan. Jill is a world-class letterer and when we saw how much beauty she could breath into the written word, it was insta-love. See more of her work here.\nDavid Peterson (Chapter on Inventing Language). The most well-known language inventor of our generation, David Peterson will be contributing a chapter on making language to help players with their own language creation process. We\u2019re stoked! Learn more about conlanging and the languages David has created at his website.\nKeith Stetson (Chapter on incorporating Dialect to a home campaign). One of the the exciting possibilities with Dialect is using it to generate language for the world in a home campaign. We\u2019re so happy to be working with Keith, avid game player and educator, on a guide to Dialect-ing other games. Fractal games in games for all!\nBackdrop Writers. We can't say enough wonderful things about our backdrop writers. They are consummate game designers, language creators, academics, and humans. Many of them are among the first players of Dialect, and we're especially excited to have so many different perspectives represented. Please stay in touch as we reveal more of our backdrops. \n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDialect is currently in the final stages of design refinement and we have a few upcoming playtests to tie it up. We're pretty thrilled with the current version but when it\u2019s your pride and joy, you do whatever you can to deliver the best game possible.\n\nWe have printers, distributors, shipping and additional writers lined up and ready to go. We plan to run a very transparent project with regular updates to backers at every stage.\n\nThis is our first Kickstarter, but we\u2019re not new to shipping products. Combined, we\u2019ve spent the better part of a decade making software for billions (yep, with a B) of people around the world in the beating artificial heart of Silicon Valley.

Except it was no dream. I probably died that day. When I opened my eyes, I found myself in an unknown yet familiar place. There were cocoons around me, with people sleeping inside. I was confused. Where was I? Had I really died?  \nWelcome to Purgatory~\n  In Chronotopia, you incarnate a soul who recently found their way in Purgatory. The soul has to find the memories of their previous life again, otherwise they\u2019ll be damned. You\u2019re assisted by a mysterious young girl who has the power to travel through lost worlds \u2013the uchronia, which are actually rewritings of fairytales. During your journey in the fairytale world, you will witness events that can grant the soul fragments of their buried memories. The number of fragments you collect will affect the fate of the soul.\n    A unique take on a forgotten fairytale with many twists\nBranching story with around 10 endings and 30 hours of playtime!\nBeautiful artwork, with animated backgrounds and special stained-glass illustrations  \nExtensive use of RenPy 3D camera for a more dynamic presentation \nSeveral segments allowing you to freely explore the castle to discover its secrets  \nA full original soundtrack with celtic influences\nTwo GxG (Nahima and the Fairy) and one GxB (the \"Prince\") romances possible!\nAs you can see on the picture above, even though Chronotopia is a visual novel, there will also be several gameplay segments through the game to enhance the experience and offer a more dynamic presentation.\nPreview of the castle's map\n    Chronotopia is a dark retelling of the fairytale of Donkeyskin, which is very similar to Cinderella. Here, instead of remarrying, the heroine\u2019s father decides he should wed her instead, so she has to escape with the help of her fairy godmother to finally be able to meet the prince. And that\u2019s where we present our version with a more...realistic and mature approach to spice things up. Of course, the choices you make will also affect her fate: she can either escape with her servant, become a fairy herself or die in a horrible way. Multiple times.\n    Her duty is to guide wavering Shadows in the collection of the memories of their past life. With this aim in mind, she uses her powers to take them to lost worlds \u2013 the uchronia. What could she have planned for you?\nShe\u2019s innocent and smart but also quite haughty, due to her education. Being dependant on Nahima, she\u2019s utterly lost when she suddenly has to find a way out of the castle by herself. She doesn\u2019t know it yet, but it\u2019s the beginning of a long nightmare that will take her to the edges of madness.\nShe\u2019s always there to take care of her. But when the King announces his desire to marry the princess, she finds herself powerless to help the one she loves the most. Slowly but surely, she can feel the girl drifting apart from her\u2026\n She agrees to help the young girl at a condition: to be able to receive her powers, the princess has to pay a price -the Fairies\u2019 tribute. Will she be willing to trust such an unnatural being?\n The death of his beloved drove him into a deep depression and a deceitful druid took that opportunity to manipulate him. Now, he\u2019s convinced his daughter is actually the reincarnation of his wife and he\u2019s willing to do the unforgiveable.\nSeveral people living in the castle. They could be precious allies or latent enemies. Regardless the princess should be careful of who to trust...\n  At heart, Chronotopia is a visual novel with point & click elements that strive to offer a unique experience. We love unusual stories with a twist and we have a very wide range of influences you may spot here: folklore, classical literature, anime (such as Haibane Renmei or Madoka Magica), videogames (such as American McGee Alice or Child of Light) as well as both Japanese and English visual novels (the Infinity series, Steins;Gate, Cinders, Long Live the Queen).\n  Chronotopia is quite an ambitious project because we really want to offer a visual novel of high quality with a good playtime. And it does come with a price.\nA good chunk of the budget (5 000\u20ac) will be allocated to the art assets needed to complete the game.\nAnother good chunk of the budget (4 250\u20ac) will be allocated to the translation. The reason is simple: as most of the teammembers aren't native speakers, we're not confident enough in our English skills to write the story directly in English. And since the price depends on the wordcount, which will be quite high, we have to spend a lot to ensure a good translation. Those are our two biggest expenses. \nOther than that, we need 1 000\u20ac for additional music tracks and the rest will be used for rewards, mostly physical ones (2 105\u20ac), and Kickstarter fees (10%). \nHowever, I, the team leader in charge of writing and programming, won't pay myself for my work to prevent the initial goal from being too high (since I'm working full-time on the project, I would need between 5 000 and 10 000\u20ac just to be able to make a living). I'm currently living off other means so you can always subscribe to my Patreon to support me!\n(Some of the free games we've made)\nTr\u00e4umendes M\u00e4dchen has been making visual novel as a hobbyist studio since 2012, with a dozen of releases, so we definitely have the experience required for such a project. However, as we're just starting out as a commercial company, we do need a financial boost. We already invested some funds into the making of Chronotopia's demo but we're going to need your help to be able to make the full game a reality!\nWebsite | Devblog | Twitter | Facebook | Tumblr | VNDB\nCEO/Writer/Programmer/Project Leader\nAfter Modern Languages studies (taking the route of an intensive foundation degree), then a Master\u2019s degree in management and public administration, this otaku culture enthusiast needed to take up a new challenge.

The main reason she joined: she worships fairytales and, while working on Chronotopia, she's still creating her own comics, mixing various themes. One being, of course, a revision of a fairytale.\n Graphist (backgrounds)\nKat is a self-taught digital artist and has been painting scenic illustrations since 2014.

Are you a Bisexual Unicorn? An Asexual Succubus? Or even a Genderqueer Merperson? If so, you\u2019re in the right place!\nThere are loads of other creatures to meet, so why not use this handy book to guide your adventures? Fred Aura the Explorer has collected his notes and interviews of his time travelling through this LGBTQA* filled land and it\u2019s time to share the collection! \n    The book is a compilation of all the Minority Monster comics over on Discord Comics combined with notes about the creatures in question, information on certain topics on gender, sexuality and romantic leanings...\n    ...all topped off with a beautiful map of Alphabet soup land on the inside covers. \nIt\u2019s a full colour hardback of approx 100 pages (the final length and number of monsters included depends on stretch goals). It\u2019s a nifty 210x210mm (A4 square) size so you can take it exploring with you but still travels easily. It would also look great on a coffee table or in the hands of someone you think needs some of the finer points of a creature explained to them.\nHere\u2019s the list of Monsters in the book so far: \nSir Fabulous the Third the Bisexual Unicorn \nCaptain Sashay the Genderqueer Merperson \nQueen Ravishment the Polyamorous Dragon \nMadame Lucie Decline the Asexual Succubus \nKing Monarch the Trans Ex Princess \nReverend Tumbles the Pansexual Satyress \nBaroness Camp Von Glamour the Lesbian Harpy \nDame Sonatina the Aromantic Siren \nProfessor Puce the Agender Sphinx \nClive the Cross dressing centaur \nMx.

The most important thing for me was to get the spines of these books sewn so it\u2019s more durable. I think this is the kind of book that will get cracked open to particular pages rather often...\n I\u2019ve done a lot of math (so many spreadsheets), and this is how all the money works out: \nMerchandise you say? Well, besides the basic book there's some very special things for your souvenirs of alphabet soup land...\n All backers will get behind the scenes access to the project and early copies of the PDF. I think this book would be an important resource for people so my plan is to release a free digital copy of the book to everyone one year after the kickstarter has finished.\n                End of November - Kickstarter money makes its slow way to my account \nEnd of December - PDF draft of book sent out to all backers (Merry Christmas) and edits made \nJanuary - Edits made, printing happens, I work on Comissions/Merch/Postcards \nFebruary - Books arrive, Shipping time!  \nIf we reach certain stretch goals please add an extra 1 week per brand new monster to give me time to draw them!\n Speaking of which....\nUnfortunately I can't write about every monster in Alphabet soup land- there are more species than you can even hope to imagine! Instead if we manage to make it past the initial goal I'll add some extra monsters with a big stretch to make an audiobook version of the series (written in prose and then dramatised by me) to make it even more accessible and portable. \n\u00a310,000 Fairy Nuff the Domme Pixie (and the visit to consent castle) \n\u00a311,000 Izzy the Intersex Incubus \n\u00a312,000 Her Royal Bi-ness Princess Pan-elope the Polysexual Pegasus \n\u00a313,000 First Lady Bamfee the Transfeminine Banshee (as seen in President Pam\u2019s comic) \n\u00a314,000 Queen Curious the Queer Cupid \n\u00a315,000 Ally Cookies, a recipe \n\u00a316,000 I.M.P.S Intersectional Monster Peer Support (a multipage comic) \n\u00a317,000 Add a drag monster (design/name tbc!)\n\u00a318,000 5 more charm options for everyone\n\u00a319,000 Pansexual t-shirt option made available\n\u00a320,000 Audiobook version of the book made\nTo be honest with you I'm not expecting to get anywhere close to this goal, but it would be neat to do it!\nMy name's Tab and I've spent the last ten years writing comics about gender and sexuality. Some of my work is very dark, with hurty feelings, emotional roller coasters and unsatisfying realistic endings, but at my core I've got a sense of humour (which mainly consists of puns). I think in a world that's tough for LGBTQA+ people that comedy is often what gets us through. \nMinority Monsters started out as a silly drawing of a bisexual unicorn which I put on a T-shirt. Because bisexuals are mythical, right? People loved him in his sparkly glory so I started thinking about other creatures, then drawing comics, then it all spiralled into this. \nI've been drawing the occasional comic for this over the past three years but now it's time to bring them all together and make something that shows that minorities are not mythical, queer creatures are powerful and beautiful, and you can be a fairy and still get a fairytale ending. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a slightly different style of book than I usually produce- normally I have all the comics ready to go and then put up a kickstarter for a print edition, maybe adding in more extras here and there. But I have no idea if people actually want this book to exist, so while I\u2019ve been filling out the info pages, they\u2019re still only drafts at present. If you folks decide that this is a book you actually want then I\u2019ll charge ahead with completing them, and you get to be part of the progress along the way. \n\nThis book deals with a lot of sensitive and personal topics, so as part of the project I\u2019ll be giving the backers the first peeks at the book\u2019s content. That way I can be sure you\u2019re happy with what I write about Bisexual Unicorns before it goes to print.\n\nIf I reach a lot of stretch goals I'm going to need more time to draw the content for the book. I estimate an extra week for each monster added so please be patient while I draw.\n\nThis is my fourth kickstarter project and I completed all of the others within a couple of months of funding. I\u2019ve been realistic with the time goals to set myself and know how much postage costs from the last three years! \n\nThe biggest issue is always printers but I managed to complete the Shades of A Omnibus even with my selected printer going under and having to frantically find a new one. \n\nIf this kickstarter doesn\u2019t fund the book will not be getting a paperback edition- it\u2019s all or nothing!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Wish you were here", "descp": "Postcard from alphabet soup land, behind the scenes book progress and free PDF.

It\u2019s the perfect item for infiltration and recon operations. Use it to store your infected USB drives, keyloggers, wireless auditing tool kits and more! The Secret World players who back our campaign will also receive access to an exclusive cross-universe ARG mission, plus limited edition NITE Team 4 uniforms that can be worn by their characters in The Secret World!\nSee the Backer Tiers chart for more information on these TSW rewards.\nNITE Team 4 is a story-driven military hacking simulation game that explores the world of cyberwarfare and features realistic mission scenarios. It will be released on Steam for PC and Mac.\nYou play as a new recruit in the covert hacking cell, Network Intelligence & Technical Evaluation (NITE) Team 4. Engaged in cyberwarfare with black hat groups and hostile states, you will be in a struggle to penetrate highly secure targets. Your job is to use the STINGER hacking system to infiltrate hardened computer networks and coordinate strike teams on the ground to carry out missions that feature real espionage tradecraft terminology taken straight from leaked NSA documents.\n        During our time developing the Alternate Reality Game The Black Watchmen, a project we successfully funded on Kickstarter, we frequently came across stories related to the world of government hacking groups and intelligence analysis. These subjects were incredibly fascinating and inspired much of the content appearing in NITE Team 4. We want to do something new in hacking games and bring this secret world to life. Our time spent producing Alternate Reality Games and events has given us the skills to craft immersive narratives unlike any other. This is not going to be a game about a lone hacker, we want to deliver an engaging experience that puts you in the ranks of the most powerful cyberwarfare unit on the planet.\nIn NITE Team 4, players will have access to a virtual hacking platform based off real systems (Kali Linux/Metasploit). Each mission is broken down into distinct phases including Recon, Exploitation and Raid. \nIn the Recon Phase, players will be performing research and investigative tasks to learn all they can using actual espionage tradecraft. Utilize reconnaissance tools to map networks, fingerprint systems and gather intelligence that will help you uncover possible weaknesses in the target organization. \nAfter gaining a thorough understanding of the enemy, players will move to the Exploitation Phase where they will use hacking modules to exploit and gain a secure foothold into the target. Customize your attack strategy by leveraging all the offensive system tools at your disposal. \nFinally, the Raid Phase begins where players will work with military teams on the ground to provide specialized support and direct units to effectively compromise an entire facility/organization using highly advanced cyberwarfare equipment. Ensure your team is well equipped to defeat threats on the ground, facility security controls and network defenses.\nHacking Suite\nThe STINGER system is a specialized interface that allows players to control hacking modules and use custom tools to deliver an immersive hacking experience.\nIn the Field \nDirect troops to perform raids in support of field operations like covertly implanting devices with malware, targeting drone strikes and sabotaging target.\n  Rich Story\nMission campaigns feature espionage terms and references, sourced from leaked NSA documents in the Snowden archive. Inspired by actual systems like Kali Linux and Metasploit.\nAlternate Reality War Games\nFrom Advanced Persistent Threats to covert malware projects that destroy critical infrastructure, NITE Team 4 is inspired by the real world of cyberwarfare. We bring this world to life using our 2+ years of Alternate Reality Game development experience and optional ARG elements that enhance the immersion of the universe (websites, research online, etc).\n     Off-Net Intrusion Group (ONIGRU)  \nSometimes NITE Team 4 operations require so called \u201coff-net\u201d activities to breach hardened areas. This is when the Off-Net Intrusion Group (ONIGRU) is called into action. They coordinate with NITE Team 4 members to complete the necessary tasks on the ground that will allow a successful penetration into a target site.\nRemote Operations Center (ROC)\nThe Remote Operations Center (ROC) is the base of operations for NITE Team 4. It is equipped with state of the art data visualization and analysis software. All major operations are coordinated and executed within the ROC. Sophisticated anonymization technology obscures the source of any cyberwarfare strikes and makes attribution of NITE Team 4 attacks incredibly difficult.\nAgent Wheeler  \nAgent Wheeler is a senior agent in The Black Watchmen's Archive & Records division. She is a specialist in Big Data analysis and database management. NITE Team 4 relies on her skills to quickly find the information they need and gain insights on collected intel. \nAs part of our Kickstarter campaign, we want you to decide on the main story of NITE Team 4. Each of these three possible options are based on actual cyberthreats that will test your hacking abilities, plus one that is a little more paranormal in nature. By supporting the campaign, you'll be able to vote on which story is your favorite and see it get developed at the end of the Kickstarter, see the list of options below:\n      Ghost Skin - Available at $25 Tier\n  Elite Skin - Available at $50 Tier\n        *All names used in game must not be trademarked, offensive or in any way problematic for us to include in the game.\n    *All Add-On prices are in Canadian Dollars. If you are not Canadian, you can calculate how much you will need to add to your pledge here.\nHelp spread the word of NITE Team 4. The most effective way to ensure the game is funded and expanded with stretch goals is to share this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, Instagram, gaming forums, blogs, etc. Join in the propaganda effort and help extend the scope of NITE Team 4!  \nShare on Twitter  \nShare on Facebook  \nShare on Tumblr  \nTrue to our ARG roots, many of the stories featured in NITE Team 4 are blended with real world events that will lead you down a rabbit hole of conspiracies. You can find out more about the real world inspiration for each story campaign below:\nCampaign 1 - Critical Failure\nWe read about the possibility of a hack on the Global Positioning System in a news article. It painted a grim portrait of how reliant some systems are on GPS and the potentially devastating consequences of GPS failure. We wanted to explore the idea of a hacker gaining access to the command center of this system and what kind of damage they could do.\nCampaign 2 - Dark Seoul\nAfter the hack performed by North Korea on Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014, we wanted to know more about the cyberwarfare capabilities of this secretive nation state. We found out that North Korea had conducted wide scale cyber attacks on South Korea in 2013 with a malware known as \u201cDarkSeoul\u201d. The idea of NITE Team 4 being asked to stop another impending cyber attack by North Korea was exciting and became our second campaign story.\nCampaign 3 - Machine Learning\nThe concept of software that could defend and attack hackers sounded like science fiction. But it turns out, the NSA didn\u2019t think so and actually developed something like this. It\u2019s called MonsterMind and supposedly it\u2019s capable of retaliating against hackers on designated networks. The possible implications of a system like this and the problems it could cause if not configured correctly, were what inspired our third campaign.\n    NITE Team 4 was originally a hacking team in the Permanent Alternate Reality Game The Black Watchmen and still exists within that narrative universe. The STINGER hacking terminal was introduced in a Black Watchmen mission as a website interface and asked players to research actual computer exploits. The overwhelming amount of interest we received from players about the STINGER terminal showed us the potential for a stand-alone version of the game.\nIn The Black Watchmen, you are an agent of a paramilitary group dedicated to protecting the public from dangerous phenomena beyond human understanding: ritualistic murder, occult secret societies, and paranormal activity, to name but a few.\nAs a global organization, The Black Watchmen offer a wide range of skills and services for covert missions anywhere in the world, on behalf of any group, corporation or government that can afford them. Often called in as a last resort, The Black Watchmen pride themselves on their discretion, strength and efficiency. NITE Team 4\u2019s cyberwarfare capabilities ensure the strength of the Global Agent Network.\nSantiak Chronicle\nThe Black Watchmen Comic Book is an account of an actual event involving players of The Black Watchmen. In addition to in-game missions, we created real world interactions that range from online research [occult and bizarre subject matter], background checks on NPCs via social media and email contact with in-game characters to full blown real-world investigations with thousands of players working together in real time (AKA Live Events.)\nLive Events involved dead drops hidden in various cities, interactions with actors, recon photos, phone calls, mail puzzles and much more. \nThe Black Watchmen universe continues to expand with Ahnayro: The Dream World\u2019s ethereal explorations into a veiled reality [Now on Steam] and a newly launched Special Ops DLC: Mother Russia.\n  Alice & Smith is an entertainment company based in Montreal, our passion is creating emotions. With its 7 years of experience in the design and production of transmedia campaigns and 15 years of experience in digital marketing, Alice & Smith\u2019s team believes in the power of emotion and in constantly creating new technological ways to reach people.\nDiscover how we created an immersive experience for the last two years in our 84-page behind-the-scenes development report.\nAndrea Doyon - Producer: The head producer at Alice & Smith, Andrea is a creative geek with a mission: \u201cmake your life fun.\u201d Andrea has lectured on the importance of cybersecurity for both large corporations and dynamic startups.\nNathalie Lacoste - CEO/Producer: Nathalie is an Art Historian (late 19th century to 1930) with a specialization in the semiotic language of fashion, and costume in art. She is fascinated with the \u201cmodern Esprit\u201d and the \u201cSleen\u201d of that period. Nathalie is the founder and CEO of Alice & Smith, and concentrates on the big picture ideas of the studio while ensuring all the details are in place.\nFred Forges - Game Design, Graphic Design, Lead Developer: Fred is our go to man for almost everything. Game design, programming, web development, image and video editing - it\u2019s all Fred. His keen eye for design and detail will give NITE Team 4 its distinct aesthetic and feel. When he\u2019s not blowing our minds by the amount of work he can get done in a single afternoon, he is busy playing games and watching a whole lot of Netflix. He also enjoys playing hockey and guitar and has a cat named Korben Dallas and a really cool dog named Marl\u00e8ne who hangs out at the office sometimes.\nSteven Patterson - Game Design, Writing: Steven grew up with a strong interest in technology, hacking and Japanese culture. Section 342.1 of the Canadian Criminal Code hasn\u2019t been used against him yet and hopefully won\u2019t be in the future. Steven\u2019s background and interest in cyberwarfare is contagious, nearly anyone he speaks to about it will come away awed at the scope of Computer Network Operations today. While absent from the game design table, Steven enjoys struggling to speak Japanese and researching other games (aka playing them until the early morning).\nPatrick Greatbatch - Game Design: Patrick\u2019s interest lies in the occult, the paranormal and the delicious. With a background in film and television, Patrick made the move to game design in 2011 with a grassroots ARG for a sci-fi web series based in Montreal. He has worked alongside Steven, on games, puzzles and scavenger hunts ever since. When he is not researching NSA leaks and Stuxnet, Patrick spends his time biking, cooking and hanging out with his two cats.\nVincent Chevalier - Developer: Silent and deadly - international man of deception, Vincent is a mystery wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a man who is very good at coding.\nOur studio has had a recurring fascination with the world of cyberwarfare over the last two years and we've planned multiple hacking themed events for our Alternate Reality Game, The Black Watchmen. We realized that there was the potential for a full, stand-alone hacking experience inspired by actual modern day civilian and military computer security tools. We are now coming to the Kickstarter community to help realize this potential.\nWe have created a funding goal of $30,000 to build a strong story campaign with online (cyberwarfare), off-net (tactical field units) and out of game (alternate reality) components. You can discover more about our capacity to create a truly immersive experience in our 84-page behind-the-scenes report on our development process. We believe that we have the skills and passion required to bring a truly novel experience to the gaming community.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have successfully completed a Kickstarter campaign in the past for The Black Watchmen and are aware of the common challenges associated with running a Kickstarter. We know that sometimes backer rewards requiring a high degree of customization or interaction with the design team can take longer than usual. If we experience any delays in delivery of backer rewards, we will be sure to speak directly with the people affected and do our best to keep everyone informed.\n\nThat being said, the biggest challenge for NITE Team 4 is to create a truly immersive experience for all phases of the game (cyberwarfare / off-net tactical field intervention), while keeping a balance between accessible and realistic. As a self-financed indie studio, we recognize that we don\u2019t have the $500k+ budget of a larger studio. But, in the last two years we have learned how to be efficient and flexible with an extremely minimal budget. \n\nLike most game projects, there may be unexpected issues or changes. We understand that making a game is a complex and challenging process. To mitigate risk, in February we launched an Alpha version of the game that was tested by over 200 players. This helped us a lot and we plan to revisit the strategy of sharing prototype versions throughout the development process.\n \nWhatever may happen, we\u2019ll be sure to be as transparent as possible and value our community\u2019s time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You", "descp": "Your name will be added to the Special Thanks wall on the NITE Team 4 website for all to see and follow the full dev process with a subscription to an exclusive newsletter.\nINCLUDES:\nSpecial Thanks on Website\nDev Updates Newsletter", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2017"}], "stat": ["61 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 25 or more", "title": "Cadet", "descp": "Earn your vote on the main story line of NITE Team 4, get the Original Soundtrack, show off a special \"Pathfinder\" forum title and play the completed game.\nINCLUDES:\nEverything from Previous Pledge +\nCopy of NITE Team 4\n\"Pathfinder\" Forum Title\nVote on Main Story\nOriginal Soundtrack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2017"}], "stat": ["358 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 50 or more", "title": "Agent", "descp": "Gain access to an additional 5 exclusive missions exploring the story of a secret hacking group.

Today, we'd like to share Scroll & Codex, an ancient, leather-bound scroll and scroll case that brings elegance and a touch of the fantastic to your games. Codex transforms into a dice tower with a twist of its base, and Scroll unfurls into a personal rolling tray in moments. With a host of customizable wood, leather, and art options, each Scroll & Codex is crafted to be a unique, timeless relic transported straight out of your game and onto your tabletop.\n    Help us bring Scroll & Codex into the world, and together we'll change dicetiny. We know some of you are thinking about the Holiday season, so scroll down to learn about our Holiday Gift Package. As always, if you have any questions, we are at your disposal.\n   <3, Q&D\n   In dire need of magical vellum? We got you. At every tier, you can choose from an array of options to customize your Scroll. Start by exploring which pledge level has your ideal combination of wood. Then make it your own by choosing your leather and the art on it. Finally, add a new Elderwood feature, the flourish, which decorates the sides of your Scroll and comes in Ocean, Lotus, Flame, or Mountain.\nScribe Reward - Maple on Cherry\nGolden Cherry with Maple accent. Shown: Serpent art in gold foil pressed onto crimson leather with Lotus flourish.\nAcolyte Reward - Walnut on Purpleheart\nRich, regal Purpleheart with a Walnut accent. Shown: Spellcircle art in silver foil pressed onto blue leather with Ocean flourish. Note: not real ocean. We tried. Roommates soggy. Salmon traps unpopular.\nScholar Reward - Maple on Leopardwood\nLeopardwood's eye-catching interwoven grain illuminates the smooth Maple accent. Shown: Winged Dragon art in gold foil pressed onto sandstone leather with Mountain flourish. FACT dragons love mountains.\nArchivist Reward - Any Two Woods\nChoose nearly any combination of wood for either the base or flourish. Shown: Wenge base with Bloodwood accent, Elvish art in ochre foil pressed onto onyx leather with Flame flourish.\n      This Scroll home. Scroll live here now\n   Codex is thunder in your hands, it's a breeze over a mountain spring, it's sunlight in your beard. As with Scroll, start by selecting the reward with your favorite combination of wood. Next, you'll choose your favorite leather and art to go with it. For some tiers, you can go one step further and customize the cap art, too! See the bottom of our Kickstarter to learn more about how Codex works; it's a mobile home for Scroll and it transforms into a dice tower!\nApprentice Reward - Cherry and Maple \nCherry stock with a Maple accent. End-caps are appointed with a Celtic knot pattern. Shown: Adventurer art in ochre foil pressed onto sandstone leather.\nAlchemist Reward - Purpleheart and Walnut\nAn Alchemist is never early, never late, and rarely has eyebrows. Comes in deep Purpleheart with Walnut accent. End-caps are appointed with a Celtic knot pattern. Shown: Spellcircle art in bronze foil pressed onto onyx leather.\n Artificer Reward - Leopardwood and Maple\nLeopardwood with Maple accent. End-caps appointed with a Celtic knot. Shown: Winged Dragon art pressed in gold foil onto sandstone leather.\n Summoner - Any Two Woods\nCrafted in any woods we've got with access to exclusive cap art. Shown (L-R): Purpleheart and Walnut, silver Spellcircle on lapis leather. Cherry and Maple, gold Serpent on crimson leather. Bloodwood and Wenge, ochre Elvish art on onyx leather.\nExclusive Cap Art\nSummoner, Oracle, and Mystic Plus Cap Art tiers come with exclusive cap art (L-R): Serpent, Spellcircle, and Elvish.\n   Foil and Leather Toil Forever Together\n   Customize your adventures with the perfect leather and foil. For each Scroll and each Codex, pick from onyx, sandstone, lapis, or crimson leathers with gold, silver, bronze, ochre, or navy foils. Foil on leather creates a vibrant, classic look made using a 100 year old pressing technique. Help us hit our stretch goals so we can add even more options!\nArt on Leather, Nothing Better\n   Choose from any of our signature art packages at every reward level for each Scroll and each Codex. Every image is etched onto a magnesium die, and then 15 tons of force combined with heat and quick fingers lets you emboss your favorite pattern onto your Scroll & Codex.\nFinish With Flourish\n   Every Scroll comes with your choice of flourish along its sides. Choose a bias-relief style that accentuates your Scroll just so. From mountain peaks to raging oceans, Scroll is quest-ready and adventure-prone. \nWood Is Good\n   If you pledge for Archivist, Summoner, or Oracle rewards, select nearly any combination our wood selection to comprise the base and accent for each Scroll and each Codex. We say \"nearly\" because Wenge sliced flourish-thin turns into a hail of deadly splinters and releases the miasma of ennui. It still looks highly attractive as the base wood for Scroll or Codex, though.\nCap Art Customization\n      Available only when you pledge Summoner, Oracle, or Mystic Plus Cap Art (I & II), detailing the end-caps of your Codex adds a final touch of magic. All other tiers receive complimentary Celtic knot cap art, or the Blank Slate look (your choice!).\n   We're excited about the possibility of growing Scroll & Codex, and if we hit our stretch goals we'll be able to add a bevy of bonuses! As a change of pace, our first two stretch goals are timed, too!\n  Black, green, white, and holographic unleashed!\n  Ivory, Chocolate and Amethyst\n  Signature icons, cap art, & side flourishes coming soon!\n  Including silver, brass, and copper colored scroll corners\n  All scrolls will ship with velvet bags to keep them safe!\n    Enclosed with a custom order form, postage and a return envelope\n    Need a gift for the Holidays? Scroll & Codex are enchanting gifts for the inveterate gamer. They\u2019re personal, delightful, and functional all at once. Although Scroll & Codex won\u2019t be delivered by the Holidays, you can still give the target of your affection the Elderwood Gift Package, which includes a custom order form so we can craft their Scroll & Codex exactly to their specifications. \n   To give the Gift Package, when the Kickstarter campaign wraps up you\u2019ll have the option on your survey to denote you\u2019d like the Gift Package instead a direct order. Your Gift Package will arrive before December 7th if you answer your survey before November 15th. The Gift Package is only available in the U.S. Scroll & Codex delivery wont start until after the Holidays.\n Our Process\n   We dedicate the same patience, care, and tenderness to Scroll & Codex as we do when making gifts for our friends. Because we use living materials there is natural and beautiful variation between each one, making your Scroll & Codex irreproducible and unique.\n   We start by hand-picking lumber at our local yard, then we delicately sand, polish, and finish it until it\u2019s nigh obsidian-smooth under our thumbs. We craft the patterns and parts using laser beams, and then complete assembly by hand to give them just the right mix of precision and art you deserve. Each Scroll & Codex is wed to a natural piece of soft leather, and we use a 100 year old pressing technique to emboss each with foil that gives them the appeal and elegance of old work done well. Foil press contours to the geography of the leather below it to create an organic flow.\n  With Scroll we\u2019ve created a new overlay-style of flourish along its sides using layered wood. We want your rolling tray to travel with you in your mind\u2019s eye as you crit them critters. With Codex we\u2019ve made it possible to appoint runes, art, and patterns on the caps to fulfill the promise of a cylinder barely containing the arcane energies within.\nHow Do Scroll & Codex Work Together?\nUsing Codex as a dice tower\n    When Codex is empty, twist the base to transform it into a dice tower; it's magic (school of transmutation) meets the mechanical, steam punk and high fantasy.\n   Don\u2019t think chucking dice into a tube to watch them come rocketing out is particularly satisfying? Codex isn\u2019t just a dice tower; it\u2019s a giant, pretty, water-sensitive cylinder. What CAN\u2019T you fit in there? Codex can hold:\na rolled up character sheet\n50+ dice\n3.5 lb of confetti\n16 pens, pencils, and markers\nhope and woe\nStoring Scroll inside Codex\n    Naturally, Codex serves as a Scroll case as well. Pop the top and then don't stop... until Scroll is out. Then you can stop. We guess.\nUnroll and set up Scroll\n    Once Scroll is liberated, setup and takedown is easy as falling.\nDimensions and Deets\nSend Us Your Ideas, We're Lonely And It's Cold Here And The Pizza Is Nearly All Gone\n   If at any time during, after, or before the campaign you feel like reaching out to two well-meaning goofs, email us at info@elderwoodacademy.com or Tweet @Elderwoodboxes.\nWho the Flip We Is?\n   We're Quentin and Dan! Quentin is passionate about robotics, education, and gaming. You may also stumble upon some games floating through the ether, such as Happy Salmon, Fast Flip, or Pass the Pandas, co-designed by Quentin and his friend Ken. Dan is the proud owner of a beard which he sunbathes daily. He is a citizen of the Netherlands (not a euphemism), was born deaf (he got better), and smells nice (he's good at smelling).\n   We got our start when Hex Chests went viral-ish and last year we did Spellbooks, which helped us grow into a slightly larger company that still makes Hex Chests and Spellboopies.

Now we finally want to show you what we have accomplished so far and ask for your support so we can start to work on our dream project full-time! \nWith Kickstarter we hope to raise the funds necessary to finish the development of our game while still staying independent and keeping our creative freedom.\nIf you don't know what Kickstarter is: you can buy the different editions of the game and if we reach our goal, the game will be developed and you will receive everything you ordered at the release of the game!\n\nYou can find out more about it here.\nIn Lost Ember you uncover the secrets of a fallen civilization as a wolf that has to find his place in the world. With the ability to control every animal you see, you have everything you need to find your way to Machu Kila - the city that shall answer all the questions that your mysterious companion raises.\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay in Lost Ember focuses on experiencing the world and the story from fascinating perspectives. Each animal you can play offers new possibilities and opportunities for breathtaking moments. Dive into deep waters, fly at lofty heights, dig underground as a mole or even climb steep cliffs with a mountain goat. We want players to move through our world in their own pace without interrupting their gameflow with combat, too hard puzzles or dying in general.\nTHE COMPANION / STORY\nOn your journey you are guided by a companion that used to be part of the old Inrahsi culture and witnessed the fall of his world. As the last soul of the old civilization he wandered the world for an eternity, searching for someone who could help him on his quest. \nHis ability to show you his memories - echoes of the past - lets you relive what he's been through. These memories can be unveiled at different places throughout the world.\nDuring the game, the wolf and his companion form a deep relationship of friendship and trust. \nSWITCH PERSPECTIVES / GAMEPLAY  \nWhile the main character is the wolf, players can possess any other animal they encounter in our world which gives them great mobility. Some of the animals featured in Lost Ember are parrots, fish, moles, eagles, capybaras, mountain goats, buffalos and more. Additional animals are planned as part of some of our stretch goals.\nThese animals inhabit different areas in our world and while some occur in various scenarios, others may only populate a specific region. On their way to Machu Kila, the wolf and his companion cross through a lot of distinct areas with their own flora and fauna.\nLost Ember will be available for XBox One, PC and Playstation 4. If you buy the game here at kickstarter, you will be able to choose your preferred platform at release. \nWe plan to bring the PC version to Steam and GOG.com. Vote for us in our Greenlight campaign to get Lost Ember to Steam!\nPowered by Unreal Engine 4\nYes, Lost Ember will be playable in VR! We already tested it with HTC Vive and Oculus Rift and let me tell you: it's awesome! We don't consider Lost Ember a \"VR game\", however, and still concentrate on the game itself and not the VR part. But if you have a VR headset at home, you will be able to switch on the VR mode at any given time and dive even deeper into our world. Whether we'll be able to bring Lost Ember to Playstation VR is still unsure.\nCraig Connor (former Music Director at Rockstar North) and Will Morton (former Senior Audio Designer and Dialogue Supervisor at Rockstar North) from Solid Audioworks produce all music and sound for Lost Ember! With a combined experience of over 30 years in the games industry working on games like GTA I-V, Red Dead Redemption, L.A. Noire and more, they bring a ton of expertise and talent to the team. You can find out more about them at their homepage www.solidaudioworks.com.\nWe founded Mooneye Studios about 2 years ago after meeting in a game development masters program in university. We all worked in the games and media industry for several years and together as a team on some smaller projects. Soon we realized that we work extremely well together and since none of us wanted to work in a big company with huge hierarchies and no real creative freedom anymore, we took an a bit risky step and quit our jobs to start our own indie studio.\nAnd that's us! :) From left to right we are:\nPascal M\u00fcller - Programming - @RichAndBit\nTobias Graff - Programming - @tobiasgrf\nFlorens Huhn - Narrative Designer - @FlorensWho\nMatthias Oberprieler- 3D Artist - @MOberprieler\nMaximilian Jasionowski- Art Direction - @M_Jasionowski\nTo make supporting our campaign as rewarding to you as possible, we thought of a bunch of really cool stuff that you can get in our reward tiers! The individual items are illustrated below:\nWell, this one is pretty self-explanatory: you will get the game as soon as it's released for either PC, XBox One or PS4.\nYou will be mentioned in Lost Ember's credits!\nIncludes the digital copy of the game and your name in our credits\nThe soundtrack for Lost Ember featuring music and sound by Craig Conner, Music Director for the entire GTA series and more, and Will Morton, former Dialogue Supervisor & Senior Sound Designer at Rockstar North.\nChoose between 3 extra skins for your main character. Extra skins are only available during the kickstarter! After that, there won't be any option to change skins in the game.\nYou will get the PDF version of our artbook with a lot of concept art from the very early days up until the final product. We will explain some of our design decisions and try to give you an in-depth look behind the scenes of the development.\nWe will design a high-resolution wallpaper exclusively available to kickstarter backers!\nA digital map of the game world with an overview over all the different areas from the wide grasslands to the decayed city of Machu Kila.\nIncludes Digital Game Edition with everything above\nGet our printed hardcover artbook to browse through the pages and always have it at hand in your bookshelf.\nIncludes Digital Plus Edition and the physical artbook\nLooking for that extravagant touch? Get our soundtrack on a 12\u2033 Vinyl-LP! You will also have the option to choose a CD version of the soundtrack, if you don't have a way of playing a vinyl LP.\nYou will get access to the closed beta version of Lost Ember and help us to improve the game!\nRevisit the places you found in-game and follow your path to Machu Kila on a poster of our game world! \nYour chance to actually be in the game! Find your name on a memorial plate for fallen heroes, that is discoverable by all players and even holds a memory to uncover.\nA few very rare legendary animals inhabit our world. While all players can find and possess some of these legendary animals, you will be able to find 3 additional animals that are kickstarter-exclusive!\n6 additional deluxe wolf skins that are only available on kickstarter and let your wolf shine in a new light!\nIncludes Physical Artbook Edition with everything above\nThe Limited Boxed Edition of Lost Ember contains a key for the digital download of the game in an kickstarter-exclusive case with the soundtrack on CD, as well 3 postcards printed on high quality paper.\nA handmade statue of Lost Ember's main character, crafted by the incredibly talented Isabel from www.allerleiunfug.de! This statue will be cast in resin, very high quality and roughly 18cm (7 inches) high.\n  A DIN A2 (that's 420 x 594 mm or 16.5 x 23.4 inches) poster of this amazing artwork.\nAdditionally to the regular poster, you will get one that is signed by the whole team!\nBe one of the firsts to get your hands on Lost Ember with our alpha access key! Make Lost Ember an even better game by giving us your feedback and ideas.\nIncludes Explorer Edition with everything above\nYou will get 2 tickets to Lost Ember's release party at the release of the game! We will celebrate with an amazing party in our hometown Hamburg in Germany. \nYour travel costs are not included in this package.\nThe old Inrahsi emperors were buried in the tombs of Machu Kila. Massive statues still remind their descendants of their grandiosity. You can become one of them! You will be immortalized as one of the statues that we will design with you after your image. The tomb will be discoverable by all players and even be a part of our story.\nYou will get a premium mention in our credits to let the world know that you were a huge help in finishing our game!\nIncludes Physical Gold Edition with everything above\nAnd, because it's not long until Christmas, we thought of a little something to give to all our backers! We will send all of you a PDF with 11 different cards to print at home! So if you think about getting Lost Ember or some of the rewards as a present for your loved ones, you now have the perfect card for it :)\nWe've planned much more for Lost Ember than we have shown you here! In case we exceed our goal of ~$110,000 (100.000\u20ac) we can include even more awesome features. These are the first stretch goals we have planned:\n       Aside from our regular stretch goals, we planned a few social stretch goals through which you can decide which animals will be added to the game on top of the current 9! Participate at www.lostember.com/animals!\n                     Kickstarter helps us secure funding for the development of Lost Ember while retaining full creative control. \"Creative control\", you ask? That means we can continue developing freely and independently without interference from the outside. \nNow I'm gonna be honest here: with our target goal of $110,000 (100,000\u20ac) we still would need some additional funding from publishers or alike. However, the money would get us to a first, full alpha version of the game. It is the minimal budget that brings us to a point where we feel comfortable enough to talk to publishers about deadlines and all the features that we want in our game. \nWe're certain to be able to get that last chunk of money to finish Lost Ember, as we are already talking to several publishers who all are extremely interested in our game. So Lost Ember will be finished with just $110,000 (100,000\u20ac) from Kickstarter. But to get to a point where we could finish the game with full creative freedom we would need about $390,000 (350.000\u20ac). With that we could truly make Lost Ember everything we want it to be. \nNow maybe some of you ask themselves, for what we need that much money. Well, one big reason is that we not only have to pay us and our office space, but also taxes, payment providers, and Kickstarter, who take 5% of the raised money. We made this little pie chart to visualize this for you.\nBecause we are a small independent team without a huge marketing budget, we thought of a little something special to spread the word about Lost Ember and our kickstarter campaign: During our campaign we will visit different youtubers, press and other indie developers in a camper van we got from Tobias' mother and uncle and play a pre-alpha demo of Lost Ember with them! \nWe want to show you how the current game looks and feels to give you a better idea of where it is heading. To make that a little more fun for you, we will make videos of the whole thing and upload them as often as we can to our youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/c/mooneyestudios.\nSo make sure to support the campaign to get notifications whenever we release a new video! :) You will be able to follow us and check out where we are constantly on a GPS map at our website at lostember.com/tour and, if we are anywhere near you, feel free to drop us a line and if possible, maybe we can arrange a meet-up and show you our demo in person!\nSPECIAL THANKS\nWe thank Jacob Pavek for prividing the Song \"Illume\" for our Kickstarter Video.

And of course there is always the possibility that we don't get that. But with as many interested parties as we are already talking to at the moment and a successful kickstarter campaign in our bags, the likelihood of this is pretty low. And even if it happens, we can always go back to doing contract works or side-jobs as we do at the moment. That would of course increase the development time, especially if we get significantly less than $390,000 (350.000\u20ac), but we can definitely promise you that we'll do our best so that Lost Ember will see the light of day as soon and as magnificently as possible!\n\nAnother risk of the development is the release date, of course. We hope to be able to bring Lost Ember to you in early 2018, but there are always unforeseen factors that can delay the release of a game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Special thanks!", "descp": "Thank you for your support!

Possible choices are for example a biologist, a mechanic and a deck-hand. Each character has different skills that you should make good use of.\nOther than in most survival games, the goal is not simply to survive as long as possible, but to find a rescue and leave the island. \n            Your tasks in the game:\nEnsure their survival. Fullfil the needs of the four characters; they get hungry and thirsty, have to sleep and watch out for overheating. Make sure that they stay healthy and well taken care of or you risk their death.\n Find a rescue. The overall goal of the game is to find a rescue. Throughout the game you will face many different tasks that bring you closer to a possible rescue. It might help to climb to the top of the mountain at the center of the island and build a fire there. But maybe it is better to try to repair the broken radio system?\nExplore the island. Use the islands resources to keep your characters alive. But careful: Not every plant is edible, not every path is save to pass, and not every cute looking animal is harmless...\nCraft items. Produce useful items with the resources that your characters collect. For example you can use a sharpened wood stake and some bamboo to build an animal trap that helps you with your hunting efforts.\nExpand your camp. With natural resources and produced items you can build up your camp and with that make life easier for your characters. With a few palm leaves and sturdy wood posts you can build a shelter that stays dry in the rain.\nPut your characters' skills to their best use. Use your characters\u2019 skills to achieve your goals. For example: don't use your doctor to build your camp, let the ship mechanic take on that task... \n     In \"Thousand Miles Out\" we want to simulate the fight for survival as realistic as possible without losing the fun in the gameplay. If something would not work in a real survival situation, it will also not work in the game. We call it: true wilderness survival.  \n A situation that is merely uncomfortable in the safety of civilization, can be life threatening in the wild. Nature does not show pity and does not forgive mistakes. The battle for survival in Thousand Miles Out feels just like that. Example: If one of the characters gets sick, then he really is sick. It will not only be noticeable by a changed status bar, the character will actually have to rest and recover in bed. And if it is a serious disease, he will have to be looked after by someone. \nThe group of characters you can control is stranded on a deserted island. Other than in most survival games, the goal is not simply to survive as long as possible, but to find a rescue and leave the island. There will be many different ways to this goal in the game. For example: The characters can try to repair the ship\u2019s radio unit, build a raft, or climb a high mountain and light a fire.\n  J. Todd Coleman, Founder of ArtCraft Entertainment and Creative Director of the most anticipated MMO, Crowfall ( http://www.crowfall.com ), loves our concept and was so kind to say a few words about Thousand Miles Out: \nPLAY\n\n   After a long and exhausting journey the research ship was travelling somewhere in the Pacific, on its way back to it's home harbour. The crew and the scientists on board were very much looking forward to seeing their friends and family again after many months at sea, and to finally have steady ground under their feet again. Home was still a thousand miles out when, without warning, the storm hit. The sky turned black in minutes, heavy rain set in and roaring winds swept over the deck.\nA lightning strike destroyed all electrical systems on board, including the rudders and the radio unit. Without navigational control nor any way to call for help, the ship went adrift in the Pacific. When the sky cleared up again, an island became visible on the horizon, a small spark of hope.\nA few miles from shore the ship ran aground, but it was possible to use the life boats and bring the crew and enough supplies onto dry land. At this point the worst seemed to be over... until a second storm formed and hit the survivors completely unprepared. Many lives were lost, as were the supplies. The initial believe that survival on a tropical island would be easy was quickly and brutally shattered.... \nIn \"Thousand Miles Out\" you control your characters with the help of point & click actions over isometric maps. The navigation can be compared to old isometric RPGs like Baldurs Gate. A good, more current example is Wasteland 2. This means that you can select one or more characters, click anywhere on the map on the ground and your characters will automatically move there. \n Interactions with usable items work similarly, one click for example on the palm and your character will start chopping it down.\nThe isometric maps are connected by an overview map and represent different regions of the island. The regions have to be discovered one by one. At the beginning only the beach map is known on which you can find the character's camp. This camp has been created by the characters at the beginning of the game and you can build it up over time.\nWhen the characters want to leave the beach map, they have to reach the edge of the map. If they reach the eastern edge of the map, they will discover the rain forest that is located east of the beach. If they reach the northern edge, they will find the coastal cliffs. This way you will over time discover the complete island. With each new map your characters might also locate new resources and locations that are needed to complete quests.    \nExpeditions to other areas are always done with just one or two characters, while the other characters remain at the camp. The characters that you send on their missions are controlled manually, while you can assign automatic tasks to the characters in the camp. Those can be tasks like \"Gut all fishes that are caught and cook them\" or \"Build a large bamboo hut\". You can of course control your characters at camp manually as well if needed.  \n All characters have a limited inventory, so that the characters have to return from their expeditions with full pockets at some point. In their inventory your characters also have the items that they need to fulfil their needs. This way the characters can, within their means, also take care of their needs automatically. If a character gets thirsty and has water in his inventory, he will drink it automatically. You can disable this automation of your characters at any time.   \n\"Thousand Miles Out\" is being developed by northworks Software GmbH, a small studio in wonderful Hamburg, Germany's second largest city. We have over ten years experience in the development of games on different platforms, from browser to mobile. In 2010 we became a daughter of the Travian Games GmbH.\nCurrently there are only three people consistently working on the conception and the development of \"Thousand Miles Out\". Given the kickstarter campaign is successful, the team size will be increased significantly.\nRay; Vision and Concept\nRay had the basic idea for \"Thousand Miles Out\" and pushes it forward. This starts with the game design and includes all project and business topics as well as the planning of the kickstarter campaign. Ray has been working in the game industry for over 10 years and started as back-end developer (PHP, MySQL ...). Outside of work he loves TV-shows and has made it his goal to spoil them as best possible for the rest of the team.\nDenis; Technical and Programming\nDenis is our Unity expert and with incredible speed he has transformed the concept ideas into prototype code. He has been a professional developer for 6 years and can code not only Unity, but also Flash in his sleep. He is an avid gamer and is continually expanding his steam library.\nMartin; Graphics and Visual design\nMartin is responsible for the look of \"Thousand Miles Out\", where he currently performs all aspects from concept design to the 3D assets autonomously. He has been a professional graphic artist for 8 years. He likes oldschool rap and provides entertainment to the whole office. \nnorthworks and Travian have been developing games successfully for more than 10 years. Until now we have mostly developed multi player games for browser and mobile devices. With \"Thousand Miles Out\" we now want to try something new; A single player game with an extensive 3D world for PC and Mac.\nWe could start right now to develop the game behind closed doors, publish it in a year and hope that you like it. We have decided against this kind of development however because we believe that \"Thousand Miles Out\" can only turn out really great, if it comes into contact with the players that will ultimately play it as early as possible (that means you!). For us, kickstarter is the perfect platform to make it possible. Our reasons to choose kickstarter were the following:\n1. We want to find out if you like the concept of \"Thousand Miles Out\" as much as we do.\n2. We want to build a community around the game, so we can influence the direction the game is going together.\nIf we reach our target amount, we know that what we are doing is going in the right direction. Of course Travian and northworks are taking on a big part of the financing of the game as well. If the kickstarter is successful, we will invest at least the same amount of money in the game ourself. \nThis means you can be sure that with a successful financing on kickstarter the game will be developed all the way until it is done. \nIn preparation for the kickstarter campaign we have built a prototype in Unity that has helped us find technical problems as well as problems with the game design early on. This prototype makes a great impression already. The characters are already walking around the island (even if only on one map for now) and all rudimentary systems have been implemented. We have established a workflow that allows us to produce and implement assets quickly and efficiently. We are using a range of pre-existing systems from the Unity asset store (Speedtree, Gaia, Unistorm, ...) that greatly simplify the development. This means that this prototype already shows us that we have the technical capabilities to build the game and we already have a basic idea how long we will need for the development..\nIf we are successful with our financing though kickstarter, we will use the target amount together with our own investment to build a team of about 10 people that will put all their effort over the next year into the development of \"Thousand Miles Out\". Once we feel that the game is ready, we will publish it using the Steam Early Access program, so that you get into it as quickly as possible to give us your feedback. Those of you that have chosen the reward tiers Alpha Access or Closed Beta Access will of course get to try out the game much earlier.\nIf everything goes according to plan, \"Thousand Miles Out\" should be completed by January 2018, so that we can leave the early access phase then.  \n          Backers that already play one of our games receive a special bonus for their loyalty:\nIf you back us with 20 Euros or more you receive a bonus for a game of your choice (goalunited LEGENDS, goalunited PRO, Travian Legends or Rail Nation). \nPlease note that the campaign has to be sucessful before you can get your bonus!\nThe bonuses are as follows:\nYou receive the \"Thousand Miles Out\" decoration building\n This unique building does not only enhance the look of your stadium complex, it also gives you seven points reputation. It is only available to kickstarter backers, and will not be available to other managers. The jealousy is a given!\n  We will give you a voucher valued at 100 gold.  \n With gold you have many options to give your account a special extra. Get more resources, build your village faster or use the advantages of Travian Plus.\n We will give you a Rail Nation starter package and 200 gold .\nThe Rail Nation starter package gives you a big advantage from the start. Benefit of extra waggons and enlarged buildings. Use your free gold to get a super realistic engine, fast research and many more.\nCondition for all bonuses:\nYour pledge has to be 20 Euros or more\nThe kickstarter campaign has to be successful\nYou receive the bonus in one of our games (not in all :))\nThe bonuses will be distributed the earliest on November 10th \nOnce the kickstarter campaign is successful we will message you to find out if you would like a bonus. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn the past we have already brought a few titles from the first idea to release and know that the development process of any game includes a number of small and big road bumps.\n\nThis can for example include technical problems like systems that don't function as expected, or design elements that are particularly hard to implement. There are also general project risks like an employee leaving the company or processes that take longer than planned.\n\nParticularly for \"Thousand Miles Out\" it can of course also happen that we are not able to realize the \"true wilderness survival\"-part as well as we want.\n\nAll those risks lead to those two effects:\n\n1. it takes longer to develop the project,\n2. the development of the project costs more than expected\n\nAs already mentioned in the \"why kickstarter\" chapter, Northworks and Travian will, within their means, cover additional costs, shall they arise. \n\nIn regards a delay in the project development we can only say that we have added a relatively large buffer in our planning and hope that we don't have to use it up.\n\nWe are confident that we have gathered enough experience in the 10 years that we have been working on the development of games to be able to solve all arising problems and are excited to see the challenges that this project will provide.\nLearn

You can sign up for our mailing list if you want to be notified of major new projects from Arcen in general.  We expect to re-launch the project, in a revised and slimmed-down form, about one week from today.\nNow back to the original message:\nAI War 2 is the sequel to 2009's AI War Fleet Command. Like the original, AI War 2 is a real-time strategy game with elements of tower defense and grand strategy that pits you against a smart and deadly AI.\nAlso like the original, AI War 2 is an asymmetric game. The AI does not play by your rules: it is much more powerful than you, has no supplies you can disrupt, and its resources are literally infinite. Your successes strengthen the AI's focus on you, requiring you to balance immediate needs against long term costs.\nWe\u2019ve made a massive 160+ page design document, because we feel it\u2019s important for backers to know exactly what they\u2019re getting. The big barriers to entry with the first game were an incredibly-steep learning curve, a clunky interface, and outdated graphics.  Those are the first things we\u2019ve addressed,  but we're also bringing a lot of other new things to the table for people who already loved the first game.\nNow we need your help to fund the game. [Here's the plan for if we don't.]\n Quick bits:\nWe did a massive reddit AMA -- more than 50 pages of responses, good grief!\nChris returned to Three Moves Ahead for the third time, this time in Episode 372.  It's more industry-focused than we meant it to be.\nChris returned to the Quarter to Three podcast with Tom Chick, where they focused on the gameplay as well as Chris's earlier inspirations.\nWe really need your help spreading the word, no joke.\nA (much) lesser way of helping out is via our Headtalker campaign, which is still a big deal and is even easier.\nWe collected a lot of fun and awesome story snippets about the AI from the first game.\nWe also collected some of the best After Action Reports people wrote for the first game.\nChat with us and other backers on our Discord server?\nWe intended to make AI War 2 a straightforward sequel. New graphics, port the gameplay, trim some fat, and iterate from there after 1.0. Then we had an idea. And then another. Then we asked our amazing fan community for their ideas, and now we have a design document longer than some novels. AI War 2 will be complete when we have implemented every mechanic in the document, preferably exactly as described. Some highlights include:\nKeeping the best parts of AI War Classic: the focus on strategy over tactics, the ability to granularly customize your campaign, massive space battles, and an AI that can surprise you.\nOver one hundred types of ships ranging from fighters to capital ships to massive superweapons.\nExpanding the AI's toolbox of tricks and strategies -- the AI will recapture lost ground and press the advantage when your losses mount up.\nLetting you decide your army\u2019s strengths and capabilities via a new Science system.\nExpanding battlefields from individual single planets to entire solar systems.\nReplacing the original game\u2019s ship triangle with more nuanced categories.\nLetting you play as humans, the incredibly powerful Spire, or the long dead but mysteriously revived Zenith. Wait, what?\nYes you read that right. Our biggest, most exciting new feature in AI War 2 is selectable player factions, based on the aliens from AI War Classic's 1st and 3rd expansions. Both newcomers have unique units and skills that set them apart from humanity and one another, and unique relationships with the other factions in the galaxy including the AI.\n        AI War 2 is an opportunity to rectify the first game's biggest flaw: usability. More than half a decade of work went into Classic and it shows. There are so many mechanics to the game that even veteran players spend game time parsing through tooltips. Sub-screens are densely packed and poorly marked. Presentation-wise AI War Classic is utilitarian at best, cluttered at worst.\nCleaning the mechanics up for AI War 2 was a joint project between us and our community, who helped by identifying too-similar mechanics for merger, and time sinks ripe for elimination.\n  Take the proposed UI changes. Tooltips are now much shorter but can be locked in place. Mouse over a locked tooltip and another tooltip pops out! By folding less immediately relevant information under information that is more relevant, we can clear up screen space and still provide you with the information you need.\nOur efficiency improvements aren\u2019t limited to the interface -- we dissected and rebuilt unit control, resource generation, building structures and defenses, connecting to multiplayer sessions and empire management, looking for ways to ensure players spend less time fiddling and more time commanding fleets.\n  Thanks to fixing up the above usability issues, AI War 2 is well placed to deal with Classic\u2019s second major issue: the killer learning curve. AI War is meant to be a hard but fair game, and the start menu should not be enough to defeat new players.\nWe\u2019re coming at the problem from a few different angles. The usability changes will help smooth the difficulty curve once they\u2019re in-game, as will the improved ship classification system. We\u2019re going to include quickstart options in AIW2 so players can jump into the game without fiddling with settings. Veteran players should enjoy these preset games as well.\nOne thing we will not be doing is dumbing the game down. We shudder at the very thought and it isn\u2019t necessary.\nThe most immediately apparent change between Classic and this sequel is the move from sprites to 3D. By moving to 3D we're able to better use the capabilities of even lower-end video cards to provide clearer, crisper, more scalable resolution-independent graphics. We're pushing more geometry, which your GPU is awesome at handling, instead of relying on lots of 2D textures, which your GPU can handle but not so well. This helps with everything from immersion, to a sense of scale, to performance. Yes, really!\n    Originally AI War's story was confined to its opening crawl: the AI rose up, ending an 800 year long human civil war and nearly driving humanity to extinction, before turning their attention to other matters. The expansion packs added aliens, lore and a story campaign (Fallen Spire), as well as a few alternate ways to win the AI War. But questions remain about the AI\u2019s goals and motivation, and about the recent and ancient history of the setting.\nWe're excited to finally start answering these questions, some of which have gone unanswered since 2009. We are also preparing to link AI War up with other Arcen titles. This will be the first time many of the connections will be laid out or explained!\nDuring your fight against the AI you\u2019ll discover floating derelicts that provide you with material for the war effort and occasionally lore about the setting. The playable factions each have their own perspective on the war and the AI, while minor factions have their own stories to share. Your discoveries will be kept in a logbook that persists across campaigns so you can peruse it at your leisure.\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there: all new factions, entities and mysteries are showing up in the Milky Way Galaxy. How they\u2019ll affect you and the ongoing war has yet to be revealed.\nWe are pleased to announce that AI War 2 will be open and easy to modify, while still maintaining sim-concurrence. Players will be able to modify ships and structures, the design of AI personalities, and create tutorials, scenarios, and vignettes of their own. The design document has a long (LONG) list of modifiable components that we identified before we even started making the game. \nArcen (that\u2019s Ar-KEN) Games started in 2009 with a lone programmer on a mission (Hi everyone! - Chris). Most real time strategy games at the time lacked artificial intelligence worthy of the name. Once you understood how the AI worked, the challenge, and most of the fun, disappeared.  So Chris decided to make his own. \nIt would promote strategy over tactics, reward players for experimenting, and constantly surprise them. The game needed to be fun for Chris even if he knew the game backwards and forwards.\nThrough his sister he found a composer (Hi Pablo!) and the pair released AI War through their website in 2009 before expanding to the usual digital distribution platforms. AI War was one of the first titles in the \u201cmodern wave\u201d of indies.\nSeven years, ten games, ten expansions to those games, and hundreds of patches to those games later Arcen Games is a proud independent game studio with fans all over the world.\nFrom its origins as a one man product, AI War Classic morphed into a community driven cult classic. Critical praise for the original is glowing, as our website can attest. Some highlights include:\n\"It\u2019s a Sins of the Solar Empire meets Supreme Commander meets Simply Nothing Else, and I think a lot of you will find this very intriguing.\" \u2013 Kieron Gillen, Rock Paper Shotgun August 2009\n\"...I\u2019ll be surprised if anyone else twists the RTS formula this dramatically and this effectively. And I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll be the Next Big Thing, because it\u2019s big, different, entirely unprecedented and an exciting way to play an RTS.\" \u2013 Tom Chick, Crispy Gamer, August 2009\n\"...as much heart and soul as Dune 2, Total Annihilation, Homeworld, Galactic Civilizations and Desktop Tower Defense rolled into one.\" - Alec Meer, PC Gamer October 2009\nThese 2009 reviews all predate AI War's first expansion pack, and all the updates since then. It's on the strength of those updates that AI War Classic made Rock Paper Shotgun's list of the best strategy games of all time.\nThe icing on the cake is that Classic still reaches new fans every day!\nSmall problem: we've made games since AI War Classic that taught us some really cool tricks, but we can't bring those lessons back into Classic. Keith LaMothe -- the lead programmer for AI War since 2013 or so -- described AI War's code as \"...a lot like a lumber mill built by two guys with nearly 0% concern for safety. 5-foot-radius sawblades spinning at maximum speed hanging from minimum-strength supports in the middle of an empty room with no safety shields and raw wood being thrown at them by various devices. You could call it 'efficient', you could call it 'horrifying'.\"\nThis was three years ago and the problem's gotten worse since then (if it helps, imagine the mill is now on fire). At this point there\u2019s no way to to implement all the tasty technical things we want to in the old engine. It\u2019s time to start anew.\nHere's the trailer for version 8.0 of AI War Classic: \nAnd if you think the design document for AI War II (this project) is long, then you should see the incredible insanity that are the release notes for the original AI War.\nKeith's been prepping for AI War 2 since 2015. He's built a new lumber mill so efficient at multi-threading it can just about travel through time. He's also responsible for ensuring the game will be moddable, something that just isn\u2019t possible in AI War Classic\u2019s code\nChris has come a long way since the days we coded everything to DirectX. Several years ago we ported AI War Classic to Unity, and at the time the only part of Unity 3D we had use for was the cross-platform shader pipeline. Since 2013, Chris has expanded outward into increasingly advanced Unity tricks and the 3D graphics pipeline. The recently-released Unity 5.4 build adds even more tools we needed.\n  We plan to stick to our design document until 1.0. That means that any stretch goals that happen (thanks ahead of time if we get there!) will not impact the schedule we laid out above... even though we already have a few ideas on how to make the game bigger and better. Every theoretical stretch goal will have its own budget and schedule\nWhat might those be? We'll talk about them should we pass our initial funding goals. In the meantime please see the \u201cNot For 1.0\u201d Limbo section of the design document. It talks about some of the things we wanted to do in the first build but wound up out of scope -- great material for stretch content.\nBut that\u2019s for the future. Right now we're focused on reaching our initial funding goals.\n    (Please excuse our dust!  We're currently updating this section.)\nDesign and name an AI personality: Please see the design document for an explanation of AI personalities and their traits. You can go as nuts as you like with the settings you choose for the traits, and we\u2019ll include it in the game. That said, be warned that we will put exceedingly hard or easy ones into relevant categories denoting them as such, which may make them not show up in most people\u2019s games. If you would like for us to keep them in the \u201cgeneral pool\u201d that is within a standard deviation of balance, we\u2019ll be happy to do that for you. Please keep the name of the AI thematic and clear as to what the AI actually acts like, but we\u2019ll include a special note that says it was created by you (your name or handle).\nName a satellite human faction: Backers at the Mark V/Mysterious Human and above may name one of AI War 2\u2019s new \u201csatellite factions\u201d. Satellite factions have no presence in your part of the galaxy but nevertheless play a vital role in the war: AI bait. Discover this faction\u2019s location and the AI will send forces to investigate, reducing the heat on you. Satellite factions may show up in other contexts as well. Stay tuned!\nWrite a Player-triggerable taunt: To be voiced by the awesome Ben McAuley, who you can hear in the kickstarter trailer. No profanity, and this is subject to approval, but you don\u2019t have to keep with the lore of the game. No copyright infringement on other franchises, but quotes and parodies are fine. The design document explains them in more detail.\nName a satellite alien faction: As above, but with aliens. We separated these out because aliens are much more entertaining. Should you prefer to name a human faction instead, just let us know.\nDesign a minor faction's lore: Returning from AI War Classic, minor factions represent human, Zenith, Neinzul and Spire factors in the war (and active in the galaxy) that aren\u2019t the player. Backers at the Neinzul/Faction Scribe level get to develop the lore for one of these groups. Working with our loremaster and other Arcen staff, you may choose to expand a planned minor faction or design one yourself.\nIMPORTANT, PLEASE READ: Designing a minor faction\u2019s lore does not mean you are designing their mechanics. Please be thematic and appropriate when you develop your faction.\nNEW REWARD! One copy of Stars Beyond Reach: By popular request!  We hope to one day finish this game -- we've invested almost half a million dollars into R&D on it, after all -- but can in no way guarantee that.  We have no immediate plans to resume work on it.  However, a lot of our testers greatly enjoyed various iterations of it.  In Steam (this is only via Steam), there are various beta builds you can choose from: 0.771 is a super old one from April 15, 2015.  0.840 is the last multi-city build, from May 22.  0.854 is the last build before the \"industrial and commercial overhaul,\" from May 28.  0.877 is the last version with districts, from June 8th.  The default build is 0.918, with territories.  There is a \"limitedbeta\" version that is for internal use only, and this reward does not grant access to that.\nDesign custom space station: Collaborating with Blue, Neinzul/Station Architect backers will design a custom space station for the minor faction of their choice. The nature of your collaboration will depend on how much of a direct role you want in the art design, within the boundaries of the game\u2019s artstyle and technical limitations.\nWrite an AI taunt: To be voiced by the awesome Ben McAuley, who you can hear in the kickstarter trailer. He\u2019ll be done up nice and evil and robotic, rather like you can hear Chris Park in the AI War 8.0 trailer, although with more clarity. No profanity, and this is subject to approval in terms of broadly fitting with the lore of the game, but we hope you have some fun with it. Chris will work with you to make sure that we\u2019re able to use your taunt in the best possible trigger points, although be aware that because of the dynamic nature of the game there\u2019s a limit on how tightly we can control that. We\u2019ll also work with you on wording if there\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t quite flow right in Ben\u2019s accent, while trying to keep as close to your original as possible.\nDesign an alien artifact: The design document explains alien artifacts.  Work with Blue to pick out a theme for their structures, and with Jack to write a short lore piece explaining one thing about the artifact.\nDesign a rare alien artifact: Same as the above, except even more awesome. Rare artifacts are something game-changing indeed. Note that they will need to pass muster balance-wise, and use existing tech mechanics.\nDesign a mystery faction's lore: A number of satellite factions will receive further lore development. Backers at the Zenith/Fleet Engineer level and above will get to choose a faction to develop themselves. You may choose to expand your own satellite faction, or with permission, that of another backer. We will coordinate with you as needed.\nDesign custom fleet ship: Collaborating with with Blue and Chris, you will design a fleetship, artistically and mechanically. While new mechanics are out of scope, Fleet Engineers will be decide what abilities their ship has and what its combat role is. Especially powerful craft could turn into prizes given for dealing with minor factions or elite AI ships. Ships that break the difficulty curve entirely will not be allowed in the regular game\u2026 but if you really want, it might become a \u201ccheat ship\u201d.\nLearn the AI's secret: Why did the AI turn on mankind? Why did it fail to destroy humanity when it had the chance? And why did the AI leave itself vulnerable during the First AI War? The answers remain secrets, one that we\u2019re preparing now to reveal to the AI War superfans at the Spire tiers. If you want to know, then please keep it to yourself! If you\u2019d prefer not to know, we\u2019ll happily keep this secret a while longer. Still, one cool turn deserves another, and this is the coolest thing we could think to do.\nDesign new canon alien race: Working with Chris, you\u2019ll come up with the 4th and 5th alien species in the Arcenverse\u2019s Milky Way. Your race may be newcomers to the galactic stage in 1.0, but they will go on to join the Zenith, Spire, and Neinzul in future AI War & Arcenverse media. We\u2019ll do our best to accommodate your ideas for your creation\u2019s characteristics, history and name, but may veto or change elements to better mesh with our setting.\nHelp create a music track: For the music loving superfan: you will work with Pablo Vega to develop an all new song for AI War 2\u2019s soundtrack! The nature of the collaboration depends on you. If you are musically inclined we invite you to contribute a tune you\u2019d like to see worked into a larger piece. Otherwise, please suggest a genre you think meshes with AI War\u2019s soundtrack, or a tone or mood you\u2019d like to evoke, or\u2026 something. It\u2019s up to you!\nThis will be added to the 1.0 soundtrack, so you\u2019re actually making the soundtrack bigger by choosing this tier.\nSkyward Collapse Source Code: For the aspiring indie developer, or the Arcen (or Skyward Collapse) superfan.  You'll get full access to the code for Skyward Collapse, with the ability to inspect, modify, compile, and use it as you desire.  This will be under an NDA that prevents you from sharing the code with parties outside your team, but you can make commercial works based on it.  Please note that this code is completely programmer-oriented and not for anyone who wants to work in a visual editor.  Please message us for any questions you have before selecting this reward.\nThis pie chart shows how we\u2019ll be spending the money from this Kickstarter if we hit our initial funding goal and nothing more. The amount of money budgeted for design and simulation work is lower than one might expect. We've spent our own money on design and programming in advance of this Kickstarter. That money is not included in this budget and will not be reimbursed by the funds we raise here.\nStretch goals are not covered in the general budget. They will have their own budgets, with costs divided between the cost of fulfillment and Kickstarter's take. Example: a music stretch goal would be about 88% music cost and 12% kickstarter cost.\nOne last note about the budget: the time it takes to make each part of a game is unequal. Design and art get done before programming, which gets done before balance and QA. In this budget, Chris and Blue will only work full-time on AI War 2 until the design work and art assets are done, after which they will move to another Arcen project. Funds from the AI War 2 Kickstarter will not be used to fund their activity on other projects.\nThis changes if we hit a dozen stretch goals or if the game sells extraordinarily well in Early Access/after release. In either case Chris and Blue will move back to full-time work on AI War 2's post-release content, and will draw pay from the new funds. Our hope is that we'll get to keep the whole team together making AI War 2 for a long time to come!\nThe design document is huge, and the below charts don\u2019t remotely cover every feature in detail. However, they do give a pretty good overview of the status as of the start of the kickstarter.  Further updates can't be reflected here, but you'll be able to see that on our site and in update messages.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThanks for reading this far! In exchange we\u2019ll let you in on a secret: the biggest threat to AI War 2 is this Kickstarter failing. Arcen has spent over seven years making AI War Classic. We\u2019ve patched it, improved it and expanded on it enough that, short of the AI rising up and destroying humanity, if we get our funding we can all but guarantee we'll release AI War 2.\n\nThat said, things change during development. Ideas can need more time, or not work at all. Miss a milestone and the game gets delayed. Programming challenges could push features intended for 1.0 into the post-release period. And this is before getting into acts of god and personal tragedies.\n\nAI War II is set to avoid issues common to Kickstarted videogame projects. Our finished design document is huge and hugely specific, we've never had a game planned out in as much detail as AI War 2 is in every area. The funding we need for the project has been carefully considered, and we're being utterly ruthless with the scope of the 1.0 build.\n\nWe have two more secret weapons: AI War Classic and our community. Almost everything in AI War 2 has an equivalent in AI War Classic. If we run into issues implementing a feature we can look back to the original version. For everything past that point, we rely on our fans, always a source of ideas and creative solutions to problems. We have a reputation for speaking with our fans and listening to them in return. You\u2019ll know what we\u2019re doing, what our challenges are, and what we\u2019re doing to overcome them. We\u2019ll go into excruciating detail (after telling you to expect \"a brief update\" or \"a quick video,\"), just like always. It\u2019ll be great.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Chris McElligott Park/Arcen Games\n2 created \u00b7 26 backed\nSmall indie studio founded in 2009 by Chris Park.

Catalysts, Explorers & Secret Keepers will be 50 pages longer, and all contributors of original work will receive extra pay!\n\nAs promised, our call for submissions is now open! Learn more about what we're looking for and our submission guidelines here!\n\nThe Basics:\nIn response to the overwhelming support for our Journal of Science Fiction, the Museum of Science Fiction is pleased to announce Catalysts, Explorers & Secret Keepers, an anthology of science fiction showcasing how women have been an integral part of science fiction as authors, as readers, and as characters for more than a century. With content curated by Museum staff, this anthology will include a variety of original and reprinted fiction from preselected authors and new fiction selected during an open call for submissions.\n\nOur team at the Museum of Science Fiction believes an anthology of science fiction is the perfect take-home exhibit. Many museums publish books to provide context and background to highlight their special, temporary exhibits. We\u2019ve decided to build on this principle and create a curated science fiction anthology as an exhibit meant to be taken home, experienced at your own pace, and shared.\nShowcasing the works of science fiction greats allows us to illustrate their influences on the genre, while rounding out the anthology with unsolicited talent helps us better recognize and celebrate how writers help shape the ever-changing nature of science fiction and its future. Science fiction grows and changes every day, and short stories have been one of the genre\u2019s hallmarks for much of its history. By creating an exhibit of notable short science fiction pieces, we illustrate how the short fiction market has shaped science fiction as we know it.\n\nOnce we hit our funding goal, we will post an open call for submissions lasting until December 1, 2016. Anyone will be able to submit work, and we will consider it as long as it fits our theme. Authors of original fiction published in Catalysts, Explorers & Secret Keepers will receive the SFWA-standard pro-rate of US$0.06 per word, while authors of solicited reprints will receive US$0.03/word. If we hit our funding goal before the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll open our submission window early! All authors published in this take-home exhibit will be invited to discuss their work as presenters and panelists in 2017 at Escape Velocity, the Museum of Science Fiction\u2019s annual celebration of all things science fiction.\n\"All the Worlds to See\" by Julie Dillon (2015)\nFunds raised during this campaign will cover payment to authors contributing to the anthology, publishing costs, mailing costs, and commissioning the Hugo-winning artist Julie Dillon to create original cover art. Any surplus funds will help finance the Museum of Science Fiction\u2019s educational programs in the Washington, DC metro region. \nBecause we\u2019ll be holding an open call for submissions, we anticipate that we\u2019ll be sending copies of the finished anthology to backers approximately 10 months after the Kickstarter campaign ends. Once backers have received their copies of the book, the Museum will make electronic and print copies of the take-home exhibit available for purchase at a higher price on our website.\n\"Scholars' Tower\" by Julie Dillon (2014)\nConfirmed Contributors:\nEleanor Arnason\nCatherine Asaro \nMonica Byrne\nN.K.

In the event that a contributor withdraws from this take-home exhibit, we are prepared to do one of the following: solicit reprint rights from another author for an existing short story; replace the withdrawn story with another appropriate, published manuscript whose copyright has expired; or ask an unsolicited author whose original submission was strongly considered for inclusion in 'Catalysts, Explorers & Secret Keepers' if they would still be interested in participating in the anthology, and work with them to strengthen the previously rejected work. \n\n\n2. The timeline for delivery of the book could change due to delays in the editing or production processes (such as delay in printing at the press, etc.). Our project manager is also the Managing Editor of the Journal of Science Fiction, and she has experience handling unexpected challenges during the editorial and review processes.

Provide the people with jobs and a sense of purpose, in turn, they will help you build a financial empire that will go down in history.\nExploit resources, build factories, and develop infrastructure to transform sleepy little towns into gleaming pillars of industry.\nDesigned with an eye towards both accessibility and depth, Project Automata takes inspiration from classic games like Industry Giant, Transport Tycoon, Anno, and Factorio. There\u2019s enough strategic complexity and replayability to satisfy the most experienced lovers of the genre, while its user friendly mechanics ensure that new players will love it as well.\nProject Automata is a game that is crammed with great ideas, features, designs, and more. Below you\u2019ll find just a handful of the features that are currently in our Alpha Demo, as well as some more that are on their way. This is by no means a comprehensive list, just a snippet of what is to come!\n              What's that? You say trust is earned and the proof is in the pudding? Well that's okay because we love pudding! We also love the game we have created and we know you will too. In fact, we are so confident that you will love it, we created an Alpha Demo to show you how far we\u2019ve come already. We even included Mac and Linux versions! Click the image to access the demo! Click the image to access the demo!\nClick the image to access the demo\n Please note that some users reported that a SmartScreen alert appears stating that the game isn't certified. Simply dismiss it, it's just Microsoft being over-protective. We promise it's virus-free!\nPlease bear in mind this is an Alpha Demo, so not all of the features we mentioned above have been implemented. That\u2019s why we need your help. With your generous support, we know we can finish the game, polish the rough edges, and make this one of the best games ever. We release regular updates about the game\u2019s progress in our \u201cUnearthed\u201d blog series and maintain contact with the community via our forums and social media. We have continually updated our Alpha Demo with patches and feature updates. We will do the same for the full version of the game.\nCheck out our blog to see our most recent updates.\nOur goal with Kickstarter is to take our game a new level. We understand that we are asking for what seems like a great deal of money, but that\u2019s because not only we are very ambitious. To achieve this goal, Dapper Penguin Studio has drawn on a wide range of experience from an excellent team of a dozen people, and each and every member brings their own strong, unique, and comprehensive set of skills to Project Automata. \nNot only are we building an amazing game, with the love and care it needs, but we are also developing an advanced A.I. that will change the gaming industry forever. Your support will help us do that and so much more.  \nWe started our Steam Greenlight campaign on September 26th and rocketed into the top 100 Greenlight games by the end of the first day. Check out our Steam Greenlight page:\n    Having spent the last year operating on personal budgets, bank loans and support from family and friends, we have now entered a critical stage of development, and the opportunity for us to work full time. To complete Project Automata, and to build a strong and well known Game Development Studio is now restricted by a critical factor: Time. Without the ability for us to hire our team on a Full Time basis we\u2019re going to immediately place Project Automata at a disadvantage, something that both the project, and you, our community doesn\u2019t deserve.  \nThank you all for your time, trust, and support. We hope you will join us on our journey to complete this amazing game.\nProject Automata is a masterful blending of the tycoon and industrial simulation genres. You begin the game with limited resources and a small, rented shop. To grow your empire you will need to build farms, mines, and other gatherers to exploit the resources around you. Sell those resources to nearby towns and cities for a quick profit or build factories to transform those resources into more lucrative goods.\nIn its current, early alpha state, Project Automata is already on par with many existing games in the genre. Players can build supply chains to gather and develop resources, they can sell those resources to towns, or trade them between towns. A tutorial and basic model of the financial simulation is also in place making the game quite playable and enjoyable. However, we are far from satisfied with the current version of the game. It can be so much more, and with your help it will be.\nDeveloping a game is tough. It takes hundreds of thousands of hours of hard work and dedication to bring a great game into existence. There is no guarantee that all those efforts will be rewarded, so why do it? In a word - passion. We build games because we love them and because we love all of you - our amazing fans. We are fortunate to have independence from corporate think-tanks and red tape. We can provide you with a quality game because we don\u2019t have to build games strictly based on profit margins and market strategies; that suits us just fine.\nWe\u2019re making Project Automata for fans of the industrial simulation genre, but also to introduce these wonderful games to a whole new generation of gamers. Games like Transport Tycoon, Industry Giant, Tropico, and the Anno series are fading away and newer entries like Factorio and Parkitect tend to be overshadowed by the waves of First Person Shooters and freemium MMOs that seem to come out on a daily basis. \nWe want to continue the growth of this wonderful genre by providing another game that, in time, will become a classic, just like those Tycoon games of old. With a proven track record working for companies like Pyros and Blizzard Entertainment our fearless leader, Alessandro Mochi, is just the man to lead our talented and dedicated team of industry professionals.\n  A great game not only entertains the player, it also creates an unforgettable atmosphere. Project Automata is set during the golden age of industrial expansion. We want the feeling of that time period to be represented throughout the game. Our amazing artists, have created a distinctive art style for Project Automata that brings the game to life and gives it a nostalgic atmosphere that players will love.\n  Textile Factory Concept Model\n  Under the hood, Project Automata will break new ground in advanced industrial simulation. Unlike other games in the genre, the towns and environment in Project Automata will be living, breathing, organisms. They will interact with the player, with other towns, and with competing companies. To succeed, players will need to constantly evaluate their strategies and decisions. The A.I. will be so good even we, as developers, won't know what it will do from one game to the next.\nTown Interaction\nAs you build, so will the world around you. Towns will grow into cities, and cities into metropolises. Every town will have Mayors and Councils that make decisions throughout the game based on their own personalities and agendas. They will enact bills that change the economy in different ways and, if the player is in good standing, they will provide rewards that boost the player\u2019s business.\n    Early Alpha Models & Textures\n  Technology will play a big role in the growth of your empire. You begin the game with the most basic technology. Simple trucks will transport your goods to and from your hubs and town trade centers. As you progress through the game, new technologies will become available. Eventually your factories will grow into huge industrial parks that pump out tons of products every day. \nFurniture Factory Concept Art\nOf course all of this production is bound to have some impact on the environment. Waste and pollution will be a factor. Some towns will be more \u2018green\u2019 than others and they won\u2019t appreciate the beauty of those big factory smokestacks as much as you.\nNot only will you have to worry about air and noise pollution, but also ground pollution and how it affects nearby farms and factories. No one wants to drink orange juice made from polluted oranges. Yuck! To keep everyone happy you will have to keep that waste under control or find a magician to make it all disappear. \nProject Automata will be a very complex and engaging simulation, but it will also be tons of fun. From the nostalgic art style to the humorous dialog present throughout the game, Project Automata is designed to be a wonderful, tongue-in-cheek look at early industrialism. Your guide will be your company secretary, Miss Doreen Watts. Her witty, and sometimes laugh-out-loud, dialog will keep you engaged and on task.\nMiss Doreen Watts & Her Fellow NPCs\nThere will be a rich, story-driven campaign included in the final version, that will welcome new and experienced players alike into the world of industrial capitalism. There will also be unique scenarios to play in the game, challenging you to overcome obstacles and get your empire back on track.\nProject Automata will be fun, engaging, and endlessly replayable. Some games we play and forget, but others earn that coveted permanent spot on our hard drives. We are confident that Project Automata will earn that spot and be the go-to game for fans for years to come.\nBeing 100% funded is a great start for the game, but we would really love to take the development way beyond the basics. You can help us hit our stretch goals by filling out the achievements table below.  \nEach spot on the grid represents one achievement. As we unlock them they will change from grey to full technicolor. The more achievements we fill in, the closer we get to our next stretch goal. While most of these are self-explanatory, the last two might need a little clarification.    \nWe want everyone to take screenshots of their best factory layouts and post them to social media using #projectautomata. We want to see your wackiest, funniest, most geometrically perfect, or just plain weird layouts here folks. Make them good because only one image per person will count toward the achievements. Some of the very best might even be featured on our webpage, so get creative!  \nThe last achievement is all about you, in particular, selfies of yourself in front of real life factories. Post them to social media using #projectautomata We want to see your happy faces in front of factories all over the world, the crazier and funnier the better. The very best might even be featured on our webpage!\nFollow us on social media and come join the conversation on our forums!\nTwitter\nFacebook\nProject Automata Forums \nEvery cent of the money we receive from this campaign will go directly to the production of the game and salaries for our team, so we can eat, pay the rent, and keep pushing forward. None of this money will be taken as profit. Our company business model means all money raised will be exclusively used to further Project Automata.\nOver a third of what we make will go to taxes and fees. The remaining amount will be allocated to various departments as defined below. These percentages include salaries for our team as well as assets necessary for the completion of each piece of the pie. \nProgramming includes all of the coding for the game including the A.I.\nDesign includes the development of the game's existing features as well as the design and implementation of new features.   \nAudio/Visual includes all of the 2D and 3D art design, music, sound, and the user interface. \nMarketing includes advertising, social media, website design and maintenance, and public relations. \nProduction includes all of the other details like legal fees, paperwork, outsourcing, and a million other little odds and ends that invariably pop up.  \nDapper Penguin Studios is an indie developer. We have a small team that has been working on this game for over a year on their own time and with their own money. It has been, and continues to be, a labor of love. We would love to complete it and share it with all of you and with a little help, we know we can do just that.\n  Kickstarter gives us all an opportunity to have the games we want, so we hope you will join us on the journey. In turn we promise to stay small, independent, and to do our best to bring you the most awesome game ever.\nThe full alpha version of the game will be available shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. We expect the beta to be ready by the third quarter of 2017 and the full release in the first quarter of 2018. The Alpha and Beta versions will also include Steam Early Access once that becomes available. Of course these dates are tentative and depend largely on the success of our Kickstarter campaign.\nTo all of our fans and to all of our backers, thank you for your support, for your love, and for being just plain awesome!\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBuilding a game has inherent challenges. Programming the A.I., creating the 2D/3D art assets, and creating an emotion evoking soundtrack are just a few of the many elements that have to come together to make a great game. \n\nProject Automata has an advantage over other games because we have the bones of the game already designed and built. We have already developed a lot of the game\u2019s structure. We just need some help getting the rest of the way to a complete game. \n\nWe know we will hit bumps along the way, but we have an amazing team of industry veterans that can work through them and keep the development on track. We have a pool of enormous talent to draw from. They have dedicated their time and efforts to this game because it is their passion. Many sacrifices have been made, from pitching in their own money, to leaving jobs, and even downgrading living situations just to make this game a reality. We are confident that we can overcome any obstacles that may pop up along the way.\n\nWe have the talent, integrity, and drive, but most importantly we have the love and passion to make sure this game is everything we, our backers, and our fans want it to be.\n\n**Please note that the flavor text in our rewards is just for fun. Only the actual listed rewards will be provided for backers. The delivery dates are for the rewards and don't reflect the release date of any version of the game which is still TBD.

We are dedicated to finishing it the right way and giving you all a game you will love for years to come. \nWe expect the full alpha to be available for purchase sometime before the end of the year and we will likely make it available on our website or some other digital media outlet.

In Flaustria, it is conducted with class. A model astronaut must show sparkling wit, a winning smile, and perhaps a working knowledge of what the spaceship buttons do. In Astronaut: The Best, your duty is to train a procedurally-generated team of deviant screwups into brilliant space heroes, or give the impression of having done so. Anything less, and you will be killed and left in a ditch.\nThe Demo\nThe easiest way to learn about Astronaut: The Best\u2019s gameplay is by playing the demo!  \n(Please keep in mind that the demo isn\u2019t the final game! Before we create the rest of AtB\u2019s content, we\u2019ve budgeted some time to spend fleshing out the core experience. Your feedback will help us learn what is working and what isn\u2019t, so we can make improvements in ways that really matter to the player.  You can send any demo feedback to atbfeedback@universalhappymaker.com.)   \nElevator Pitches\nWe\u2019ve been told that X-meets-Y pitches are helpful when describing an unusual game, so here are our best shots:  \nIt\u2019s like King of Dragon Pass meets Look Around You\nIt\u2019s like a Mel Brooks version of Papers, Please \nIt\u2019s like Princess Maker or Long Live The Queen, if you were raising a whole bunch of princesses, any one of which might turn out to be a hideous reptile at any time, but even if that were the case, there could totally be a silver lining to that cloud \nIt\u2019s like a wonky physics game, like Goat Simulator, but the physics is human interaction \nGameplay Basics\nIn Astronaut: The Best, you are the Director of the Flaustrian Space Academy. Your goal is to find and train astronauts for mankind\u2019s first spaceflight, to make sure they bring as much Glory to Flaustria as possible. You don\u2019t have to worry about building or piloting the ship \u2014 the Academy is just about the people.\nAstronaut: The Best is about narrative and strategy in equal parts. You decide how best to train your astronauts, building a team with the right mix of skills and personalities to bring home the bacon of national Glory. You also navigate a series of challenging narrative decisions every single day. And in our game, a day is only a couple minutes long, so it adds up to a lot of mixed-up and mechanically meaningful consequences. Here are some highlights:\nEarn money for the space program while building character, by making your astronauts do promotional events on live national television!\nSuffer the meddling of Flaustria\u2019s five High Priests, or fear their divine magic powers!\nDiscover more about your astronauts\u2019 unique sets of skills, liabilities, and neuroses! Then accept them for who they are, or use dark magic to change them.\nPlay through the main storyline, where you must right a wrong threatening to sink the space program in each one of Flaustria\u2019s five provinces. Each mission, along with the big launch, can end in drastically different ways depending on your choices and your astronauts\u2019 performance. \n(For more on the gameplay, you can also check out the devlogs on our site.)\nThe Full Game\nAstronaut: The Best is built for replayability and experimentation. Each playthrough will take 2-3 hours, and unlock new paths and options for subsequent ones. Your astronauts will be completely different every time you play, as will the random events. However, the storyline and central choices of each mission will remain the same, allowing you to try out different choices and see how the results diverge. \nOur artistic goal is to create a lighthearted and humorous environment where you can experience moral conflict. We want you to experience a society whose values are very different from our own, and see whether you adapt or stand firm. We will give you too much power to meddle with the lives of others, and find out how you will use it. We will give you opportunities to deviously cheat the system, where it might turn out the system knew all along and demands an apology. Our goal is to give you a safe space to explore your values, where you can laugh about it at the time and think about it afterwards.\n  Fast Facts About Flaustria  \nLike any civilized nation, Flaustria worships the Five Gods, and their High Priests run the government. \nFlaustria has warred on-and-off for centuries against their neighbors, the snake-worshipping Vladagar.  Flaustrians nourish a distaste for Vladagar\u2019s loose morals and foolish representational government. \nThe leading industry of Flaustria is tabloids. Second place is tea.\nCurrently, Flaustria is locked in a cold war with Vladagar. It has been mutually agreed that the first to space wins.\nThe Five High Priests\nAs Director of the Flaustrian Royal Space Academy, it\u2019s important that you know your bosses, the council of High Priests. Your superiors are powerful, but also impetuous. They\u2019ll be visiting you frequently to make unreasonable demands and offer their very special types of help. They pack the institutional and mystical capabilities to make your life rather difficult if you decide to challenge their divine authority.\nCorreblanch, High Priest of the Sun, Defender of Life and Purity: The scariest part of a nun and hippie combined, Correblanch believes that her greatest possible gift to you is constant vigilance of your moral failings. She offers a simple solution to any dilemma, and it involves absolute austerity, repentance, and communing with nature.  \u201cYour everyday existence is profane. Do you not realize this?\u201d    \nStarnat, High Priest of the Mongoose, Protector Against Serpents: Starnat takes everything seriously, but nothing more so than the threat of serpents. Having seen too many comrades laid low by serpentine trickery in the old wars against Vladagar, he will stop at nothing to make sure your program is safe from snakes.  \u201cThis advertisement implies that a serpent may enjoy sugary cakes where a man cannot. It is a staggering blow to our nation's morale and pride.\u201d\nRulu, High Priest of the Book of Knowledge, Solicitor of Wisdom and Power: The most mysterious of the High Priests, Rulu holds knowledge sacred and private. As such, nobody is quite sure whether Rulu is a hypercompetent spymaster or just bluffing. The sort of person who begins and ends every sentence with \u201cJust so you know..\u201d  \u201cJust so you know, it is possible that an imminent disaster might cripple your organization. Imagine if such a thing were true! Were that the case, I expect it would be easily avoided by sacrificing to the God of Knowledge, just so you know.\u201d\nInside-Track, High Priest of the Market, Root of All Fortune: To the outsider, it might seem like Inside-Track is only out to make himself money, and that he only cares about style instead of substance. True Flaustrians understand that he\u2019s just looking out for Flaustria\u2019s economy by promoting the interests of his main man, the Coin God of the Market.  \u201cYour rocket goes in a straight line? That\u2019s not gonna play. You\u2019ve gotta style a bit, do a loop or something. Here\u2019s an idea: launch a ring of fire into space first, so you can fly through it. That one\u2019s free.\u201d \nMorningdew, High Priest of the Moon, Shadow of Finality and Fan of Doomed Romance: Morningdew is the newest High Priest. She communes with Death, but doesn\u2019t see any reason to be dour about it.. Her heart is in the right place, but giving a teenager the ultimate in both magical and political power? Caveat emptor.  \u201cYour astronauts totally HAVE to read my poem. In public, or on television. It's about a girl.. who writes poems.\u201d\n    Reward Descriptions\nName in Credits: Your name will be featured in the credits of Astronaut: The Best, the game you helped make possible. In addition, you\u2019ll receive our exclusive and coveted Backer Updates.\nGame: A bright, digitally shining copy of Astronaut: The Best, the game you\u2019ll have been waiting for. AtB will be available in both Steam and DRM-free flavors (assuming our Greenlight campaign succeeds), for Windows, OSX, and Linux.\nDigital Artbook: A PDF tracing the evolution of AtB\u2019s art, containing development notes and untold secrets of Flaustria\u2019s story. It also includes a selection of desktop-ready crazy-res images and a printable papercraft Ignaeus (the androgynously triangular host of The All-Seeing Eye)! \nSoundtrack: Downloadable versions of all AtB\u2019s music tracks, for listening during the drastic decisions and dizzying deskwork of your own life. The soundtrack will include a rendition of the Flaustrian anthem performed by a chorus of artificial street urchins. \nShameful Game Bundle: AtB lies along a long and winding gameography. While you\u2019re waiting for its release, whet your palate with a collection of our most shamefully fascinating past works, each accompanied by a written retrospective/apology. It\u2019s like a tiny digital museum, or cabinet of curiosities. Highlights include: \nThe never-before-seen tech support adventure \u201cSatisfaction Guaranteed,\u201d from before it gradually evolved into a game about magical astronauts\n\u201cAdelbert Vester: Humoural Physician,\u201d a game where you win your way into the court of the Holy Roman Empire by actions such as giving Nostradamus an enema\n\"The Filth and the Fury,\" a procedural music journalism adventure where you must predict the popularity of genres such as electric madrigal and flaccid jazz \nSeveral others that we have suppressed from our memories, but we will drag screaming into the spotlight just for you!\nBeta Access: We\u2019re not currently planning on doing Steam Early Access or any other wide-release prerelease. That means this is your chance to get early builds of Astronaut: The Best, have your feedback heard, and help us make the best game we can.\nOriginal Concept Art: Julia has lots of sketchbook pages that eventually became the characters and world of Astronaut: The Best. If you select one of our premium tiers, we\u2019ll sign one and mail it to you as a keepsake! All sketches are unique, and thus all are ultra-rare. Will you be lucky enough to receive Noncanon Alternate Rulu or Some Weird Frog?\nHandwritten Horoscope: We will personally prognosticate you, informing you of your Flaustrian birth sign and its implications on your fate. The High Priest Inside-Track will give you investment advice, and the High Priest Correblanch will bless you by listing your faults. Here is a sampling of the sort of cryptic advice one might find in such a horoscope: \nBAGS OF BREAD must beware well dressed house-sitters with time to burn and money to spend. Keep your sofas clean and change the batteries in every smoke detector before handing over the keys. Change is behind the wheel of today, the way fire is the backseat driver of yesterday\u2019s kitchen.\nTEAPOT MICE keep the kitty full by eating leftovers, but only when they have been suitably refrigerated. \nTier Full of Snakes: Do not select this tier. Perhaps you wish to be eaten by snakes because you are trying to collect life experiences. If this is the case, I warn you that being eaten by snakes may only be experienced once, and indeed may preclude you from collecting other experiences in the future.\nAstronaut Face In Game: Normally, our astronauts have faces made by randomly combining different elements. And yes, your face will be chopped up (virtually) and used as the DNA behind thousands of random astronauts. But wait! We will provide you a special cheat code, wherein if you give an astronaut a certain name, they will have your face. Kinda like how bonus characters used to work in NBA Jam, or Sid Meier in XCOM: Enemy Unknown.\nCustom National Anthem: We will write you a national anthem. Perhaps it is for a fictional nation of your invention, or perhaps you wish to declare yourself a sovereign nation. Tell us about your country, its values and history, and we will give you a majestically-recorded instrumental anthem with a set of lyrics. \nWe retain the right to put the anthem on our soundtrack, because we think it\u2019d be awesome to have an album full of national anthems, but you can use it as you see fit otherwise. We also reserve the right not to write about genuinely objectionable content (e.g. if you want an anthem for racial supremacy, you don\u2019t need us; Wagner has a good selection. Feel free to ask if you\u2019re not sure).\nBe An Important Character: Appear before every player, to help or challenge! The full storyline of Astronaut: The Best features several characters central to a mission\u2019s storyline, who will visit the Director to prompt key decisions. Determine the appearance, name, mannerisms, and personality of one of these characters. Make yourself, your loved one, or your totally-not-yourself fanfic character a part of Flaustria. Obstructionists, television executives, well-intentioned agents trying to solve problems, and even All-Seeing Eye judges are up for grabs. \nDesign a Mission: Our exclusive creative reward: it\u2019s a deep collaboration, so we\u2019re only offering one. Work with us to design a full storyline in Astronaut: The Best. As an idea of scope, our entire Kickstarter demo is a single mission, so it\u2019ll have about that much content. We\u2019ll meet (online) to discuss your ideas, make sure it has an appropriate tone and scope, and then we\u2019ll do all the hard parts of making it happen. In the end, you can choose to release your mission as part of the full game or keep it to yourself as a secret private experience. \nBarrel-Aged Copy:  The choice of a true connoisseur. We will produce a physical copy of the game, and age it for ten years in a barrel. We will fill the barrel with whiskey to add flavor, unless that would ruin the game. (Us figuring this out and documenting it is part of the reward.) After a decade of aging, we will deliver unto you the finest vintage of game ever sampled by humanity. (Pending the vicissitudes of time: if the west coast of America sinks into the ocean, we may have to restart the process.)\n     As we start to near 100% funding, we\u2019ll post more details about our stretch goals. We promise to be responsible developers and use stretch goals for fun rewards and interesting improvements, rather than promising major changes that will eat up a disproportionate amount of time and resources.\n    Budget Explanation\nThis chart shows the rough breakdown of how we\u2019ll spend our budget, after Kickstarter and payment fees. Since our only non-digital rewards are sketches we already have on hand (and perhaps a single physical copy of the game), we don\u2019t anticipate fulfillment costs being a factor beyond administrative overhead.\nThe $26,000 we\u2019re asking for isn\u2019t enough to fully employ a team of five for a year. Our core team has other jobs to give us a living income while leaving us enough time to make steady progress on Astronaut: The Best. However, we do still need this Kickstarter money to complete AtB! These funds are necessary for us to compensate contracting team members, ensure that freelancing teammates don\u2019t have to pick up extra work, and give us a bit of cushion against unforeseen circumstances, since there are always unforeseen circumstances. Of course, the more money this campaign makes, the more work our team will be able to devote to Astronaut: The Best, and the less time it will take us to deliver the finished product.\nFundbetter\nHalf of our planned budget comes from this Kickstarter. The other half is provided by Fundbetter, the narrative game investment program run by Failbetter Games. However, they\u2019re only matching the $26k if we succeed in this campaign!\nFundbetter is not a publishing deal, nor will Failbetter themselves hold any creative sway over the game. They are simply investing in Astronaut: The Best in exchange for some of its profits once released, so that we can set a more modest goal for this campaign than we could otherwise. We greatly admire Failbetter as a game studio (check out Sunless Sea and Fallen London if you haven\u2019t already), and appreciate Fundbetter\u2019s dedication to helping experimental indie games. We hope that AtB succeeds wildly and gives them plenty of money to fund other weird projects!\n  A disgraced ex-professor, David is one half of the duumvirate that leads AtB\u2019s design, coding, and writing. In his past life, he was a 3D artist who worked on several AAA titles at Rockstar Games, Sony Online Entertainment, and Pandemic Studios. Escaping the big-studio world for academia, he earned an Interactive Media MFA from the University of Southern California, then served as artist-in-residence at UCLA\u2019s Design Media Arts Game Lab. While making AtB, he has been working part-time as a programmer at Blue Marble Game Co. in Los Angeles, trying to stay current on philosophy, and learning to appreciate Japanese whiskey and shmups.\nA disgraced ex-member of the American Academy of Poets, Mike brings his blistering contraband poesy to AtB\u2019s writing, and also its programming and design. Under the banner of Rad Dragon, Mike co-created and shipped games including Shove Pro, Safari Rescue, and Alphabeats for iOS and Steam. On the side, he has done design and narrative consulting, stayed a spell at USC\u2019s Game Innovation Lab, and currently works part-time as Creative Director at coding education company TechSmartKids in Seattle.\nA disgraced ex-fire eater, Julia has turned to creating the art (and trailer) for Astronaut: The Best. A freelance illustrator and nationally-exhibited gallery artist living in Seattle, her work combines sewing and illustration in a unique mixed media process. She holds a MFA in Illustration from the University of Hartford and a BFA in Illustration from Otis College of Art and Design. Julia has taught college-level art and graphic design classes, self-published books and comics, and has ten years\u2019 experience as a traveling circus sideshow performer.  Her portfolio is at juliay.com.\nA disgraced ex-saxophonist, Matt runs AtB\u2019s music composition, sound design, and audio production. He graduated from the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and has was part of iZotope\u2019s RX audio suite team that won an Engineering Emmy. He has published electronic music under the name Absent Qualia, and played rock gigs as a drummer, bassist, and woodwind player. He currently works as an audio engineer at procedural music startup Amper Music in New York City, and spends his spare time constructing modular synthesizers.\nA disgraced ex-monk, Marina\u2019s path has led her around the world to running communications for Astronaut: The Best.  A Political Science graduate of UCLA, her day job is the Marketing and External Operations Manager for MTM Lathe & Stucco.  She lives in Austin, where she does stunt work for local film productions.\nA disgraced ex-artist, Warren provided the voice of the Spirit of Flaustria for our Kickstarter video. A voice actor living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he has performed roles including the spokesperson for When Inanimate Objects Attack, the prince from Desert Gem Studio's The Hunchback's Tale, and the voice of the YouTube channel Be Amazed!\nThanks to the following YouTubers for granting us permission to use their awesome streams in our video:\nConstantlyCalibrating\nChrisTenarium\nCrypticHybrid\nHusbandoGoddess\nRainy Day Let's Play\nRandomiseUser\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk we\u2019re taking with Astronaut: The Best is making a strange game that possibly no one will really get, but if you back us we will feel much better about that one.\n\nAll game projects entail risk. Production can run into bugs and stall, eating up budget. Key team members can become ill or miss time, which is especially dangerous with a small team such as ours. We\u2019ve done our best to address these risks in the following ways:\n\nWe have been working on the game for nearly two years. We\u2019ve built all the core systems, which means all the riskiest programming challenges are complete. More importantly, we\u2019ve arrived at a game design that we no longer need to tinker with (besides a few planned improvements). We won\u2019t need to spend time recreating assets and systems to match sudden design changes, which is perhaps the most common hazard for a game\u2019s production process.\n\nWith the help of Fundbetter, our budget includes some wiggle room that should allow us to cover a delay or period of absence.\n\nEarlier this year, Mike self-published an independent game on Steam, so we know all the work required to bring a professional-quality game to market and have planned accordingly.\n\nA particular risk of our game is that we\u2019ve never done a Kickstarter before, so juggling game development and community interaction will be new to us. But we\u2019re looking forward to trying it!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Universal Happymaker\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nUniversal Happymaker builds games that are moral laboratories.

THANK YOU SO MUCH!\nWe've reached $10,000, so we will increase all creator payments by 50%. The talented writers and cover artist are the main reason this book turned out so beautifully, and they deserve to share in this campaign's success.\nIf we reach $12,500, we will create an audiobook edition of DANGEROUS WOMEN! I've been talking to voice talent friends and pricing out professional rates, and at this level we would have enough to create a beautiful audio version of DW and provide it to every backer whose reward includes a print edition!\nIf we are so fortunate as to reach $15,000, then creator payments will double. Again, the creative talents that have participated in DANGEROUS WOMEN are the key to its success, and if we double our goal, then they deserve double pay. :-)\nIt's time\u2026 to take over the world!\nSince Northwest Press published its first prose collection of gay super-villain stories, The Lavender Menace, readers have been asking for a collection of stories about queer female villains, and now that book is finally here!\nDANGEROUS WOMEN: TALES OF QUEER VILLAINY\u2014edited and with an introduction by lesbian comics tastemaker Erica Friedman\u2014brings you thirteen short stories of power, destruction and chaos by women who love other women almost as much as they love taking over the world!\nThese 238 pages of deliciously dastardly stories of super-powered villainy are contained in a wraparound cover by artist Agnes Czaja (Anything That Loves) and contain contributions from a group of visionary writers.\nThe Financial Plan\nWe are trying to raise at least $7500 to produce a lush 5.5\"x8.5\" trade paperback collection, cleanly designed and offset printed with a beautifully finished cover.\nOur writers and cover artist will be paid from a pool of about $2000\u2014more if we exceed our minimum goal!\nPostage to send out books will range from $500-$1000, based on the number of international pledges. (We don't want to underbudget for postage, as that's the number one cause of delays in fulfilling Kickstarter projects.)\nWe've included an additional $500 to cover corrections, unanticipated costs, and promotional expenses.\nOur last collection of similar length and content, The Lavender Menace, cost $3300 to print and incurred $700 in shipping and additional costs.\nThe Rewards\nNorthwest Press has been producing fantastic LGBT-centric comics and graphic novels since 2010, and we're going to offer a wide selection of rewards above and beyond a copy of DANGEROUS WOMEN.\nYou can pledge a small amount and get a digital copy of the book in a number of formats, compatible with just about any digital device. Or pledge a little more and get the print edition, produced to Northwest Press' exacting standards.\nYou can opt to get a twin-pack of DANGEROUS WOMEN and its companion collection The Lavender Menace, for 26 tales of queer villainy in all! (Early-bird contributors can get The Lavender Menace included for free!)\nWe've also got reward tiers that include our award-winning anthologies Qu33r and Anything That Loves, first issues of our comics series Dash, A Waste of Time, Rise, and The Legend of Bold Riley, and even a deluxe \"mega pack\" that includes every still-in-print book and comic that Northwest Press has ever released!\nThe Stories\n\"Evil.

The Elf Queen Solatia, aware of their plight, has secured some lands in a far away country and an old Keep where they can rebuild.\nAssigned to help these woodland folk rebuild is The Royal Company of Colonizers, an elite group of expert gatherers and builders. Three of the most storied of these colonizers have been chosen for this mission, The Dwarf: Dwilben the Gatherer, The Gnome: Gloia the Builder, and The Halfling: Horbir the Explorer.\nDwarrows is a peaceful Town-Builder that borrows from the Action Adventure genre. \nPlacing a Windmill in town\nTake control of three uniquely skilled characters to leave the confines of the town, explore the lush forest surrounding it, and work together to solve puzzles. \nSome wild bluebirds in the woods\nGather resources to build your town, invite the wandering elves to join it, and discover treasures within the ruins of a forgotten civilization. \nThe Dwarf chops down a tree for wood\nFeatures\nExplore, quest, and puzzle through a peaceful and atmospheric world\nPlay as three uniquely skilled characters\nDiscover new town structures, characters, and treasures\nBuild your town and balance resources and expansion\nGather resources to supply your town and townsfolk to live in it\nUse ancient artifacts to boost character abilities and town productivity\nUnlock new structures for your town by combining blueprints\n    Dwilben\u2019s role in the mission is to gather the natural resources needed to help the wood-elves build a new colony.\nCuts down trees to collect wood resources\nMines gold and stone resources\nCarries large explosives to open blocked or hidden passageways\nGloia\u2019s role in the mission is to assist the wood-elves by helping them design and build town structures and the colony as a whole. She also excels at repairing anything that might be broken.\nRepairs and builds structures\nDesigns new town structure blueprints\nBlocks projectiles and falling debris with her shield\nHorbir\u2019s role in the mission is to assist the wood-elves in exploring the new land and finding whatever treasures hidden within to finance the rebuilding of their civilization.\nDetects hidden treasures\nQuickly travels by sprinting\nSkillfully climbs walls\nStepping outside of the town, players will explore the woodlands, meet strange characters, explore dungeons, solve puzzles, complete quests, and find treasure to bring back to town. Players will encounter a variety of beautiful environments and places.\nA historied haunted forest lies in wait for you to rescue its lost souls and solve its ancient puzzles.\nGhosts approaching in Vigil Pines\nLend a hand to the farmers at the quiet Breezy River Farm, who could really use your help.\nAll is quiet at Breezy River Farm\nWander into tiny villages where groups of Wood-Elves have established themselves. These villages can sometimes help you grow your own village, or they might be looking for some help!\nWood-Elf hanging out at Hillcrest Village\n  The player will have the ability to swap between 3 characters. In general town-related gameplay, each character will have unique abilities and contributions to the team. Most of the time, it is not necessary that the characters be together to complete a task. In some instances, such as dungeons, the player must control all three characters to complete puzzles and advance. \nThroughout the world, the player will encounter puzzles. Sometimes spread throughout the outdoors in the environment and sometimes in the form of a dungeon. At times, the puzzles will be ways to move forward in the environment/story, other times it will be used for gaining specific rewards. Puzzles are similar to the MetroidVania style with some minor 3D platform jumping. \nThe Town Alchemy System allows players to experiment with combining structure types to create a new one. The logic is similar to that of Little Alchemy. When the player discovers a new structure type they receive a blueprint, which they can use to build that structure in town.\nExamples:\nTent + Tent = Small House\nHouse + Small Store = Inn\nPuppet Show + Farm = Circus Tent\nIn order for the player to build the town they will need to collect resources.The three main resources that the player must collect are: Wood, Stone, and Gold. \nThese can be obtained by the Dwarf with his wood-axe and mining-pick, or by any character if they search a geocache. Gold can also be found on treasure hunts with the Halfling.\nSimilarly, the player must also collect Townsfolk. The Townsfolk in Dwarrows are what makes your town work. The player will find the potential Wood-Elf citizens camping in the woods and can ask them to join the town.\n  The Queen of the Commonwealth was able to secure some land for the new settlement, but the space is limited. Strategically use this space to build structures that will maintain your town and unlock new abilities.\nExamples:  \nBuild markets to better the economy and add to your town\u2019s resource capacity\nBuild houses to increase population capacity\nBuild farms to feed and maintain your population\nBuild recreational and entertainment structures to keep your townsfolk happy and productive\nIn order to support more Townsfolk, your town must have enough housing. Better houses will support more people while taking up less space and improving living conditions for the Wood-Elves.\nYour citizens work jobs in the buildings you provide them, but their productivity is affected by their happiness. Keep your citizens balanced and happy by giving them recreational and entertainment structures.\nTry to befriend the animals and creatures found within Dwarrows. Once an animal is endeared to you, you can give it a name and it will follow you during your travels.\nPets help the character it is following by improving its abilities and luck. You can bring one along for each of your characters.\nThe kind and peaceful Wood-Elves suffered a great flood that took their homeland and for many years they wandered the commonwealth as refugees with no place of their own. Queen Solatia saw the plight of the Wood-Elves and for her subjects she acquired an agreement with a people from an ancient, far-away country. The Achyrons agreed to allow the Wood-Elves to settle in their indigenous territories, the luscious Dusken Woodlands where there would be plenty of resources, life, and treasure to help them build a new society.\n\nAn old keep from a failed settlement attempt still stands there in an valley called Duskenvale. There, the wood-elves began to set-up a base of Operations and await the arrival of an expert team from the Royal Company of Colonizers to assist them in the start of a new civilization.\n\nThe Royal Company of Colonizers is an elite group of experts whose skills pertain to the colonization and growth of the commonwealth they serve. Though there are hundreds within its ranks there are no more storied colonizers than a little mismatched trio made up of a Dwarf, a Halfling, and a Gnome.\n\nThe three always insist on working together because they believe that their differences make them a stronger team. Traveling the world in the service of good, helping to build infrastructure, and stabilize developing towns and economies, Dwilben, Horbir, and Gloia dedicated their lives to the casual heroics of ingenuity and resourcefulness.\nAdditional Info/Links\nTrailer: youtube.com/watch?v=raEPcYxalRk \nWebsite: www.dwarrows.com \nPresskit: www.dwarrows.com/press\nBlog: https://lithicentertainment.wordpress.com \nGreenlight: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642051488\nWhat we have left to do\nThere are a lot of features already completed in Dwarrows, but there is still so much more that we want to do. There are certain goals that we are determined to achieve in which our only barrier is financing. Some items that we would like to complete with assistance of the Kickstarter funds are: \nHire a Composer - The wonderfully talented Neil Quillen [www.neilquillen.com, https://soundcloud.com/neil-quillen]\nComplete all remaining art assets\nPay for new versions software licenses and hardware for testing\nMarketing \n    We are a small team of 3 developers, based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with a variety of experience between us in Programming, Art, Animation, QA, Game Development, Project Management, and Design. We are a completely self-funded, by the bootstraps, garage development team.\nWe have been working as a team on Dwarrows for nearly 4 years, and now that it is in its final stages of development, we're looking to Kickstarter to help fund the level of polish that we are aiming for.\nLithic Entertainment [twitter | facebook | website]:\nAndrea Woodford: Game Designer and Artist [twitter]\nAl Bellemare: Game Designer and Programmer [twitter]\nSteven Woodford: Animator and Scripter\n  Additional to what we\u2019ve listed above, there are other fees involved in a Kickstarter campaign. \nBelow, we\u2019ve broken down on a chart how each task and fee would make up the $12k.\nProgramming is not included on this chart because it is self-funded\nEquipment includes new software licences and hardware related to testing on new platforms\nAudio will primarily cover production of a soundtrack\n    Notes: In tiers in which rewards include use of a name, the use of your likeness, or the use of your design we may require a consent and release form to be signed before the delivery or production of such items. We also reserve the right to reject any name, phrase, design that we deem inappropriate.\nBelow are just a few examples of in-game rewards you can get from pledging.\n First available in pledge level: Adventurer ($40)\nYOUR name could help decorate the walls of the Hall of Victors\n First available in pledge level: Dearly Departed ($100)\nThis gravestone in Vigil Pines could be marked with YOUR name\n First available in pledge level: Doppelganger ($200)\nHave a little green elf made into YOUR likeness\n  Our inspirations\nWe wanted to aim for a game that had a broad audience appeal, was fun and relaxing to play, and allowed the player to feel like they left a mark on their world. \nOur town-building combines elements from games such as Tropico, Triple Town, and Little Alchemy. \nThe adventure/puzzle portions were inspired by games like Zelda and Metroidvanias. The feature of switching between three characters is similar to, though not exactly like Trine.\nOur Greenlight Campaign\nOur Greenlight Campaign was very successful. We were excited by the overwhelming positive response that we received from new fans on Facebook, Twitter and Greenlight itself. We reached the Top 100 mark in the first 24 hours which was a wonderful surprise for a zero-budget, under-dog marketing team such as ourselves. By the time that Steam did its next batch of greenlighting (just shy of two weeks from when we first submitted) our game was sitting at the #20 spot and still climbing.\n \nOur plan going forward\nWe are determined to finish, release, and sell Dwarrows regardless of any circumstance, though with more funding we would be capable of creating a more immersive experience with the extra touches in the final leg of development. Ideally, we would like to release an alpha build in the fourth quarter of 2016, but this date partially relies on us finding extra funding to assure we can keep putting as much time into development as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any ambitious project, especially with a team of three, it can be difficult to always know or predict every coming pitfall. Issues pertaining to money are usually at the root of any project\u2019s difficulties. Dwarrows has been in development for four years and throughout this time, we\u2019ve managed to build this game on as low of a budget as possible. Using our own savings, working part and full time jobs and contracts, as well as receiving aid from very generous family. \n\nWe\u2019ve managed to get to this leg of development without any debt or needing to compromise the quality of our vision. So far, we\u2019ve always had the skills or solutions to make whatever it was that we needed. Looking forward however, there are indeed some aspects of the project that we cannot do without additional funding such as music, marketing, additional quests and content. We are confident the game will get finished regardless of the Kickstarter because our current set-up will allow for the completion of the game sans the extra touches.\n\nDwarrows is a project of passion, there is little risk in the completion of the project. What is at risk is the quality we can achieve and the time in which we need to achieve it\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "The Watcher", "descp": "Receive campaign updates (you can choose to increase or cancel your pledge later)\nThank you for your interest in Dwarrows!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 15 or more", "title": "Villager", "descp": "Receive a digital copy of the game!\n(The game will retail at a higher value than what is offered to our backers)\nINCLUDES:\nSteam Key -

Inspired by classic gems like Monkey Island, Kings Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry, but set in a queer community in the pacific northwest. You play as Lupe, a long haired butch with a heart of gold.  She lives with her babely girlfriend, Alexis,  that is until one day when Alexis gets kidnapped! You gotta help Lupe by deciphering clues, talking to lovable weirdos, and navigating self care.\n\"Queer Quest is another entry into the burgeoning landscape of queer games, and with any luck, others will soon be naming it as their inspiration too.\" - Kill Screen\n\"I met the developer of this game at XOXO. I was fascinated and intrigued. Glad to see it's on Kickstarter!\" - Ron Gilbert (Monkey Island 1&2, Maniac Mansion)\n\"Never in our wildest dreams did we think we\u2019d be playing a video game about our actual lives! We\u2019re so ready.\" - Huffington Post\n\"Now that I think about it, 'point and clit' is pretty clever.\" - The Cliqist\n    Queer Quest is set in a gayborhood in the Pacific Northwest.  It is a story driven puzzle game that explores the oddballs that shape a community.  There's a wide range of characters, most based on real people in a real community.  \nQueer Quest was inspired by a protest that happened a few years ago in Portland, OR.  There was a physical assault on a queer couple, and the organized response was for folks to hold hands across a bridge.  That protest inspired me to make this game.  Queer Quest is about how community responds to tragedy.\n       (in order left to right from photo)\nHagen Deloss ... Art\nMo Cohen ... Programming / Writing / Design\nMaria Del Castillo ... Music\n(Not pictured: Nick Sahoyah who drops by and helps with comedic & puzzle refinement, Emily Madly who did the character concept art, and Vincent Cruz who does the tarot art. \"WHAT TAROT ART?\" You ask? You'll have to play to find out.)\nI'm raising money in order to pay the team a fair wage.  Art, animation and music is all time consuming, and working on a shoe-string budget is rough and slow.  Donating to this Kickstarter will directly help expand the small, yet growing, canon of queer video games.  This is a passion project that I've been scoping for years and finally built enough skills to start developing.  I've been paying for art and music out of pocket, working a full-time day job while developing Queer Quest at night.  And it isn't sustainable, so now I turn to my communities of queers, gamers, and everyone else who needs this game to exist as much as I do.\nThe bulk of the money will go to paying for art and animation.  Point-and-click adventure games are really graphic heavy and since I'm contributing the programming/writing for free, the next highest cost is the art.  After that, a chunk goes to taxes, fees, music, rewards, marketing, and equipment.  A small percentage ( < .001% ) might also go to flavor blasted cheddar goldfish, because we eat a lot of those.\nPending successful Kickstarter, we plan to launch the game in the next three years, because we want to take the time to do it right. If this Kickstarter fails, this project will take around ten years to complete if I continue to fund out of pocket.  \n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny indie game company risks running out of money, burn out, over-scoping. Making a game is really fun sometimes and really tedious other times. I document all of the challenges that come up in the dev blog if you're interested in reading how many hats one person can wear at the same time. But I wouldn't worry about my dedication to making this project happen, I've been planning this game for four years now, all the while I've been building up my programming skills, writing plot points and puzzles, and fearing that someone would beat me to making this game first.

We hold an open call for submissions starting on Oct. 1 and by Oct. 31 have an ebook published and files to the printer for a physical book.\nPrevious years have produced Vampyr Verse, The Hungry Dead, Halloween Haiku, Cthulhu Haiku, Cthulhu Haiku II, Halloween Haiku II, and Zen of the Dead.\nSeven years of horror!\n  This year the title is Lupine Lunes, featuring werewolves and the lune poetry format, though other horror tropes and forms are welcome (see below). \n                    Call for Submissions\nOne of the things we love about Halloween is that people are willing to \"dress up.\" So even if you've never thought of yourself as a poet or short-story author, why not give it a chance?\nShort submissions can be sent directly via Popcorn Press's \"Contact Us\" page. For longer submissions, send a query via that page, and we'll respond by email.\nAccepted submissions will earn:\n1 free copy of the ebook; \npayment based on page length*;\n\"Author\" status at PopcornPress.com (with special pricing on most items). \nSubmission grants Popcorn Press the right to publish the work in the book. All other rights are retained by the author.\nAnd yes, we will consider works previously published elsewhere. (No simultaneous submissions, please.)\nWhat We're Looking for . . .\nFiction: Short stories dealing with werewolves are preferred, but Halloween or horror in general are welcome. We're generally more impressed by great mood pieces than by gore. \nPoems: We're suckers for good formal prose, but free verse will also be considered. Given the \"lunes\" of the title, we're especially interested in well-crafted lunes and other short forms: haiku, senryu, tanka, and sijo. (See our \"Poetic Forms: Haiku, Senryu, Tanka, and Lunes\" blog entry.) We also love cleverly written sonnets. \nExperimental poetry forms are also welcome. For further insight, we recommend reading our \"The GUP Method for Creative Writing\" blog entry. And note that if a piece strikes us as genuine and unique, we're happy to work with you on polish.\n*Payment: We believe writers should be paid for their work. In past years we have paid $1 per half page filled (devoting a half-page to each haiku or other short poem). This year payment will be based on the success of the Kickstarter, with each contributor receiving one share in the final profits for each half page filled. (Our cover designer will get a flat 10 shares; our editor is working for free.)\nDeadline for submissions is Oct. 23.

You can play the prologue (with a playtime of around 60 minutes) right now and make your decision to support us, afterwards. Click here to play now (PC, Mac, Linux)!\n           During the campaign we've come up with several community challenges, that unlocked awesome new content in Code 7. They have all been successful so there are three side stories and characters in the final game.\nLinnea, a teacher at Oriens-Station on Mars, will confess to you that she has smuggled her twin sister Jenna onto the station, because administration has denied her stay. They both share Linnea's identity. But when her sister suddenly goes missing, she gets worried someone could have found out and asks you for help to find out what happened to her.\nMarco is a car mechanic, living in New Berlin with his family. After an incident, he will save your friends and asks you to retrieve a very special file from the location your heading, in return. A file that reveals that he hasn't always been \"just\" a mechanic.\nBlue is highly skilled technology thief, who breaks into the location you will be infiltrating in Episode 3. Your paths will cross and make things a little more complicated. Will you be able to work together or will you be in each other's way?  \nModern Feeling \u2013 Code 7 is a fully voiced text adventure, with animations, music and sound effects! \nAccessible \u2013 Don't worry if you're not a fast typer, the game will help you with auto-complete, maps and more. There is also a prototype version for visually impaired people, it can be found here.\n\nSymbiosis - Team up with the main characters of each episode. Talk to, navigate and protect them and in return they will help you.\nEpic \u2013 Travel through the universe to stop the deadly Code 7 virus over the course of six episodes.\nAtmospheric \u2013 Your mind will create the setting of the story. Let us show you how creepy things can be when you don't see them.\nMultiple Endings \u2013 There are important choices you will have to make in every chapter which then determine how the finale, Episode 5, plays out.\nAround 8 hours of gameplay \u2013 Depending on your playstyle, each episode will have a playtime of around 1.5 hours. \nIndie \u2013 We, Kevin Glaap and Zein Okko, are an independent team, and we want to stay that way, evolving this project together with you, the backers!\n    Humanity longs for the stars and is about to leave Earth behind to settle in new galaxies. Previously, a small team of professionals sets out to establish the first interstellar colony but the station has abruptly and mysteriously gone silent. \nTwo agents, Sam and Alex, are sent to find out what happened and find themselves face to face with an A.I. that threatens the whole of humanity. Now it is up to them to stop it, find out the true motives of the A.I. and what Code 7 exactly is. \nAnd when a third force enters the ring, it becomes even harder to distinguish who is a friend, who is a foe, what is reality, and what is the truth.\n  The whole game is an MS-DOS-like system you use to solve puzzles and advance in the storyline.  Special commands manipulate objects in the game, hack into systems to get information or passwords, and communicate with characters so they can be your eyes, ears, and hands as you help navigate them through dangerous environments.\nYou will have a list of available commands depending on where the characters are or how you are connected to the network. The commands are linked so you can access system hierarchies.\nA command always consist of at least two words, for example: door.unlock. However, commands can also be longer, such as system.interface.bgcolor.setblue.\n  Each episode will introduce a new character (or characters) whom Alex will have to work with, together, as a team. You will have to make important decisions that will influence their course in the story and define their relationship with you in the final episode (provided, that is, they survive...).\nDepending on your choices, characters will think of you as a friend or an enemy and the finale in Episode 5 will change, accordingly.\n  In the course of the game, you will learn various hacking techniques to solve puzzles and break into systems, like the Brute Force or the Man-In-The-Middle-Attack.\nThe latter will be embedded in mini games that increase in complexity over the course of the game. We want you to not only feel like a hacker but also gain a rough understanding of what hackers do.\nThe game features a minimal map which shows the location of the main character and the surrounding area.\nYou will have an overview of the area, but the people you're talking to won't, so you have to navigate them from location to location to investigate.\n Sometimes you will have to help them sneak past dangerous individuals.\nThe puzzles in Code 7 are very versatile and most of the time are a combination of the above mentioned mechanics. Sometimes, you'll just need to find a login-name and password, another time you'll need to equalize the pressure levels of two rooms and at another place you'll have to get rid of a bunch of robots guarding an important computer. We plan to have different approaches to a lot of puzzles, so you can use your creativity to solve them. In Episode 0 for example you will have to deal with an evil robot, and there are two different ways of doing so. We want to have a lot more ways to solve puzzles in the future!\n  With Code 7 we want to create a deep and thrilling atmosphere, that's why it's so important to us to have good and fitting audio. We have already mentioned the great voice actors, but we also implement a variety of sound effects to go along with what the characters do or experience in the game. The Soundtrack is specifically composed for the game and is done by Zein. Listen to the Soundtrack of Episode 0 on Spotify.\n    Goodwolf Studio is a small, independent game developer based in Germany, founded by Zein Okko and Kevin Glaap.\n  We are working together with the sound studio Knights of Soundtrack to find and record professional voice actors.\nWe already have two great voice actors on board: Jessica Carroll and Jack Luceno, who are voicing Sam and Bradley in the Prologue and did an amazing job portraying those characters. We hope to work together with more great actors when the Kickstarter is successful. \nJessica Carroll talks a bit about her character Sam and the experience she's had so far. Watch the video:\nPLAY\n\n  We're two people, creating this game. We put a lot of effort, money and time into it. Now we need your help to finish the remaining five episodes. Since we have an explicit need for the money, we're dividing the money usage pie charts into what we'd do with the 15000\u20ac and what we'd use any additional backing for.\nA very important part of Code 7 is that the dialogues are all voiced by professional actors, which greatly helps the atmosphere and storytelling. Good voice actors, however, are very expensive. We went all-in to create the prologue but we need your help for the remaining five episodes. Help us raise 15.000\u20ac to give the Code 7 characters the voices they deserve!\n  Any backing that goes beyond the initial- or stretch-goal financing (see above) will be used to further develop the overall quality of the game. \n  You can join our Facebook group for discussions on the game and connected topics, answers to your questions and special challenges for this campaign. We hope that through your participation in the discussions we can make Code 7 the best it can be. Give us your honest feedback, show your support or just take part in raffles. We're happy to welcome you into the community. Join the community now.\nFacebook Group\nTwitter\nSubreddit\nDevlog\nWe also already got through Steam Greenlight last year! You can read about our experience with it here.\n                                    Have a look at this table to get an overview on what tier contains what.\n  The following images of the physical rewards are just previews. The final products might not be 100% the same, but they will be very similar. \n        You've made it all the way to the bottom of the page. Good for you!

In any case, we will always keep you updated and if any delay should occur, we will communicate it in time.\nWe'll try our best to not let that happen, though.\n\nIf we fail to raise the money, we will try to finish the game on a smaller scale.

You'll hear from us again!\nPlease visit www.7thSeaRPG.com for the latest news.\nVoyage of Fortune\u2019s Star is our single-player, 3D, story-driven, computer roleplaying game based in the rich world of Th\u00e9ah as presented in John Wick\u2019s tabletop roleplaying game, 7th Sea. We have a team of experienced storytellers, programmers and designers to bring you 10+ hours of incredible experience.\nHere's the story we want to tell!\nNow captain of the feared pirate vessel Fortune\u2019s Star, former Vodaccan duelist Anzolo Zorzi has a fearsome reputation, a loyal crew, and one of the fastest blades in all of Th\u00e9ah. But he also has a heart of gold. When he arrives at the scene of a naval battle to claim plunder from both winner and loser but salvages only an enormous stone sarcophagus that floats on the water, Anzolo has no notion that he\u2019s embarked on the strangest\u2014and most dangerous\u2014voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star. Anzolo expects to recover gold and jewels from the sealed tomb, but instead discovers a most surprising and long-missing clue that may allow the renowned Kreuzritter to defeat the legendary Schattenmann, a scissors-fingered creature that terrorizes that forests of Eisen. Unfortunately for Anzolo, and perhaps for the knights as well, the Kreuzritter require the pirate\u2019s assistance.\nFortunately, Anzolo has a guardian angel looking over him. Magdalena Salvaza is the Fate Witch currently entrusted with the generations-old duty of waiting for this moment. The Fate Witches of her line expected to guide someone of greater character than Anzolo Zorzi, but Magdalena\u2019s confidence in the pirate captain grows as she learns about his past and as she observes him in the present. Even as Anzolo faces dangers, forces allied with the Schattenmann understand that defeating Magdalena is the true key to foiling the Kreuzritter\u2019s ancient plans.\nCan we make this game for \"only\" $200k?\nAbsolutely!\nMy partners at Fuel.Tech wanted to provide a specific example of how we can stretch a smaller amount of money quite a long ways given 3D resources that are available. and below I present the result. They purchased a \"dungeon\" asset for $80 and spent about eight hours lightly modifying it before introducing our model of Anzolo Zorzi to create a gameplay scene. This process allows the team to avoid a lot of the heavy-lifting of building core assets and instead concentrate of modifying the asset to suit the specific needs of the game and story.\nThis is the brief description of the scene that Fuel.Tech opted to build:\nAlready in possession of a strange sarcophagus and its even stranger contents, Anzolo Zorzi, pirate captain of Fortune\u2019s Star, seeks a Syrneth artifact in the bowels of Iskandar.\nHere's the resulting gameplay clip:\nPLAY\n\nHere are some key elements of Voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star:\nYou primarily experience the story in the role of the captain of Fortune\u2019s Star, Anzolo Zorzi.\nWe hope to add the overlapping storyline of the Fate Witch, Magdalena Salvaza, so that for sequences of the game she becomes the primary character under your control.\nYou have a large crew of pirates and will be able to direct their actions as well.\nWhether you experience it only from Anzolo\u2019s point-of-view or if we can also add Magdalena\u2019s narrative, the story is our priority. Experienced, award-winning writers will craft a rich, dialogue-based narrative.\nThe game is built in Unreal Engine 4 and features action RPG gameplay.\nThe game is available as a digital release, as well as in standard and collector\u2019s boxed editions loaded with extras.\nWe\u2019re initially developing versions for PC, Mac and Linux.\nDigital release is to backers via Steam and also DRM-free.\nWe have many language options planned, including English, Italian, French, German and Spanish.\n  Update #1 reveals more about the Schattenmann!\nUpdate #2 shows our game budget and provides more information about Fuel.Tech, the team who will produce the game. \nUpdate #3 discusses the expertise of my partners at Fuel.Tech and why we CAN make this game. And there's a great new gameplay video too!\nUpdate #4 talks about the crew of Fortune's Star and diversity in 7th Sea TTRPG and our cRPG.\nOur first update also introduced six Social Stretch Goals to gain exclusive in-game items for all backers. Here is the progress on those:\nShare the Facebook post: 122/100 (SUCCESS!)\nBackers only will receive a Zephyr Bag in-game item!\nKeep sharing!

Note that you may now choose between sets of 3d6 or 3d10. The dice are pictured in Add-Ons below.\nThe two digital-only pledges for our project \u2014 Digital and Special Digital \u2014 offer two options: \u201cFirst Mate\u201d & \u201cCrew\u201d. The \u201cFirst Mate\u201d pledges offer a slight discount over the \u201cCrew\u201d pledges. We offer the \u201cFirst Mate\u201d pledge as thanks for those who back our project until it has funded. Once our project is funded, the First Mate pledges will be closed.\nWhy offer a First Mate pledge? There\u2019s a reason for you and a reason for us.\nFor you: It\u2019s thanks for your early support for our project. Some Kickstarter projects offer an \u201cearly bird\u201d reward, so this is a bit like that. We want everyone who helps us reach our funding goal to be considered an \u201cearly bird\u201d and this method allows us to do that.\nFor us: Early momentum is key on Kickstarter. If offering a discount on pledges to early supporters helps convince you to support the project, then it\u2019s worth offering the discount so that the project has a chance to grow even bigger over the course of the month.\n  7th Sea was reborn as a tabletop roleplaying game here on Kickstarter earlier this year. It was a huge success. In fact, it became Kickstarter\u2019s highest-funded, most-backed tabletop RPG of all time. The game is one of swashbuckling and intrigue, exploration and adventure, taking place on the continent of Th\u00e9ah, a land of magic and mystery inspired by our own Europe. Players take the roles of heroes thrown into global conspiracies and sinister plots, exploring ancient ruins of a race long vanished, and protecting the rightful kings and queen of Th\u00e9ah from murderous villains.\nTh\u00e9ah is made up of a number of Nations, each with its own character and personality. The concept of \u201cnation\u201d is new to Th\u00e9ah, only emerging in the last century or so. National identity has also begun to spread among the people, making culture more than just an expression of the monarch\u2019s tastes. The current Nations of Th\u00e9ah represent the whole of the civilized world\u2014as far as the Th\u00e9ans are concerned.\nAvalon: Green and enchanted, this union of three kingdoms has recently risen to the forefront of Th\u00e9an politics.\nCastille: Headquarters of the Vaticine church, this fertile Nation recently fought off an invasion\u2014their western neighbor, Montaigne, wished to seize their rich farmlands and plentiful mines.\nEisen: A proud land recovering from a thirty-year war. A Nation of veterans, Eisen is also a land of horrors let loose by three decades of mass murder.\nHighland Marches: To the north of Avalon are men and women made strong by a harsh land. The Highlanders\u2019 greatest desire is freedom at any cost.\nInismore: The Emerald Isle is the rebellious, misbehaving little brother of Avalon, led by a king who may be immortal and is more than certainly mad.\nMontaigne: One of Th\u00e9ah\u2019s most powerful Nations, leading the world in art and culture even as its Emperor crushes the populace beneath his thumb.\nSarmatian Commonwealth: Two Nations bound by a single crown, the Commonwealth is a democratic monarchy where all people are equal, even kings.\nUssura: A Nation torn between two ambitious rulers who will do anything to drag their Nation into the future, no matter the cost.\nVestenmennavenjar: A Nation of raiders and warlords who conquered the world\u2019s economy by hammering their swords and spears into coins.\nVodacce: The former cradle of civilization (and Anzolo's home!), now split between seven Merchant Princes whose complex schemes reach every corner of the world.\nMap of Th\u00e9ah\nSwashbuckling and Sorcery\n7th Sea is a world where an order of musketeers guards the lives of the nobility, but also the virtues of honor, integrity and fraternity. It is a world of sharp blades and sharp wits, where a cutting retort can be just as deadly as a sword\u2019s point. It is also a world where the nobility control the most powerful force of all\u2014sorcery. Powerful magic pulses in the hearts of the noble class, power that was given to them long ago. Some assume the forms of animals. Others rip through the fabric of reality or play with the forces of Fate itself. The hard edge of steel coupled with the shadowy substance of sorcery: that is the world of 7th Sea.\nPiracy and Adventure\nThe pirates of 7th Sea are united by a common cause: freedom. Freedom from the tyranny of sorcerers and kings. Freedom from the shackles of the Church of the Prophets. Freedom from greedy landowners and moneylenders. Pirates sail where they want, take what they please and live a life of freedom unknown by any other in the world of 7th Sea.\nDiplomacy and Intrigue\nIn the world of 7th Sea, kingdoms are on the verge of becoming countries. In the courts of kings and queens, diplomats dressed in powdered wigs, lace and silk try to resolve the disputes of Nations. A swelling tide of nationalism grows in the hearts of men and women, and a new kind of conflict\u2014covert warfare\u2014is finding its way into the world.\nArchaeology and Exploration\nBeyond the kingdoms of The\u0301ah lie the ruins of an ancient civilization, lost centuries ago: the vast cities of Lost Syrneth. Who knows what ancient secrets and treasures remain, unseen by human eyes, untouched by human hands? Men and women who call themselves \u201carchaeologists\u201d unearth these treasures and bring them back to noble hands.\nVoyage of Fortune\u2019s Star is first and foremost a story experience. We\u2019ll follow Anzolo Zorzi, a former duelist who is now Captain of Fortune\u2019s Star. Arriving at the scene of a naval battle, Anzolo and his crew are astonished to see a stone sarcophagus churn to the surface of the ocean. Clearly valuable, impenetrable to instruments at sea, and too heavy to load, the sarcophagus is set in tow. Thus begins the next chapter of Anzolo\u2019s life\u2026and sets in motion the centuries-old duty that has fallen to Magdalena Salvaza, a Fate Witch far-removed yet ever-present.\nAnzolo will discover that the sarcophagus offers not treasure but rather responsibility, but as a scoundrel with a heart-of-gold he\u2019s unable to set aside the task that falls to him. Dark forces descend upon him almost immediately, but if the Fate Witch who watches over him\u2014and who gradually falls in love with him\u2014upholds her ancient vows, Anzolo will have an opportunity to defeat an ages old evil that has stalked the land.\nThe legendary Schattenmann is an emaciated monster that stands twenty feet tall and inflicts horror on men and women who defile the forests of Eisen where it dwells. It seeks to inflict even more harm as the powers that have held its evil in check are fading. Even the renowned Kreuzritter (Crusaders) are caught off guard by the beast\u2019s sudden ferocity and brazen, horrific attacks on areas into which it never ventured before.\nOne of the Kreuzritter delivers a message by most unexpected means to Anzolo and steers the pirate captain onto a heroic path he\u2019s never before embraced. But as the bearer of hard-won knowledge, confronted by a murderous and seemingly unstoppable foe, and seeking to impress the strange dark woman who manipulates events to his favor, Anzolo embarks on his strangest voyage yet.\nMagdalena Salvaza, a Fate Witch\n  Built as a single-player experience, Voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star features Diablo-style point-and-click gameplay, though the play experience as a whole is story-driven. The story unfolds on board the Fortune\u2019s Star as well as at several different ports and inland locations. The number of locations as well as some specifics of gameplay will be determined by the final funding total of this project, but players will be able to assume control of a single character such as Anzolo Zorzi or other members of the crew. In addition, some sequences will require the player to control many characters at once in order to survive a threat or unravel a puzzle.\nBelow is the clip featured in the project video of Anzolo battling wraiths on the deck of Fortune's Star.\nPLAY\n\n    While our game emphasizes the story, we\u2019re not relying on that alone! The design team has vast tech experience from designing games and apps for entertainment and Fortune 500 companies. Voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star will be a 3D graphics-rich game built in Unreal Engine 4. We\u2019re already building and collecting assets. More samples of this preliminary work can be seen in the project video.\nMinimum System Requirements\nWindows\nOS: Windows XP SP3/Vista/Windows 7 & 8\nProcessor: x86-compatible 1.8GHz or faster processor\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\nGraphics: DirectX compatible 3D graphics card with at least 256MB of addressable memory\nDirectX: Version 9.0\nStorage: 10 GB available space\nMac\nOS: OSX 10.6\nProcessor: Intel-based Macs only (x86-compatible, 1.8GHz or better)\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\nGraphics: Modern 3D graphics card with at least 256MB of addressable memory\nStorage: 10 GB available space\nImportant note: Minimum system requirements are subject to change as hardware and software evolves over the next year or so.\n  The game will feature original music by the team of Steve Sechi (Composer/Sound Designer) and Kostas Varotsis (Orchestrator/Conductor/Composer). Steve has composed and produced over 200 albums of music for production libraries in the US, UK, and Canada and his music has been used on hundreds of TV shows and films. Kostas has won the Beethoven Award (Bonn, Germany) and a Gold Medal for Orchestral Conducting (Reims, France). Together they have recorded live orchestral projects, which may bear on a future stretch goal!\nWe're featuring music by Steve and Kostas in our project video. Here...take a listen:\nHere's a version with the choir:\nAnd here's a version without choir:\n    There\u2019s almost no wrong answer to this. Because pirates! Because adventure and romance! Because it\u2019s new (again)! And the truth is just as simple as these examples. Here are the three key reasons we selected 7th Sea as the property on which to base what we hope will be the first of many computer roleplaying games:\n1. 7th Sea is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game. Not only is TTRPG something Stewart knows a lot about, but it\u2019s also a proven basis for successful translation to computer games, e.g. Shadowrun Returns.\n2. Stewart Wieck and John Wick. Sometimes it\u2019s who you know! The fact that John knows Stewart and that John and his team trust Stewart and his team with this great property is not only a compliment, but also essential to produce a game of this size. John Wick Presents has already been a most gracious licensing partner.\n3. The 7th Sea TTRPG had a *huge* Kickstarter. We absolutely hope to convince a large number of the more than 11,000 backers of the TTRPG to support our cRPG project.\n  7th Sea Second Edition\n  Stewart Wieck founded White Wolf in the time when desktop publishing programs were very new to market. Suddenly, publishers on a shoestring budget could produce professional publications. We\u2019ve entered a similar era for digital entertainment. Sure, there are really big budget games that remain beyond the reach of new and small computer game companies, but suddenly a crew of talented and dedicated individuals can create games that used to be the province of larger companies and larger budgets only.\nKickstarter itself has narrowed this gap even further. We\u2019re not creating a $50 million blockbuster game, but even risking the several hundred thousand dollars required to create the game we envision remains a tremendous burden. Your Kickstarter pledge removes this risk and allows us to focus on making the best game possible knowing that we have an established audience waiting for the game.\nYour pledge means we don\u2019t have to be a developer beholden to a game publisher. Your pledge makes you the publisher! As any game creator will tell you, we make games because we want people to play them, and if our players are also our publishers, then we\u2019re paying complete attention to exactly the right set of people.\nWe are infinitely grateful to you for the faith you place in us with your pledge. Stewart has delivered on countless products throughout a thirty year career in gaming. The designers at Fuel.Tech have delivered multi-million dollar projects to some of the world\u2019s largest corporations.\n  The cRPG pledge levels at SPECIAL DIGITAL and above all include these two backer-only packages of bonus character moves and animations:\nCombat Moves Package \u2014 This is an assortment of a dozen bonus moves for Anzolo Zorzi. Execute these acrobatic attacks to achieve special results. We may add more moves as well as moves for other characters as stretch goals.\nMotion-Capture Package \u2014 We\u2019ll fly John Wick and other special guests to Houston to join Stewart Wieck and any backers who pledge at BOATSWAIN and higher for the opportunity for a green screen motion-capture session. All of these moves from zany to well-considered (perhaps including Walking the Plank) will become character animations available within the game and are included as rewards for everyone who pledges at SPECIAL DIGITAL or higher.\nIn-game image of Anzolo's lunging attack.\n  The pledge levels to the right do not offer every possible permutation of digital and physical rewards that you may desire. Therefore, please feel free to add an the amount to your pledge for any of these \u201cAdd Ons\u201d. To keep things simpler after the project, please only include digital add-ons for digital-only pledge levels. If your pledge level includes physical rewards, then you may add any of these rewards. (Note that physical rewards always include the digital versions too.)\nYou\u2019ll tell us the exact Add-Ons that you want in the survey later.\n  Gold Doubloon (1.5\"metal)\u2014 *art & design not final*\n  Custom d6 and d10 from left to right: Anzolo (swords), Magdalena (eye & web), Schattenmann (sun disrupts darkness) \u2014 *art & design not final*\n  Mock-up of the Anzolo Zorzi figurine. Final figure will be painted.\nFigure Scale: The Anzolo Zorzi and Magdalena Salavaza figures will be pre-painted 32mm figures while the Schattenmann figure (representing a 20-foot tall beast that roams the forests of Eisen) will be more than 3x that tall!\nBuried Treasure is a special Add-On available as digital-only or as a physical reward. Every other month for twelve months following the release of Voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star we\u2019ll create a treasure map and a story hook regarding how Anzolo Zorzi comes into possession of the map. Follow the map and clues in-game to discover bonus loot and additional game encounters. The physical version of this reward is a special leather scroll case (each one unique) in which we\u2019ll ship six sheets of parchment on which you may print the map that you receive digitally.\n  Voyage of Fortune\u2019s Star becomes a reality when the total of all backer pledges reaches $200k. If we continue to gain support for the project after the game is funded then we will use the additional funds to add to the game. More story. More features. More music. With enough support we\u2019ll even add completely new types of gameplay options, like VR. Everything added by stretch goals is at no additional cost to you!\n  Your ship: Fortune's Star!\n  All the physical rewards in this project ship \u201ccustoms-free\u201d to Europe, Canada and Australia/New Zealand. This means we\u2019ll ship them to you from distribution centers within those economic zones. Since we\u2019ll pay the fees for these rewards when we ship to the distribution centers, you\u2019ll owe nothing extra when you receive your package.\n  We\u2019re collecting the same shipping amount from everyone who pledges for a physical reward. This means we\u2019re collecting the same amount whether you live in the USA or New Zealand. Obviously, though, it will cost us a lot more to ship to the latter. We\u2019re doing this for two main reasons:\nShipping charges may go up in the year from now until we\u2019re ready to send your rewards.\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how much all of these rewards will weigh, so it\u2019s difficult to make an estimate even at current shipping rates.\nWe\u2019ll collect any additional shipping due when we send surveys for the project. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll tell us about the add-ons you want as well as provide your shipping address. We expect that the amount we\u2019re charging now means nothing more will be due from backers in the USA, but everyone outside the USA will owe a bit more, from about +$5 in Canada to +$40 for a destination like Brazil.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStewart Wieck has been in gaming since he began as an RPG freelancer in the mid-1980s and soon thereafter founded White Wolf in 1986.

And we aren't just talking about the classic \"he's a bad guy or he's not\" clue. The Virtual Moderator knows what role everyone is and generates nuanced clues for you based on the current state of the game, in real time!\nNo Dying - Other social deduction games don't let you play anymore when the group votes you out, and dying on the first night is the worst. In L90: The Origin, if you make a mistake, you simply switch teams and keep playing! \nReal-Time Events - Instead of waiting for night time to fall, you can take the action on your mobile device whenever you want, in real-time. This means there's no \"sleeping\" like in other social deduction games, and no need for a moderator.\nCooperative Gameplay - As a researcher, share your own data and contribute to the growing collective knowledge.  Can you solve the mystery before its too late?  As an infected, focus on high priority targets and protect your Masters! \nDeception - As the infection spreads and grows, so too does the paranoia and distrust. Researchers might have determined that their best friend was safe before, but did they make a mistake and get infected? Who can you trust?\nNever Hopeless - Even if you're the last remaining human Researcher, you can still win the game if you can figure out who the Infected Masters are.  Infected Masters who get found out can still \"feed\" their minions, causing them to get stronger.\n\"Buy The Box\" - With your $10 pledge, you have the ability to host this game with as many people as you can fit in a room! Other people can join in on their devices for free, just the same as if you had brought a traditional board game to a friend's house.\nThough the game uses your mobile device, it is still a traditional social deduction game that's played in the real world! Your fellow Researchers are an enormous source of information. Make sure you share any information and work together. Of course, you'll also need to stay vigilant and look for hidden nods, meaningful looks, and subtle whispers...\nA Deeper Look At How To Play:\n     You\u2019re a scientist. You never believed in ghost stories or things that go bump in the night. You graduated top of your class and accepted this mission in the arctic circle because you were the best. So explain yourself. Explain what\u2019s happening. Explain how the door that could stop a truck was found flung from its hinges. Explain the sounds. Explain why you\u2019re hiding under your desk with your dinner knife and saying prayers to any deity whose name you\u2019ve ever heard? You\u2019re a scientist, damnit. Explain yourself.\nYou are an Antarctic Researcher, part of a team of elite scientists posted at an Antarctic Research Station. An ancient life form, trapped beneath the ice for millennia, has infected one of the others, taking their form and hiding in plain sight. It is the most powerful Infected Master, and it calls itself \u201cThe Origin.\u201d To figure out who the Infected Masters are, you and your fellow Researchers will use all your training as scientists \u2014 Isolate biological samples, conduct experiments to gain clues, and perform tests on your \u201cteammates\u201d, but be careful! The Infected Masters can spread their Infection through their own biological samples, taking over the Researchers\u2019 bodies, and turning them into their Infected Minions.\n            The \"Researcher,\" \"Corruptor,\" \"The Origin,\" and \"Overlord\" backer levels all get your likeness into the game as a playable character!

Programmer by day, board-game super hero by night, Al\u2019s dream game is the one that has no rules and all the fun.  \nNick Keith: Being a Program Manager pays the bills, but Nick\u2019s true calling is making and breaking games. He strongly believes that games need to be more than just what comes in the box\u2026 community, friendship, memories. Oh, and he always keeps his word in Risk. \nGhost Roadhouse: The business unofficially started years ago on the campus of Eastern Michigan University. Nick and Al worked as managers in the game room, and on dead nights they would sit around the pool tables playing games with friends. \u201cSpud\u201d \u2013 who is still involved with Ghost Roadhouse today \u2013 challenged Al to make a game. Many games, years, and degrees later, Al and Nick decided to officially launch Ghost Roadhouse.\n  We have worked for over two years designing, prototyping, testing, and playing L90: The Origin, and we have funded it completely with our own money, simply because we have faith in the product. Our experiences at a multitude of conventions all tell us a similar story: people love the game. We are confident that we can deliver everything promised at or before the deadlines outlined above, and we will do our best to bring value to the amazing people that have faith in us. We are grateful for everything that our fans have done for us so far, and we will do everything that we can to pay it back to them. We are not asking for anything extra beyond what we have budgeted to make the game -- we're not even budgeting to pay ourselves back for what we've invested so far. We really just want to get the game made and in the hands of the fans that have been so patiently waiting to be able to download and play with their friends. Thank you so much for taking the time to check us out.\n-Nick and Al\nMade with \u2764 by Ghost Roadhouse\nMusic: http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnder-promise and over-deliver.

Enter a fresh fantasy world. A wonderous place of science, adventure and mystery. A home for homunculi, chimeras and master alchemists. Explore forgotten places like a homunculus factory in a volcano and a submerged temple in a swamp. Advance through them using all your alchemical knowledge!\n     Alkimya is an action-adventure game based entirely on alchemy, that lets you create your own potions and use them as bombs, tonics and sword oils. Besides fighting against fearsome enemies and huge bosses, you will have to solve puzzles and transform your environment to become a true master alchemist!\n  - Make your own potions: Combine Air and Fire to create Lightning. Change flasks to transform an explosion into a barrier. YOU are the alchemist! YOU are in charge of the recipes!\n - Interactive Environments: Through alchemy, raise the water level of a lake, cross a river by creating ice platforms, use the wind to move objects, lightning to start an engine. Through alchemy, you control your surroundings!\n - Elemental Puzzles: Use your wits to solve challenging puzzles using only potions. Finding the right elements and the proper flask is key to your success!\n - Real time tactical combat: Choose your potions wisely to face different enemies. Discover the way to defeat them and their elemental resistance/weakness. You can slow the time while aiming too! Use the battlefield in your favor!\n - Local co-op mode: Call on a companion to play the main story with you as Pan, the cute flying homunculus, to help you in combat, solve puzzles and collect resources.\n       Alchemy systems are usually very boring and frustrating in most RPGs we\u2019ve played. You gather tons of resources, follow strict recipes, and the potions don't usually do a lot. The truth is that alchemy is always an optional system. It can make your journey easier, but it doesn't feel very rewarding for having spent so many hours learning the system. \n     We think that alchemy gameplay can be so much more interesting than that. It can be spontaneous, fun and dynamic. No recipes. Discovery and mixture are the words that spring to mind when we think about it. In our heads, we have an exciting image of an alchemist deftly choosing ingredients from his bag to make a potion while facing off against a dangerous enemy! Almost like a very creative inventor searching for a way out of a terrible situation.\n     Here are some points of reference we've assembled to complement this exciting image:\n- Magicka: very quick and dynamic spell creation\n- The Legend of Zelda: use of items to fight, solve puzzles and explore new places\n- Fullmetal Alchemist: very fun alchemical universe\n- CD Projekt Red: listen to your players and reward them\n                 Alkimya takes place in an abandoned land that once was the cradle of Alchemy, but has now been devastated by an old war. Test subjects from decades of experiments have escaped and made the region their lair.\nSeth and Pan\n     Seth is a young man who wakes up in an abandoned field, confused and with no memories, but some basic alchemy knowledge. He starts his journey to survive and recover his identity.\n   Pan is a mysterious homunculus. She finds Seth passed out, and feeling a special connection, decides to guide him through his journey.\n     Together, they will explore the land of Isur, abandoned home of brilliant alchemists, facing mortal danger in an adventure that will test their friendship and their self-knowledge.\nIsur Region\n       Alkimya is an Action-Adventure game with multiple regions. You will explore places like an abandoned city, an alchemy laboratory hidden in the woods, and a destroyed homunculus factory inside a volcano. Each region has many challenges, hidden secrets and a unique dungeon with an exciting boss battle waiting just for you!\n        Alchemists need ingredients to create potions and they can be found anywhere: dropped by animals, plants, rocks and destructible objects. There are many different types with a multitude of uses, and some are a lot harder to find than others.\n     Primary elements are the most special ingredients, giving elemental properties to a potion. They are usually found in living beings. Each element produces a potion's unique special effect, such as killing chance, burn, critical damage, etc.\n     With the proper ingredients in hand, potions can be created following 3 easy steps:\n        At any moment, a second player can join the game as Pan, a flying homunculus. She is a unique character and her abilities are very different from those of the main character, Seth. Pan is able to absorb bomb elements and use that power to do elemental attacks. Her handy wings allow her to reach new places. Pan is Seth's sidekick during his adventure, helping him gather ingredients and solve puzzles.\n     It can sometimes be difficult to gather 2 people together to play a co-op story mode. At the same time, it's so fun and rewarding to play with a friend or mate. With that in mind, we have created a local co-op mode that anyone can join/leave at any time. We miss the days when player 2 only had to press Start to join a game. So this is how Pan works: if player 2 presses Start, he/she will control her. If player 2 needs to leave, Pan will be controlled by an AI. This way, you can have fun with your whoever you want with no stress!\n        The music is being composed by the amazing and talented Yuri \u00c9deron. The music is sounding fantastic, and it sprung from a lot of influences: Final Fantasy, Mega Man, Zelda, Mario, and classic RPGs like Chrono Trigger. It's all great stuff. Check it out!\n   So why Kickstarter?  \n     Alkimya's cost is way higher than $20,000. But we decided to follow the indie way. There are other paths we could have taken, but the game's essence wouldn't have remained the same.\n    We are doing everything we can for the game with our own team: gameplay, 3D art, animation. We decided to invest all our personal time and money, but unfortunately, it wasn't enough. We eventually reached our limit with the game still requiring some specialized work.\n    We need to hire people for specific areas to accomplish our goal of delivering a unique experience! Alkimya still requires sound effects, more music, voice acting, animated cutscenes and localization. We are asking for a small, but crucial, amount of funding to improve the game. This is why we need your help!\nAnd the stretch goals?\n     All of the money received will be used to improve the game and create more content. We can achieve that by increasing our team size and hiring third-party services.\nBudget\n     There are fees, taxes and the costs of physical rewards, but the rest of the money will be used to further develop the game. We made this diagram to show how much of the total funding each area will need, but it is only an estimate, and it's based on our initial goal ($20,000).\n       Alkimya will only come to life with your help, and we really want to reward you for that! Besides the classic rewards (game, T-shirt, name in credits), you should be part of the project, developing the game along with us. If you feel there is something missing or you have an idea for a reward, please let us know!\n     There are 2 packs: Apprentice and Alchemist. The Apprentice pack has all basic goods: Steam Key, Beta Access, Name in Credits, News, Certificate, Wallpapers and any surprise that comes up along the way. The Alchemist pack has everything from The Apprentice plus Alpha Access, Soundtrack and Art Book.\n     If you want the PS4 or Xbox One copy, just add $5 to the pledge. For group pledges, such as Alchemists Guild (add $20) or Alchemists for Life (add $10). When you get a Console version, you will also get the Steam key too.\n                  We chose stretch goals that would allow us to develop extra content, allowing us to deliver a richer, and more dense game experience. Much of this content was part of our initial vision, but it was unfortunately cut due to our initial budget. These cuts allowed us to find the essence of Alkimya, however it would make us very happy to put these elements of our original vision back into the final version.\n     The stretch goals also allow us to invest in localization. For now, the game will be released in English and Brazilian Portuguese. When we hit a localization stretch goal, we will have a poll of what language you want for the game: Spanish, German, French, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Polish.\n     For Seth and Pan extra skins, we have the following themes: Alchemy War, Desert Survival, Dark Arts, Time Travel and Royalty. We are open for suggestions too. We'll open a poll for all backers to choose the new skin. The same will happen for the new elements: Life, Dark Matter, Aether (Space) and Summoning.\n     Besides all that, we wanted to give a surprise to two of our team members: Felipe and Polly. They have been dating for three years, and now Polly wants to marry him. We challenged Felipe to marry her if the game reaches $50k on Kickstarter. They won't receive any money for the wedding. It's just a challenge! Help us make this marriage happen!\n       We have been developing Alkimya since May 2014 (a little more than 2 years) and from the very start of this project, we had a team goal to stay close to players and listen to what they had to say. After less than a month of development, we took the project to a local event to have players test the gameplay and get their feedback. From that day on, we have been present at every event possible and have been talking to players every chance we\u2019ve got. We wanted to know what they expected from us and what they thought about Alkimya.\n   To be honest, it hasn\u2019t been an easy journey. Many people have entered and left the project. We've learned so much along the way that a lot of things had to be changed. Not all of them were easy changes, but there is one thing that remained untouched this whole time: the support we've gotten from the community. We want to thank you all for joining us on this journey. You give us strength to keep developing games and Alkimya has improved immeasurably because of you. Thank you very much! We love the project and hope to deliver not only a great game, but a truly unforgettable experience.\n     So this is the time we really need your support. If you like Alkimya, tell your friends, share on your social networks! We really want to bring this game to life and you are the one that can make this happen!\n         Bad Minions is a small indie games studio from Brazil. It\u2019s four years old now. In the first couple years, we developed mobile games, which allowed us to gain experience and level up. At some point, we decided to pursue our dreams and make bigger and better 3D games for PC and Consoles. Today, there are 4 people working directly on the development of Alkimya, and most of us worked in other game companies before. We have a lot of help from other devs too. The game dev community has been amazing to us and we couldn\u2019t be happier!\n     Our studio is also part of an indie house, which is the home of two other indie teams. We can say that it's an amazing group where everyone involved shares their experience and knowledge, helping each other to grow. It\u2019s also an environment where you can breathe game development at any time of the day.\n          Please, tell your friends about Alkimya if you like what you've seen! Share it on your social networks! Tell the press and your favorite YouTubers! We really need all of your support. You are the one that can make Alkimya a reality!\n             ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLet's do this as a QA!\n \nQ. \"I had terrible experiences with previous games I have backed. They simply didn't deliver what they promised: rewards, game quality, or even the game. Will it be the same with Alkimya?\"\nA. We too have become distrustful of game campaigns, but we always finish what we start. Even with tons of obstacles in our way. We have had many reasons we could have quit before now and we are still here. Alkimya will be released! We've invested 2 years of our lives into this game, and we can't quit now. If the campaign succeeds, it will help us to get closer to that goal, easing the burden. You will receive the game as promised, rest assured.\n \nQ. \"And the rewards?\"\nA. All the rewards were planned before the campaign. We know who will produce them and how they will be properly distributed so that you will receive them as promised. Right now, we are planning to deliver them a few weeks before game launch, but we can't guarantee that, because we'll be deeply involved in the game's launch. So there is always a possibility that physical rewards will arrive a few weeks later. All digital rewards will be delivered on game's launch (except for beta access, of course).\n \nQ. \"Great! And game's quality?\"\nA. We started the game 2 years ago. From the day we started, quality has only improved daily. Today our graphics are prettier than ever. Gameplay is feels better too. Also, we are only showing real in-game footage. No tricks. What you are seeing is what you'll get. It's very likely to get even better! \n \nQ. If the Kickstarter campaign fails, the game will be released?\nA. Absolutely. Unfortunately, we'll have to cut some of the cool stuff we are planning, and probably we'll have to put Alkimya in Early Access. But the game will be released. There is no turning back at this point.\n \nQ. \"9/10 games on Kickstarter are delayed. I know it will happen to you!\"\nA. It's very hard to plan the development with pinpoint accuracy. Something will always happen when you are not expecting it. Sometimes you go to a conference or an event, and while you are there game development completely stops. This is especially true for small teams like ours. There are a lot of small things that can delay the project. Individual delays you think will be nothing, but when they add up as a whole, it can turn into months. We want to finish the main game of Alkimya by January 2017. After that, we can polish it and add some cool stuff like easter eggs. We believe we can do this with time to spare, but there is always a possibility.\n \nQ. \"How about the risks involving Stretch Goals?\"\nA. Our intention is to deliver the stretch goals on the game's release date. It's possible that they may suffer some delay, but for now we are projecting that they will be ready for release at the same time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Bad Minions\nFirst created \u00b7 5 backed\nBad Minions is a small indie studio from Brazil.

Meet Russian Subway Dogs, a fast-paced action-arcade game inspired by the real-life stray dogs of the Moscow Metro. We have done extensive, totally legal research in order to fine-tune this chaotic simulation of what it's like to scavenge for food from Russian commuters. Surviving isn't easy when you are dodging volatile vodka, rival dogs, and the rare and dangerous Subway Bear!\nRussian Subway Dogs is already playable, super frantic, and fun. With your help we can make it bigger and better! We have some great rewards to thank you for backing us, and our talented team is raring to go!\nRussian Subway Dogs will be available through Steam and itch.io upon release, and we are aiming to launch simultaneously on Windows and Mac. \n  Levels inspired by the world-famous architecture of the Moscow subway system, rendered in meticulously detailed pixel art.\nMission mode filled with unique challenges from your kitty comrade the Proletaricat! \nAn extensive endless mode with online leaderboards. \nOver a dozen food and drink items to consume: gyros, burgers, cabbage, beets, herring, kvass, pigeon, pelmeni and more! \nDiverse subway wildlife including, rival dogs, poodles, rats, elk and bears!\nBomb your enemies with exploding vodka! \nSimple \"pick up and play\" gameplay with a deep scoring system to keep you coming back. \nSilky smooth 60fps gameplay. \nAdorable Russian puppers!\n  A round of Russian Subway Dogs is all about eating, eating eating! Consuming food both increases your score and keeps your stomach life bar full. \nScare up food by barking behind commuters, they'll throw whatever they're holding into the air.\n  Grab food before it hits the ground. Air food is both more filling and higher scoring. Avoid dropping your food and you'll rack up high scoring combos!\n  Watch out for passengers carrying vodka! It's no good for doggies and highly explosive.\n  Your barks can also deflect falling food or vodka. Well aimed vodka helps you get rid of rival dogs and wildlife and heats up your food. Hot food = more points and more filling meals!\n  Fail to eat enough or take too much damage and the round will end. Your doggie will have to head home to forage another day. \n  Unlike most score attack arcade games, Russian Subway Dogs is full of little touches of simulation, adding depth and emergent gameplay. Food can be warmed up with explosions to make it more filling. Hot food that isn't eaten quickly will burn away. Snowdrifts can be cleared away with vodka explosions but also melt faster if hit with hot food, cooling the food back down. Bears fatten up if overfed. Power-up items like coffee or kvass provide equally powerful upgrades to rival dogs who eat them. The more you play, the more of these touches you'll discover.\nAn angry bear burned by a vodka explosion eats a burger and fattens up.\n  The Moscow Metro does in fact have a population of stray dogs who commute each day in search of food. They've learned to identify specific stops, where they can find the best street food, and how to trick or surprise people into feeding them. There's even a statue at Mendeleevskaya station memorializing a famous stray, Malchik!\nphoto credit - englishrussia.com\nThe Moscow Metro has some of the most beautiful, unique stations in the world, making it a perfect setting to draw inspiration from. Originally built during the Soviet era around the concept of svetloe budushchee, \u201cA Radiant Future\u201d, these stations resemble palaces and art galleries with sculptures, stained glass windows, gilt framed paintings, and roman columns. We\u2019re working from hundreds of reference photos to accurately capture the spirit of each station in pixels, while adding a bit of fun canine content to the mix. Here are a few of the stations featured in the game!\n      Russian Subway Dogs started as a jam game created for the GDC Pirate Kart. This early gameplay sketch was very well received with coverage on Indiegames.com as well as several let\u2019s plays in both English and Russian and was chosen as an official selection for Fantastic Fest\u2019s Fantastic Arcade in Austin, Texas. \n  Inspired by this positive response we\u2019ve been improving Russian Subway Dogs by adding more detailed animations, revamped physics and 60fps gameplay, a deep combo system, new commuters, food types, bears, snowdrifts, and more!\nNow we\u2019re ready to take Russian Subway Dogs to the next level! We're packing it full of new content and gameplay modes, then releasing it commercially on Steam. With your help we can make canine magic happen!\n    Travel from station to station taking on missions from the Proletaricat, your feline commander. Missions include a specific combination of commuters and wildlife with a time / score goal you have to beat. However the real meat of the mission is a series of extra sub-challenges. These range from requiring deft hand-eye coordination to puzzling out deeper mechanics. For example:\nComplete the mission with a vegetarian diet.\nDon't let the poodles eat any food.\nGet a 6 x Tasty Kombo.\nEat six pigeons. \nComplete enough subchallenges and you\u2019ll open up the next station with a new set to solve! \n   We're adding a whole range of new commuters and wildlife to the mix. Flighty pigeons, stout babushkas wielding giant herring, annoying balalaika players, and irate subway elk are only a few of the upcoming additions!\n   Kvass, coffee, hot sauce and other new foods will provide game changing powerups not just for the player, but also any rival dogs who eat them. There\u2019s nothing more annoying than a toy poodle moving double-quick on a caffeine high stealing all your food, so make sure you grab any powerups before they do!\n  Arcade games are best when you can show off your skill and compete globally with other players so we're adding online leaderboards! For those looking for a solo challenge we're also including lots of interesting skill-based achievements to aim for.   \n  We're bringing the talented Peter Chapman on board to create a brand new original soundtrack. You may be familiar with his work on award winning games such as Guacamelee!, LittleBigPlanet Karting and Modnation Racers. He'll be producing his own unique electronic take on traditional Eastern European folk music for Russian Subway Dogs. Listen to the first track here!\n  We're adding a whole bunch of polish every step of the way. Improvements and additions like animated backgrounds, new sound effects, particle effects, play balancing, and more. We want to lavish as much love as we can on Russian Subway Dogs, adding all those little details that take a game from good to great! \n  We want Russian Subway Dogs to be enjoyed around the world so we'll be localizing it into as many languages as possible! \n  Want to play as a the Proletaricat? A goat? Cerberus the three headed hound of hell? Work together during the Kickstarter campaign to complete community backer missions and spread the word about Russian Subway Dogs. The more backer missions completed the more bonus characters we'll add to the game. \n            These community achievements are a fun way to stay involved after you back (or before!) and help us spread the word. The Proletaricat will be keeping track and updating the achievement board above throughout the campaign. Every time four achievements are completed she'll poll the community and you will get to pick which fantastical \"pup\" will be added to the game! \n Submit fan art, photos and videos to the Proletaricat by tweeting them at @spookysquid or spookysquidgames.tumblr.com or on the Russian Subway Dogs Facebook page at fb.com/russiansubwaydogs. We can only count submissions through those channels so be sure to send them our way!\nSpread this Proletaricat Propaganda on twitter: LINK\nSpread this Proletaricat Propaganda on tumblr: LINK\n  For our stretch goals we want to take our little pup hero outside the subway system for some historical and supernatural fun.

Best known for their lo-fi gothic platforming beat\u2019em up They Bleed PIxels, they have also released a number of bite sized free games including Night of the Cephalopods, Cephalopods Co-op Cottage Defence and The Night Balloonists. The most recent addition to the team, artist Alina Sechkin, joined the company in 2015.\n   Pixel artist and game designer Miguel Sternberg is a veteran of Toronto\u2019s thriving indie game scene. In addition to co-founding Spooky Squid Games, he\u2019s a former co-founder of Capybara Games and The Hand Eye Society, a videogame arts and culture organization where he started Comics vs Games, a project encouraging collaboration between independent comic and game developers\nIn addition to co-creating They Bleed Pixels his game design credits include several smaller games including Night of the Cephalopods, Cephalopods Co-op Cottage Defence, Black Church Brigandage (with comic artist Andy Belanger) and The Night Balloonists (with programmer Andrij Pilkiw). \nA professional pixel artist for over a decade, his art has graced the back cover of Scott Pilgrim Gets it Together, the movie Crank and the web game Legends of Zork among others. \nBefore working in games he killed an old woman in Cube 2: Hypercube with time crystals, and animated reindeer mouths.\nAn alumni of Toronto's DMG program, Alina Sechkin's pixel art appears in Will O\u2019Neill's Actual Sunlight and Necrosoft's Playstation Vita game Oh, Deer! as well as at the DPAD2 game culture exhibition.

Of course the exact amount may change depending on what levels everyone backs at.\n4% [$2000] will go towards localization costs getting the game translated. \n63% [$31,500]  will go towards game production: art, code, sound and music. \n \n  Photo Credits\nTop illustration by Eric Kim with colours by Miguel Sternberg.\nPhotos of framed prints and I <3 They Bleed Pixels Collection by Paul Hillier Photography.  \nWe are grateful to the following photographers who have made their work available for use via Creative Commons licensing.

All signs and portents point to this momentous night, and you and your siblings of shadow stand ready. Your cult has sacrificed much - and many - to prepare the ceremony to awaken the dread god whose name twists your tongue and whose dark purpose twists your mind. But this night is one of great power, and your lodge is not the only one who seeks to harness that power. Other cultists prepare similar yet horribly different ceremonies, and investigators roam the streets and locales of Arkham, seeking to stop the inevitable annihilation. You must strike now, before a cult of a different old one ushers in their own maddening end times. In your hands lies the Fate of the Elder Gods!\nIn Fate of the Elder Gods, 1-4 players take on the ever-maddening role of cults trying to summon ancient evil and herald the fall of mankind! Each cult is competing to be first to summon their god, but they must also repel intrepid investigators working to seal off the gate to beyond with Elder Signs. Gather arcane artifacts, cast powerful spells, embrace the Dark Gift of your Elder God, and be first to awaken your dread master... before it's too late!\nDuring the game, players use a variable hand of spell cards to aid their cult in their mission. Use a spell's Astral Symbol to navigate the areas around Arkham on the unique Fate Clock board, and activate symbols in a location's Astral Column to ready powerful spells. Readied spells can be cast at any time and their Astral Symbols aid in readying future spells while in a cult's Spell Reserve, creating an engine for harnessing even greater power.\nAs cults travel to the six locations on the Fate Clock, they activate specific powerful abilities, such as gaining useful artifacts at The Museum or enabling their Elder God's Dark Gift at The Ceremony. As a cult sends more and more cultists to a location, they can take control of that location, gaining far more powerful abilities. However, cults must be careful when navigating Arkham, as a location with lots of activity will attract pesky investigators. Tempt fate too many times and the investigators may raid your cult's lodge, place Elder Signs, and forestall the summoning of your Elder God. If a cult gains too many Elder Signs, it's game over!\nIf any cult manages to raise their Summon Track to 9 before the investigators save humanity, their Elder God awakens and they win! Of course, \"win\" is a relative term as it will certainly herald the end of the world, or at least destroy Arkham, but that's a small price to pay for eternal servitude to the Ancient Ones.\n  Fate of the Elder Gods comes with a beautiful Fate Clock board, custom screen-printed dice, cards and panels for spells, curses, and more, and over 100 gorgeous miniatures! Here's a complete run-down:\n19 inch by 22 inch (480x550mm) custom-cut, quad-fold playing board\n80 sculpted plastic Cultists (in 4 player colors - purple, green, yellow, and black)\n25 sculpted plastic Investigators\n2 sculpted plastic Cthulhu Fate Piece markers\n65 Euro mini-sized Spell cards with linen finish\n20 square Artifact cards with linen finish\n20 Euro mini-sized Curse cards with linen finish\n16 Euro mini-sized Gate cards with linen finish\n8 player reference cards\n8 Elder God Lodge boards in fine card stock (Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep, Tsatthogua, Bokrug, Ithaqua, Atlach-Nacha, Hastur)\n8 Elder God Selection cards\n10 custom resin dice\n4 wooden Summon Track tokens (in 4 player colors)\n40 thick punchboard Elder Signs\n6 thick punchboard Squall tokens (for Ithaqua's Dark Gift)\n18-page full color glossy rulebook\n  From the very start of this project, we all envisioned a top-notch production that would make the game wholly immersive for every player. Drawing inspiration from older classics like Twilight Imperium 3 and newer games such as Blood Rage, we turned to the talented team of artist Jorge Ramos and veteran sculptor Chad Hoverter to create some truly awesome minis to represent the Cultists, Investigators, and the impressive Fate Piece for Fate of the Elder Gods.\nWe wanted a very distinctive Cultist for the base sculpt. Since we were going to be basing the Fate Piece around Lovecraftian-classic Elder God Cthulhu, Jorge chose to entwine the two designs and craft the cult's tall hood around the kraken-esque crest from his Cthulhu sculpt. The tentacle embellishments on the sleeves and hoods just make this Cultist even more awesome, and Chad executed it all perfectly.\nWe gave Jorge some 20s, 30s, and 40s fashion directives, but this rendition of the plucky Investigator is all his vision. Chad added his distinctive flair to really bring this sculpt of the woman of action and investigation to life.\nOur only direction to Jorge for this Fate Piece statue was to take Cthulhu in a unique direction. His vision of a kraken-like Cthulhu complete with spiky carapace certainly set it apart from the typical bulbous-headed predecessors. Chad added his signature dramatic flair, making this statue even more menacing.\n  There are a lot of cool things about Fate of the Elder Gods, but the heart of it all is the Fate Clock game board. Cults will use spells to move the Fate Piece around the Clock to a location, activating that spot's special action and - if they happen to have control - an extra action that can grant a huge boon. The physical Fate Clock will be a custom-cut quad-fold board that will have an amazing presence on any gaming table.\n    If videos aren't your thing, or you'd like to delve deeper into how to play Fate of the Elder Gods, download and peruse the latest version of the preliminary rules that were provided to our playtesters and reviewers right here!\nYou can also watch a full game of Fate of the Elder Gods played by the designers at Gen Con 2016!\n  \"Fate of the Elder Gods is one of the best games I have ever designed. It is a work far greater than I would have achieved alone because I believe teaming up with Darrell and Chris brought out the best ideas from each of us, making the whole much greater than any of the individual parts, and creating a game experience far beyond my initial vision.\" - Richard Launius, co-designer of Fate of the Elder Gods\nReview of Fate of the Elder Gods by Joel Eddy of Drive Thru Review!\n Review of Fate of the Elder Gods by Kevin and Melissa of Tantrum House!\n\"I had a ton of fun playing Fate of the Elder Gods and was looking forward to more plays during the convention. I was faced with tough decision like whether I wanted to use spell cards for movement or try to ready them for use, to use my readied spells or save them to add to my pool of symbols to ready more spells, should I activate a location with an action I desperately wanted to take or one with symbols that will allow me to ready a spell I really wanted to have on hand. There definitely seemed to be different paths to victory and tons of replayability due to the variety of Elder God\u2019s to choose from. I will definitely be backing the Kickstarter and eagerly await another chance to summon an Elder God and bring about the fall of mankind.\" - Dan Licata, review on BoardGameGeek.com\n\"I played a four player and two player game with the near-final prototype. The unique abilities of each elder god really mixes up the strategies and makes you approach the game differently each time. This variable play, mixed with a solid core of mechanics and an epic end game, makes Fate of the Elder Gods a great game.\" - Bryan Fischer, Nevermore Games\nFate of the Elder Gods is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\n      This 3-foot x 3-foot vinyl playmat can bring even more awesomeness to your gaming sessions of Fate of the Elder Gods! If you'd like to add this playmat to your pledge, simply add an additional $39 to your pledge level and we will clarify your order after the campaign concludes. Please note that any pledges for the ELDER GOD pledge level include the playmat, so you can get all the things for $199!\nAchieving our base funding goal will ensure that Greater Than Games will be able to publish Fate of the Elder Gods at the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of Fate of the Elder Gods is priced according to our initial funding goal; if we are able to exceed that then we can afford to upgrade some game components and add in a lot of other really cool stuff... including monsters! The Mi-Go and Ghatanothoa mentioned below will not be in the retail base game; if we unlock enough stretch goals beyond them, though, we can produce a whole beastly expansion that Kickstarter backers will get for free! \n     Every backer of Fate of the Elder Gods will receive the special promotional Elder God, Azathoth, not included in the retail version of the game. As the ruler of the Outer Gods, Azathoth's greatness is reflected in the special passive ability of his Dark Gift - Elder Signs only make him more powerful! When serving Azathoth you'll be begging other Cults to visit the Streets of Arkham and send those pesky Investigators your way to Hasten Doom!\nBackers at the Cultist level and above will also receive the special pack of promotional Cult cards that grant even more powers from your Ancient One!\nThese cards can be optionally added to any game. There is a Cult card for every god in the base game, as well as Cult cards for Azathoth and any of the gods that are unlocked through stretch goals. There are even a couple of unaligned Cult cards for even more variety! This promotional pack will not be available in retail and is a little something special to say thanks for supporting the Kickstarter.\nDark Gift\nBackers at the Dark Gift pledge level will receive a special hardcover book, Forbidden Lore: Uncovering Fate of the Elder Gods, filled with over 50 glossy, full-color pages of awesome Lovecraftian goodness! Inside this tome you'll find a ton of behind-the-scenes information on the art production process, including preliminary sketches and final pieces for the locations, miniatures, Elder God portraits, and more. You'll also uncover the literary histories of the Elder Gods and more deep facts about the history of Arkham and its mysteries. Forbidden Lore will include three of the designers' personal favorite Lovecraft stories - The Whisperer in Darkness, At The Mountains of Madness, and The Shadow Over Innsmouth - with special illustrations!\n Elder God\nBackers at the Elder God pledge level will receive the book, Forbidden Lore: Uncovering Fate of the Elder Gods, as well as a copy of Fate of the Elder Gods signed and numbered by designers Richard Launius, Darrell Louder, and Chris Kirkman! Backers will also receive the special 3-foot x 3-foot vinyl playmat, and two limited edition, 24\" x 36\" canvas prints of the art pieces for The Ceremony and Streets of Arkham, signed and numbered by artist Nolan Nasser!\n  Fate of the Elder Gods is truly a project of passion, born from a group of creators who not only have a love of boardgames but also a love for the Lovecraftian lore that surrounds the game.\nCall him the Duke of Dice, the Titan of Theme, or just King Launius; Richard has been designing and championing boardgames that tell good stories for 30 years, ever since his classic hit Arkham Horror was first released in 1987. Richard is known for his other great game designs, such as Defenders of the Realm, Elder Sign, Dragon Rampage, Cthulhu's Vault - a Lovecraft storytelling game, and more.\nDarrell is a graphic designer, multimedia director, father, science geek, grilling enthusiast, and game designer from Dover, Delaware. Darrell counts himself blessed; his best-selling first design, the chemistry game Compounded, is currently in its fourth printing, and his baseball game, Bottom of the 9th, is already headed to its third. His former knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos was fairly limited, but now considers himself an expert by osmosis after developing Fate of the Elder Gods with Richard and Chris.\nChris was born with boardgames in his blood and has been designing and developing games - both digital and analog - for over 30 years. Chris is founder of Dice Hate Me Games, and serves as Game Development Director at Greater Than Games, where he scouts for new and awesome things and then helps to make them even awesomer. The only thing he loves as much as gaming is the Cthulhu Mythos, so this project is a dream come true.\nNolan\u2019s career in board game illustration is relatively young, but the pure passion for his craft has quickly made him a rising star. Nolan has worked with the Greater Than Games team on three past projects - Spirit Island, New Bedford, and Exoplanets - using his talents for digital painting to craft those gaming worlds. Nolan is responsible for crafting the landscapes in Fate of the Elder Gods, creating the art for the Fate Clock locations, as well as the gorgeous game cover.\nJorge is a concept artist from Madrid, Spain with an incredible talent for character illustration. Jorge worked with the Greater Than Games team on Spirit Island, creating the incredible visages of the island's many protector spirits, and did character design for the ship captains and salty sea-dogs of New Bedford as well. Jorge is responsible for the character and monster concept sketches for miniature sculpting reference, as well as the awesome Elder Gods illustrations.\nChad is a veteran miniature sculptor from Dallas, Texas who has been a part of many projects in the boardgame world. Some of his most recent and well-known projects are sculpts for Mice & Mystics, Tailfeathers, and Specter Ops. He is, of course, responsible for all the sculpts in Fate of the Elder Gods, including the monsters... provided we fund high enough!\nFor US and Canadian backers, we are offering free shipping.

Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snags along the way.

Manage the teams of policeman, medics and fireman to many different cases. Answer emotional calls and try to help people! \n  We plan to put over 50 different call types in the game - sometimes serious and dramatic, sometimes funny or irritating. Each recorded with emotions, and most often based on true events!   \nEach dialog has a few different flows, and it is up to you which way will you choose, according to the situation. Will you choose to use the caller to help, or will you tell them to wait for services to arrive? Will they come on time? Will you be able to provide correct First Aid Instructions? Or maybe you should tell the caller that it is not a case for 911? \n During the conversations you will have to make hard choices. Sometimes you will have to provide real First Aid Instructions. This job is more difficult than you think, but we hope that you will learn some of the procedures as well. \n For example, we covered heart action stop, major injures, childbirth, choking, accidents, drowning and many other medical cases!  \nNever know when they might be useful in real life!  \nBut this is not all - other calls might be about ongoing crimes, drugs dealing, family abuses. We also covered fires and technical problems (like chemical hazards or people trapped in elevator). You will get confused why and in which situations people can call 911 :)\n We made some rocket science to give an option to download and play on ANY REAL CITY in the world, thanks to OpenStreetMaps! Fight the crime and help people near your home in Free Game mode!\n Choose any larger city like New York, London, Berlin, Moscow.... or any smaller one like Albuquerque, Kaposv\u00e1r, Windhuk, Sandomierz. Your choice, it will work, as well as over 8000 other cities! \nPS. The maps themself are not included in the game and can be downloaded for free. \nThe gameplay itself divides in two modes - management and duty. \nDuring the duty mode your job is to answer the calls and dispatch adequate teams to the location, if you have them available. Together with the calls, you also receive other reports either from your teams or other operators. Each Duty represents a day of the operator's work. It takes about 10 minutes to play.  \nAfter the Duty mode, you go to the management mode - there you can recruit additional team members, buy vehicles and equipment and watch an after action reports, where you can find out what happened to your callers.   \nThe main statistic of the game is Reputation, which goes up every time you successfully resolve a report, and goes down each time someone dies, criminals escape or you fail to resolve a report in given time.\nAnother statistic is money - which you can get for special awards (like saving life or by avoiding major failures) or by giving the tickets for each reported minor offenses.\n  There is a lot of content in the game, and more will come!\n In the campaign mode, you will play on different cities like San Francisco or Wachington DC, facing growing threats and more and more challenging tasks. Will you manage to operate 20 teams at once.\nSome of the planned missions include: large sport events, protests, international government summit, drug mafia activities, terrorists attacks, natural disasters like earthquakes, floods and fires. Each will have corresponding calls and reports, which you will have to handle correctly in order to advance to next level\n We made a great effort to prepare a large, organized list of things that can happen in your city - starting from a cat on a tree, through injuries, fires, bombing and terrorist threats, accidents and natural catastrophes!\nEach of those reports require different reaction time, priority, other teams types, number and ordering, as report elements might interlock each other\n    Each of the emergency services has it's own set of vehicles and equipment, with adequate properties like speed, number of places for criminals or injured, and some additional effects!\n \"Best Indie Game\" award at Digital Dragons 2016 Indie Showcase goes to \"911 Operator\".

You'll love MCC if you like Gamma World, Metamorphosis Alpha, or DCC RPG. You don't need to own DCC to play MCC. \nMCC cover art by Doug Kovacs\nWhat is this Kickstarter?\nThis Kickstarter funds a stand-alone hardcover book called Mutant Crawl Classics. MCC RPG is a tabletop role playing game grounded in the rules and philosophies of DCC RPG. MCC RPG can be played on its own as an independent campaign, or integrated into an existing DCC RPG campaign.\nWhat is DCC RPG? DCC RPG is a stand-alone tabletop role playing game. DCC RPG debuted in 2012, and has generated four printings and spawned a movement. The game is based on a modern interpretation of the original D&D inspirations. Check out our past DCC RPG Kickstarter for more information.\nDo I need to own a copy of DCC RPG to enjoy MCC RPG? No! MCC RPG is deliberately designed to be stand-alone. The MCC hardcover includes all the basic rules needed to play. If you own DCC RPG your enjoyment will be enhanced, but that is not necessary.\nMCC icon art by Stefan Poag\nWhat is Mutant Crawl Classics?\nMCC RPG is both a supplement to Goodman Games\u2019 Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG as well as a complete game in its own right. You can use these rules to run your own post apocalyptic role playing game, or simply as a way to spice up your existing DCC RPG campaign with the addition of mutants, artificial intelligences, and futuristic technology. These rules are designed to be 100% compatible with the DCC RPG rulebook, and characters and monsters from either system should mesh seamlessly into your campaign with little or no adjudication required.\nWho created it? MCC is written by Jim Wampler. Jim is a longtime veteran of the RPG industry - you can read his complete bio below!\nWhat is the format? MCC will be published as a hardcover book, 8.5\u201dx11\u201d trim size, with a color cover and B/W interior pages. We anticipate it being approximately 160-180 pages long. It will be chock full of outstanding original art, in the same style as DCC RPG.\nShow me what it looks like. Certainly! MCC RPG has been in the works for years, and Goodman Games has published several previews of MCC RPG. Here are some for you to check out:\nA 29-page preview of the complete game, originally published in our Gen Con 2015 Program Guide. Includes information on the setting, character creation, character classes, mutations, artifacts, patron A.I.'s, and more!\nA complete 13-page level 0 adventure, The Museum At the End of Time, originally published in our 2016 Free RPG Day module.\nThe Setting: Terra A.D.\nThe characters in the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG live in a primitive world dominated by the bizarre side-effects of an ancient holocaust known only as the Great Disaster. Millennia after this cataclysmic extinction event, the world \u2014 now known as Terra A.D. (After Disaster) \u2014 has regrown into a lush tropical wilderness. The lifeforms that survive and flourish in Terra A.D. did so because natural selection rewarded their ancestors for possessing either very plastic or very hardy genomes. Plants and animals with wild and unstable mutations permeate the ecosystem and the food chain. Though some species have settled down into relatively stable body plans and are capable of reproducing true to form, there is still the chance in any given birth of a new mutation arising.\nOf these mutations, the advent of intelligence and sentience are by far the most pervasive. Never before in the history of the world has it been home to so many competing sentient species. Many animal and plant species now possess rudimentary reasoning abilities, and more than a few walk upright, communicate with each other, and make use of tools. These sentient species are collectively known as Manimals and Plantients.\nWhat few members of mankind that survived the Great Disaster meanwhile descended into barbarism and savagery, and eventually split into two separate species: Pure Strain Humans and Mutants. Rather than surviving the Great Disaster by virtue of constantly mutating genetics, the genome of Pure Strain Humans became hardened against radiation and other mutagenic environmental effects, leaving them an especially hardy and intelligent race. The Mutant species of mankind meanwhile evolved along an opposite path, never breeding true to form even within small tribal gene pools. A mutant is always born with at least one notable cosmetic mutation, and upon reaching post-adolescence, mutants will typically manifest a diverse set of unpredictable additional mutations, making them among the most bizarre and horrific of all Terra A.D. creatures.\nNo existing sentient species or culture on Terra A.D. has managed to rise above the Neolithic stage of civilization. Stone tools and a tribal hunter-gatherer society dominate, with even rudimentary agriculture being a very rare occurrence. Metallurgy and writing are unknown to most sentients.\nThe Ancient Ones\nIt is generally accepted among the denizens of Terra A.D. that there once existed a legendary race of an unknown type that ruled and ordered the world with an arcane force known as technology. While nearly every sentient species makes an apocryphal claim to be directly descendant of these protean techno-wizards of millennia past, the evidence for their existence is inarguable. Though long since passed out of all memory, the imperishable artifacts and ruined haunts of the Ancient Ones were manufactured of such incomprehensibly durable substances and with such super scientific knowledge as to be virtually immune to the ravages of passing centuries. Many such devices and places may yet be discovered relatively intact by those brave enough to plumb the taboo lands of Terra A.D.\nThe Characters: Class Options\nIt is the goal of every youngling to return from the Rite of Passage (MCC\u2019s character funnel) with a potent enough artifact to be promoted to a Seeker Team. Seekers are those elite tribesmen whose job it is to go out into the wilderness, ruins, and taboo lands seeking ever-greater artifacts of the ancients for the benefit of themselves and their kinsmen.\nEach genotype in MCC RPG has its own unique abilities and powers. Pure Strain Humans have Darwinian Luck and four classes from which to choose. Mutants, Manimals, and Plantients possess bizarre physical and mental mutations and individual race-as-class powers. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the MCC RPG classes:\nSentinel (Pure Strain Human): A hardened warrior with an artifact bonus die for weapons and armor.\nShaman (Pure Strain Human): A worshipper of a Patron Artificial Intelligence, granted the ability to run wetware programs that alter the laws of physics. \nHealer (Pure Strain Human): A tribal healer with expert knowledge in naturopathy healing techniques and able to get superior results from the medical artifacts of the ancients.\nRover (Pure Strain Human): A tribal scout with a knack for disappearing and then turning up on the other side of computer-locked doors and ancient security systems.\nMutant: A tribesman with mutations and an appearance so shocking to others he often acts first in battle.\nManimal: A sentient bipedal animal with mutations and an ability to attack at advantage in large packs.\nPlantients: A sentient bipedal plant with mutations and the ability to influence the luck of others via fragrances, pollens, and pheromones.\nMutations\nMutations in MCC RPG each have a table of possible effects, from complete failure and the possibility of gaining a defect, to mighty mutational effects that can alter the very landscape. Mutations come in two types \u2014 passive and active. Passive mutations are permanent effects like armor, extra limbs, or enhanced stats. The effects for passive mutations are only rolled once per level. Active mutations are at-will powers, and their efficacy is rolled with each use. \nLost Super Science\nThe lost super science of the Ancient Ones is centuries in advance of anything that we have today. While many of the familiar tropes of post apocalyptic gaming are present in MCC RPG \u2014 like power armor, robots, and particle beam weapons \u2014 it\u2019s always with a Vancian super science spin. Even a simple dazer pistol may come with its own AI and semi-sentient personality. \nPatron AIs\nExisting far above the level of mere robots, androids, and holograms are the Patron AIs. These godlike artificial intelligences may be ancient global satellite systems, military guidance computers, or even rogue quantum field AIs living in the EM field of the planet. But they all share one thing in common \u2014 a world-dominating agenda and the willingness to grant mortals great power if they are served faithfully.\nFoes and Danger\nNot since the Cambrian Explosion has the planet seen such a wild evolutionary radiation of mutations and bizarre lifeforms. If these were the only dangers permeating Terra A.D., they would be an abundance. But the world is also home to wounded lands soaked in radiation, volcanic crater countries, and the ruins of a civilization so powerful its technology functions yet, often in dangerous and unpredictable ways. Though long since perished, the Ancient Ones are also survived by the mightiest of their creations, the rogue chunks of \u201csmart metal\u201d that still roam the dark corners of the world. These robots and androids are animated by inexhaustible power sources, sometimes corrupted CPUs, and insanely murderous artificial intelligences. Taking back this world and re-building civilization may be the grand goals of the tribal elders, but most days you and your Seeker team are focused on just living to see tomorrow. \nPlus All The Usual DCC Goodness\nThe Mutant Crawl Classics RPG is written to be 100% compatible with Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG. Character and setting transfers are seamlessly accomplished, and genre-mashing ability is built in \u2014 all using the same streamlined d20 system you know and love. If you\u2019ve played DCC RPG before, you already know how MCC RPG works. If you\u2019re new to the DCC RPG system, you\u2019re in for a treat. Spells and mutations results are accomplished with the roll of a d20 and reference to an expansive results tables. D20 combat is simultaneously simplified and enhanced. Instead of an endless list of modifiers, increases and decreases in attack ability are accomplished simply by moving the roll up and down the dice chain (d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, d10, d12, d14, d16, d20, d24, and d30). The DCC RPG system may seem at first glance to be a \u201cswingy\u201d combat system, but the Luck mechanic and spellburn/glowburn mitigate this tendency and balance the game beautifully!\nLearn More\nGoodman Games holds seminars at conventions throughout the year, where we discuss all sorts of pending projects. Check out the video from our \"What's New With Goodman Games\" seminar at North Texas RPG Convention 2015 to hear Jim Wampler and Joseph Goodman talk about Mutant Crawl Classics!\nHear creator Jim Wampler talk about Mutant Crawl Classics!\n  Add-On Items and Pledge Levels\nThe Mutant Crawl Classics Kickstarter has already cleared a number of stretch goals, and we've had many requests to get those in print! You can see exactly which stretch goals have been achieved in the \"Stretch Goals\" section below. Most stretch goals are in PDF, but to answer the requests to have them in print, we've added pledge levels that include the \"Print Block\" (as we're calling it).\nWhat is the \"Print Block\"? The print block is a $50 flat rate, and will include printed editions of all adventure module stretch goals cleared through the end of the campaign. Note that the stretch goals include other, non-adventure items, and the print block is strictly the adventure modules. The adventure modules have a printed retail price of $10 each, and as of the time of this writing, there are 5 stretch goals cleared, so the print block is at normal retail price (5 modules x $10 each = $50). However, the price of the print block does not change as we clear more stretch goals. So if we clear all 7 adventure module stretch goals, this will be a $70 value for only $50. (And who knows, maybe we'll go past 7!) You can find a breakdown of the adventure module content in this recent update.\nWhat are the pledge levels with the print block? You can pledge for the basic hardcover, or the gold foil hardcover. And we have added pledge levels so you can pledge for \"basic hardcover + print block,\" or \"foil hardcover + print block.\"\nWhat other add-on items exist? You can also add these items to your pledge:\nDice! A 14-die set, including all the \"funky dice,\" available in either radioactive green or glow-in-the-dark color schemes. Each set is $25. Check out this update for more details on the dice. \nT-shirts! A black tee with the MCC RPG skull in vivid green. The graphic will also glow in the dark. Add +$25.\nA slipcase! A color slipcase to enclose your hardcover. Add +$25.\nWhat are shipping costs for add-ons? If you select the print block add-on, an adjusted shipping cost is included. If you add anything else (dice, tees, and/or slipcase), please add as follows:\nDice: +$2 shipping per tube\nT-shirts: +$2 shipping per shirt\nSlipcases+ +$2 shipping per slipcase\nStretch Goals\nGoodman Games intends to support MCC with a solid range of adventure modules, just as we have with DCC.

Exploding with character and style, the denizens of Gloom are simply begging to be brought to life (so you can kill them)!\nThis campaign is to help fund the digital adaptation of the core set of Gloom: Second Edition along with the Unhappy Homes Expansion Pack. The game will support online multiplayer as well as a single player mode against AI.  If this campaign is successful, tablet editions for Windows, Android, and iOS devices will be developed after the release of the PC version for Windows and Mac.\n\"I've been telling stories about these families for over a decade, and I'm excited to see them come to life (... before tragically dying, of course).\" ~ Keith Baker\n  In Gloom, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your Characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. \nYou'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own Characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' Characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. When one of your family members finally suffers an Untimely Death, that Character and all of the tragic circumstances that led up to his demise are set aside until the end of the game. \nThe game ends the instant an entire family is eliminated. Each player then totals the visible Pathos points on each of his own dead Character cards to get their Self-Worth scores, and then adds these scores together to get his total Family Value. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins! \nMisery loves company, and if you love Gloom like we do, you just want to share it with the world. Now with Gloom: Digital Edition, you can! Want to share you misery with your old pen pal in Pennsylvania? Or maybe you prefer sharing your Gloom with complete strangers. \nNo matter who you choose to share your sorrows with, Gloom: Digital Edition wants to make your darkest dreams come true!  The game will support online multiplayer and single player against AI.\nThere's no question about it, Gloom is beautiful! Gloomy... but beautiful! In Gloom: Digital Edition, soak up all that delightful drudgery as you enjoy unique environmental backgrounds for each family. Was that a shadowy figure in that alley or a trick of the light? \nWhat makes Gloom such fun is the storytelling. Each play-through weaves a unique series of mishaps and merriment that's sure to create some memorable moments. \nSo how will we translate this in the videogame? We'll let the characters speak for themselves! Every character in Gloom: Digital Edition will be fully animated. They'll also talk! At least the ones that have mouths... \n            Why Kickstarter? We want the fans to be involved from day 1 in recreating this beloved game. We can't think of a better place than Kickstarter to bring new and old fans of the game together to help us spread the Gloom... What's the money for you ask?\nOur primary and most important expense will be development support for the game, itself.  In order to make Gloom: Digital Edition into the online experience it deserves to be, we'll need to contract music composers, voice actors, and a number of other specialists onto the project.  A small portion of our funds will go towards marketing, helping to make sure the world will know when Gloom is coming, and finally, a very small amount will go towards operational expenses, helping us keep the lights on.\nWhat's the release plan? We plan on getting the PC release of the game to you in the summer of 2017, although we plan on delivering many of the backer rewards as soon as possible.  We are planning on tablet releases for Apple, Android, and Windows as well, but will be announcing their release date later in development.\nWith friends like these... Sky Ship Studios was formed with the vision of bringing our favorite table top games into the digital space. We've set out to bring you the same level of quality that you would expect from other titles our members have worked on, such as Bioshock Infinite and Guild Wars 2, to Gloom. We're excited to bring our 111 years of collective game development experience to bear on a project we're deeply...darkly...passionate about! Titles our team members have contributed to: Bioshock Infinite , Guild Wars & Guild Wars 2, Scary Girl, Natural Selection 2, Space Quest 5, Sub Nautica, Singularity, Kick-Ass,  and many, many others!\nIn addition, we contribute to various gaming blogs such as Blogcritics,Trugameheadz and Gamepositive and are active members of IGDA and the Madison Games Alliance.\n   Translations provided by: The Geo Group\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough we will do everything in our power to deliver Gloom: Digital Edition in the Summer of 2017, we reserve the right to adjust that timeline if it becomes apparent that the game needs more testing or refinement before it hits the market.

Click HERE!\nPrey for the Gods is coming to PS4, Xbox One, Mac and Steam, with successful campaign completion! No stretch goal required.\n  Read about this recent announcement of PS4 & Xbox One.\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/802508750/prey-for-the-gods/posts/1635921\n  In Prey for the Gods, you play a lone hero sent to the edge of a dying world to discover the mystery behind a never-ending winter. Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to.\nCore Features:\nColossal battles with giants where you can climb your foes \nA vast and mysterious frozen world with dynamic snow terrain that you must traverse\nIntense survival game play\nExplore mysterious temples that contain secrets and treasure.\nDynamic weather and day/night cycle\nNon-linear game play where you choose who to battle and how\nLoot the fallen heroes and equip yourself with weapons and supplies\nUnique musical score\n  Prey for the Gods ambitiously combines the game play of Shadow of the Colossus, Deus Ex, DayZ, and BloodBorne. It has tight controls, action-packed boss fights and a frozen mysterious world to explore.\nPrey for the Gods can be played with a keyboard or a game pad. Your basic actions are attack, move and dodge/climb. Simple to learn and critical to master. You control the hero from a third person perspective and can explore the world in any direction. Dodging is crucial as the creatures that inhabit this island are not forgiving in battle and will not give mercy.\nThe combat in Prey for the Gods is fast-paced, brutal, and up to you. Each of the giants you encounter will be unique. To be victorious, you need to discover and exploit their weaknesses then climb on and defeat them. Do you take the giants head-on and dodge their massive attacks, striking when the time is right? Or hide from their gaze and sneak up on them? Pick up a sword, find a bow and arrow, fly through the air with a grapple hook, or use your bare hands.\nYou decide how to fight, and you decide how to survive. In battle, weapons can break, and arrows are finite, so do your best to make every shot count. Luckily, you can pull out the arrows you shoot. Discover the giants weaknesses, climb and defeat them.\n    Composer Ian Dorsch has been writing and recording music for games and related media for the better part of 15 years. His game audio work runs the gamut from AAA (Gears of War 3, Xbox Fitness) to indie (Airborn \u2013 Pino\u2019s Journey), and as a contributor to Polygon, The Escapist and Gamers With Jobs, Ian has written theme music for some of the longest-running podcasts and video series in gaming (Zero Punctuation). In addition to his work as a freelance composer, Ian is also a singer and choir director, and he currently directs the Grays Harbor Chamber Singers and the Vestr Singers, a professional vocal ensemble from the Seattle area.\nSkewsound has the experience and talent to bring the cold atmosphere of Prey for the Gods to life. Having done sound and music for a number of AAA and notable indie games including Chariot, Lost Within, Knee Deep, Magic Circle, RockBand 4, Gigantic, and Grim Dawn\nExploration is rewarding but risky. Luckily, your footsteps in deep snow will help guide you back if you get lost. However, the deeper the snow the more tired and hungry you will be. Hunt for food, then pick up what you can and find a safe cave to rest. Build yourself up from nothing, salvage items and weapons from fallen heroes including swords, bows, outfits, and more.\nSpend too long out in the cold and risk exposure that will chill you to the bone. Our dynamic weather system is treacherous and ever changing. From a sunny day, to a blizzard at a moment\u2019s notice you never know what to expect. The weather is just as dangerous as the giants you are after. A trek out to find your next foe could have you changing course and looking for shelter to warm yourself.\n   \nNo Matter Studios is developing Prey for the Gods. Comprised of three veteran game developers with approximately 30+ years of combined experience.\nBrian Parnell - @brianjparnell\n\"Director\"\nArt and Design and email LOTS of email;)\nIn 2004, I got my first job play testing at Nintendo and then my first development job as an artist at Iron Lore working on Titan Quest, Titan Quest: Immortal Throne, Dawn of War: Soulstorm. After that I worked at Harmonix which included Rock Band 2, & RockBand: Beatles. I mainly did 3D character art and some concept/UI work too before getting more interested in proper management and focusing on game development as a whole. All of this while staying up late helping with friends indie projects including Natural Selection 2, and Grim Dawn. \nTim Wiese - @timjwiese\n\"Alchemist\" Art and Programming\n\"I've been working in the games industry since 2009, started off as an Environment Artist and over I time transitioned into Technical Artist/Tools Engineer, then to Engineer. As a gamer with love for a good story, I'm driven by the desire to develop a game that is Fun first and foremost (yes fun with a capital \"F\", it's important), with the depth to leave a lasting mark.\"\nHung-Chien Liao - @akyangliao\n\"Architect\", Programming\n\u201cI make the magic happen.\u201d That\u2019s all Chien wanted to say, mainly because the guy is too busy atm.\n  We started development of Prey for the Gods game in 2014 part time. We've been full time, living on our savings, since January 2016. For 3 people, we've come pretty far and are about 25% of the way in development. While we've come a long way, there's still a lot of work left to do. In order for us to continue development and keep creative control we need to ask for your help.\n    UPDATE: Prey for the Gods will launch with 5 bosses. At the initial budget of $300k, we'll release the game on Windows/Steam with boss types ranging from bipedal, quadruped and flying body types. Following Steam release we will begin porting the game to PS4, and Xbox One. This combined with intense survival based action combat, dynamic weather, and non-linear game play will give players a great experience at a fair value.  \nFurther stretch goals allow us to expand scope. We can add more art, animations, orchestral score, and more bosses. Most importantly we can hire an animator and hire a world builder. \nBoss stretch goals will be released after the initial 5 boss launch on Windows/Steam and not-simultaneous console release. Stretch goal bosses will be free to all backers that back at the $15 amount or more. \nStretch Goals!\n    $15 Backer = PC Digital Copy of the game, to be delivered via Steam upon release.\n  $25 Backer Plus = A Digital copy of Prey for the Gods (choose which platform if stretch goals are met), Elite Grappling Hook In-Game Item, & Digital Wall Papers\n  $35 Backer Deluxe = Digital copy of the Original Soundtrack for Prey for the Gods, and a digital copy of the Art Book.

To do this we have put in a great deal of our own funds into the development of this so far. It was important to us to have real skin in this before asking for outside funding. We have also been incredibly ruthless with our scope and brutal with our budgeting. Because of this effort we\u2019re able to have a road map that we feel comfortable with as Prey for the Gods come to fruition with your help.\n\nSCHEDULE RISK: There is inherent risk in completing any project let alone a video game project. Estimates are much harder to lock down early in development. Prey for the Gods is far enough along in development to shed some of that risk, but it needs your help to get across the finish line. We have been working on this game part time since 2014 and full time since January 2016. During that time we\u2019ve developed, and documented our core mechanics, game play loops, combat, climbing tech, and weather systems. Doing this has allowed us the ability to scope and estimate more accurately. However, we\u2019ve been shipped a number of games and we know that even with the best planning development can change, and slip. Given our past game development experience we know how to manage this when it does crop up and our backers will be first to know and we will do our best to meet those challenges head on.\n\nCONSOLES: We've listened to our fans and placed consoles platforms in a position where we can make it work for our development. To make this possible we had to remove the Mac version. This was no easy decision but one that we feel is possible if the stretch goals are met. It is very likely that the console development will be staggered to allow us the time and resources to release each version in the best state possible. To speed this up it could mean working with partners to deliver specific platform versions for an even smoother deadline, by entering into these partnerships it can also push out other platform releases for a number of reasons.\n\nHYPE vs REALITY: Our plan is to stay as true to our vision and make necessary adjustments for the goals of making the game as fun, and exciting as possible. However, sometimes the last 10% of development can take 90% of the time. Luckily, we\u2019ve made enough solid games to understand that early feedback and iteration are key. Our plan is to do play-testing during development to help us guide that polish so that we focus on what matters most. We want you there with us, and we need you there with us to make sure this game is the success that we all want it to be.\n\nEven the simplest of games can be challenging to develop with three people. For us the key is proper scope, backed with experience, and a relentless unwavering passion to finish. We know that, with your support, we can make Prey for the Gods truly great.

A collapse has just occurred, trapping you and your crew of 23 other miners underground with limited food and supplies! You play as Bud Rook, the foreman of the mine. Your task is to guide your mining crew through the dangers and horrors of being trapped in a mine, and get them to safety. You\u2019ll face external threats like additional collapses, poisonous gas, injuries, the darkness of the mine, and more in addition to the internal threats of ever increasing stress and psychological conditions that will drive you and your miners to the brink! Through extensive and dynamic dialogue trees that change based on the situation of the mine and miner, you will be able to learn about the history of the mine, and get to know your fellow miners as relatable people that you will want to save and hate to lose. You can speak to miners to lower (or increase) stress, and each miner will have their own personality traits and quirks that can be uncovered through dialogue, and these traits and quirks will have to be taken into consideration when designating miners to tasks throughout the mine, as they will determine how effective each miner will perform each task. Your morality and strategies will be tested in the depths of these mines as the stress rises and the supplies begin to dwindle.\n\nLead your miners to either safety or despair: As the foreman, you must lead the diverse cast of 24 unique and relatable miners through this disaster.\nA memorable cast: Every miner has deep and impactful dialogue and their own personality and characteristics that will determine how they react in different situations.\nDynamic Dialogue System: A true intertwining of gameplay and dialogue! The situation in the mines and a miner's status will determine how they react in dialogue, and your actions in dialogue will help determine their status in the game!\nThousands of Lines of Dialogue: Thousands of lines of dialogue in total ensures that no matter what path you take will always have rich and impacting dialogue.\nA tension rich atmosphere: Injuries, disease, lost miners, mine collapses, ever increasing stress, and more will hound you and your large group of miners. Can you get everyone out alive?\nNever the same story twice: Dynamically generated 3D mines and a unique AI system that changes based on player actions and world events means that no mine will have the same story.\nMoral dilemmas: What are you willing to do to ensure the survival of you and/or the group?\n  As Bud Rook, the foreman of the mine, you will be primarily ordering your miners around the mine, in an attempt to locate food, supplies, additional tools, and possibly even an undiscovered exit to the mine. In addition, you will also have to speak with your fellow miners to get to know them, gain usable information about them, and attempt to calm them down through extensive dialogue trees that react dynamically to the world around them. But be wary as the mines are a dangerous and terrifying place. Your miners will become exhausted, injured, and stressed as you send them out. Unprepared miners could become lost in the darkness of the mines, and may even die while performing tasks. It is up to you to lead your group, and when dire situations arise, it is up to you to make the difficult choices that will affect the miners physically and mentally.\nBud Rook can also perform any tasks in the mine himself. With the player manually controlling him, he can explore the mines, scavenge for supplies, and any other task the other miners can perform. However, this is not without its risks, as once the foreman dies or becomes trapped, the game is over. The rest of the miners will be simulated on whether or not they survive, but without a leader, the odds are slim.\n   Every miner is different.  Each character is uniquely designed to provide the most memorable experience for the player.  You must learn the miners' quirks, personality, strengths, and weaknesses if you want them to survive.  Their lives are on the line, and every choice you make can either save or end their lives.\n  Dwindle's music theme is Blues and melodic guitars. The soundtrack will be composed by Andrew Day and Tyler Dressler. You can sample one of their works down below.\n              Rewards and Fees: The Kickstarter fees and costs of the rewards (creation and shipping). This number is if all major, limited rewards are purchased. Any excess money will go into Feature Development, Art, and Sound.\nFeature Development: The costs for the development of this game, including design and programming.\nMarketing: small advertisements and keeping you entertained and in-the-loop throughout development.\nArt: Creation of the art for Dwindle.\nSound: The creation of sound effects and the soundtrack.\nWe are a group of 14 dedicated gamers and game developers. We are led by Jason Marquez (who has already successfully created and sold a server hosting business) and using art and animation by Dan Taylor (Animator for the Freedom Planet 2 trailer). Brought together by our love of game development and our work in the UCCS Game Design and Development program, all of us have developed multiple week long and semester long projects. We have come together and formed this studio as we feel that we now have the experience and knowledge necessary to develop full commercial games.\n  As a way to keep you informed and to get your input on our game, we will be having Livestreams every week which we will show our game design discussions, developers' work, and lounge discussions. We want our game to be the best it can be and we will want your input so we can go above and beyond for our supporters.\n  We have already been working on this game for the past 5 months and most of the systems are already in place. Unfortunately, in order to not just continue work on this game over the summer, but fully dedicate ourselves to this project, we will require the funding to support us. This money will allow us to work on Dwindle full time for the rest of the summer and release not just a final product eventually, but a quality and polished product by the end of September.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame design is a difficult, iterative, and lengthy process and this is our first major commercial release. We have all created many different video game projects in the past of varying lengths and difficulties, but commercial release is still a major step, though we are confident that we can make this.\n\nOf course, being a game design project still in progress, it is always possible that changes in design, release dates, and features will occur. Rest assured, we will ensure that you are informed for every change that occurs and milestone we meet.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Rabid Troll Studios\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nRabid Trolls Studios is a Colorado based independent video game development company located in Colorado Springs.

She can augment her speed, jumping ability, healing, and even enchant her gleaming blade with flames.\nThroughout the world are powerful magic subweapons that are fueled by Pandora's regenerating mana. The most powerful of these subweapons are obtained by either finding them in hidden areas or defeating bosses. With a grand total of 19 unique subweapons, there is no shortage of ways to dispatch the demonic horde.\nDraw your sword and extract Dire Vengeance!\nDire Vengeance is an old school platformer harking back to the classic console games of yesteryear.  Inspired by games like Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden and Gradius, Pandora travels through the lands of the Demon Realm, hacking and slashing her way through a bevy of monsters and ghouls.  Along the way she can power up her abilities and use her regenerating mana to fuel her quest.   \n40 distinct enemies\n    8 beautifully rendered domains with demanding platforming puzzles \n    8 challenging bosses \n  Upgradeable sword\n19 unique subweapons\n      Gradius-style power up system\nOriginal Heavy Metal score to rock your world!\nCan't wait until the game is released to see what Dire Vengeance is all about?

Prior to forming Magic Shot he spent nearly a decade working in the video game industry, including as a freelance artist and a stint as a game artist at Zynga, where he worked on titles such as Chefville and Mafia Wars. Throughout his career, Karl had a vision of making a game the way he wanted; A gothic, 2D platformer with tight controls, amazing art and a retro feel.

His background is in Electrical Engineering and he has worked on many projects outside of the video game industry, including developing a device to inject or remove material from single cells, measure the electrical signals generated by neurons, and working on novel technologies to detect the presence of biomarkers in blood. After talking with Karl about developing an old-school platformer that they would like to play, Adam decided it was time to move into the world of video games and he joined the Magic Shot team to help develop Dire Vengeance!\nVisit Us\nDire Vengeance is a living project that is updated frequently.
