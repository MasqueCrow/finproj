Featuring a built in Character Builder, with beautiful hand-drawn options so you can create your heroes, villains, and NPCs how you see them. \nWhether you play Dungeons & Dragons 5E, Pathfinder 2E, Call of Cthulhu, Savage Worlds, Cyberpunk, or another game, we have something for you!\nIntroducing TWO New body options plus FOURTEEN additional armor options!\nWith this Kickstarter we\u2019re expanding our body options, and giving you more fantasy clothing options, plus so many amazing new weapons to choose from.\nThere's even MORE New weapons an shields we're adding! More than 50 new options in total!\nTell us what other options you'd like us to add in the comments!\n The Beta is Live at https://www.beneverending.app/ and already has loads of options.\n\nYou can also capture your character\u2019s backstory and personality by adding a bio.\n Tokens. \nExpected release May 2021\nWant to use your character in a virtual tabletop like Roll20 or Fantasy Grounds? We're making it easy! You'll be able to choose from loads of unique and interesting token frames with just a click.\nPoses.\nExpected release July 2021\nOur programmers are hard at work making it so you can change your character's pose with a single click! With this addition we'll be one big step forward in helping you turn your adventures into webcomics and animated videos.\nWebcomics and Animated Videos.\nExpected BETA July 2021 and October 2021\nWe're focusing on the Character Builder today, but eventually you'll be able to import your characters into our Scene Creator and Story Animator tools to create and publish party portraits, webcomics, and even animated videos of your adventures and story ideas.\n Late Addition Stretch Goal!\n(April 9 update) We're really excited to have unlocked Wolfborn and Kitsune options, but someone reminded us we forgot my favorite of them all. MOUSEFOLK!\nIf you can help us get to $7,000 by April 10 at 11:59 pm (EDT), we'll include Mousefolk options, even though they weren't part of the original plan. \n(How could we not have included them? Help us fix this oversight!)\nSo, if the Character Builder App is already live in Beta... why back it now?\nDon't wait. Support us because you want more options faster. \nDon't pay for expansions. Unlock stretch goals to include those features for YOU for free!\n\n1. We want to introduce these two new body types, 14 armor options, 50+ new weapon and shield options, PLUS even more if you back us and unlock stretch goals. Even though we've drawn these new bodies, there's a lot of work still to render the different armor and other options, so they can be included in the builder. If you back us, it'll give us the boost we need to secure additional time from our artists make these and more character options available to you.\n\n2. Other than the new body choices, most of the options we're including in this Kickstarter will be available only as specific purchases, achievements, or as \"Hero Tier\" member items. Hero Tier members are those who purchase a full year membership - OR Back Us On Kickstarter (that's you). By backing us today - you get access to premium features for 18 months (that's *counts fingers and toes* way more than 12)! And you never loose your saved characters, even if you don't renew.\n\n***We can't say this enough: you ALWAYS have access to all your created characters, plus free tools even if you don't renew your membership.***\n\n3. Finally, supporting us by backing the Kickstarter tells us that there are people who want to use the character builder and that we should continue investing in expanding and improving both features and options.\n\nHow We'll Use The Funds\nNow that we've successfully launched a robust Beta of our Character Builder, and are approaching 2,000 members - it's time to give you MORE! We're raising funds to add new bigger heroic body types to our character builder, more armor, and more weapons.\n\nFunds will be used to pay for additional time from our team of amazing artists, so they can create all of these hand drawn options for you and make them work in our Character Builder.\nGo to https://beneverending.com/about-us/ to see our full team. \nWe're all counting on your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there's always a risk of something catastrophic or unexpected, we're well positioned to deliver. This is our second Kickstarter. And we've been delivering on those rewards (like the Character Builder). The Beta is live and the bodies drawn. It's not that much more work - we just need some help from you to get us across the finish line.\n\nWe have learned a LOT! While we're still building out the full story animation platform, the Character Builder was a key component. That is live in Beta already. We're approaching 2,000 people using the Character Builder to create their D&D characters, social media avatars, Roll20 tokens and more. \n\nWe add new character options every week and have done a good job streamlining the art pipeline process.\n\nWe have the new character models created. It's just a matter of adjusting all of the components to fit the new models, and some of that work has already been done. We need the funds to pay for additional art and programming time from our artists and developers, without slowing down the development of the rest of the platform.\n\nOur big lift was the posing of the characters.

Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow.

Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

A very kind person pointed out that our icon for the Warrior was almost identical to the modern icon used in Black Power messaging. This was entirely an error on my part. I used a placeholder mock-up instead of our final icon and we've since remedied that. You can see the actual icon for the Warrior in the current image on the Campaign page. The icon that was there previously was an internal use only illustration that was meant as a developmental reference and was never intended for print.  I apologize to anyone who was confused or concerned, and I truly hope there was no offense caused.  We have the deepest respect for our Black allies and our icon was always meant as a nod to them.

Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

After receiving a call informing her that her estranged mother is dying, Danielle leaves the tour, hopefully in time patch things up with her mom before the end. Driving through the desert in her Panther Pink 1971 Dodge Demon, she notices some unsettling visual cues. Thinking it's because she's running on too little sleep, she pulls into a roadside motel for the night. In the middle of the night, the clerk turns into a demon and invades her room.\nAfter that things get weird. \nOver the course of the series, 1 - 4, Danielle learns that Satan himself has trapped her in Hell so she can help him reclaim his stolen throne from a usurper, another fallen angel. It's got something to do with a mysterious object in a blue case, a dead gun-runner, Aleister Crowley, a cursed weapon imbued with the trauma of a million murders, and one super cool Panther Pink 1971 Demon powered by Chrysler's infamous \"Slant 6\" engine, a motor renown for its durability.\nPure grindhouse pulp-horror, Hellbound Slant 6 combines a few of my favorite things; cool cars, heavy metal, the devil, and bad-ass women. The whole aesthetic is White Zombie, I'm talking La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume 1 and Astro-Creep vibes, all the way down.

They teamed up with a likeminded DoP and put all their worldly money towards a fantasy feature film [pictured below], made with goodwill and steep learning curves... this formed the first steps into their world of Myrlan. Following their first taste of filmmaking, the team formed Pale Raven Pictures and dove into writing the 126-page draft for the sequel - for some time, that's as far as this world got.\nA few short films and award-winning music videos later, the fantasy world of Myrlan calls again - this time with 4 years of training and experience in writing and directing, not to mention a rich research into medieval combat techniques. Now, with our incredible cast and devoted team all working for the love of the project, we can bring life to Myrlan like never before. How much of the world we can show... is up to you.\nFrom \"Blessed\" - Pale Raven Pictures, 2016\n This is a standalone short film.\nThere are no hidden secrets or references to past manifestations, this is the standalone first chapter of Myrlan's story. We have chewed over many imaginings of the land and its narratives: our world-building has spanned the 6 years since our first film, resulting in two feature screenplays, five short screenplays and a short story - these build a deep reference for the vivid world we present now, in Myrlan.\nWhere we go next is untold... a feature film? Series? We have plans that will lead us to those conversations, with this film as our credentials. You can be sure you're playing a hand in the birth of a grand story.\n\"Myrlan\" development - background to the story and inspiration references for people and costume.\n All funds for this project go straight into production and distribution.\nAny funds we receive will be visible in the film: a costume, an axe, a shield, a tankard... Or be used for the film's visibility, by entry into film festivals - a commitment we make to promote all artists involved in Myrlan.\nOur pitch is simple: everyone working on this project is a volunteer in their professional role. Many will be balancing this against day jobs and other professional work in acting or filmmaking and we are overwhelmed with the devotion and support we've already received from our team. We do not expect artists to work for exposure on feature productions, however, short films don't make money, they cost money. They are an investment in the careers of the artists involved. As the production company we have the responsibility to deliver our actors, stunt performers, camera persons, composer, make-up artists, costume designers and art department a career milestone that is worthy of their dedication and time.\nThe duty of Pale Raven Pictures is to \"springboard artists into the arts industry\". We are working with keen and incredibly talented artists breaking into one of the world's toughest industries (especially after the events of 2020!) - backing this project is investing in the careers of over 40 independent artists.\nFrom \"Alone\" - Pale Raven Pictures, 2018 [click to view]\nAbout the Director and Co-writer, Cieran.\nPart of the co-writing duo behind all Pale Raven's fantasy projects, Cieran writes non-stop. As an independent writer, he has a feature screenplay and 10 shorts under his belt - one recently selected as Semi-Finalist in a screenwriting award.\nHe's fascinated with world-building and loves actors to be able to work in a day-dream where the film world becomes their reality... From his own training in acting, he has an eye for performance and a good hunch for casting, which proved useful when considering over 300 applications for parts in Myrlan..!\nCieran [right] on the set of a Viking combat showcase, 2019 [click to view]\nAbout the Producer and Co-writer, Dale.\nDale has written, directed and performed in independent theatre productions, as well as producing and co-writing a number of films for Pale Raven Pictures. He trained for 4 years in acting, honing transformative character performances. He has worked professionally as an actor for scare attractions, adverts, educational videos and even hosts a pub quiz or two.\nDale's passion is historical combat. He trained for 5 years in HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) and 1 year with the Viking Society, choreographing numerous fight scenes. Dale's goal in Myrlan is to make the combat scenes as realistic and as adrenaline-fuelled as possible.\nDale on the set of our award-winning music video \"Big Noise\" which he produced and co-directed [click to view]\nWe have already started shooting.\nProduction has commenced on test shoots and some preliminary scenes. We aim to shoot the majority of the film in MARCH 2021 and have a finished film by AUGUST 2021.\nAs 2020 has taught us, things have been hard to set in stone. Cieran has trained extensively in Covid-compliance filmmaking, and is a qualified Covid Co-ordinator with First Option Ltd. He has already shot a short film during national lockdown, following health & safety guidelines to the letter and imagining creative solutions for transmission-prevention beyond just using PPE.\nBeer tent, on the set of \"Myrlan\", 2020\nHave a look at how backing can build our story...\nWe have the tenacity to go ahead with production no matter what funds we have. Whether we exceed our goal or fall short, we'll still deliver you a great film - but you can bring it to life. With each goal achieved, we will curate the content of every frame to fit our budget and fully immerse you in Myrlan.\n Current goal: \u00a32750 | Unlocks Special Previously Unreleased Fantasy Origin Story...\n*To make budgets more fun, special content is unlocked in each level. Reaching the current goal of \u00a32750 unlocks a special, unreleased origin story that we shot back in 2018... We never found the right time to share this story, so step with us into the glades of Serpent's Head and a young lord's past...This will include thanks to all our new backers at the time of reaching that goal.\nIf you wish to back us anonymously and you're using a Kickstarter account, you can do this by changing your name in your profile settings. If we reach our goal and you backed using a guest account, we will contact you via the email you provide to request the name you wish to use.\nIt can be hard to imagine the effects of budgets, so we've expanded on it below:\nWith Cuts - \u00a3 Goal Not Reached At this level we would cut larger scenes from the film and re-write around these sections with less demanding sequences. We would lose a major fight scene and re-shoot a dialogue section to condense two scenes into one.\nPerformance Focused - \u00a3450 At this level we would focus intimately on the performances of our great cast. The film would be shot closer in, to avoid focus on set dressing, costume and location, and would have smaller fight scenes. It may play closer to a drama and explore inter-character relationships further.\nCharacter Focused - \u00a3800 Here we would have the liberty to explore the characters in Myrlan in more depth, creating unique costume items and props for them as well as additional supporting cast.\nStory Focused - \u00a31500 At the heart of Myrlan is its story. With this kind of support we would be able to access and dress bigger, bolder locations - showcasing Yorkshire's finest heritage sites. These will include long art department days, building the best environments for our actors to immerse themselves in Myrlan.\nWorld Focused - \u00a32750 Welcome to Myrlan. This backing will create the world of Myrlan as fully formed as it is in our script. If battle-ready swords and castles weren't enough, we'd also have the capacity to expand some scenes - including grander fights and an introduction to our capital city, Heim.\nExpanding Horizons - \u00a32750+ This support puts Myrlan into a whole different conversation. What we've set out to achieve with modest budgets can be imagined on a grander scale and make an unforgettable impression. We can go down paths we thought inaccessible, exploring visual effects, specialist equipment and admissions to prestigious film festivals. \nThe heart of our efforts is to support all artists involved in Myrlan and put them in the spotlight for their incredible work.\n\"Myrlan\" budget breakdown - we will update regularly on how we are distributing your support.\nThanks for taking the time to read.\nWe appreciate any support you may be able to give, from backing us to simply watching the film we create. By sharing this project online, by word of mouth or sending a raven to anyone you think might be interested, you are already supporting us, and we will raise a mug of mead in your honour when wrap night (\"wrap-narok\") comes!\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Myrlan in 2021\nDale in a camera test for \"Myrlan\", 2020", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will go ahead with production no matter what funds we have.

They rocket through the stars to safeguard diplomats ending a generations-old conflict. They sip tea together and share shy glances at the corner cafe with their old classmates and comrades. Even when swords are crossed, they have the potential to connect more deeply than anyone expects.\nA sword duel can end in kissing, a witch can gain her power by helping others find love, and an entire campaign can be built around vagabond matchmakers piloting their sentient gay spaceship from system to system.\nIf you love angsty disaster lesbians with swords, you have come to the right place.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians by April Kit Walsh is a roleplaying game that celebrates the love, power, and existence of queer people\u2014specifically queer people with swords and a lot of feelings. Flirting, sword-fighting, and barbed zingers all mix together in a system designed for both narrative drama and player safety. This innovative take on the Powered by the Apocalypse engine is a breeze to learn and ensures that no matter how the dice fall, something interesting happens to move the story forward.\nIn this game, you will solve problems with wit, empathy, and style, fight when something is worth fighting for, and redeem (or seduce) at least a few of your adversaries. You\u2019re part of a community that embodies important ideals and you\u2019ll strive to protect it and make your world better.\nPlay as one of nine character types: Beast, Chosen, Devoted, Infamous, Nature Witch, Scoundrel, Seeker, Spooky Witch, and Trickster. Each explores a particular emotional conflict that drives the drama and shapes your character\u2019s story. Are you a Beast, faced with the dilemma of expressing your inner truth versus fitting in to a society that demands you conform? A Devoted, who sacrifices for others while struggling to care for yourself? A Trickster, who craves closeness but fears vulnerability? In long-term play, you may even resolve your initial arc and advance into a different playbook as you continue to change and grow, facing new challenges.\nBackers get immediate access to the playbooks too. They're form fillable!\nThirsty Sword Lesbians provides clear, robust guidance and support for running the game, including how to make appealing adversaries, set the tone, structure play, and create a safe environment at the table. Handy reference sheets help you narrate appropriate twists and drama on the fly, depending on the feelings and character types you have in play.\nWant to jump into a one-shot? The game includes six adventures that can stand alone or kick off a longer series: Sword Lesbians of the Three Houses, Best Day of Their Lives, Constellation Festival, Gal Paladins, and Monster Queers of Castle Gayskull. For even more inspiration, it features The Starcross Galaxy campaign setting along with five more settings from these contributing authors:\n Lesbeans Coffehouse by Dominique Dickey\n Neon City 2099 by Jamila Nedjadi\n The Three Orders of Ardor by Whitney Delaglio\n Les Violettes Dangereuses by Jonaya Kemper\n Yuisa Revolution by Alexis Sara\nWe also provide ample guidance on how to create your own tales of fighting with swords and falling in love, along with a world building worksheet, variant rules, and a set of starting scenario seeds to play with. Because the game focuses on feelings and relationships, it\u2019s a lens you can use to play in a variety of genres. If you like slashfic of characters with swords, you\u2019ll love this game.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians is explicitly designed to tell melodramatic and queer stories; tales fraught with relationship triangles, mystery, intrigue, relationship anarchy, celebration, and revolution. It includes rules to highlight different identities, emotional connections, and setting elements.\nThis game is not for fascists, TERFs, or other bigots. The team behind Thirsty Sword Lesbians supports racial liberation, intersectional feminism, and queer liberation. We love and respect transgender people, nonbinary people, intersex people, and women. This game is a joyous celebration of lives and identities otherwise marginalized. If you don\u2019t agree, fix your heart before sharing a table with other people.\nWhat if... not Thirsty? The game fundamentally assumes that the characters crave connection, but that connection doesn\u2019t need to be sexual or romantic. We offer you options for changing how the game addresses connection in our variant rules section.\nWhat if... not Swords? It\u2019s simple enough to swap out a different hand-to-hand combat option. Your campaign or your character can use a labrys, the double-bladed axe that became a lesbian icon in the late 20th century. You can use different styles of unarmed combat or even grapple using telepathic self-projections. It\u2019s also possible to replace the swords with mecha, starships, or guns, but it requires some thought and the book will help you think about how to ensure that it stays intimate and relationship-focused. The conflict doesn\u2019t have to be physically violent, either; you can use any kind of conflict that\u2019s adrenaline-inducing and close-quarters.\nWhat if... not Lesbians? We\u2019ll let you in on a secret: you don\u2019t have to play a lesbian. The game plays with themes that are common for all sorts of people who are marginalized on the basis of gender and sexuality, as well as feelings that go beyond the queer experience. If you want to play thirsty sword cishets, we\u2019re not going to stop you\u2014just don\u2019t be surprised if the game turns them queer.\nWhat if... I\u2019m not good at flirting or zingers? You don\u2019t have to be witty or good at flirting in real life to play a character with those skills, and not every character in Thirsty Sword Lesbians is good with words. Shy and awkward sword lesbians find love, too. You\u2019ll find them well-represented in this game.\nReady? Let\u2019s Go!\nClick for a PDF of this graph!\nWondering what\u2019s involved in all those delicious bullet-points on that reward tier you\u2019ve been flirting with? Here are your answers (scroll further down to find out about the many stretch goals already unlocked\u2014look for the big glass)!\n\n\n\nAngsty disaster lesbians, here and now! You can find details about the production timeline in the project's FAQ.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up your rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would.\nBased on our average shipping scenario in the USA, we're charging a flat $10 fee (media mail + handling costs) for book shipments to USA addresses.\nBIG NEWS as of October 19th! Thanks to a big show of support from our friends at the UK-based Mongoose Publishing, we are now able to offer shipping outside the USA for this Kickstarter. Right now we have the Smitten (all flavors) and Nice tiers set up to offer shipping for $15 to destinations in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. We would be happy to add your location as well! \nPlease contact us at feedback@evilhat.com if it looks like your destination is not yet covered, and we'll add it as an option as soon as we confirm the shipping rate for that country/region.\nIf you end up ordering multiple books for international shipment, we will bill an additional $5 per additional item in BackerKit well after the campaign is done.\nApril Kit Walsh (she/her or ze/zir) writes queer games about feelings, vulnerability, and caring for one another.

We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years.\n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Thirsty Sword Lesbians is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket or otherwise introduce problems getting the books from the printer to us.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2020 and 2021. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Thirsty Sword Lesbians to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run a couple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 14+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

Los escritores pueden enviar sus cuentos en cualquiera de los dos idiomas. Cincuenta porciento de las historias que publicamos en cada edici\u00f3n ser\u00e1 de autores del Caribe, Latinoam\u00e9rica y sus di\u00e1sporas.\nIt was a cold autumn night in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, and a grey spring afternoon in Washington State. Dream Foundry was hosting its first online convention, and Coral spent the day working on running the convention spaces, hosting the meetings, and moderating channels. Eliana kept screaming internally about how happy she was to be able to attend an online SFF convention. After a long day of great panels and a lot of coffee for Coral, the two happened to be in one of the voice chats and they began to talk. \nA few weeks later, an anonymous person sponsored Eliana for SFWA's Nebulas. The two met again in one of the breakout rooms where the Nebula winners were celebrating. The conversation steered towards the topic of SFF and Spanish, and how there were very few online spaces where people who wrote in Spanish could publish short fiction (and get paid for it!)  \nCoral contacted Eliana the following week and asked her what she thought about doing an online bilingual magazine, one that would publish stories in both English and Spanish. Eliana had already toyed with the idea before, so she immediately said yes. \nThe kindness of strangers, a little luck, and the amazing people who brought up the topic led to the creation of Constelaci\u00f3n Magazine, a bilingual speculative fiction magazine. \nEra una noche fr\u00eda de oto\u00f1o en Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, y una tarde gris de primavera en el estado de Washington. Dream Foundry llevaba acabo su primera convenci\u00f3n online, y Coral se pas\u00f3 el d\u00eda trabajando. Eliana no paraba de gritar internamente por lo feliz que estaba de participar en una convenci\u00f3n de SFF online. Tras un largo d\u00eda de paneles geniales, y mucho caf\u00e9 para Coral, las dos se encontraron en uno de los canales de voz y empezaron a charlar. \nUnas semanas despu\u00e9s, una persona an\u00f3nima sponsoreo a Eliana para que asista a los Nebulas, organizado por SFWA. Las dos volvieron a encontrarse en una de las salas de Zoom donde los ganadores del premio estaban celebrando. La conversaci\u00f3n gir\u00f3 en torno al tema de SFF en espa\u00f1ol, y c\u00f3mo hab\u00eda pocos lugares online donde la gente que escribe en el idioma pudiera publicar cuentos (\u00a1y recibir remuneraci\u00f3n por ello!). \nCoral le escribi\u00f3 a Eliana la siguiente semana, y le pregunt\u00f3 qu\u00e9 pensaba de la idea de hacer una revista online biling\u00fce que publicara historias en ingl\u00e9s y espa\u00f1ol. Eliana ya hab\u00eda tenido una idea similar, as\u00ed que inmediatamente dijo que s\u00ed. \nUn buen gesto an\u00f3nimo, un poco de suerte, y las personas geniales que hablaron del tema llevaron a que nazca Constelaci\u00f3n Magazine, una revista de ficci\u00f3n especulativa biling\u00fce. \nConstelaci\u00f3n Magazine will be published quarterly, and all its stories will be in English and Spanish. Authors will be able to submit their stories in either language.\nWe will pay authors $0.08 per word (SFWA rates) and open up for submissions several times a year.\nWe will pay translators $0.04 per word, and raise the pay to $0.06 if we reach one of our stretch goals.\nWe will pay our cover artists $1000 for the cover art.\nConstelaci\u00f3n Magazine ser\u00e1 cuatrimestral y todos los cuentos estar\u00e1n en ingl\u00e9s y espa\u00f1ol.

After finishing school and never finishing college, I decided I would be a writer when I won my first short story contest in 2011. I didn't even consider writing my stories in English because I didn't feel anyone would want to read the stories I wanted to write. \nAfter reading about #DignidadLiteraria, I realized that much like I approach my own writing, if I wanted a place like this to exist, I'd have to create it myself. I want Constelaci\u00f3n to be the place I yearned for back then, a place that actively says: bring me your stories with names that I don't know, open the windows for me to get to know where you come from and your dreams and your struggles, and even better if it's from a small country I don't know much of. So maybe, another little girl from Paraguay, Zambia, the Philippines, Nicaragua, Guyana, Qatar, or Malaysia, or anywhere in the world, will grow up knowing that her stories are valid regardless of the language they're written in. That they matter and that there's an enormous world out there waiting to read them. \nEn sus palabras, Eliana Gonz\u00e1lez Ugarte\nEncontrar libros de ficci\u00f3n especulativa en Paraguay era dif\u00edcil antes de la era del internet, as\u00ed que crec\u00ed leyendo lo que hab\u00eda disponible en la biblioteca de mi colegio. Tras graduarme y nunca terminar la universidad, decid\u00ed que ser\u00eda una escritora despu\u00e9s de ganar mi primer concurso de cuentos cortos en 2011. Ni siquiera consider\u00e9 escribir mis cuentos en Ingl\u00e9s porque no pens\u00e9 que alguien querr\u00eda leer las historias que yo quer\u00eda escribir.\nDespu\u00e9s de leer sobre #DignidadLiteraria, me di cuenta que as\u00ed como encaro mi escritura, si quer\u00eda que exista un lugar como este, tendr\u00eda que crearlo yo. Quiero que Constelaci\u00f3n sea el lugar que yo anhelaba en aquel entonces, un lugar que dice: tr\u00e1iganme sus historias con nombres que no conozco, abran las ventanas para que pueda aprender de d\u00f3nde ven\u00eds, tus sue\u00f1os y tus luchas, y mejor todav\u00eda si es de un lugar que no conozco mucho. Entonces, quiz\u00e1, otra ni\u00f1a de Paraguay, Zambia, Filipinas, Nicaragua, Guyana, Qatar o Malasia, o cualquier lugar del mundo, crecer\u00e1 sabiendo que sus historias son importantes, y que hay un mundo enorme all\u00e1 afuera que quiere leerlas. \n In her words, Coral Alejandra Moore\nAfter the Nebula Awards in 2020, I happened to be sitting in a Zoom room with a handful of people. The conversation wound back and forth, as they usually do, and I some point Mary Robinette Kowal asked a perfectly innocent question. \"I wonder if there's a market for Spanish speculative fiction in this country?\" \"Absolutely!\" was out of my mouth so quickly it could never be taken back, and just like that, my brain was already moving pieces around to figure out if I knew how to make that happen. So my answer to the question of \"Why now?\" is quite simple: Because it's about time.\nEn sus palabras, Coral Alejandra Moore\nDespu\u00e9s de los premios Nebulas de este a\u00f1o, ocurri\u00f3 que estaba sentada en una sala de Zoom con un grupo de gente. La conversaci\u00f3n iba de tema en tema, como suele ocurrir, y en un momento Mary Robinette Kowal hizo una pregunta inocente. \"\u00bfMe pregunto si en este pa\u00eds hay mercado para historias de ficci\u00f3n especulativa en espa\u00f1ol?\" \"\u00a1Absolutamente!\" sali\u00f3 de mi boca tan r\u00e1pido que nunca podr\u00eda retractarme, y as\u00ed, mi cerebro ya empez\u00f3 a mover las piezas para ver si podr\u00eda hacerlo. Entonces mi respuesta a \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no? es bastante simple: porque ya era hora. \n\n\n\nAround the world, in various cultures, constellations have often been linked to the practice of astrology. So, for a little bit of extra fun, we thought we'd make a zodiac of our own, with each year being a different animal. Our first year, 2021 will be the Year of the Capybara! Capybaras are the embodiment of serenity.

I'm a tabletop game designer you may know from games and books like the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Betrayal at House on the Hill, The Maze of Games, Apocrypha, and Lords of Vegas. Once the latter game was off to the printer, I went part time at Lone Shark for a few months to try to do something positive in the last months of this election cycle. \nSo I wrote, edited, and designed a massive new edition of my essay book Game Theory in the Age of Chaos, alongside my mathematician co-author Rich Malena-Webber. It's a strategy guide on how to fight fascism. My team and I are raising funds to print the book here on Kickstarter. We're doing this because game theory suggests this is our last chance to save America.\nGame Theory in the Age of Chaos is a 532-page book of 65 essays about game theory and politics. Every day since Donald Trump got elected, I've fought the urge to scream at the internet. Instead, I channeled that howling into a series of essays showing how game theory explains and justifies the behavior of all the actors in the system: Trump, the Democrats, the Republicans, the Supreme Court, and most of all, people like us. By taking a deep breath, remaining level-headed, and letting my grasp of game science do its work, I've connected with my readers on Medium, and had my essays shared all over the world. Alongside my Basket of Adorables colleague Gaby Weidling, we made a small edition of some of those essays a couple years ago, supported by scholarly essays by Rich, who teaches game theory to raise funds for Democrats. We also sent copies to every Democratic Senator and Congressperson, with your help.\nNow, as we count down the last weeks of this election, I've compiled a massive new omnibus edition, with forty new essays by me and supporting pieces from Rich, plus an all-new foreword from game enthusiast and Washington senator Steve Hobbs. It's quite the book, I think.\nAs with our last campaign like this, we're also giving U.S. backers the option to send a copy to every Democratic member of the incoming Congress. If you're feeling particularly generous, you can get the book sent to ten Congresspeople. Based on the letters we got from them, some of them actually read it and applied its tactics to help beat back the autocrats and restore democracy in America. If you select that option, we'll cover the shipping to a Congress member. Because we don't actually know who these members will be, we're going to do this in one batch, rather than have individual backers select Congresspeople. We'll also send them a note which has your name on it (if you want).\nFor readers in the United States, we have another option for you. This Kickstarter is about raising funds for the book; it is NOT a political fundraiser. \nBut we also care deeply about winning this election. So, you can go to our site at SHARK.VOTE and back the book there instead, and we'll give you the book for free if you do some critical election integrity tasks like volunteering. You'll be treated as if you had backed the campaign when we send the information to our pledge manager after this campaign ends. Again, you don't have to back here if you select this option. If you do want to back here as well, we'll send you a book for each campaign you back.\nThis is just for Americans, since soliciting foreign interference in campaigns is still illegal last time we checked. If you're from outside the U.S., please back the book here!\nThe book is done. We sent it to the printer last week. They're putting the finishing touches on it now. In fact, you can read all of it right now, because it's right here. Go ahead, flip through it. If you like it, get yourself a copy.\nIf you order a physical book for $25, you'll not only get it in softcover, but also as a PDF. You can add it in ebook form (.epub and .mobi) for an additional $5. Or you can just get all three digital versions for $15.\nContents pages\nEssay pages\nHere are some of the essays in the book.\nGame Theory and the Two Magic Words that will Impeach Trump\nCo-op Mode: Why Trump Sees \u201cMany Sides\u201d to Nazi Murder\nAbortion Rights and the Game Theory of Armor\nGood Guys, Bad Guys, and the End of an Armed Society\nThe Kap Trap: Why No Team will Call in Kaepernick\nThe GOP Is Living in a Fantasy World on Taxes\u2014Specifically, Star Wars\n#MPRraccoon and the Puzzle of Hope\nSeizing Children Is Good Policy (If You\u2019re a Complete Monster)\nMike Pence is the Werewolf\nGame-Changer: How the Democrats Won the Kavanaugh War by Losing the Battle\nPlaying Diplomacy with Nancy Pelosi is a Dangerous Game\nBarr Sinister: How to Beat a Corrupt Referee\nI Don\u2019t Think She Knows About Second Brexit, Pip: How Theresa May\u2019s War of Attrition Killed Everyone\nYou Don\u2019t Have to Want to Save the Planet. You Just Have To.\nThe Butt Fumble: Rudy Giuliani and the Incompetence Gambit\nThe Progressive Voltron: How to Buy an Election\n\u201cI Don\u2019t Take Responsibility at All\u201d: Trump Fails the Trolley Problem\nWhen the Social Contract Dies, It\u2019s Time to Riot\nSouthern Discomfort: Lose the Confederacy or Lose Billions\n2020 Vision: What to Do When Everything Is Life-or-Death\nA Wargame Designer Defines Our Four Possible Civil Wars\nHere's the size of the book itself. It's solid.\nPLAY\n\nSome of these essays are pretty heavy, it's true. For me, it helps to crank up the volume on my favorite thematically appropriate tunes. So, I've assembled some of these songs, with the artists' kind permission. Because they want to fight fascism too. Each book comes with a digital copy of the album Music to Doomscroll By.\nThe songs include:\n Austin Wintory\u2019s \u201cThe Storm\u201d\n The Doubleclicks\u2019 \u201cPanic\u201d\n Jim Boggia\u2019s \u201cNothing\u2019s Changed\u201d\n Jonathan Coulton\u2019s \u201cSolid State\u201d\n Jonathan Mann\u2019s \u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s Dissent\u201d\n Kid Beyond\u2019s \u201cCEASEFIRE\u201d\n Kirby Krackle\u2019s \u201cQuaransheen\u201d\n Marian Call and the Guttersnipes\u2019 \u201cConsequence\u201d\n Mega Ran\u2019s \u201cDo Better\u201d\n Molly Lewis\u2019s \u201cPantsuit Sasquatch\u201d\n Quelle Chris and Chris Keys\u2019 \u201cSudden Death\u201d\n Sidecar Astronauts\u2019 \u201cNazi Puncher\u201d\nAnd maybe more when we get done with it. It's music for your brain and your tapping toes. The music comes with the PDF of every copy of the book. Free.\nHere's a slice from Meg, whose music you can also hear in our Kickstarter video above.\nGame Theory in the Age of Chaos isn't my first political project. My best known bit of outreach is The Ghastlytrump Tinies, a parody of Edward Gorey's The Gashlycrumb Tinies that Gaby and I did with approval of the Edward Gorey House. The initial run of the book raised about $10,000 for Democrats and the Southern Poverty Law Center. You can add on a copy of The Ghastlytrump Tinies to your pledge by adding $10 to your pledge. You'll get the booklet plus a PDF of The Annotated Ghastlytrump Tinies, which contains 26 more longform poems by me.\nThe Ghastlytrump Tinies is an alphabet primer of all the things we stood to lose in a Trump administration. From \"A is for Arctic, drilled by wells so tall\" to \"Z is for Zeitgeist, cuz it's the apocalypse,\" we got our favorite artists and cartoonists\u2014John Kovalic, David Malki!, Satine Phoenix, Heather Hudson, Kris Straub, Lar deSousa, Nate Taylor, and so many others\u2014to illustrate one of the impending disasters as seen by a child. Over the last four years, it's become a tragic checklist, as the Trump administration has found a way to ruin just about everything good.\nIt's a poignant, funny, troubling work. I encourage you to watch the Doubleclicks' audiobook below.\nLone Shark's games are played by people of every political and social background, and we're thankful for that. But we're people too, and we all agree that trampling human rights and undermining democracy are bad things. We've never been shy of saying to people \"This is what we think\" as loudly as possible. Through our charity and social work, we've championed the rights of marginalized people since we started this company 18 years ago. In 2016, when we wanted to do more overtly political work, Gaby and I made a side group called Basket of Adorables. As Lone Shark's personnel decided they wanted to be a part of those efforts, we decided to fold that into our company. Everybody knows our opinions. If they're gonna hate on us for expressing them, we don't want them as customers anyway.\nWe're all game and puzzle creators, but trust us, you don't have to tell us to \"stick to game design.\" Honestly, we'd much rather be sticking to game design. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and so we're devoting our free time to helping restore the rule of democracy in America. Most of us contribute our time, writing, and illustration out of the hope that we'll have a positive effect on the national dialogue.\nI'm thrilled to be joined, as usual, by Richard Malena-Webber an academic, puzzle and game designer, and presenter. He's designed puzzles for everything from the launch of the Tomb Raider movie to live interactive crime-solving mysteries. Rich created and hosts Atomic Game Theory, a video series devoted to game analysis, and he created the Puzzle Keyring, an educational decryption tool for codes and ciphers. His recent project was a D&D summer camp for kids that was wildly successful.\nAs usual, I'm helped here by editors Gaby Weidling and F. Wesley Schneider, cover designer Liz Spain and Skylar Woodies, artists John Kovalic and Pat Race, and store and website manager Shane Steed. Plus everyone at Lone Shark. I appreciate their help, and of course yours as well. Thanks for helping restore democracy in America.

You can increase the width of the Level Up by buying extra Centre Tiles \u2013 but make sure you buy enough extra side pieces to finish your table.  You can purchase extras by viewing the Add On Menu on the page below.  \nSome common sizes\nThe 2x4 Level Up (A 24 inch by 48 inch rectangle)\nThe 3x3 Level Up (A 36 inch square)\nThe 3x4 Level Up (A 36 inch by 48 inch rectangle)\nThe 4x6 Level Up (A 48 inch by 72 inch rectangle \u2013 for wargamers)\nReady To Level Up Your Game Night?\nAs fans of board, card and role-playing games, we often struggled on game nights to fit everything we needed onto our table. How do you fit character sheets, game cards, the main board, figures, dice and tokens on to a table that is also playing host to drinks, snacks, the compulsory game night pizza and a myriad of other items?\nWe have found the solution to your board game frustrations... the Level Up - a lightweight, portable, tabletop extension that raises the main playing surface, whilst still allowing plenty of space underneath for all your game night necessities!\nDimensions\nLevel Up is made up of 6 tiles which each measure 12\" square (30.48cm). The whole platform, when constructed, measures 24\" (60.96 cm) by 36\" (91.44cm) and stands at just over 6 inches from the table (16cm) \u2013 when complete, the playing area is just a little over A1 in size - further extension pieces are available in the stretch goals.\nEach 12\" square tile has been designed with reinforced rib supports to enable the level up to carry weight up to even the heaviest game pieces or the odd rogue cat. The Level Up has been tested by our engineers to 5kg (11lbs).\n\nWe have chosen metal for the legs for durability and strength but also so that they can be made as thin as possible, so as not to interrupt your view of the items underneath the Level Up. To ensure durability, threaded metal inserts have been added to the underside of each tile to provide proper thread engagement for the legs to be inserted into.\nThe design of the Level Up allows for the legs to be attached as close to the center of the surface as possible. This clears the underneath space for your character sheets and attached cards, dice, pencils as well as the ever-present danger of drinks. If stability is a worry, each tile will have three threaded metal inserts so that the legs can be attached as close in or as far out as you require.\n\nHow Sturdy Is It?\nThere have been a lot of questions regarding the question of stability of the Level Up.  We're pleased to say it's been tested to hold 5kg (11lbs)!  If you want to make it even sturdier you can add extra legs by adding to your pledge.  Please see the \"Add On Menu\" below!  \nPLAY\n\n\n  Every Level Up Comes With: \n(6) Board Tiles \n(6) Legs \n(1) Canvas Tote bag\nWhere table space is at a real premium and the games are competing for the same space with all the yummy fare that you are selling. Well, now your customers can have their cake and eat it whilst still playing their favorite game (other food items are available).\nWhether you are interested in level Up to use in the cafe or for your shop, please get in touch and we will send you a retail price list.\nAs well as creating the Level Up as a 6-piece, standalone product, we have some great add ons that will enhance the product.  Most came about as a direct response to suggestions supplied by you during our pre-launch campaign so thank you for that!\n\n Here's how add ons work.  Pick out your add on below.  Add that amount to your pledge.  For example.  Let's say you want the map clips and the upgraded bag.  Before we ship the product we will email you a survey and confirm your add ons and give you the opportunity to add more if you like.  \nAdd \u00a34 / $5 to your pledge and get a set of 6 plastic board clips.  Perfect for anyone using a battle mat or any rolled up surface.  Say goodbye to the days of having to weigh down the edges for a flat and smooth playing surface.\n Add \u00a34 / $5 to your pledge and receive a set of 6 extra legs.  Perfect for those who want to add extra stability to their board.  \nAdd \u00a312 / $15 to your pledge and get a set of 2 middle extension pieces and 2 extra legs.

We are ready to begin the manufacture of Level Up, all we need now is you to help us make this concept a real success.\n\nThis project has real potential to be massive. That being said, the bigger the project, the more links there are in the chain. With every additional link, there could be additional problems waiting to ambush the smooth planning of this project.\n\nWhilst we hope no problems will occur IF something was to happen, we can assure you that we will do all we can to mitigate any delay. Some difficulties, however much we might want to help, will be outside of our control. Industrial action, acts of god, fire and flood, ash clouds from volcanoes as well as plague and pestilence are just some of the issues and problems that might occur that we have no control over. \n\nWe have, however, already added in \u2018stretch\u2019 room, additional time for each section of the project to be completed and will keep the delivery dates and other deadlines updated on the KS page as well as through our development blog and social media channels. We will work hard to ensure all your queries are answered in a timely fashion.\n\nTo be honest and upfront is at the core of our Kickstarter Project. We have chosen a superb team to support us in this project who want this game to become as much a reality as we do. This being said many of our team are sub-contractors working for several clients at the same time. Sometimes this leads to parts of our production process working slower than we had planned or forecast.

The brainchild of Kate Madison, known for her phenomenally popular Lord of the Rings fan film Born of Hope, and award winning actor Christopher Dane, the first season was released on YouTube in 2016.\nNow, Ren is back to fund new episodes and continue the story, with the help of a global audience of fans and supporters.\n\nWith 8 million YouTube views, 14 international awards and over 60 nominations, Ren: The Girl with the Mark is one of the most successful genre web series in the world. Season One is available to watch on YouTube, Starbaby TV, Amazon Prime (US, UK and Germany), The Fantasy Network and Seed & Spark.\nWe plan to continue from where we left off, following Ren as she\u2019s pursued by the Kah\u2019Nath while also dealing with being wrenched from everything familiar. Ren was torn away from her friends and family at the end of last season and thrown together with the outlaw Hunter. Ren desperately wants to find Karn and her brother, she needs answers and cannot abandon Baynon like she feels her parents did to her. Hunter joins her on her quest, he wants to help her, or is there more to it than that? Does he have his own agenda? \nThe pair don't have much time to figure out a plan before the pursuing Kah'Nath catch up to them. Ren's new bond with the Mahri spirit starts to grant her memories from those Nuh'Mahri who came before but will she be able to figure out the powers that now start to develop without a guide to show her the way? \nMany of the main characters in Season One play an important role in Ren\u2019s journey so although we will be focusing on Ren we will also learn the fates of others as we move forward. We even have some new characters to introduce as the story continues, some may be fleeting but others may become significant players in Ren\u2019s story.\nAs Ren begins to come to terms with the circumstances she finds herself in, she will start to explore not only the physical world around her but the very fabric of society and the truths she has always been taught.\nRen is fan supported, creator distributed. There is no network behind it, no Hollywood studio. It lives or dies based on YOUR support. Season One could never have been made if it wasn't for the hundreds of people who backed it financially or volunteered their time to work on it.\nYes, Season One has been staggeringly successful on YouTube, but YouTube isn't a paid platform, so revenue is limited, and there's no public funding for web series in the UK. So we rely on our fans to help support the show, as Patrons and through crowdfunding campaigns like this. This way we can keep our creative vision and remain independent, and you get to keep watching the series you love with no risk of a big studio cancelling it.\nCONTRIBUTE if you have the means to do so. You can pledge as little as \u00a31, or the equivalent in you local currency (Kickstarter automatically converts it). Backers will get updates along the way, they can grab some awesome rewards, and they'll be the first to know when the episodes are ready to watch.\nSHARE with your friends and family. Tell people how much you love the show and how you want to see more. If your loved ones don\u2019t know what Ren is, sit down and binge the first season with them. Share the love! #RenewRen #MakeYourMark \nCHEERLEAD: Crowdfunding can be exhausting for everyone. Helping us keep a positive and friendly community around this shared goal is essential. Everyone is here to have a great time collectively, bringing a story that we love to life for new episodes.\nWe want to make all five of our Season Two episodes for you, so as soon as we hit our initial target we'll start working on our stretch goals to fund new episodes. Watch this space for details.\n We\u2019re excited to offer you a selection of unique perks as a thank you for supporting us. Have a browse and remember you can change your reward pledge at any time, so if we add a new item you can always upgrade later.  \nWe\u2019ve worked hard to include rewards tailored to all members of our community, whether you\u2019re a filmmaker, gamer, collector or fantasy fan, and as the campaign runs we will be on the hunt for new items to add as well.  \nThe Fantasy Network, our campaign partner, is a community-owned network that funds and streams independent fantasy and science fiction from around the world. When our second season premieres, you\u2019ll get access to watch not just the new Ren episodes, but to discover other incredible shows from our global producers too. TFN is available on the web, iOS, Android, and Roku.\nThe Boar\nThere are five main coins in the currency of Ren's country, Alathia.  Ren was born during the 'Time of Dragons' and each coin has the dragon on its reverse, representing the current era, which changes every one hundred years. On the other side of the coin there is an image representing an admired human quality.  This quality is written in runes above the image with the name below.\nAs this trailer for the Season One videos shows,  the vlogs are a great way to learn about filmmaking as well as sharing in the fun of being on set.\nExample round\nDohl'Leg is a two-player fantasy betting game designed for the series by co-creator Christopher Dane. A roll of the letter die determines the live column for each round, and players place one bet each in the live column and one elsewhere on the board. The number die is then rolled, and the player with bets in the corresponding square scoop all the chips in that column. As the game goes on and the board fills up with chips, strategise where to hedge your bets and where to double down. Roll the Eye for a double payout, or roll the Mouth for an automatic win. Be the first to bag all of your opponent's chips, and don't forget to cheat when their back is turned!\nSeason One photo book\nRen\u2019s director of photography Neil Oseman has 20 years\u2019 experience of shooting independent films. In this course, he shares his knowledge across 4x hour-long modules that will take your cinematography to the next level. Each module sees Neil block, light and shoot a scene inspired by Ren, with real actors, on real locations, while explaining every creative and practical decision he makes. This course is aimed at students, budding gaffers, camera operators looking to step up to DP, content DPs looking to move into drama, and filmmakers looking to increase their production values through cinematic lighting. The course will be released in May 2020. \nOriginal clay sculpt for the Hunter miniature, by Hans Goosen\nNOTE: VAT/sales tax and shipping costs are not included in your pledge.  Actual VAT and shipping costs will be calculated and charged in  BackerKit after the campaign, based on your location. See the Shipping and VAT section for more information. \n\nWill Sophie Skelton return for Season Two?\nDue to her commitments on Outlander and other projects, Sophie is unable to return to the role of Ren. We're sad to see her go, but we're so grateful to her for bringing our title character to life, and we wish her all the very best. We're also super-excited to have discovered a gifted young actor who can take the character forward into her future adventures! \nWhat is Kickstarter?\nKickstarter lets the community decide if a project deserves to succeed. Pledges are ONLY collected if we reach our minimum funding goal. If we don\u2019t reach our goal, no money is collected and the project fails. This helps reduce your risk, knowing that you will only be charged if we raise enough funds to make the project properly.\nRather than relying on the whims of network or studio executives, we empower you the community to renew the shows that you love.\nWhile pledge rewards on Kickstarter are exciting \u2014 and a great way for us to say thank you! \u2014 the most important reward is that together we get to continue the story of Ren: The Girl with the Mark. Thank you for making a pledge that helps us put as much of our fundraise as possible straight into the production and what you see on screen.\nAs such, our policy for funds pledged in excess of pledge levels is that they are considered bonus funds for production. Please do not add any additional money during the Kickstarter for BackerKit shipping, VAT, or extras \u2014 it will not carry over to BackerKit. It will turn into costumes, set decoration, hiring cast and crew, and making Ren: The Girl with the Mark the best possible thank you for the support that you\u2019ve given us.\nWhat is BackerKit?\nWhen the campaign ends, we will use BackerKit to send surveys, calculate and charge accurate shipping and VAT, and allow you to make address changes. You\u2019ll receive a link to the survey when it's ready, which you can use at any time to check on the status of your order.\nTo avoid unforeseen issues, not over or undercharge you, and to better let you manage your pledges, we have decided to not include shipping in the reward costs but to calculate it properly after the campaign in our BackerKit pledge manager.\nAs well as removing items you don't want from your reward to save on shipping, you will also be able to add extra items from the BackerKit store once the campaign on Kickstarter has ended, allowing you to tailor your reward to exactly what you want.\nFor similar reasons we have not included any sales TAX or VAT costs to the rewards. This will also be added, if needed, later in BackerKit.\nAs a company based in the UK, we recognize that changing political situations may affect our ability to ship \u201cin-zone\u201d for the EU. We will work with our fulfilment partners to make sure that VAT (or other duties) are handled properly up front so that packages within the EU will ship domestically, and to your door, whenever possible, from warehouses in Germany and/or the UK. Similarly, our fulfilment partners in North America will ship directly from a warehouse in the USA.\nFulfilment Partners\nThe Fantasy Network and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, both experienced crowdfunding companies, are helping us source and manage rewards fulfilment. Rewards in North America will ship via Funagain from their Indianapolis warehouse. Rewards in the EU will ship from UK and German warehouses. Digital downloads will be served via Vimeo, Gumroad, and BackerKit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we work hard to mitigate our risks, the unforeseen can always throw a curve ball. We are always prepared to adapt and adjust with circumstances outside our control. We will have production insurance, contingency plans, and an experienced production team to guide the production through any rough water.\n\nWe have learnt a lot from our previous campaigns. We are working with Ben Dobyns from Zombie Orpheus Entertainment so we also have their nine-year track record of crowdfunding success to help us through any problems. \n\nThe project will be submitted to IMDb. Backers listed as getting an IMDb credit please be aware that although submitted these credits are subject to IMDb approval.\n\nWe are building relationships with a number of partners like the team at BackerKit, manufacturers, fulfilment partners and everyone else we need to make sure that our campaign is completed to your satisfaction.\n\nOur pledge to you is that we will always do our utmost to deliver on our commitment to excellence.\n\nNOTE: We have budgeted for rewards and production based on current treaties, exchange rates, and tariffs. With the final form of Brexit still unknown, we want to make special note that our plans may require significant revision should Brexit or any domestic or global turbulence affect the production of Ren or delivery of your rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Kate Madison: Mythica Entertainment\n2 created \u00b7 31 backed\nMythica Entertainment is a team of independent filmmakers in the UK committed to providing high-quality entertainment, specialising in the...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "TIP JAR", "descp": "Receive the backer-only updates and access to the post-campaign BackerKit store.\nNOTE: VAT/sales tax is not included in your pledge.

Ten (10) generic bases will be provided as part of rewards that include a Gameboard-1 unit. Games can also be played with purely digital pieces. \nOur display refresh rate allows fast-paced gameplay with low latency, from multiple contact points, when using physical or digital objects. \nWe've also designed the Gameboard-1 to connect to your personal electronic device for private screen game play or augmented reality applications.\nWIFI and Bluetooth integration allows personal electronic devices to create virtual interactions with the board environment, with or without internet access.\nTo increase screen real estate, the Gameboard-1 can even connect multiple gameboards for a multi-screen gaming experience, using NFC sensors and internal antenna arrays to make wireless connection seamless and fast.\nConnecting multiple Gameboard-1 units is a snap! (This image is a render to illustrate multiple-board functions.)\nGorgeous hardware isn't enough. We're gamers and we know what we want: more games! \nThis campaign will help us finish building a single marketplace that will offer thousands of individual titles a la carte and an optional monthly subscription service for unlimited access to that vast library of games and gaming tools. \nIt's like Netflix for games, including everything from classics like chess and checkers to modern strategy games to interactive and original creations from partner game creators, with networked game play similar to PSN or Xbox Live.\nWe are building partnerships with some of the biggest names in the hobby and gaming industry to create a robust library... and we're excited to reveal more partners over the course of this campaign.  \nWe want anyone to be able to bring their games to the platform. Our open developer SDK means that it is simple for developers to add and update their games in the ever-expanding games library.The Last Gameboard marketplace isn't restricted to board games. Developers can make any game or content they want: from purely digital board games to games that interact with physical pieces, cards, and dice in ways we haven't even imagined yet.\nWe don't take the term \"Partners\" lightly.  We provide GitHub, Architect and Engineer access to help drive innovation and product roadmap.  We are building a community. We are the community.   \nThe Last Gameboard technology is fully compatible with Unity and Unreal.\nThe Developer Edition includes everything you need to start creating your own games, programs, and innovations for this platform.   \nGameboard-1 is beautifully designed from the inside out. It's a sleek console with real world game play informing every element of design. \nWe have our prototype in the lab right now and cannot wait to share the first unit from the manufacturer in the coming weeks!    \nHere are just some of the hardware features we plan to include with every Gameboard-1 unit we ship:\nThe Gameboard-1 is designed with thin edges to maximize playable surface area, chemically strengthened glass and a plastic housing designed for durability.\nThe 1920x1920 LCD display exceeds the specification for high-definition, so that every detail is crisp and clear.\nPlus, at only five pounds, the device remains lightweight and portable. The on-board battery allows up to four hours of game play, so the game can continue by candlelight if the power goes out.\n Two USB-C ports support not only peripheral devices, but with a USB-C to HDMI adapter you can output the contents of the screen to another device, making Gameboard-1 perfect for Twitch and YouTube streamers who want to embed or overlay the game within Wirecast or OBS.\nPlay online with networked play, or download your game and enable the Gameboard-1 local WIFI network to connect private screens and peripherals when offline.\nFour speakers and microphones let sound become an integral part of your game play, while WIFI and Bluetooth connectivity makes syncing with your personal mobile device a breeze.\nAn onboard 64 GB eMMC hard drive stores your key files locally, while a 64-bit CPU and 4GB of RAM keep everything running smoothly on our custom-built The Last Gameboard OS (TLGOS).\nFAMILIES:  From your living room to visiting grandparents, now your entire game library can travel with you. Enjoy a family game with the kids, then stay up late with the latest strategy game.\nGAMERS: Thanks to full compatibility with D20Pro, now included in your subscription, gamemasters can direct the action with every tool available in a multi-player virtual tabletop... on a real tabletop! Interactive maps, combat management, and access to tabletop systems\u2014from Dungeons & Dragons to Pathfinder and beyond\u2014make Gameboard-1 a crucial part of your weekly campaign.\nGAME STORES: Immediately demo many of the games on your shelves for customers, helping to increase sales, then bring out Gameboard-1 again for open game night. Game stores are all about community and The Last Gameboard helps you focus on creating the extraordinary experiences that keep bringing regulars back to the table.\nSTREAMERS: An essential tool for tabletop streamers, Gameboard-1 lets you bring the details straight to your online audience. Forget trying to set up an extra camera above the table and lighting the board properly: now you can display partial or full game AV output right inside your favorite streaming software, while you focus on the interactive play that your audience loves.\nDEVELOPERS: Whether you're adapting your classic board game for TLGOS or creating an innovative new experience that merges tabletop with the unique capabilities of Gameboard-1, you're at the cutting edge of new technology, bringing games to a new generation of gamers.    \nWe've designed Gameboard-1 with the following technical specifications that we intend to meet or exceed in manufacturing:   \nA successful Kickstarter is just the first step in the process of bringing the Gameboard-1 to your door! \nFollowing the Kickstarter we will prepare and launch surveys on BackerKit, where you will be able to manage your pledge, update your shipping address, and where we will charge market prices for shipping and fulfillment. Please DO NOT add money for shipping during the Kickstarter, so that we can keep those costs as accurate as possible for each pledge level prior to shipping.\nWe are excited to use BackerKit for pledge management, where you will be able to select add-ons, update your shipping address, pay fair market prices for shipping, and track the status of your rewards.  \n The initial development of Gameboard-1 was funded thanks to a seed round of private capital, which allowed us to complete design of our prototype and finalize our manufacturing partnerships. Now we're bringing Gameboard-1 to Kickstarter to raise money to fund:\nManufacturing Testing (including beta boards)\nThe Manufacturing Run\nPackaging\nGameboard-1 Case Development\nWith your help we'll be able to transition our product from prototype to retail-ready.\nMost importantly, this limited-edition Kickstarter helps bring together the core community of gamers, streamers, and developers who will receive first access to the Gameboard-1.  \nAbout the Company\nIn 2018, avid hobby gamer Shail Mehta met with hardware guru Rob Wyatt over beer to discuss the fundamental flaw with touchscreen devices: why couldn\u2019t any digital device recognize physical objects for varying shapes and sizes, especially the types of objects that are needed for hobby gaming.\nGameboard-1 was born out of the need to address the analog problems of hobby games while maintaining the essence of why gamers love to play. Gameboard-1 solves the problems of set-up/take down, learning/teaching new games, inability to explore games before buying, games that cannot be easily saved, finding someone to play with and much more.\nIn January 2019, The Last Gameboard, Inc., was formed. They began to establish relationships with game makers all around the world, incorporating both Unity & Unreal to bring the best hobby gaming content to TLG\u2019s upcoming platform.  \nShail Metha - CEO / Co-Founder\nShail has a passion for gaming. When she immigrated to the US in the 90s, Shail encountered a group of children in her apartment that were playing chutes and ladders. Shail, not knowing English, just began to play. The role of gameplay in creating community and fostering human connection has been central to Shail\u2019s work at The Last Gameboard.\nIn her professional life, Shail has a financial background working for hedge funds and venture capital funds. She has consulted for the Nuclear Regulatory Committee, City University of New York, City & County of Denver \u2018s projects, and Triunity Engineering. Has managed teams and executed projects throughout her career. Shail is the driving force for the vision and future for The Last Gameboard.\nRob Wyatt - CTO / Co-Founder\nRob moved from the UK to the US nearly 20 years ago. Known as the \u201cGuru of Hardware\u201d in the industry, Rob loves creating new technologies in gaming and is an avid skydiver. He was the system architect of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox console and went on to work at Playstation, Atari and Magic Leap. Ron owns several patents in AR/VR including a patent on multiple app sparse pixel time warp in AR headsets and processing. He is a visionary, designer and maker of The Last Gameboard\u2019s incredible technology.\n Dustin Hatchett - Business Development\nDustin has been an avid gamer since he first played TSR\u2019s Boot Hill and FASA\u2019s Star Trek RPG in 1983. In his 25 years in the gaming industry, Dustin has managed multiple retail game stores in Denver, Colorado and owns a production company producing live action role-playing games and multiple game conventions. For the past 20 years, he has worked in technical and project management roles for large telecommunications companies.\nDustin will bring his extensive game industry knowledge and background in project management as co-owner of Rocky Mountain Games (a pre-visualization and development company) to The Last Gameboard as Business Development Coordinator.\nMike Horn - Advisor\nMike is a recent inductee into the Pop Culture Hall of Fame who grew up in the collectibles business. After college, his first job was as a buyer for Diamond Comic Distributors, the world\u2019s largest wholesaler of comic books and supplier to thousands of comics and hobby shops. His job was to line up and buy trading cards (initially) and later all licensed merchandise.\nIn 1994, he left Diamond to form his first company, Palisades Marketing. Originally a marketing consulting agency, he evolved it to become a leading manufacturer of licensed collectibles. By 2005, Mike had grown Palisades to nearly $7 Million in annual revenue with 20 full time employees. Afterwards, Mike formed SwagDog and Power Up Factory, two successful ventures in the collectibles industry, before returning to consulting with the formation of Golden Strategic Development in 2019.\n Lys Galati - Marketing\nElysabeth \u201cLys\u201d Galati was seven years old when she finished reading the leather-bound silver foil edition of Frank Miller\u2019s The Dark Knight Returns. Still overwhelmed by the book, her mother asked \u201cLys, your math is getting better. Do you want to come up with the adults and play D&D?\u201d. Nothing was the same after that. A simple game night became an origin story.\nAfter a stint with Diamond Comics doing everything from customer service to buyer, Lys saw a gap in the industry. Lots of incredibly creative people who put their heart and soul into products who often didn\u2019t have the time and (sometimes) skills to promote themselves properly. Sphinx Public Relations started in 2000 and has been an ongoing business ever since. The company was founded on the idea that all geek voices, regardless of budget, deserved a chance at the spotlight.  \nGet Your Project Funded Today!\nADDITIONAL PARTNERS\nBackerKit\nZombie Orpheus Crowdfunding Management\nArrow Electronics\nWant to stay on top of all the latest news about Gameboard-1?

During a game you engineer and play out stupid, disastrous situations, usually at the intersection of greed, fear, and lust. It\u2019s like making your own Coen brothers movie, in about the same amount of time it\u2019d take to watch one.\nFiasco is inspired by cinematic tales of small time capers gone disastrously wrong \u2013 inspired by films like Blood Simple, Fargo, The Way of the Gun, Burn After Reading, and A Simple Plan. You play ordinary people with powerful ambition and poor impulse control. \nSo what's in the box? \nThe new Fiasco retains all the features familiar to old friends, while being much more welcoming to new ones. \nWe\u2019ve tossed out all the dice and index cards and replaced them with playing cards. Setup elements? On cards. Tilt, Aftermath and positive and negative Outcomes? On cards. It speeds up play, adds intuitive, strong visual appeal, and just plain improves the play experience. \nAs an added bonus, it\u2019s now possible to \u201ctune\u201d playsets, combining elements from your favorite Fiasco settings old and new. Since playsets are now decks of cards, we\u2019re committed to rolling out old favorites and new surprises regularly, and we\u2019re looking into how we can share the tools you need to make you own. \nThe game has been playtested thoroughly and is ready to go. We\u2019ve taken great pains to make it beginner friendly - everything you need is in the box.\nThe start of any Fiasco is in the Setup. You and your friends (3-5 players) will choose one of the playset decks that sounds fun and put it on the table with the Engine deck. That's all you need to play the game, but we'll also include a game board and player aid cards to guide you and make sure everyone is on the same page. \nInside the box you'll get three playsets- Dragonslayers, Poppleton Mall, and Tales From Suburbia. These are some of the most popular and well-loved playsets for classic Fiasco and we think you'll have a great time with them! You can also back at reward tiers that include Expansion Packs- more info on those in the What's Included section below.\nThe prototype deck for the Poppleton Mall playset\nTo create the Setup, you'll shuffle the playset deck and hand out all the cards to the players. The players will then take turns choosing Relationships from their hand and placing them between any two players, establishing connections between characters. \nOnce you have the Relationships chosen, you'll add details to each relationship, including Needs, Locations, and Objects that will all help to drive your story. \nOnce these connections are in place, each player looks at the relationships on either side of them and determines what sort of person their character must be. The last step is putting together a name from the options on the back of each playset card. \nPoppleton Mall all set up and ready to play\nOnce the setup is done, you'll use the Engine Deck to begin playing Scenes in two Acts. Each player will take a turn framing a scene about their character, choosing the setting and determining what their character wants. Other players will join in, offering suggestions and playing their characters. After a minute or two, the other players at the table will decide whether the scene has a Positive or Negative Outcome and give you a card. \nThe Fiasco Engine Deck prototype\nEach player will get two spotlight scenes in the first act and two in the second. In between you do the Tilt, which uses elements on the Outcome cards to determine some crazy new twists in your story. At the end of the game, you'll use the Aftermath cards to determine how your characters' stories end up, before you describe your final epilogue.\n Praise\n\"Damn this Fiasco game is ingenious.\" \u2013 John Rogers, TV and film writer for Leverage and The Librarians\n\"Fiasco is unique among RPGs because it encourages us to actively reach for that moment we all dread in most games, that moment when something truly awful is going to happen, with possibly dire results for our characters.\" \u2013 Wil Wheaton, Actor and Writer\n\"I think, for me, there\u2019s a kind of non-Aristotelian catharsis in that active rehearsal of everything I fear and dread and also pine for; it\u2019s a chance to dance with Poe\u2019s Imp of the Perverse, to give in, to make the dangerous choice\u2014it\u2019s the same thing release I get from the act of writing. But writing is a solitary discipline for the most part and Fiasco\u2026 Fiasco is so gloriously communal.\" \u2013 Kelly Sue DeConnick, Writer of Captain Marvel, Pretty Deadly, and Bitch Planet\n\"The joy of Fiasco comes when the line between game and story blurs and suddenly you\u2019re sitting around a table with the brilliant and wonderful souls you allow into your home and you all try to make the perfect Big Black Box. Impose logic, reason, design, over the chaotic horror of existence because in story-space, in a game-space, because here we CAN. We aren\u2019t just allowed but it\u2019s ENCOURAGED. Draw this map of hell, we tell ourselves. Later on we can find our way out.\" \u2013 Matt Fraction, Writer of Hawkeye and Sex Criminals\n\"Fiasco is roleplaying stripped down to sheer elegance, to virtually zero ramp-up time. The notion of playing ambitious crooks with poor impulse control \u2014 inspired by a host of movies like Fargo or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels \u2014 is both inspiring and immensely replayable. But the real genius of Fiasco... is that now you can enjoy it in almost any setting you like.\" \u2013 the 2011 Diana Jones Award Committee\nAwards and Honors\nFiasco \u2013 Winner, 2011 Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming\nFiasco \u2013 Winner, Best Support, 2009 Indie RPG Awards \nFiasco \u2013 Judge\u2019s Spotlight Award, 2009 ENnie Awards\nFiasco \u2013 Finalist, RPG of the Year, 2010 Indie RPG Awards Boardgamegeek.com \nActual Play Videos\nPodcasts\nCatastrophic - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/catastrophic-a-fiasco-podcast/id1063907406\nFandible - http://www.fandible.com/fiasco-with-great-power/\nGosh Darn Fiasco - https://goshdarnfiasco.simplecast.fm/ \nOne Shot - http://oneshotpodcast.com/tag/fiasco/ \nThe Tilt - http://thetilt.libsyn.com/podcast \n Please Note!

If you prefer to share it with the world, we will format the game for printing and release it so anyone in the world can get it. We hope you choose the latter option because it will invariably be a work of genius, but it's up to you.\nCaveats: We reserve the right to workshop your playset idea, or to reject it entirely.

We\u2019re cautious about the possibility of overcharging some of you, so rather than set flat rates by country, we\u2019ll be adding shipping costs when your package is ready, though BackerKit. This will get you the most accurate rate based on the time we send and your location.\nPrices do not include shipping or customs!\nPlease keep in mind that these are estimates, and with things as they  are in the UK/EU, these numbers could change. We're continuing to work  with our shipping partners and will adjust as needed as we get closer to  charging for shipping.\nAlso, while we say \"the rest of the world\" there are some  restrictions imposed by our partners- shipping to Russia, Brazil, China,  Israel, and Saudi Arabia may incur additional charges, due to increased  difficulties shipping to there. We'll continue to look for affordable  options.\nIf shipping charges turn out to be too expensive for you, you will be  able to request a refund of your pledge amount after the campaign  through BackerKit, either by sending us a Kickstarter message or email  to info@bullypulpitgames.com. \n This Kickstarter campaign is designed to be very lean and straightforward - our goal is to get the word out to as many people as we can, so that more people can find out how much fun the game is. If you back this Kickstarter at any level you\u2019ll get immediate access to the pre-release draft of the rules, and we\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll love them. Please play, and tell your friends! \nThe primary reward for jumping on board now is the chance to help us explore this new direction for the game and to get access to the upcoming playsets before they're publicly released.\n Fiasco was created by Jason Morningstar and Steve Segedy. Together, we run Bully Pulpit Games, and we've been creating and publishing award-winning games such as Star Crossed, Night Witches, The Warren, and the original Fiasco since 2006. This is our sixth Kickstarter campaign.\nBrennen Reece created the layout and visual design for Fiasco.

That said, while we don't expect any problems, shipping from overseas means that there is always a slight risk that a cargo ship will be late and things will be delayed by a month or so. We will keep you informed!\n\nFULFILLMENT\nWe'll be using the same local fulfillment service as we have for all of our previous campaigns to handle U.S. customers. We're also looking to expand our options for overseas fulfillment so that we can offer customs-free shipping to more international backers.

They handcraft twenty-sided dice, build their own campaigns from scratch, even wage legal battles against the United States prison system to assert their right to play.\nFor decades, role-playing games like D&D and Pathfinder have been banned in many United States prisons. Some wardens claim these games are demonic and foster fantasies of escape.\nYet even when books and dice are banned, incarcerated players have found creative workarounds. They band together to battle monsters and overcome obstacles, in virtual worlds as well as real life.\nInmates say these games are rehabilitative and are helping them prepare for life on the outside.  Recent research studies agree: Cooperative gaming builds skills like teamwork, critical thinking, and creativity.  Even more importantly, games like D&D bridge racial divides. In California, the gaming table is one of the only places where prisoners of different races and gang affiliations set aside their differences to do something cooperatively.\nLET'S PLAY is told primarily from the perspective of inmates who have waged legal battles for the right to engage in gaming rehab. Some lost; others--like Kevin--changed the system forever.\nHandmade prison D20\nFor eight years, Kevin battled the California Department of Corrections. It all started when he returned to his cell to discover that his gaming materials had disappeared, including hundreds of pages of handwritten campaigns and elaborate maps that adorned his cell from floor-to-ceiling. \nDuring Kevin's jury trial, the legendary creator of Dungeons & Dragons, Gary Gygax himself, flew out to testify on his behalf.\nExcerpt from Gary Gygax's letter to Kevin after the trial.\nThanks to Kevin's lawsuit, role-playing games are now an official activity at several California prisons. But the battle is not yet over. Though Kevin won the lawsuit and the right to play, his novels, maps, and campaigns were never returned to him. Do they still exist in the basement of some courthouse? We want to find out.\nThrough the story of the lawsuit and the players, like Kevin, who were impacted by it, LET\u2019S PLAY aims to get to the root of the national controversy around role-playing games in America\u2019s prisons and explore philosophical questions around inmates rights, the rehabilitative potential of role-playing games, and the purpose of the criminal justice system.\nFinally, LET'S PLAY is a film about perspective and identity\u2026 about using role-playing to see the world through the perspective of different characters and building empathy.\n                                                                           >>>-<<<\nPERSPECTIVES FROM THE PLAYERS ON WHY ROLE-PLAYING GAMES ARE SO IMPORTANT IN PRISON...\n\"We were hardcore. We\u2019d play from soon as we got back from breakfast to lockup. Saturday or Sunday\u2014all day long.\" - Mark, former inmate, California \n\"We used to run underground games with no books or anything. It was pretty L33t.\" - Melvin, Inmate, Colorado\n\"Rehabilitation in the Department of Corrections is structured in a way that gives no alternatives. Not everybody is built the same. Dungeons & Dragons is my rehabilitation that I can deal with to escape into my own reality to solve my own problems.\" - Aaron, former inmate, Colorado\n\"Our rules are no evil characters, no leaving the team behind. Selfish players will usually die.\" - Carlos, Inmate, California\n\"Prisons are the most segregated places in the world. The D&D table is one of the few places where you can have blacks and whites playing together without fear of reprisal.\" - Jared, Founder, Prisoner Reentry Network\n\"It became more than just Dungeons & Dragons at that point. It started that way, but it became about the first amendment in prisons.\" - Kevin, former inmate, California\n                                                                        >>>-<<<\nA.K.A... HOW MY CAREER DEVELOPING CRIME SHOWS CAME TO INTERSECT WITH MY LOVE OF D&D\nThe creator and brainchild of LET'S PLAY, Elisabeth de Kleer, brings to the table(top) over ten years of production experience in the 'true crime' genre. While directing shows for CBS, Netflix, National Geographic, the BBC, VICE, and the Discovery Channel, Elisabeth has interviewed hundreds of inmates in prisons across the united states.\nAn interview at a maximum security prison in Texas.\nWhen not investigating cold cases or interviewing inmates, Elisabeth can be found at the gaming table or writing articles about the rehabilitative impact of role-playing. Some of you may have already come across one of her articles in VICE:\nDragons in the Department of Corrections\nHow Inmates Play Tabletop RPG's in Prison where Dice are Contraband\nOr the following award-winning documentary she produced for VICE in 2017 about a couple cellmates in Colorado who played together both inside and outside of prison.\nElisabeth has also partnered with a San Francisco-based organization called the Prisoner Reentery Network that is using gaming as tool to help recently-released inmates reintegrate into society. This is where she met Kevin and uncovered the story of his lawsuit against the Department of Corrections. \nA beautiful piece that was filmed by ABC News on this group.\nHowever, while her articles and short film have brought attention to the topic, Elisabeth believes a longer form documentary is the best way to do justice to this controversial topic.\nOver the last couple years, Elisabeth and her team have filmed dozens of interviews with inmates and former inmates who have played role-playing games at prisons across the country. So far this film has been self-funded, which is why we need your support. Here are some of the ways your money will be used to help us finish the film:\n Fees for accessing and copying legal materials related to D&D cases. This will allow us to take a deep dive into some of the most interesting lawsuits, like Kevin's, and attempt to  track down the gaming materials that were confiscated from him.\n Cost of putting together a professional camera crew so we can film gaming groups inside prison. (We've already done the most difficult part, which is getting soft approval to film in the first place. Now we just need funding to make the most of this special opportunity.)\n Funds for hiring an animator to breathe life into hand-drawn inmate fantasy art and to create a visual style for the film. The art will be used to illustrate the story in a way that weaves together magical elements with real life. For example, the warden of the prison might be depicted as a dragon or \u201cboss\u201d and the prison itself, a dragon\u2019s lair. These visual intersections of gameplay and real life show how the game becomes a platform to express and explore their inner struggles and demons.\nCreating a marketing and distribution plan that will promote both the film as well as recreational therapy behind bars.\nWith $60,000, we believe we can create a short film that takes a deep dive into one of the most interesting prisoner rights cases in history, but it will be tight. Each additional dollar we raise makes it possible to include additional content and improve the production quality of the film so that it can compete against the Hollywood heavy-hitters at film festivals around the world. If necessary, film grants (which are very difficult to obtain during pre-production but much easier when the film is nearing completion) are also an option we're considering for down the road if expenses surpass the money we raise through crowdfunding.\nTo bring this project to life, we've put together an awesome team of filmmakers, gamers, and experts.\nAnd we're partnering with the following organizations...\n Hawke Robinson, a Department of Health Registered Recreational Therapist, founder of RPG Therapeutics LLC http://www.rpgtherapy.com/ and RPG Research  https://www.rpgresearch.com/, uses role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, Doctor Who, No Thank You Evil, and others as tools for rehabilitation.  He has been researching the effects of RPGs on participants since around 1985, and developing programs using RPGs in all formats (tabletop, LARP, computer-based, and solo) to achieve educational and therapeutic goals for various populations since 2004. When he's not lecturing and teaching workshops on gaming-as-therapy, you can find Hawke driving around the country in an RPG gaming bus.\nHawke Robinson will serve as an on-camera expert and advisor to the film.\nThe Prisoner Reentry Network, founded by attorney Jared Rudolph, is an Oakland-based nonprofit that supports successful transitions from incarceration to the community. Jared works as a trial lawyer at the San Francisco Office of the Public Defender, and regularly speaks about mass incarceration and its history. Every other weekend, he runs a Dungeons & Dragons game called \u201cSecond Life\u201d to help recently released inmates build community and reintegrate into society.\nJared Rudolph and the Prisoner Reentry Network will be featured on-camera, and Jared Rudolph will serve as a criminal justice advisor to the film.\nA PRN-facilitated \"Second Life\" game in San Francisco.\nKanaka Endeavors is a 2D20 gaming system developed by Danny, an inmate in the California Department of Corrections. Danny has been testing the system with his gaming group behind bars as well as players on the outside and hopes to roll it out when he's released from prison in 2019. \nDanny will be featured on-camera and Kanaka Endeavors will help fulfill some of the crowdfunding rewards.\nDanny and the other D&D players pictured in an article entitled \"Nerds United\" that Danny wrote for the prison newspaper.\nMusic for the Kickstarter video was provided by: https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music \nFINALLY...\nIf you can't help us monetarily, please help us by spreading the word through social media. The more people know about this documentary, the better we can get the word out about the rehabilitative potential of role-playing games in prison.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy far, our biggest hurdle is getting on-going access to film games behind bars.\n\nGetting IN to prison is harder than one might expect. Both state and federal facilities have extensive rules for media visits. Additional staff must be brought in to accompany the production crew. Some states prohibit cameras entirely.\n\nFortunately, Elisabeth de Kleer has extensive experience navigating prison media rules. Over the last 10 years, she has filmed at dozens of maximum security prisons around the country (primarily for Discovery Channel shows) and developed relationships with the administrative staff that approve filming requests.\n\nWhile we've received soft permission to film games we've been following at a couple different prisons, where we ultimately film will depend on how much access we are given. The ideal scenario would be one where we'd film a game over the course of many months, following the trials and tribulations of the inmates both as characters inside the game and in real life. To do that, we need to show the administrators that we have enough of an audience to warrant the additional time and effort on their end to host us, as well as to pay our professional film crew for their time.\n\nPut simply, the more backers and funding we have, the better our chances of getting prolonged access to some of the subjects of our film.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Kleer Creative\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nKleer Creative was founded by Elisabeth de Kleer, an award-winning documentary filmmaker with expertise in interviewing and crafting...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Public Shout Out", "descp": "Welcome to the game!

There are documentaries about motocross riders out there, but they are mostly about men. We are always treated like the sideshow despite the fact that many women can totally hold their own when riding with guys,\u201d says Eline. \nEline was blown away to receive letters and emails of support from women all over the world with similar stories in motocross, following the pilot\u2019s release. We'll be sharing their pictures, videos, and stories throughout the campaign.\nOriginally from Estonia, Eline is a motocross champion and the first woman in Canada to jump her dirt bike onto an airbag. Passionate about motorcycles and filmmaking, Eline is dedicated to telling stories of badass women.\nThe completed pilot episode is 8 minutes long and now we are raising money on Kickstarter to add FIVE more 8-10 minute episodes to complete SEASON 1 of Diaries of Badass Chicks. These episodes will be filmed over two weeks in Lower Mainland, BC Canada in the summer of 2020, involving as many awesome racers and riders as possible. It will be one hell of an epic shoot!\nThe 2020 Calendar will have its own shoot in August/September 2019 with the release of the calendar planned for November 2019, making it a perfect Christmas present!\nHaving the principal photography for the series in 2020 enables us to maximize the budget and really hone in on the production value. Plus, whoever has visited Vancouver, BC in the fall, knows why it is labelled \"Raincouver\", so we want to avoid the challenges of dealing with heavy rain\u2014especially since one of our episodes involve a freestyle motocross airbag! \nWe are so excited to have all of you on board to bring this EPIC, BADASS and GROUNDBREAKING series to life!\n#WEAREBADASSCHICKS\nDIARIES OF BADASS CHICKS is Fan-Supported and Creator-Distributed.

You take on the role of a Wanderer\u2014someone who died, but didn\u2019t end up in Heaven, Hell, or any other traditional afterlife.  Devoid of any memories of your life on earth, you find yourself in an endless desert filled with gateways. Search different planes of existence for clues of your former life - or a semblance of one. Along the way you'll encounter strange inhabitants, alien cultures, and other humans who\u2019ve lost all hope and are bent on destroying you. \nAfterlife is Alice in Wonderland meets What Dreams May Come set in a world inspired by the works of Guillermo del Torro, Hayao Miyazaki, and surrealist artists. \nFind lost memories, come to terms with how you died, and discover who you truly are. \nStepping onto the Tenebris for the first time you realize you're in an outlandish world full of creatures, cities, and customs you don't recognize. A city built atop a giant skeleton, a roadside diner in the middle of the desert, a vast dark pool of inky water. Nothing here is truly human and you're the alien here, far from home with no hopes of return. Salvation lies in the memories you've lost so you travel and search - you are a Wanderer. \nAs a Wanderer your ultimate goal is to regain your memories and find your Requiem\u2014a true end in a place known as the Beyond. In order to do this, a Wanderer must do what their title implies and travel. By travelling into different Limbos\u2014different gateways to the Beyond\u2014you find memory fragments. These glimpses of memories summoned forth by your unconscious give you Resonance. Gain enough Resonance to experience a Break, a full blown memory of your past life, bringing you closer to your Requiem. Each Break creates an opportunity to heal, to strive to remember, to fight for your personality - and your soul. \nLimbos may be cities, forests, or even entire worlds. Each Limbo is populated with its own unique inhabitants who have no idea of any realm beyond their own, much like humans on earth. Wanderers enter (and exit) Limbos through the Tenebris, but consider Limbos their own realms. A Limbo may appear like a person\u2019s version of Heaven, or it may appear totally alien\u2014it all depends on the Limbo.  \nWanderers don't travel the Tenebris alone, it is far too dangerous for that. Instead, you travel with a Crew, a group of lost souls who you met on the boat ride from the world of the living to the world of the dead. A Crew travels together for protection and companionship, personalities may differ or even clash, but these people are the only ones who truly understand what you're going through.\nMechanics in Afterlife: Wandering Souls center on player's action and GMs do not roll any dice. Instead, GMs set scenes, develop plots, and present their players with obstacles. Players decide how they want to overcome these obstacles.\nYou make checks to determine whether your chosen action is a success or not - to make a check you roll a pool of six-sided dice (d6s). A die face of a 4-6 is a success and you must gain enough successes to meet the Challenge set by the game master (GM). \nIf your check is a success - you do what you set out to do. If your check is a failure - things get worse. When things get worse you take damage to one of your Concept pools - Health, Hunger, or Will. Or the GM escalates the scene by pulling in a plot twist, more enemies, or other surprises.\nTo prevent things getting worse you may spend points from your Vitality pools, which is an in game currency representing extra resources a Wanderer has to throw at a problem.\nDuring character creation, the GM takes on the role of the Boatman, guiding your Wanderer on a boat ride from their mortal life to the Tenebris. They will ask you a series of questions based on a variety of dice rolls, and how you answer gives your Wanderer different stats. \nThe memories your Wanderer retains during character creation are vague and highlighted by one brilliant feature your Wanderer refuses to forget. Throughout play you\u2019ll experience more concrete memories during Breaks illuminating the shadows of your lost memories. Things may not always happen as you remember them and part of the journey is the surprise.\nWanderers have many tools, which you may use to make checks easier and perform fantastic feats. \nDuring character creation, the Boatman gives each Wanderer a martial item - a Bow, Sword, or Shield - which reflects how they deal with conflicts. This mystical item, called an Approach, grows as they grow and stays with your Wanderer until they die. Your Approach isn\u2019t limited by earthly limits places on the concepts of a sword, shield, and bow; bows can deflect, shields can slice, and swords can be missiles. \nWanderers use Talents to mold and manipulate the world around them. They can be anything from summoning a mythical beast to reading someone\u2019s mind. Your Talent is a gift bestowed upon your by the Boatman on your ride to the Tenebris. You may learn new Talents as you advance. Depending if your Approach is the Bow, Shield, or Sword your Talent will be different than those with a different Approach, but same Talent. \nAfterlife is a game about a Wanderer's personal journey to recovering their memories. Wanderers recover memories when they see something or someone that reminds them of their past life while exploring a Limbo. This is called a Fragment, and the GM uses it to create a Break - a private scene where your Wanderer re-lives a memory. When the Break concludes the Wanderer has a newfound sense of self, for good or bad, and you get to unlock a Death Mark.\nDeath Marks are tattoo-like markings that  are constantly shifting, flirting on the edge of imperceptibility, whispering forgotten secrets in Wanderer's ears. Each Death Mark is linked to a specific memory and grants Wanderers special abilities to use in game. Death Marks are predetermined in character creation by your Wanderer\u2019s ride with the Boatman. \n\nCheck out the exciting rewards you can get through backing our Kickstarter.

A Wanderer's Guide to Mirages & Limbos is a brand new setting book. It introduces new Limbos and Mirages for GMs to use in their game along with player focused information on how to interact with Limbos and Mirages. We'll also take a deeper look into the different species you can meet within the Tenebris and give each of them an in depth write-up.

Legends are born, friendships are forged, and they begin to experience real-world personal growth.\nFor the past seven years, we have been using tabletop games as therapy to help kids become more confident, creative and socially empowered. We're ready to help thousands of children around the world, but we need your help! \nCritical Core is a tabletop role-playing game designed to help kids on the autism spectrum build social skills and confidence. It's a great way for parents to engage with their children at home, and for professionals and experienced gamers to use as a group social skills tool.\nCritical Core is brought to you by Game to Grow, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and co-developed with autism advocates, parents, therapists, and educators.\nPLAY\n\nSuitable for cognitive age 9+, including teens and adults.\n2 to 4 players recommended, plus one adult that acts as the facilitator. (Game Master)\nPlayers must have basic listening and verbalization skills.\nWhen running games with young players on the spectrum, parent or certified therapist should be present.\nExperienced gamers will be able to integrate Critical Core into their favorite platform: Ruleset is adapted and streamlined from D&D's 5th Edition OpenSRD.\nA great introduction to tabletop role-playing games for everyone.\nThe Critical Core Starter Set has everything you need to play. The game has been tuned to be as easy as possible to get started and stay engaged. \nPLAY\n\n Facilitator's Guide - For parents, therapists, and Game Masters, our best practices on running fun and effective therapeutic gaming groups.\n Player & Game Master Guides - Quick-start rules and playing guides for players and Game Masters.\n Adventure Modules - Tested and tuned to be challenging and fun.\n Dice (4 sets) - One for each player, one for the Game Master. Enough to run a 3 player game out-of-the-box.\n Character Sheets - 4 popular hero archetypes, each with their own unique abilities.\n Game Cards - Not required for play, but helpful aids for both players and Game Masters - Visualization, quick-reference rules, and spell cards.\n Game Tokens - Visualization aids for working with the included map.\n Reusable map - whiteboard marker friendly. \nPlease note: Artwork shown is work-in-progress and may be subject to change!\nWe believe that Stretch Goals should improve and enhance the usefulness of Critical Core, so we're planning a steady stream of new adventures, characters, cards and tokens that you can use at home or in therapeutic settings. Plus a few extra surprises that will unlock at higher levels!\nCritical Core is fit-for-purpose, designed to help neurodiverse players get started and stay engaged. At the same time, facilitators are provided with the right tools to make the experience effective without it 'feeling like therapy'.\nEach encounter the players face is targeted to help build strength in areas that are related to challenges associated with autism spectrum disorder.\nCritical Core is scaffolded around the DIR/Floortime model, and game encounters map to the FEDC framework. (Function Emotional Developmental Capacities)\nBut all of this is under the hood. At its heart, Critical Core is simply FUN.\nPLAY\n\nWhen kids engage in a world of fantasy play they are free to explore new ideas and relationships in a safe and fun sandbox. Skills learned while playing Critical Core can last a lifetime.\n Although designed for kids on the autism spectrum, Critical Core is just as beneficial (and fun) for all kids. It's an easy stepping stone into the fantastic world of tabletop role-playing games.\nCritical Core is built on established developmental frameworks and distills seven years of practical gaming therapy experience into an easy-to-use format. It is an amazing tool that can be used at home, at school, in a therapist\u2019s office, or out in the community. And above all, it's great fun.\nPLAY\n\n\nGame to Grow - Adam Davis (MA Ed) and Adam Johns (LMFT)\nCritical Core is brought to you by Game to Grow, a 501(c)(3) organization that runs tabletop RPG therapy gaming groups every week. Founders Adam Johns and Adam Davis are distilling 7 years of experience and best practices into the Critical Core project so that the benefits of intentional gaming can be spread to an even wider audience.\n\nVirginia Spielmann (MSOT) - Executive Director of STAR Institute for Sensory Processing Disorder in Denver, Colorado.\nVirginia is a British trained Occupational Therapist with more than 20 years experience working in pediatrics. Virginia co-leads the development of the Critical Core Project, defining the system within the established DIR Floortime\u2122 framework of developmental intervention.\nmcgarrybowen Greater China - creative agency\nThe Critical Core project was initiated and co-created by creative agency mcgarrybowen Greater China as part of an ongoing program to provide creative solutions for social good.\nICDL - The Interdisciplinary Council on Development and Learning\nA not-for-profit organization dedicated to promoting each person's development to their fullest potential. ICDL was formed over 20 years ago to be the official home of DIR\u00ae and DIRFloortime, recognized as the next generation of evidence-based intervention for autism and other developmental challenges.\n \n \nYour passion and support can make Critical Core a reality. Please, pledge now and then get a friend to do the same. Together we can bring the incredible benefits of intentional gaming to those who need it most.\n  We're committed to getting this right. The majority of our time will be spent improving and refining the Critical Core Starter Set with the feedback from beta testers and testing groups. We also have some final artwork and design work to take care of, and of course there is the physical production. We'll be keeping you informed throughout the process, and probably asking for some help and advice along the way! \nGame to Grow is a not-for profit 501(c) company, and our donations are allocated to helping run game groups for kids across the Seattle region. Kickstarter is important for two reasons:\n First, you are an amazing community, and if anyone can help spread the word about the incredible benefits of role-playing games, it's you!\n  Second, there are costs involved in developing and manufacturing Critical Core, so Kickstarter helps us to produce this amazing project!\nPerhaps you already have a favorite role-playing game and are wondering how Critical Core can fit into your gaming life. Like many of you, we are avid gamers and have many games we\u2019ve loved for years. \nCritical Core can improve the games you\u2019re already playing.\nIf you\u2019re already playing an established RPG with your kids, your students, or your community, Critical Core can still help you improve your game and boost your outcomes. \nCritical Core contains a rule system, designed to be easily accessible to a neuro-diverse population as well as new facilitators, but that\u2019s not all! If you are already established using a game that you enjoy and find effective, you\u2019ll be able to use the other components of Critical Core that are designed to support a game facilitator in helping their players learn and grow.\nCritical Core contains a unique module design where in-game scenarios are targeted to real-world development outcomes. This can be translated to most established role-playing games. Additionally, the Critical Core kit includes a facilitator\u2019s guide which contains the learnings of the past seven years of facilitating role-playing games for social growth.\n  Do I need prior experience with role-playing games to run Critical Core?\n                          No. Critical Core is a 'rules-light' tabletop RPG, and the instructions will be designed to help brand new Game Masters quickly learn how to facilitate games that are enriching and fun. We are also planning to release video guides and tutorials to help you out! \nI'm already playing tabletop RPGs with my kids!\nAwesome! You already know the amazing benefits we're talking about. You also know from experience, that tabletop RPGs can be easy to pick up and play, but learning how to be a great Game Master can be challenging, especially for new players.\nWhy not use an established role-playing game platform?\nCritical Core's rule set is adapted from D&D's 5th Edition Open SRD. We have taken out some of the complexity for new players and Game Masters. Think of Critical Core as an entry-level platform: easier for parents, schools, and clinics to pick up and play.\nAre you trying to replace my favorite game?\nNo way! We see Critical Core as a stepping stone to the wide world of RPG gaming. Actually, we hope that as kids grow familiar and comfortable with the system, they can move on to your favorite platform. If you're already using some of the great games out there, then more power to you!\nSo how is Critical Core different?\nWe have applied our experience and best practices to help children (and caregivers) have the most effective and fun experience possible.\nMeticulously designed adventure content to help empower kids with social and problem-solving challenges.\nGame encounters, guidebooks, mechanics heavily influenced by established developmental frameworks (DIR/Floortime).\nRules have been adapted to be easier for new players and Game Masters to pick up.\nAdventures divided into 'one-shot' chapters that can be completed in 90 minutes.\nGoldilocks Content'  -  not too complex/scary and not too easy/cartoony. Just right.\nI've been GM'ing for years, what's in this for me?\nFor starters, you'll be able to pick up the Critical Core system in minutes. We have had inquiries from organizations from across the globe who want to start using Critical Core. You could be a great mentor or GM partner for Critical Core games. Please contact us for more info on how you can help!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCritical Core is based on our learnings in using tabletop RPGs over the years as a therapy, and we're confident that we have a solid system in place.

Over the last few years, I invited 30 award-winning authors to write in response to my art.THEN AGAIN: Vintage Photography Reimagined by One Artist and Thirty Writers is the singular anthology that assembles these richly imagined stories and poems with the captivating images that inspired them.\nImagining possibilities and forging new worlds, the stories and poems amplify the art. The artworks intensify the writings. Throughout the collection images evolve, characters re-appear, plots reveal, symbols come alive. We dream together. \nOnce I thought I might spend eternity with you, before I knew what it was or what it felt like. Instead there is this skulking fellow, who disappears whenever I turn around. (from Paul Park's \"Memory Tower\" in THEN AGAIN)\nTHEN AGAIN is a collector's edition of limited quantity and abundant quality. The professionally designed book will feature over 30 full-color images, each paired with its corresponding story or poem, all printed on heavyweight premium paper stock bound in sturdy softcover.  \nThe Booklet will be a shorter, seven or eight chapter version of THEN AGAIN.\nLike all Kickstarter campaigns, this one is all or nothing. To fund this project, we need to reach our goal of $30,000 by April 30. If we do not, no one's credit card is charged and the project is unfunded.\nThis campaign is your opportunity to get a copy of the book and to join in the fantastic community that's bringing this project to life!\nBraiding them into her hair would never work, even ignoring the smooth skin where her human ears no longer were. No, her rabbit ears had their own ideas. (from Andrea Martinez Corbin's \"A Lullaby from Long Ago\" in THEN AGAIN)\nAbout the Art\nYou can find vintage photographs languishing in attics, basements \u2013 perhaps even your own - and in antiques stores. I rescue them, but I do not preserve them like a conservator. Instead, I collaborate with each image to create something new with the old. \nOver the last couple decades, I\u2019ve developed a technique for painting on vintage photographs. These rediscovered portraits and snapshots are the basis of my art: both canvas and inspiration for my painting. By the time I find them, the original chains of personal connection have broken. Subjects are freed to become characters cast and costumed, players in another story that forms fresh bonds with new audiences.  \nPearl was the first Cephalopod Ambassador to the Dry Lands. They did not realize that no one would listen to her. Eight is a very great age for a squid, though, as it happens, not for a human. Plus, she\u2019s a girl, and who knew that would make a difference? (from Kij Johnson's \"Tool-Using Mimics\" in THEN AGAIN)\nContributing Writers\nTHEN AGAIN presents original stories and poems, each written in response to my artwork, by some of the freshest and most accomplished voices in literary and speculative fiction and poetry, including recipient of a 2018 Arab American Book Award, poet Safia Elhillo, author and essayist Akiko Busch, young speculative fiction writer Erin Roberts, best-selling author and multiple award winner Elizabeth Hand, Guggenheim and NEA fellow Mary Ruefle, another NEA fellow and short story writer Renee Simms, World Fantasy Awardee Sofia Samatar, and recipient of the World Fantasy Award - Life Achievement John Crowley... \nAnd many more top-notch authors:\nUnoma Azuah,  Tina Connolly,  Andrea Martinez Corbin, Paul Di Filippo,  Jeffrey Ford,  Shawn Frazier,  Kij Johnson,  Kirsten Imani Kasai,  Karin Lowachee,  Simone Muench,  Paul Park,  Christine Poreba,  Jennifer Rapaport,  Gregory Scheckler,  Hollis Seamon,  John Seven,  Jim Shepard,  Karen Shepard,  Hasanthika Sirisena,  Sara St. Antoine,  Marjorie Thomsen,  Sarena Ulibarri, and Izzy Wasserstein.\nPlus reprints of poems by Pulitzer Prize winner Jorie Graham and 2018 Wallace Stevens Awardee Sonia Sanchez, to which I made a artworks in response (please note, the Sonia Sanchez poem will appear only on the printed full version of THEN AGAIN, available at the $90 reward level and above).  And an introduction by curator Judie Gilmore.  \nYou'll find more information about each author below. \nCollision of Tomorrows (after Self-Portrait as Apollo and Daphne, by Jorie Graham)\nLimited Edition\nThe funding goal of $30,000 affords an edition of 500 beautifully designed books. I\u2019ll be delighted to make more if there's demand, but there are no plans for broad distribution beyond this Kickstarter campaign. I plan to produce only a couple hundred more than the quantity of book rewards chosen here. \nTHIS is the place to get your book and be part of this effort!\na quick breakdown of where your dollars will go\nHow the Project Came To Be\nFive years ago, curator Judie Gilmore invited me to participate in an exhibit for which authors wrote in response to the art. Inspired by one of my artworks, Hollis Seamon wrote a stunning short story, so thoughtful and potent on its own. Her story further re-created the already transformed photograph. \nTogether the art and writing generated a third radiant thing.\nI was hooked, and wanted more. So, I studied hundreds of poems and stories, and invited authors whose style could enhance the growing collection of art and writing. Each author chose which artwork to write on, and I offered some of them character prompts from other stories in the anthology. \nThe culmination is a treasury of distinct, but intertwined tales and pictures to spark your imagination and wonder.   \nThe book itself is a collaborative work of art.\nAt this moment, 90% of the writers have finished their stories and poems, receiving an honorarium for their work. All the art is ready, and the designer is set to go. We\u2019re connecting art, writing, and now you. \nWe are getting this done together!  \n\u201cI want to be a Flowerhead!\u201d cried Erik Von. \u201cI want to be a Flowerhead when I grow up!\u201d But Father wouldn\u2019t have it, and he yanked Erik Von away... (from John Seven's \"Flowerheads\" in THEN AGAIN)\nHow You Can Join In\nBecome a Backer: Please consider backing this project at a level you\u2019re comfortable with.

Our puzzle novel The Maze of Games has been no exception. Years after we ran two fantastic Maze campaigns on Kickstarter, we're still finding new pathways and puzzles within the Gatekeeper's domain. We wanted to take everything we have for The Maze of Games and put it into one massive omnibus package, supplementing it with fun new material. But to do that we had to send author Mike Selinker and developer Gaby Weidling into their own maze. As you may have guessed from the video above, things went a bit awry. The two are now stuck in the maze.\nOn the upside, before the Gatekeeper trapped Mike and Gaby, they were able to gather quite a bit of stuff. For the first time, you can get everything for The Maze of Games in one place, including a bunch of new items for fans who thought they had it all. Fresh off the book being solved for the first time, we're Kickstarting a new answer guide handwritten by characters Colleen and Samuel Quaice entitled The Keymaster's Tome. There's The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour audio puzzle suite and a new audiobook for The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze. If we're very clever and very lucky, we can help Mike and Gaby escape the room and add a few more goodies to our cache. \nAll the digital and physical rewards. Well, most of them, anyway.\nAlong with the puzzle creations we've lined up for you, we have a unique adventure. The Maze of Games Escape Room by Epic Team Adventures opens its doors today, March 14th. You can book your experience today at epicteamadventures.com! Designed by Gaby, Mike, and ETA's Jesse McGatha and Richard Thames Rowan, this intense experience is the first of several mind-bending puzzle rooms set in the Gatekeeper's world. When you book, you can use the escape room discount code we've added to every backer level so you can experience what Mike and Gaby are going through. Hopefully you'll have an easier time getting through the maze than they are.\nBelow you'll find all the details on The Maze of Games Omnibus and Escape Room Experience, including descriptions of all the items, backer levels, stretch goals, and the Maze of Games Escape Room. And what would a Maze of Games Kickstarter be without puzzles? Make sure to come back as we update. Mike and Gaby will send us messages from inside the room, and we'll need your help to decipher them. See below for details, and keep an eye on @LoneSharkGames on Twitter for all the puzzling info. Mike and Gaby have assured us there are secret badges along the way for everyone who can help them escape the maze. \nThe Maze of Games hardback, The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze, and the Maze Map.\nThe Maze of Games is a puzzle novel Mike had trapped in his head for 18 years prior to 2013, when we took the unique book to Kickstarter. It's the story of two British children from 1897, Colleen and Samuel Quaice, who get trapped in a series of increasingly deadly mazes by a skeletal guardian called the Gatekeeper. What makes the book unique\u2014other than its strange story and dynamic art by Magic: The Gathering artist Pete Venters\u2014is that the pages are in the wrong order. You must solve the puzzles and restore the narrative in order to help the children escape the maze. A 40-page section called the Conundrucopia features all of the best modern-day puzzlemakers writing puzzles in the style of the 1890s. It's cool. \nThe Two of Diamonds spread in The Maze of Games.\nIf you pledge to this Kickstarter campaign, you can get access to:\nThe hardback of The Maze of Games, its PDF, and its audiobook narrated by Wil Wheaton.\nThe softcover of The Theseus Guide to Guide to the Final Maze and its PDF.\nThe recently updated second edition of the Maze Map poster and PDF, a unique 20\"x30\" story maze by Mike, Eric Harshbarger, and Corey Macourek.\nAudio albums of The Maze of Games Soundtrack by composer Austin Wintory and the Songs in the Key of Maze EP by Marian Call, Kirby Krackle, and Paul & Storm.\nA discount code for the solvable ebook for iPhone and iPad by Puzzazz. \nThe covers for the Maze of Games Audiobook, Songs in the Key of Maze, and the Maze of Games Soundtrack. Art by Pete Venters, graphic design by Elisa Teague.\nEach backer who receives physical goods will pay the actual cost of shipping their rewards. Final shipping rates and costs will be loaded into our PledgeManager, and you will pay for your shipping via the PledgeManager as well.  We'll charge backers as close to our actual shipping costs for their shipping address as we can for each order. Lone Shark is not making any profit on shipping and handling. FYI: The Maze of Games hardback is a heavy book. See the FAQ for our current shipping estimates.\nPlus there's a lot of brand new stuff you've never seen. Including this amazing project. \nPLAY\n\nFor years, we've imagined a live experience where you get thrown into the Gatekeeper's maze and have to solve your way out. We knew of only one team who could bring this vision to life: downtown Seattle's Epic Team Adventures. Our friends at ETA have made some of our favorite rooms: the film noir-themed The Sparrow Files, the Poe-inspired The Raven and the Red Death, and many more. ETA's team includes some of the Maze's biggest fans, and so we collaborated with them to make The Maze of Games Escape Rooms.\nSome of the sights in the Maze of Games escape room. This image is spoiler-free and not used in any puzzles in this campaign.\nFar from being satisfied with making  one Maze of Games escape room, ETA concocted an adventurous plan to make four rooms in the same space, all themed around authors trapped in the maze. Gaby and Mike worked with ETA designers Rich Rowan and Jesse McGatha to craft these escape rooms, and we got our Gatekeeper Wil Wheaton to narrate the whole thing. It's a tremendously cool experience that you can see in the video above.\nWe hope that you can all make it to Seattle and match wits with the Gatekeeper. To encourage you to visit us, all reward levels of this Kickstarter campaign include a discount code good for $35 off the cost of a full room booking of The Maze of Games Escape Room at Epic Team Adventures. If you pledge, click this link to get access to the code, allowing you to book your room experience on the ETA site today. The code can be used any time in the next year. Remember: Pledge, get the code, book the room.\nFor those who just want to buy it all now, look at the level called Everything Maze Plus A Full Room, which lets you pledge for an entire room plus all the physical and digital rewards. We can't send out individual codes until after the campaign closes, so if you're in a hurry to book, get your $35 code here today and then pay the rest on the ETA site.\nThe Keymaster's Tome mockup cover (not final art). Designed by Skylar Woodies with handwriting by Gaby and Mike.\nThe Keymaster\u2019s Tome is a new physical book made for this Kickstarter, available in both printed and PDF form. People have been asking us since the dawn of this project when we were going to have a Keymaster to go with our Gatekeeper. The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze was the closest we could get to an answer booklet without divulging the Maze's secrets to everyone, and it was fun to add more puzzles too. But just this past month, a group of puzzle solvers finished the final puzzle in The Maze of Games. With that done, we felt that the time was right for an answer book, so Mike and Gaby hand-crafted The Keymaster's Tome, a version of The Maze of Games puzzles (not the story) with answers, conversations, and tidbits hand-written in the margins by the Quaice siblings as they make their way through the maze. Here's as much of a look as we can show you. \nPage spread from The Keymaster's Tome. Spoiler hands not included.\nThe book is available as a PDF in the Just The New Digitals level, as well as a softcover in the Just The New Book & The New Digitals level. \nStretch Goals\nWhen we started the campaign, The Keymaster's Tome was 60 pages detailing answers for the main puzzle section of The Maze of Games. Now that the campaign has exceeded our funding goal, we're adding hand-written and annotated answers to more puzzles.\nUNLOCKED: $13,500 - We added 24 pages of Conundrucopia answers in our hand-written, story-based style. That raised the Tome from 60 pages to 84 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $15,000 -  We added 8 pages of extras: the endpapers, the library card, the credits, and so on. Everyone who pledges to this campaign will have their name in The Keymaster\u2019s Tome. This got the Tome from 84 pages to 92 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $17,500 - We added 8 pages of The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze answers. This got the Tome from 92 pages to 100 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $20,000 - We added 8 pages of soundtrack and Maze Map answers. This got the Tome from 100 to 108 pages.\nUNLOCKED: $25,000 - We added an audio answer key to The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour, recorded by Mike and Gaby! \nUNLOCKED: $30,000 - We've begun the creation of a new Maze of Games website with The Keymaster's Tome content for backers to access!\nUNLOCKED: $35,000 - We're including cool Maze of Games wallpaper (in black and white and color) in every digital bundle!\nUPCOMING GOAL: $40,000 - We'll include the Maze of Games escape room 2-page spread from Puzzlecraft in every digital bundle and add the handwritten answers to The Keymaster's Tome!\nCovers for The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze audiobook and The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour. Art and graphics by Pete Venters and Elisa Teague.\nWe\u2019re introducing two new audio products as part of this campaign. First,The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze now has its own audiobook, which adds a new chapter to the existing one for The Maze of Games. Both star Wil Wheaton doing all the voices.\nThe second audio project is The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour (originally named The Audiophonic Conundrucopia), a radio show hosted by Wil alongside us and our puzzlemaker and musician friends Kid Beyond, Molly Lewis, Austin Wintory, Francis Heaney, Eric Chaikin, Greg Pliska, and Wil Zambole. It's easy to turn it on. You must solve the puzzles to turn it off.  \nMike and Molly Lewis record something old-timey for the Variety Hour. Photo by Gaby.\nBoth of these new audio experiences supplement The Maze of Games audiobook, created by Skyboat Media. If you've only got the physical books, open up your ears for a whole new way to play. \nThe Gatekeeper's Edition. Created by Elisa Teague and Regent Publishing, ambigram by Scott Kim.\nOK, we swear this story is true. When we first made The Maze of Games, we made 250 copies of a black and silver leatherette-bound in-world book called The Gatekeeper's Edition. It has deckled pages, a library card, a ribbon, and other boss features. We fulfilled all of those and agreed never to make that edition again. Done and done.\nBut ... our guy Shane was cleaning up the warehouse in preparation for a move last month and literally tripped over a box of Gatekeeper's Editions. We assume we kept them in case some didn't reach their destinations, and everyone forgot about them. Now that we found this treasure trove, we couldn't just keep it locked up. So we're making a mere ten absolutely, positively, very last ever copies of The Maze of Games Gatekeeper's Edition available at the Keymaster's Trove level, along with a signed copy of the Keymaster's Tome. If you're interested in owning a piece of history, take a look at that level. \nMike Selinker is the president of the Seattle design studio Lone Shark Games. He's the co-designer of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Lords of Vegas, Unspeakable Words, Apocrypha, The Ninth World, Thornwatch, and many other games, as well as the author of other books like Puzzlecraft, The Kobold Guide to Board Game Design, and Game Theory in the Age of Chaos. While at Wizards, he helped design and develop games like Betrayal at House on the Hill, Risk Godstorm, and Axis & Allies, and was a creative director on 3rd edition Dungeons & Dragons. He\u2019s also the executive director of the political advocacy group Basket of Adorables. He can be found at @mikeselinker. \nPete Venters is the book's illustrator, and one of the most popular game artists around. He is best known for his nearly 300 pieces of trading card art for Magic: The Gathering, but has also worked in concept art, comic books, and book design. He is the illustrator for the Gothic Charm School trade paperback, written by his wife, Jillian Venters. He and Mike have collaborated on projects for Disney and Wizards of the Coast.\nElisa Teague is the book's graphic designer. She is a game and puzzle designer, her latest titles including Geek Out!, Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow's Walk, Lions and Tigers and Bears - Oh My, various Dungeons & Dragons and other RPG modules, and the upcoming Kingdom Hearts Talisman. She has also been an art director, developer, and production manager on over 100 titles in the industry, including Lone Shark Games' monster hit (pun intended) Apocrypha Adventure Card Game.\nGaby Weidling is the book's developer. She's a game, puzzle, and event designer whose  handiwork can be found in games like the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow\u2019s Walk, Apocrypha, and more. Some of her favorite puzzle projects include developing The Maze of Games and Puzzlecraft, designing a series of escape rooms set in the world of Magic: the Gathering\u2019s Innistrad, and teaching puzzle design at DigiPen. She spends her spare time trying new things, cuddling her cats, and just generally being a sunshine cannon. Someday she\u2019ll quit the game industry to become a detective or reboot Matlock. Maybe both. She can be found at @ermahgerdgerby.\nTanis O'Connor is the book's editor. Her past work includes design, development, and editing on Dungeons & Dragons with Wizards of the Coast, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game at Paizo Publishing, many other game and puzzle events, and 5 (!) MIT Mystery Hunts. Do not try this at home. \nOh, right, we nearly forgot. Gaby and Mike are trapped in the Maze of Games escape room for the entire length of this campaign. We'd go and let them out, but it's more fun to let you figure out how to free them. We're going to give you daily puzzles of several types, all of which combine to figure out how to get them out. It'll all end in a final campaign-end livestream, but before we get there, you better get cracking on these puzzles. \nHere's what you got:\nIn the campaign video above and six later update videos are seven rebus puzzles. Those are visual addition puzzles like the kind you see on the show Concentration. Each leads to an answer, which will get you one of seven badges. The first one contains this image. Another hidden puzzle across all the videos will get you the eighth badge.\nIf you follow our Twitter account @lonesharkgames, you'll see a set of 20 daily Tom Swifties. Those are puzzles where Tom says a sentence in a particularly punny manner such as \"'I'd like to stop by the mausoleum,' Tom said cryptically.\" In our Gatekeeper Swifties, the answers are all names of authors the Gatekeeper has trapped in the Maze. Answering all of them will lead to a final instruction which gives you a ninth badge. The first ten such puzzles are gathered here.\nAt five geek-themed events\u2014the MIT Mystery Hunt, the JoCo Cruise, Emerald City Comic Con, the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and this week's PAX East\u2014we'll be there giving out postcards. All five puzzles' answers combine together in a specific way to get you a tenth badge. \nThe first event postcard. We'll post the rest after each event ends.\nFinally, getting Mike and Gaby out of the Maze of Games escape room will get you the eleventh badge. That's only available when the campaign comes to an end.\nWhen you have an answer for any of these puzzles, submit it on our answer site. You'll get a response from us that will let you continue your quest and maybe give you a badge. When you get one, use it as your Kickstarter, Facebook, or Twitter icon. That'll show off how smart a puzzler you are, and maybe even that you care if Mike and Gaby get out alive. Regardless, we'll see you in the Maze. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe don't have a lot of risks on this campaign. The Maze of Games Escape Room is ready for opening, the audiobooks are recorded and formatted for download, and the third-printing books are getting ready for shipment. All the digital rewards and most of the physical rewards are ready to go.\n\nThe only physical object that isn't finished is The Keymaster's Tome, because we hope the campaign lets us make a larger version of it. When the campaign is over, we'll finish up work on that and send it to press in the United States. When all that's ready, we'll get it all to our fulfiller for shipping in the US. It may take longer to get our non-US orders done, but we'll get them fulfilled as quickly as we can.\n\nThis is the first of TWO puzzle book campaigns we'll be doing fairly close to back-to-back.

Please give us a shout through the 'Ask a Question\u2019 button on our Kickstarter campaign FAQ page.\nWe can\u2019t wait to bring the entire 10-episode The Legend of Vox Machina animated series to life!\n<3\nCritical Role\nCritical Role is a weekly livestreamed tabletop roleplaying game featuring a group of prominent voice actors, who happen to be best friends. Each week, veteran Game Master Matthew Mercer leads the cast through epic adventures set in the world of Exandria! Trust us \u2014 it\u2019s rad.  \nOur original storyline centered on a group of heroes known as Vox Machina \u2014 Pike Trickfoot (gnome cleric, Ashley Johnson), Keyleth (half-elf druid, Marisha Ray), Percival \u201cPercy\u201d Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III (human gunslinger, Taliesin Jaffe), Grog Strongjaw (goliath barbarian, Travis Willingham), Scanlan Shorthalt (gnome bard, Sam Riegel), Vex\u2019ahlia (half-elf ranger, Laura Bailey), and Vax\u2019ildan (half-elf rogue, Liam O\u2019Brien) \u2014 as they battled the forces of evil and learned to work as a team. Their epic tale concluded in November, 2017 after 115 episodes and 373 hours of gameplay.\nThe show is still going strong, now over 50 episodes in to our second season, which tracks the misfits known as the Mighty Nein. Critical Role reaches a wide, international audience called Critters, who are just about the greatest fans in history. \n Titmouse is an Emmy award-winning animation production company behind the hits Big Mouth, The Venture Bros., Metalocalypse, Niko and the Sword of Light and Star Wars: Galaxy of Adventures. One of the largest 2D animation studios in America with studios in Los Angeles, New York and Vancouver, B.C., it employs more than 400 of the most talented people in the industry (all guaranteed to be 100% human). Its fresh styles can be seen on major networks such as Disney, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network and streaming services like Amazon and Netflix.  \nVox Machina is back, baby \u2014 but this time they\u2019re cartoons! Here\u2019s the amazing creative team that\u2019s gonna take our tale from imagination to animation...  \nArt by Critter Hunter Bonyun (@deerlordhunter)\nWRITING TEAM\nA brand new story was crafted by the cast of Critical Role and scripted by our good friend and talented TV writer, Jennifer Muro (Star Wars: Forces of Destiny, Spider-Man, Justice League: Action). Muro is one of the most sought-after writers in the industry and she\u2019s written an in-canon adventure that takes place before the events of the streaming show. \nANIMATION TEAM\nTo bring the magic and mayhem of Exandria to life, we\u2019re sinking the vast majority of our resources into the animation budget. As Titmouse has proven again and again, they pride themselves on top notch quality and attention to detail, ensuring this story will be told with visceral, action-packed visuals. It\u2019ll be bloody gorgeous.\nVOICEOVER\nThe voice acting for The Legend of Vox Machina will (of course) be provided by the cast of Critical Role, who bring decades of experience to the table. You\u2019ve no doubt heard their voices in some of your favorite cartoons \u2014 Teen Titans Go!, Ben 10, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball Z, Sofia the First, Avengers Assemble, DuckTales, Transformers, and many, many more. And to round out the main cast, we\u2019ll bring in some extra special celebrity cameos, as well as voice over industry legends. \nOTHER DETAILS\nIn The Legend of Vox Machina, our adventuring group is right around Level 7 \u2014 fledgling adventurers, but still powerful enough to fire off exciting spells and brutal attacks.\nSo, what will this campaign allow us to create? A bitchin\u2019 high-quality, fantasy cartoon set in a world created by one of the most accomplished storytellers, Matthew Mercer. With heart-stopping action and side-splitting comedy, it will have something for everyone. \nIf we smash through our crowdfunding goal, The Legend of Vox Machina will be released in Fall 2020. But we can\u2019t do it without your help funding this campaign \u2014 which ends on Thursday, April 18th at 11:59pm Pacific.\nUPDATE (MARCH 7TH):\nDue to the overwhelming love and support of our amazing backers, we're creating an animated series!\nAs a quick refresher: the first few episodes of our animation will focus on a brand new Vox Machina adventure, which takes place before our show began streaming live on Twitch. But because of your incredible generosity, we\u2019re following your lead and going for it, diving right into a series that begins the retelling of the saga of Vox Machina. We can\u2019t wait to show you how the story shapes up!\nWe're excited to share new episode offerings as part of our new stretch goals for our campaign: The Briarwoods are coming to animated life in The Legend of Vox Machina!\nThe Briarwoods arc is one of the most exciting and popular storylines of the Vox Machina streaming campaign. When we were brainstorming about what might come next, the clear winner was introducing the Briarwoods into The Legend of Vox Machina.\nThe Briarwoods arc story so far\u2026 Vox Machina arrive in Percy's hometown, Whitestone, to avenge the murder of his family and the corruption of his city at the hands of the evil Briarwoods. Danger and betrayal lurk around every corner, and it will take all of Vox Machina's abilities to combat this deadly threat. The Briarwoods arc began in episode 24 of our first streamed campaign, and remains one of our absolute favorites.\nFor the last batch of stretch goals that we crush, we\u2019ll be able to create two additional 22-minute Briarwoods arc episodes.\nSo, to recap, here\u2019s what you can expect episode-wise from The Legend of Vox Machina animated SERIES:\n Episodes 1 & 2: A brand new story centered around Vox Machina at level 7 (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 3, 4, 5, 6: Briarwoods arc! (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 7 & 8: Continuation of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 9 & 10: Continuation and conclusion of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\nBe sure to check out our backer updates tab at the top of this page for the full download.\nUPDATE (APRIL 5TH):\nWe have unlocked our final stretch goal and now, we\u2019ll make the entire 10-episode The Legends of Vox Machina series for you AND a one-shot GMed by our very own Ashley Johnson! \nAt the moment, we\u2019re not planning on adding additional stretch goals -- every dollar that we raise after this point will be allocated directly into making an even more kick ass animation. This means more animators, more music, and more awesomeness. Of course, if that changes, we\u2019ll be sure to let everyone know as soon as possible.\nIn our wildest dreams, we never thought that we\u2019d be able to bring an entire Vox Machina SERIES to life. But, time and time again, you all continue to challenge our expectations in the best way. We cannot thank you enough and we cannot wait to roll up our sleeves and get started. \nTravis & Sam went on dozens of Hollywood pitch meetings, and found some interest \u2014 but we ultimately decided to create our first animated special on our own. By doing so, we can continue to stay true to our beloved characters and tell the stories you want to see. With an ever-burning desire to bring a Vox Machina animation to the masses, we decided to give the power back to our amazing community, roll up our sleeves, and make this special with YOU instead. \nEvery dollar you contribute allows us to embark on this animated adventure together, with the ultimate goal of producing a full-blown animated series. We\u2019ll keep you posted on how the project is going \u2014 with behind-the-scenes looks at the animation process, recording sessions, reward product creation, and everything in-between. As a backer, you are part of our team and we guarantee you\u2019ll feel empowered and informed every step of the way.   \nCONTRIBUTE if you have the means to do so! Backers will get updates along the way, receive awesome rewards, and be the first to know when the show is ready for prime time.\nSHARE with your friends and family. Even if your loved ones don\u2019t know Critical Role yet, a super badass cartoon is a perfect way to introduce them to it. Help us spread the good word! \nAlong with making the 22-minute animated series of our dreams, the money raised through this campaign will allow us to provide cool rewards and administer our crowdfunding project. \nIt\u2019s incredibly important that we remain transparent, so we created this handy chart to show you exactly where your hard-earned money will go. \nThe overwhelming majority of our funds raised will support the production of our animated special \u2014 from our incredible animation team to voiceover studio time, soundtrack composition, music, effects, sound design, etc.\nOf course, we have accounted for some boring (but important!) stuff too \u2014 like credit card processing fees, accounting, and additional staff to keep this project running at full steam. \nWe wanted to give you the coolest and most high-quality rewards, all of which are exclusive to this crowdfunding campaign, which means you won\u2019t be able to find this swag anywhere else! \n We\u2019re thrilled to offer you a selection of campaign-exclusive perks as a thank you for supporting The Legend of Vox Machina. We\u2019ve set it up this way to guarantee that most of your funds go towards creating the best damn cartoon possible. After countless creative meetings, we created this set of sweet products that we would be proud to own ourselves.    \nEach time we hit a new goal together, we'll share our new crowdfunding goal with you! This means more swag and some bad ass Vox Machina one-shots that will unlock for everyone (backers or not!).   \nFirst, check out our Kickstarter FAQ on our campaign page. We will update this page as often as possible to ensure that the answers that you seek are readily available. \nIf your question isn\u2019t covered in the FAQ, feel free to drop us a note by hitting the \u2018Ask a question\u2019 button on the FAQ page. \nSpecial thanks to Critter Jessica Mahon (@my2k) for creating the portrait art for our campaign headings.

It was where some of the greatest writers of the 20th Century got their start and some of the most iconic characters made their debut, from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan and John Carter to Maxwell Grant's The Shadow to Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian. \nWithout the pulps, comic books may never have introduced the super-hero...and then where would we be today?\nThe pulp magazine era was bristling with brawny men and statuesque women globetrotting, and getting into and out of danger. Their exploits quickened the pulses of their readers, young and old alike. They gave rise to some of the most enduring heroes known the world 'round.\nTo honor and celebrate a bygone era, I have partnered with most of my Crazy 8 Press team. If you've loved Aaron Rosenberg's work on ReDeus or From this is Hell or Paul Kupperberg's super-hero comics and adventure stories or the intergalactic adventures from Mary Fan or the noirish stylings of Russ Colchamiro, then you know what you're in for. Aaron, Paul, Mary, the late Glenn Hauman, and Michael Jan Friedman are all signed on for the project. \nAdditionally, I have assembled a stellar line-up of other writers \u2013 Derek Tyler Attico, Jim & Becky Beard, Paige Daniels, Kathleen O'Shea David, Robert T. Jeschonek, Amy Lewanski, Karissa Laurel, and Jenifer Purcell Rosenberg \u2013 to produce new thrills and chills, spanning the traditional pulp realms of mystery, sword and sorcery, horror, science fiction, romance, and high adventure, in a volume appropriately titled...Thrilling Adventure Yarns!\nMeet Professor Ironheart! The Blue Mask! The Green Lady! Cannon Belle! And many more brand-new heroes that would have made pulp-era creators proud.\nAn Historic Coup!\nWe have also secured the rights to a true relic of the glory days of the pulps: A previously unpublished World War I aviator tale by none other than Lester Dent, the creator of Doc Savage! This is a milestone in the history of the pulp magazines, available only to the backers of this campaign. \nWe're really excited about Thrilling Adventure Yarns -- in part, at least, because of this great cover by the inestimable British artist Alex Ronald. Feast your eyes on this image and you can see for yourself that the days of yore will be treated with deep affection.\nOur goal!\nThis isn't the kind of publishing project in which the publisher takes the lion's share of the profits and doles out the scraps to those who've done all the work. All funds that remain after the expenses of acquiring the Lester Dent story, commissioning the cover, designing the book, funding a print run, and sending out rewards to our backers will be divvied up by our editor and our writers in equal amounts. If we reach our goal of at least $4,500, we'll be able to accomplish all that.\nBut it's our hope to earn enough to add some other authors as well, and maybe, just maybe, to reach a stretch goal that will enable us to add interior illustrations.\nIt all comes down to you.\nA la carte!\nThis handy-dandy a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package--to receive all the things you want and none of the things you don't.

Vancouver, British Columbia found out after a breakout of White Sun, a virus capable of bringing back the dead in a viciously primal state. Panic turned into destruction as corpses marched through the streets, tearing at the flesh of anyone in their wake. \nHope was fleeting. \nGlobal superpowers came together and formed the International Bio-disaster Response Agency (IBRA). Cleaner Squads were dispatched into the unfolding crisis. Their mission: extract the living and clear out any dead that stands in their way.\nBruce Deacon, fireteam leader of CS-42, was among the first wave to arrive. Entering the besieged city only to discover\u2026\nIn Vancouver, when it rains it pours.  \nWhat is Vancity Outbreak?\nVancity Outbreak is a graphic novel about a deadly virus that turns victims into ravenous undead cannibals. Bruce Deacon, the squad leader of a bio-disaster response team, is sent to rescue the survivors trapped within the city. He meets a student nurse named Jane Riley and together they work to escape the quarantine zone. Only to discover that they bit off more than they could chew.\nWhiplash Comics uses real actors and real locations. We tell stories through the medium of a camera and create stunning visuals through composting the photographs. The result is a truly unique style that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. \nOur cast includes real models, actors, makeup artist, musicians, and other creatives. Together, with very small budget, we put together TWO action-packed issues. Reid Lucier tailored each photo using graphic compositing to add the effects while working with Cale Boudreau to input the story. \nWe've had a booth at Vancouver\u2019s zombie walk, comic conventions and met with successful creators to learn everything we can. It paid off and we want to continue going forward! With your help we can pay for the printing costs, shipping fees, and begin working on future comics!\n\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 2 - Crossings\nIssue 2 - Crossroads\nIssue 2 - Crossroads\nIssue 2 - Crossroads\n\nReward Tiers\nTier 1 - Bite\nTier 2 - Infection\nTier 3 - Viral Spread\nTier 4 - Outbreak\nTier 5 - Pandemic\nTier 6 - Apocalypse\nTier 7 - Annihilation\nOur Vision\nWhiplash Comics brings graphic novels to life through photography. With a successful Kickstarter, we can bring both issues of Vancity Outbreak to market, tainted with our blood, sweat and tears.\nAnd we don't plan on stopping there! \nWe have more stories in the works including: issue #3 of Vancity Outbreak, a spy comic, a VR short movie based on Vancity Outbreak, and even branching off into illustrated comics.\nWith enough support we can deliver more jaw-dropping visual storytelling. We made Vancity Outbreak with a budget of $200, having a group of creatives from all walks of life come together through nothing but passion. \nOur goal moving forward, however, is to offer compensation to the actors, extras, make-up artists, and everyone else that contributes. This is an important step if we want to maintain our cast for continuity sake. The photoshoots last anywhere from 10-12 hours and often require re-shoots. Tons of work pours into each comic which requires intricate planning to put together. \nWHO ARE WE?\nReid\nCale\nWhat's the backstory? How did Vancity Outbreak come about?\nReid Lucier had the idea for Vancity Outbreak after finishing a zombie themed photoshoot with our resident Bruce (Roberto Lanzas) and Jane (Yu Sarah Matsushita). After editing the first photo, he noticed how cinematic the shots were and found the inspiration to make a comic. Reid created a short PDF comic book with the photos he had.  A year later Reid decided he wanted to continue Vancity Outbreak and really do it right with a full graphic novel in mind.  After bringing up the idea to the original cast and receiving a lot of enthusiasm from them to do more, Reid sat down to write a full graphic novel.  It took all about 10 mins to realize writing was not his speciality.\nThat\u2019s when he met Cale Boudreau, a creative writer and zombie fanatic, online. Together, with couple cold ones and some poutine they created the vision for the comic.  They began casting actors, makeup artist, and looking for props and locations to shoot.  Shedding their blood, sweat, and tears to make it happen. \nTwo full issues were shot, and Reid went to work on editing, and layout, special effects etc. Now finally we are thrilled to get these issues into your hands!\nWhy back us?\nBecause we know where you live, and the next time you open your front door we'll have our undead associate waiting for you...\nOur associate :)\n Just kidding...maybe? \n\nPrinting\nSize: 6.6 by 10.25 inches\nCover:  10pt paper stock, Matte anti-scratch, green foil stamping\nInside paper stock:  85lbs matte\nBinding: Perfect Softcover\nWe shopped around and did our research.  We walked a few indie comic events and 8/10 books we picked up, flipped through and impressed us were from Print Ninja.  We contacted Print Ninja and they sent us a few samples. The one style of graphic novel sent over was perfect.  The look, the feel, the fantastic quality...we knew we had to have it. Pricier than other places we contacted, but will be well worth it. We want top quality for us and most of all, our fans! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any creation process there are challenges. With a photographic comic these problems become more complex.\n\nHere's the good news: All the work is done and the first two comics are 100% complete! We simply need help to fund our first printing run and to bring forth all the great rewards with it. \n\nWe have a TON of interest from actors wanting to join future projects.

These are working professionals in the industry so their schedules are often hard to align. \n\nOur contingency here is find a day that works for everyone. We can also break up shoots into two smaller days.

In the ancient forest of Soza, a fighter, a thief and a hermit go searching for a magical sword that can control minds!\nIt was shot in the woods by the Yoghurt Rooms in East Grinstead with some scenes in Ashdown Forest.\nWe are hosting a MOVIE PREMIERE in the East Grinstead Cinema on Sunday the 9th of December. In order to do this screening, and hopefully more in the future, we need a BBFC certificate, and they're very expensive!\nWith your support, we hope to screen this film, not only for this story, but on behalf of all micro-budget film makers. We want to bring big independent features into the cinema, where they should be!\nThe film stars Xander Phillips as Tias, Seth Easterbrook as Ulysses, and Martyn Eade as Mars. It's a more classic style fantasy, with a fully original classical score, which I have written myself.\nWe recommend arriving at the event at 6:30 PM\nThe doors will open at 7:00 PM and there will be one intermission in the middle of the film. The cast and crew will be there, handing out awards to pledgers, answering questions, and trying our best to hide our nerves (me in particular!)\nYour pledge will help us to cover the costs of this release. Not the film cost itself. We paid for that for the love of making film. The budget was probably around \u00a32000 in total, mainly due to old style clothing and you guessed it - swords! This funding will help mostly with the certificate, the theatre rental, and if we overshoot our goal, it will begin to help cover costs of printing, ink, paper, cases, posters and rewards.\nAbove all, your pledge will - quite honestly - give us a little more hope in this field of art. To make something that people give a chance, to give their time and money to experience something new, whether good or bad, gives us the ability to learn from the experience, and a little more confidence in putting the time and money into future films.\nUPDATE ON THE RATING: It is now a 12A, confirmed!\nIf your kids like classic fantasy adventure, bring them! :D\nThis is a \"fantasy epic\" so it's not short. It has been cut down, so it's faster-paced, but after debating for a long time, I could not bring myself to divide this film into two halves. Although it was almost possible, it would have spoiled the structure of the script, and the way it was intended to be. But as promised, a 15-minute intermission, and some possible surprises during :) Like the way cinema used to be!\nPlease pass this link to anyone who you think it might appeal to. We're always looking to build relationships with backers who may also be trying to get into the film-making game. That's the whole idea!\nThank you for your time in looking at our film, and I look forward to meeting you and posting all those rewards.

I ask for help at the last minute, well after I've done everything I can. (Although one day, I hope to try new methods!) Therefore there are practically no risks for backers.\n\nThe film has already been written, shot, edited and scored. We are in the absolute final stages of audio mixing, which will probably be done by the time this kick-starter is launched. I will then test it with Chris on the projector, make any adjustments, test again (I usually aim for first or second test to be the final one), then it's done. If I die, the show goes on. If the cinema gets fried by a dragon, then we might have a problem.\n\nSince the campaign ends the day before the premiere, the film is scheduled to be tested within a week from now. The only risks are technical ones, computers deciding to fight me, which I am pretty used to by now! If some horrific freak technical problem happens and the Premiere can't go on, then I would know well before the kick-starter would end, and would not allow it to take the money from its backers in the first place. I have already started production on the rewards, which are relatively easy to complete at this stage from previous experience.\nVHS is a bit of a tricky one, but we reckon we've solved it doing some tests.\nWhen the film is on that projector, tested and given the nod, it stays there.

My name is A. M. Paulson.  I am a dyslexic writer with a few stories published and am writing a comic book series through Oneshi Press.  I had lots of issues in school with spelling and reading with the letter 'c' being a true enemy of mine for my early grade school years.  Later in life I learned a rule to spell with the letter 'c'.  The letter 'c' sounds like a 'k' before a, o, and u as in cat, cot, and cut.  The letter 'c' sounds like an 's' before e, i, and y as in cent, city, and cyst.  Now I am inspired to write a picture book to teach this rule to help other kids like myself.  I sent it to many publishers, but they had no idea what to do with it and rejected it on the grounds they didn't know who would buy it.  I know this story can help many kids, so I got together with a friend, and we planing to put it on Amazon Kindle.  We need $100 for art supplies  and to pay the artist.  We have other goals as well.  \nThose goals are...\n$200 for an audio book\n$300 for a paperback printed edition\n$500 for a hardback printed edition\n$1000 for an animated short of the story\nI am not one to ask you to give money without seeing the manuscript.  So, the rest of this post is the story 'Mary and the Letter C.'  I hope you enjoy it ;)\nMary and the Letter C\nBy: A. M. Paulson\nMary was very sad. She had failed her spelling test, and her parents said it was because she did not try hard enough to learn to spell the words.\n\u201cHow can you spell the word \u2018cat\u2019 k-a-t?\u201d her dad had asked.\n\u201cThe word \u2018city\u2019 begins with a \u2018c\u2019 not a \u2018s\u2019,\u201d her mother had said. \u201cEveryone knows that.\u201d\nMary had tried to tell her parents she spelled the words the way they sounded just like her teacher told her to do, but they wouldn\u2019t listen. Instead they sent her to her room without any dinner.\nAs she sat on her bed, Mary decided the only reason she failed the test was because of the letter \u201cc.\u201d She wondered why the letter \u201cc\u201d sounded like the letter \u201cs\u201d when you sang the alphabet song, but when used in words, it sometimes sounded like a \u201ck,\u201d for example in \u201ccat.\u201d For hours, she thought and thought. \nMary thought about how the letter \u201cc\u201d doesn\u2019t really have a sound of its own.\nMary thought about how the letter \u201cc\u201d steals spelling jobs from \u201cs\u2019s\u201d and \u201ck\u2019s.\u201d\nMary thought about how much better the world would be without the letter \u201cc.\u201d\nMary thought about hammering out the letter \u201cc\u201d into the letter \u201cI\u201d or squeezing it into the letter \u201co,\u201d or bending it into the letter \u201cv.\u201d \nUntil at last, she fell asleep. \nIn middle of the night, a sound woke Mary up. Jumping up and down on her bed was a fairy. The fairy had the wings of a honeybee and a dress made of letters.\n\u201cHello,\u201d said the fairy. \u201cI\u2019m Spella, the fairy of spelling and grammar. I\u2019m here to teach you about the letter \u2018c\u2019.\u201d\nMary closed her eyes to go back to sleep. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to learn about the letter \u2018c\u2019.\u201d Mary said. \u201cGo away, so I can go back to sleep.\u201d\nSpella flew over to Mary and whispered in her ear, \u201cLearning about \u2018c\u2019 will help you pass your next spelling test.\u201d\nMary opened one eye. \u201cIt will?\u201d\nSpella nodded. \u201cI promise.\u201d\nMary sat up.\nSpella flew to the middle of the room and clapped her hands, and the letters \u201cc,\u201d \u201cs,\u201d and \u201ck\u201d appeared. \n\u201cYou are right about the letter \u2018c\u2019 being troublesome,\u201d Spella said. \u201cLots of children your age have trouble knowing which of these three letters to use at the beginning of a word.\u201d\n\u201cBut my parents said no one had trouble with it,\u201d Mary said, remembering what her mom and dad had said before they sent her to her room.\nSpella shrugged. \u201cSome people have no problem with it. Everyone is different.\u201d\nSpella clapped her hands again. The letters \u201ck\u201d and \u201cs\u201d vanished in a puff, and the letters \u201ca,\u201d \u201ce,\u201d \u201ci,\u201d \u201co,\u201d \u201cu,\u201d and \u201cy\u201d appeared. These letters made two rows. \u201cA,\u201d \u201co,\u201d and \u201cu\u201d were in one, and the letters \u201ce,\u201d \u201ci\u201d and \u201cy\u201d were the another. \nThe fairy pointed at the two rows of letters and said, \u201cBelieve it or not, it is really these letters that determine in words that begin with a \u2018c,\u2019 if that \u2018c\u2019 sounds like a \u2018k,\u2019 or an \u2018s\u2019.\u201d\nMary did not believe Spella. She wondered how vowels had anything to do with how the letter \u201cc\u201d sounded. However, instead of asking, Mary waited for Spella to go on.\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Spella, as the letters \u201ca,\u201d \u201cc,\u201d \u201co,\u201d and \u201cu\u201d began to glow. \u201cThe letter \u2018c\u2019 has the hard sound \u2018k\u2019 before \u2018a\u2019, \u2018o\u2019 and \u2018u\u2019 as in the words cat, cot, and cut.\u201d\nThe letters \u2018a\u2019, \u2018o\u2019, and \u2018u\u2019 stopped glowing. Spella pointed to the other row of letters, and that started glowing.\nSpella then said, \u201cThe letter \u2018c\u2019 has the soft sound \u2018s\u2019 before \u2018e\u2019, \u2018i\u2019, and \u2018y\u2019 as in the words cent, city, and cyst.\u201d\nSpella clapped her hands and the letters vanished in a puff. The fairy looked at Mary with a large smile on its face. \nMary scratched her head. \u201cThat is kind of confusing.\u201d\n\u201cYes it is sort of confusing,\u201d Spella agreed. \u201cBut English is a hard language with over one-hundred different spelling and grammar rules. For example, the \u2018k\u2019 sound can also be spelled with a \u2018c\u2019, \u2018k\u2019, \u2018ck,\u2019 \u2018ch,\u2019 or \u2018que.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so stupid!\u201d Mary groaned. \u201cI\u2019m never going to be good at spelling.\u201d\nSpella hovered in front of Mary. \u201cBeing good or bad at spelling has nothing to with being smart or dumb. Now will you let me help you learn to use the letter \u2018C\u2019?\u201d\nMary nodded her head. Through out the night Spella helped Mary understand the rule about using the letter \u2018C\u2019 in the begging of a word. It was not long before the Mary was able to spell words with the letter \u2018C\u2019.\nSpella asked, \u201c How do you spell the word \u2018cart\u2019?\nMary spelled. \u201c C-a-r-t\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Spella cheered. \u201cNow how do you spell the word \u2018city\u2019?\n\u201cC-i-t-y\u201d Mary spelled.\nSpella gave Mary a thumbs-up. \u201cThere see you got it.\u201d\nMary gave Spella a hug. \u201cThank you so much for all of your help, Spella.\u201d\n\u201cThanks are not needed,\u201d Spella said. \u201cI\u2019m a fairy after all, and fairies help people.\u201d  \nSpella signed sadly. \u201cNow I\u2019m sorry to say that I have to go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m going to get through school without you. No one has ever tried to help me like you did,\u201d Mary said with tears forming in her eyes. \u201cI wish you could stay and be my friend forever.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Spella said. \nSpella clapped her hands again and a card appeared in Mary\u2019s hands.\n\u201cWe will always be friends.\u201d Spella flew in front of Mary\u2019s nose. \u201cIf you ever need any help in spelling or grammar, just do what the card says, and I\u2019ll come.\u201d\nSpella vanished in a puff of smoke and letters. Mary put the card on a table next her bed, lay back down on her bed, and fell a sleep.\nThe next day, Mary woke up thinking the whole thing had been a dream. Then she saw Spella\u2019s card on the table and knew it had happened. She also knew it would not be the last time she would meet her fairy friend Spella, the spelling and grammar fairy.

Now imagine that same near future demands you have the trendiest dating app which requires you to upload your... DNA? A bit intrusive, right? What are the ethical guidelines when it comes to advancement in technology? Where do we draw the line between right vs. wrong? Who\u2019s to say we haven\u2019t crossed it? \nXYXX explores a near future in which one technological innovation alters the lives of lonely singles everywhere. Technology. Reality. Privacy. Identity. Love. These five themes are the backbone of XYXX -- and our team can't wait to tell more of these stories!\nElle (Meredith Shank) downloading XYXX for the first time\nThe Origins\nBack in the fall of 2015, Conor Patrick Hogan and Cory McConnell came up with the idea for XYXX over a case of PBR in a Silver Lake backyard. Conor provided the PBR, Cory provided the Silver Lake backyard. Below you'll find a segment of the original pitch that was drafted from this brainstorming. It's remarkable how little was altered from its core inception. \nA segment of Conor and Cory's first story area, 10/12/15\nOnce the pilot was written, Conor and Cory invited four other writers (Andy Holt, Samantha Levy, Lyz May and Kim Ndombe) into the world of XYXX and fleshed out an entire first season  together. Producers Scott Sullivan, Maija Gustin and Daniel Marks provided instrumental feedback during this period too. Black Mirror was an obvious inspiration in early meetups, with Orphan Black's tonal fluidity and High Maintenance's structural ingenuity providing further assistance with our own series' blueprint. Once the entire first season was written, Conor and Cory reached out to directors and casting directors -- purposefully searching for new, unknown (to them!) accomplices who would challenge their storytelling process and collaborate on ways to make the world of the series even more grand. \nXYXX Casting Session, Spring 2016 [From L to R: Chris Redondo (Casting Director), Morgan Dameron (Director), Cory McConnell (Editor) and Conor Patrick Hogan's fingers (Writer)]\nOnce Morgan Dameron (director) and Chris Redondo (casting director) were aboard, the next few months blurred. Casting bled into VFX trials which bled into production meetings and, finally, 3 days of filming. From the first setup, everyone was aware that our premiere episode's leads -- Meredith Shank and Jim Cummings -- possessed an uncanny chemistry. \nElle (Meredith Shank) first meets Harry (Jim Cummings)\nXYXX was finally a living, breathing thing.\nThen 2 years flew by. Sadly, no one seemed interested in XYXX. So we're moving ahead solo!\nThe Near Future\nXYXX is a near future anthology series that aims to be pro-reality, not anti-technology. By using a black and white tableau for \u2018reality\u2019 and bright, bold colors for \u2018technology\u2019, we plan to ask our audience: just what is truly revered in society now that our screens have become so ubiquitous \u2013 is it true human connection or merely the appearance of said connection? \nHarry (Jim Cummings) previews the XYXX profile of Elle (Meredith Shank)\nWhile this aim may appear grandiose, it\u2019s the subtleties of the separate romances our team plan to delve into that will make this series stand out from any counterparts. Episode 1, a true world-building introduction, delves into what transpires when you begin online dating (for the first time ever!) in our near future world. Episode 2 explores the repercussions when one spouse in a relationship won\u2019t upload their DNA to the questionably invasive app. Finally, Episode 3 tackles a high school senior's blossoming sexuality when it doesn\u2019t necessarily match that of heteronormativity in this brave, new world.\nAs long as XYXX engages an audience enough to make them simply consider the moral quandaries almost on our doorstep -- while also (hopefully!) making them laugh -- the cast and crew will have accomplished their goal. \nElle (Meredith Shank) receives a rather unwelcome text\nThe Plan & Crew\nWith your crowdfunding contribution, the team behind XYXX will shoot Episodes 2 and 3 in the Winter of 2018 and then release all three episodes as Season 1 in the first half of 2019. We're excited to have some new teammates -- Brandon Smithson (director, ep 103) and Leslie Wasserman (casting director) -- with many of our first episode's crew returning too.\nCONOR PATRICK HOGAN (Co-creator / Writer / EP )\nConor Patrick Hogan stayed in the closet way past his expiration date. During his early twenties (while still closeted!) he produced a feature film, Trailerpark, based on the collection of short stories by award-winning author Russell Banks. Once he departed from Ohio (and finally came out!), he moved to LA and worked on various TV shows including Modern Family, Covert Affairs, Banshee, SIX and Chicago Med, where he is currently the script coordinator. Conor's super worried about people casually uploading their DNA to random apps, but that's why he appreciates Cory's perspective on the whole sitch.\nCORY McCONNELL (Co-creator / Editor / EP)\nCory McConnell is a producer and editor living in Los Angeles. XYXX has been a labor of love during time off from his day jobs, including stints at CollegeHumor and The Ringer. He is ambivalent about uploading his DNA to phone apps, but vehemently against the proliferation of electric scooter startups.\nMORGAN DAMERON (Director 101 & 102 / EP)\nMorgan Dameron is an award-winning writer, director and producer who has always blazed her own path. Born in Kansas City, MO, Dameron was awarded the Women in Film and Television in Kansas City\u2019s \u201cTrailblazer Award\u201d for Up and Coming Women in Film while still in high school. She received a full scholarship to the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts, where she graduated summa cum laude. She has been supported by prestigious programs such as the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, The Caucus for Producers, and Ryan Murphy\u2019s HALF Initiative. Dameron has directed groundbreaking digital series and branded content garnering tens of millions of views. Her first feature film, Different Flowers, received rave reviews during its national theatrical release and can currently be seen on Showtime. Kansas City Women in Film and Television recently bestowed her with the \u201cSpirit of Kansas City\u201d award for her work bringing film production to her hometown and Duke University\u2019s Talent Identification Program recently honored her with the Early Achievement Award. She lives in Los Angeles.\nBRANDON SMITHSON (Director 103)\nBrandon Smithson is a LA-based filmmaker who got his start in entertainment by shooting music videos and fashion shorts in NYC. Some of his previous work includes two music videos for Bob the Drag Queen and a behind-the-scenes short with recording artist Brandy.  In 2016, his digital series Inner Circle garnered international press and was featured in Gay Times. More recently, Brandon serves as creator of the episodic series Fish Tank which takes you on a comedic adventure into the dating lives of two trans women.\nLESLIE WASSERMAN (Casting Director)\nLeslie Wasserman is a casting professional for film and TV. She was recently the Casting Director for Dekkoo Series I\u2019m Fine and Del Close documentary For Madmen Only. Her work includes Cameron Crowe\u2019s Roadies, Strangers 2: Prey at Night and Of Kings and Prophets. Upcoming films include Lady and the Tramp, Mustang, The Devil Has a Name, City of Lies, Four Kids and It, and TV series Shark Lords. Wasserman is also a proud member of The Casting Society of America and has worked with the feature film program at Sundance Labs.\nMore crew announcements to follow during our campaign...!\nElle's ex Dan (Sachin Bhatt) and Elle (Meredith Shank) on a near future photo frame projector\n\u2022 Have any further questions?

Where the story about the time that the wood elf cavalry saved the day, or how the onslaught of the orc hordes could not be stopped. We wanted to create a history with our friends.\"\n  \u2013 Ron Newcomb\nThe Rangers: Rise of War game has been years in the making. This game\u2019s journey began back in 2014 as The Rangers film was being developed. Since 2015 it has been play tested by the creators and gamers to develop and refine the most diverse game play we could provide, a game that we would want to play. Each army offers a diverse makeup and features that add depth and create unique outcomes in game play. The game is set in the high-fantasy world of The Rangers, Adrasil. The Rangers franchise includes several films, as seen on The Fantasy Network, a comic book, and a live-action role playing event, \"Weekend Warrior\u201d.  \nFACTIONS\nHUMANS\nBased in the Kingdom of Olaran, the humans are a young race, divided into the Landwards, who hold power and the Rangers, who are an elite group of warriors that are the eyes and blade of the king. The Human faction is allied to the Wood Elves. Veteran Human units can be upgraded to a Ranger. Human Heroes may inspire the populace of a region to double their production output.\nWOOD ELVES\nThe Elven Lords like to stay to themselves, but during this time of war, the ancients must join the age of man and emerge from the depths of their hidden palaces in the Green Wood or fall under the weight of the Shadow Elves and their Orc hordes to the north. Their alliance with the Humans is tenuous and fraught with suspicion. Wood Elf units possess \u201cswiftness\u201d and may move 2 spaces during their turn. Wood Elf Heroes have a +1 movement and may engage enemy troops at long range with their bow in an adjacent territory during their turn.\nSHADOW ELVES\nThe Elven Lords of the North, known as the Umbran, are an ancient and noble people. Adept in the arts of war and magic, they are fierce in battle though small in number. Their subjugated allies, the Orc hordes, make up for their lack of numbers. Shadow Elf s possess \u201cstealth\u201d and may move 2 spaces during their turn and a +1 initiative to the opening die roll at the start of the game. Umbran can hold +1 additional spell card. Umbran Heroes may strike and retreat in the same turn too on a die roll of 1, 2 or 3. They may also choose to attack with an Orc Horde they are adjacent to.\nORCS\nThe Orc Warlords and their hordes are brutal and vicious in battle. Hordes overrun and crush their enemies by tenacity and sheer weight of their numbers. The Orcs are allied to their masters, the Shadow Elves. Orc warriors cost half as much as all other units. Orcs may choose to pillage a building for half its resources in return. Individual Orc troops may also \u201cberserk\u201d, sacrificing themselves and tripling their attack value for one turn of combat + max unit/region ratio.\nCREATURES\nShould you choose to quest with your Hero, you may find yourself face-to-face with a beast from ancient days. These ancient creatures are difficult to kill and dangerous in a fight.\nSHIPPING\nWe will be handling shipping cost after the campaign. Our goal is for Friendly Shipping worldwide with fulfillment centers and local publishers. Each of these countries (US, Canada, Europe, Australia/NZ, Asia) we plan to send bulk shipments to fulfillment partners paying VAT and fulfilling more directly.

Forget diplomacy\u2014humanity\u2019s presence in space is focused solely on seizing exoplants and extracting their resources. The ships of the Coalition are interstellar company towns, run by indifferent AIs and designed to keep their crews in constant debt. Inequality is rampant\u2014if you\u2019re wearing a red crew shirt, life sucks: you\u2019re overworked in hazardous conditions while under constant surveillance and living on top of one another. And you have to pay for your own health care. And the whole time, the smirking officers are telling you the only reason you\u2019re not enjoying the good life is because you\u2019ve chosen to stay poor. So, nothing at all like the world today.\nAfter surviving fifteen years in a red shirt, Webb is nearly burned out. She joined up like any starry-eyed kid did: to get her own ship. But that\u2019s never going to happen\u2014not now that the officers loathe her for being the crew\u2019s elected (and powerless) representative, even as she\u2019s trying to break out of the enlisted ranks herself. But rank has little to do with leadership, and hers will be put to the test when the starship Independence collides saucer-first with with a threat they\u2019re completely unprepared for: aliens that don\u2019t look like us.* When the ship\u2019s social order breaks down from a truly alien threat, it\u2019s falls to Webb to save the crew, the ship\u2014and herself.\n*You can have sex with most aliens.

A lot of the art in these rules is placeholders and we're still tinkering with fonts and backdrops for legibility purposes, but the content is the current iteration of the rules.\nJuly 5 - The first review is in! In German. However, you can read the somewhat amusing Google translation of it here.\nKilling Lee Garvin? Huh?\nKilling Lee Garvin (KLG for short) is a game with a mission. To make fun of the improbable yet inevitable mortality of game designer Lee Garvin (Tales from the Floating Vagabond, Badass Zombie Killers, etc.), which hopefully is quite a few years off. And also because on his way there he has racked up a lot of medical bills that he feels honor-bound to pay while simultaneously faced with the problem of doing so on what you can make as an indie game designer. And the minor distraction of being evicted and living in his car for the past several months. So, with the assistance of cartoonist Ron Leishman (co-creator of Captain Canuck), I'm trying to help Lee out a bit.\nGreg: Being a board/card/rpg game designer is creatively wonderful, but sucks in a lot of other respects. Publishing is already a low-income zone with no job security and negligible benefits, and game design is a ghetto within that zone.\nAnd if you are an independent game designer, it can be even tougher. Lee Garvin is a friend and like me, an indie, but unlike me, life has not been kind to him. In the sense that \"being in an accident, going into a coma and waking up medically bankrupt\" is \"not been kind\".\nAmong other things. Lee has endured a laundry list of improbable bad luck events that would make a good script for a slapstick version of Final Destination.\nBecause I'm a game designer, I see everything as having game potential, so I humorously told Lee I should make a game about killing him off. And the more I thought about it, the more it actually started to make sense...\nAnd so, Killing Lee Garvin was born... At the time I started work on this, Lee still had a roof over his head and the project was meant to just help with his medical bills, but as his life circumstances took a more...outdoors turn, the focus has turned to helping him first get that roof (any roof) back, so that he can try to do all the things those of us with roofs take for granted.\nLee: I wasn't entirely sure Greg was serious about doing this at first, but I should have guessed; he made a game about stalking slasher victims (which I have played quite a bit). And for the record, It wasn't an accident that put me into the coma; it was the doctors who were trying to get me to breathe after I got pneumonia. The accident was a different time.\nBut to give an example of where the cards are coming from, long ago, in an age known as \"The '80s\", I was a Boy Scout (Go Troop 35!). While at one of our troop cookouts, the guys were spread out all over the grounds of the church that served as the host for most of our events. Being Scouts, we were naturally very curious about nature. Being Boys, we were reckless and quite foolish in our endeavors. Being the '80s, safety had not yet been invented. Some of my fellow scouts were expressing their curiosity towards nature by whacking a wasps' nest in a tree with a long stick. I was walking from around the other side of the building at the time, so naturally, I turned the corner just as they knocked the nest out of the tree, and it hit the ground, and all the wasps in the world flew into my open mouth. I really, really wish I could say that was the worst pain I have ever experienced.\nIf one accepts the \"many worlds\" theory of alternate realities, I died in 437 of them. But this being the 1980s, and my father being from Texas, as long as the kid could breathe and no bones were visible, he saw no reason to get medical professionals involved.  \nBut I did get ice cream.\nLife-threatening calamities and ice cream. The Lee Garvin story...\nGoals?\nGreg: KLG has a few simple goals. Be a good, hilarious game. Help out Lee. The latter part is simple. After the production costs are taken into account, Lee gets half. And this is not Hollywood accounting. Lee gets most of his projected cut as fast as I can cut the check after the Kickstarter ends. And if it is funded with time to spare, I'll write as much as I can out of my own account, just to give him a head start. And the more people we get on board, the lower the production cost is per game. So, the more people that want to kill Lee, the better off he ends up. I'm not exactly sure how the karma math works on that one, however...\nLee: One thing I want to make crystal clear is that, yes, I am in a bad way (hell, I'm sleeping in my car right now), but I am not alone, and there are others who have it worse than me. So yes, I will be using some of the money from this project to dig myself out of the hole I'm in, but a full 50% of it, I intend to donate to the Jack Vasel Memorial Fund. This is an organization that has already helped me quite a bit, so I just want to return the favor. They exist to do nothing but help Gaming Professionals who have hit hard times.\nAbout the game\nKLG is a simple 3-6 player game that hides a significant amount of strategy and backstabbing. There are two ways to win. First, you can \"heal\" Lee and you win. Second, you can manipulate someone else into killing Lee and if you have the best game position at that time, you win. So, you can be a good guy and save him, or a bastard who engineers and then takes advantage of his untimely demise...\nIt's a single-deck game, with 54 cards and a bunch of tokens in three colors for representing Lee's health. Cards are simple. They have a number, a color and a type (Harm or Help). Every round you choose from a selection of face-up cards to add to your hand, play cards secretly and reveal them. Harm cards give Health tokens to other players, Help cards put tokens back in the common pool. If you get too many tokens of a particular color, Lee becomes an ex-game designer and it will all be your fault. You are a bad person and Lee's ghost will haunt you. Even if it was another player who gave you the tokens that made you lose. It's pretty easy to end the game by bringing about Lee's untimely demise, but to win you also have to have the best board position when that happens. Not so easy. So you may have to work very hard to keep him healthy...right up to the moment where you push him in front of a bus.\nBut you can also make deals involving the cards. And break them. You do not know exactly what other players are holding, but you do know who has what tokens and what will trigger the end of the game. So, the deals you make and the order in which they resolve is an important part of each round. So, cards are revealed and the round leader (player 1) says \u201cHey player 4, I won't hit you with the Squirrels if you don't Mug me\u201d, and player 4 says \u201cSure thing!\u201d Of course, since player 1 does their action first, player 4 does not have to abide by the deal, but they will. This time. \nAnd whoever is the current round leader has to narrate Lee's life events using the revealed cards for that round. So player 1 looks at the cards and says: \n\"Lee compensated for the stresses of GenCon with a regular cardio workout. But while jogging in the park one morning he was mugged and beaten. And then the squirrels found him...\u201d\nKLG gameplay video\nPLAY\n\nA game of KLG takes ten to thirty minutes to play, and strategy really depends on who you are playing with. People who are trying to win by healing Lee will have a different strategy than those trying to bring about his premature end, and how you play depends on how many of each type of player are in your game. But you are simultaneously playing against the table (the state of tokens and their distribution) and against the other players (what are they trying to do, and to whom?). \nStretch Goals \n$15,000: The basic game\nNot really a stretch goal. This covers the production, art, the Kickstarter cut and enough room to get Lee some money. The base funding level is not low-balling it in expectation we will blow through it. It is a realistic number so that if we reach, Lee gets some help. Given the fixed costs like art (most of the cards are custom caricatures of Lee), this is the minimum level to make the game happen.\n$20,000: Custom meeple\nThe \"first player\" meeple in KLG denotes who gets first pick of cards and deal-making opportunities each round. If we get $20,000 in pledges, we will have a custom meeple made that is an embarrassing caricature of Lee Garvin. My personal preference would be him looking like an out-of-shape Bane (admit it, he's meeple-shaped), but if we reach this goal, Lee will be browbeaten into supplying some pictures and people can vote on their favorite in the comments section.\n$35,000: Quality upgrade \nThe base level of the project turns a profit, but is a short run game and much of the cost is the artwork and the higher cost per game for short run printing. The $35,000 level is the minimum for getting a large print run from China. The lower cost per unit means we can upgrade the quality of everything. Cards, box, tray liner, rules, the works.\nIt's a big jump from $15,000 to $35,000, but depending on the printer I'm pretty sure we will be able to get a useful \"printed in China\" price for some level of pledges north of $15k but less than $35k. We are going to provide the best quality available for whatever level of pledges we do get, but this stretch goal guarantees we can go for the best. You're spending $25 on the game, we want it to look and feel like a good value for the money (in addition to repeat play value for the money).\n$50,000: Organ tokens. Instead of the normal colored bits that are the health tokens, we will spring for the cost of custom blue brain, green lung and red heart tokens to represent Lee's health.\nLaser-guided Chainsaw Add-on!\nOne of Lee's game designs is a cheesy little non-collectable card game called Badass Zombie Killers (or BZK), where the game is about preparing for the zombie apocalypse, having the coolest and most vicious gear, and the game ends when the zombies actually show up. You can download an image of the rules cards from this link.\nNow, unlike Lee who is living in his car in Colorado, the irony is that the remaining stock of BZK actually has a roof over its head in Virginia, close enough to where I am to go get them. So, if you've every wanted a copy of BZK and saw that it is out of stock on Amazon and ThinkGeek, this is your way to get one. So, with the cooperation of Reality Cheque and Skortch'd Urf, this game of prepper one-upmanship can now be yours! Just add $17 to your (US-only) pledge for KLG and we will ship them both at the same time. The $17 covers the BZK and the extra cost for shipping, since we will have to go from a First Class 12oz box to a flat rate Priority Mail box.\nHobo Capitalism Add-On!\nMatt Vancil suggested something to Lee after the \"hobo knife\" picture was posted in Update #23, and the following is entirely Lee's doing. I claim no credit for it. There is now a \"Hobo Capitalism\" add-on in this campaign. For US$10, a US backer will get an official Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 (as seen in Update #23), an autographed picture of Lee holding a knife that is probably not yours (much nicer than the picture below but no guarantee he will look any more sane), and in a hat-tip to Munchkin, a special rule for Badass Zombie Killers that can only be utilized by the rightful owner of said knife. This add-on price includes postage in the US. So, you can add this to any game pledge and it will be sent to you directly from Lee's high-tech manufacturing facility, which will probably be the front seat of his 2008 Saturn.\nThe official Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 has a number of unique features*. It can be smuggled through metal detectors! Each one is hand-crafted by Lee himself and will have its own unique character. It has trace amounts of Lee's DNA in case you need to leave it at a crime scene to confuse the forensic team. And in an emergency it can be disassembled to give you several feet of duct tape.\n*Due to variances in the manufacturing process, the ability of the Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 to cut anything tougher than a McDonalds pancake is not guaranteed. This product not endorsed by the SHA (Stabby Hobo Association).\nAnd here, for the second time anywhere! The tentative official Badass Zombie Killers Hobo Knife\u2122 Rule \nIf you have an authentic Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 in your possession, you may do the following once per game. Discard 4 Badassery worth of Weapon cards or Modifier cards from your hand (that is, the total Badassery value or bonus of the cards must add up to at least positive 4) into the Dumpster. Whip out your Hobo Knife\u2122 and Shank one opponent's character.  \nTo Shank, you must choose one of that character's special abilities, and place the blade of the Hobo Knife\u2122 so that it covers it completely. That ability is not available for use for as long as the blade remains lodged in the character (until dislodged by a special effect). At the end of the game, the Hobo Knife\u2122 is returned to its owner. Don't make them come over there.\nShipping\nGames will be shipped in the US by First Class or Priority Mail (depending on whether they top 12 ounces with the stretch goals), and tracking numbers will be available.  \nSame as USA, just a little more expensive. \nEU-bound games will ship from the EU to avoid Customs charges and will go via regular mail within the EU.  \nAustralia-bound games will depend on the level of funding. At the low end they will be shipped via an intermediary service, while if we get into stretch goal territory we can probably use a normal fulfillment center. \nIf you are backing this project from Mars, we will arrange to have your package put on the next available manned flight (losing the entire shipment we shoehorned into the Schiaparelli lander soured us on automated interplanetary delivery options). Kickstarter does not have Mars in their system so contact us privately for shipping cost. Due to Customs restrictions, we cannot ship to the Moon or other planets at this time. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter (third if you count collaborations), and the fourth that Lee has started or been a collaborator on, so while we are not \"veterans\", we have some experience with the process. But this one has the potential to be significantly bigger than previous ones. The project goal is modest and will turn a profit that can go to help Lee, but if it exceeds its goals by a lot, then the scaling goes from \"domestic short run printing\" to \"seafreight container from China\", and from \"local pack & ship\" to \"hire a fullfillment service\". The numbers have been run for both cases and work out, and give sufficient wiggle room for stretch goals. However, I do want to avoid \"stretch goal creep\", since I've seen over-promising on other projects, and overly ambitious stretch goals also cause significant production delays.\n\nFortunately, I have a friend in the gaming industry (Mark Walker of Flying Pig Games (look his projects up)) who is both local and has significant experience with Chinese printers and domestic and international fulfillment operations. So in the unlikely event this explodes like kittens, I'm sure there will be headaches, but the headaches will be manageable. And if worst comes to worst, I can always blame it on Lee... (Lee: Hey!)\n\nThe timeframe from \"end of Kickstarter\" to \"game in your hands\" is going to vary based on how successful it is. The moment the minimum threshold is reached, the art will be contracted and the artist is ready to go on it. If it reaches a \"China production\" threshold, we have several possible suppliers and will have to choose one, and if we hit the top tier for custom game pieces, this will probably add a little to the production time as well. Of course, if we hit these thresholds with time to spare it means we can get them underway even before the campaign ends. One thing that will be a delay at the high end is that seafreight will take about a month, compared to domestic short-run printing that would take a few weeks from printing to delivery. My best guess at this point is \"on time or sooner\" for a barely funded campaign to \"a month or two late\" for one with all the stretch goals, but the benefit of the latter is a much nicer looking product (and more money going towards Lee's medical bills). The listed delivery date is an intermediate value, and if you have funded other campaigns you know how that goes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Nice guy", "descp": "You just want to help out, because you're a nice guy.

You do not realize the gradual insinuation of high-ish speed net access until it is gone. I used to be able to work from a 14.4k dialup connection. Of course, web pages were optimized for low speed connections and there was not nearly as much to surf, and I relied much more on my extensive reference library of dead-tree books rather than doing some quick google-fu to get an answer. And I would go to an actual library if needed. I still have my old Library of Congress 'go back into the stacks and rummage around pass' as a souvenir of those days. This has been an eye opener. I get .25mb on a good day and live in a cell tower blind spot, so my predicament would probably be murder-inducing to someone who relied on high speed net and good mobile phone coverage.

Running a webseries is time-consuming and expensive, we want to keep making great content for teachers, kids, and parents but we can\u2019t do it without you!\nWHO DOES QKS PARTNER WITH? \nTeddy and I have collaborated with a handful of LGBTQ+ influencers and organizations. Here are a few highlights <3\nWho is part of Queer Kid Stuff Team?\nLindsay Amer - Creator, Writer, Editor, and Host \nLindsay Amer is a queer activist, artist, and storyteller.

Her work has appeared across the internet, in publications such as Bustle, Autostraddle, and Allure. When she isn\u2019t directing Queer Kid Stuff she can be found hanging on a trapeze, talking loudly about feminism, and hunting for the perfect fried chicken sandwich. Also, she is very gay.\nMeghan McCarter - Make Up Artist/Stylist \nMeghan is an advocate for inclusive education through the dissolution of barriers-to-entry at all levels. This begins with community-based action that equips educators, parents, and students with the tools they need when they need them, without precondition. Mostly she does that by making Lindsay look really handsome on a semi-monthly basis but, when she's not doling out fleek brows, she also tutors primary and secondary school students and runs a weekly queer-oriented drink & draw in Bushwick.\nEmmie Finkle - Production Designer \nEmmie Finckel is a New York based scenic and properties designer specializing in new work and immersive/sensory design.

When we shared a demo of our early work (well, hobby) on Imgur and Reddit, the community response was so positive and energizing that we decided we should commit full-time. The footage you see in the video above is the result of our preliminary work, and we're dying to dig in and upgrade literally every feature you see. This Kickstarter, we're asking you to join us to help make truly fine and fun augmented reality & dragons.\nFresh and warm, straight from the egg\nTo bring augmented monsters and heroes to life, we\u2019re using token-based augmented reality. Each token you place and move around your table is transformed into beautifully animated creatures and cravens (or heroes, if you're the sort). In the final version, the QR-coded cards from the demo will be replaced with polished, professional tokens that add to your tabletop roleplaying experience.\nYour one-inch tokens will come in four varieties: print-and-cut, grayboard, ceramic, and engraved wood. To move your characters and beasties through space, you simply move the tokens through a scalable grid that AR&D will generate for you.\nPrototype ceramic tokens\nPrototype wooden inlay tokens\nHero breeding and cultivation is perhaps the best part of tabletop RPGs. Our first core feature is a comprehensive character creator. From within AR&D you'll be able to summon and customize exactly the right hero for your adventure, stick him on a token, and bring him to animated, living-and-breathing augmented life. Want an Elven archer, an Orc cleric, or a Half-demon barbarian? Pick what speaks to you, gear them up, and make them kiss we mean take them on adventures.\nA mockup of the character creator\nAR&D will let you choose from the classic mythological races like Human*, Orc, Elf, Demon-touched, Dwarf, Lizardman, Halfling, Half-giant, and Gnome. Regardless of which you choose, you can customize their natural variations, put them in clown makeup, and select from epic sets of armor and gear to complete the ensemble. (*mythical human, naturally).\nYour new character, ready to murder hobo his way into infamy\nWithin AR&D will be your very own monster farm. Summon up mesmerizing art and captivatingly sculpted monsters that can breathe fire, fly, burrow, and generally end your player characters' dreams. Most of our next months will be dedicated to building up armies of Very Bad Dudes for all of us to play with. On first pass, there will be 25 unique, animated, resizable monsters ready at launch, with more if we hit our stretch goals or find ways to extend out the day/night cycle.\nTo make the library of baddies truly endless, other stretch goals will make it possible for you to upload 3D files you create or find on your own. You could 3D scan yourself and be your own character class! One of us already turned himself into a playable lvl 13 Coward, complete with wooden cart, cabbages, and despair. It\u2019s a prestige class for Peasant, in case you'd like to roll one yourself.\nTo build the best version of AR&D that we can, we'll need you. While we've already had a ton of fun playing around with early versions, we want your help in making a lasting, rich, and robust play experience. As we finish up testable chunks of design, we'll be counting on you to play with us. Long before the final version is issued, your job will be to tell us all the ways in which it breaks, or better yet all the ways in which we can make it shine.\nOur stretch goals will help define how far you all want us to push AR&D. The more bells we ring, the better AR&D will be on release. Also the louder the bells will be.\nWe'll add the ability for you to upload any 3D file you create or download for use in your games. You can share models with friends, scan yourself, or we'll point you in the direction of some open-source libraries to dive into. By making it possible to use your own files, you'll have limitless flexibility in bringing your campaigns to life.\nWith the shared tabletop feature, you can remotely see and interact with the same table your friends are using. You could move your character behind cover in Vermont and your friends in Texas would see it happen right in front of them. You'll have to trust your DM that the Gorgon really was staring your escort in the face the whole time.\nWe'll create a fully integrated character sheet for you to use in-game.

Rampaging LG Unicorns, here we come!\nOur milestones for this Kickstarter are already quite ambitious, so we'll only unlock further stretch goals if we hit all of our first targets.\nWe love Kickstarter, and we love the enthusiasm Kickstarter backers bring to a project. We need a big community of vocal RPG fans to help propel this project forward.\nSome of you may wonder why the funding threshold is set so high. Well, we have huge plans for AR&D, and we're setting ourselves on a course for the next year and a half. We want to make something enduring and worthy of your support. To complete a project that lives up to our hopes and dreams will take everything we've got; half-way simply won't do.\nElder Labs was started by Dan, one of the cofounders of Elderwood Academy. We've always been passionate about fantasy tabletop gaming, and when we first saw augmented reality in action our hearts stopped. Elder Labs' mission is to use the awesome promise of augmented reality to bring tabletop RPGs to life. If you ever want to reach out and say \"hello\" or an awkwardly friendly \"HELLO!\" please hit us up at info@AugmentedDungeons.com.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny Kickstarter, big or small, is at its heart a labor of love, collaboration, and madness. We're no different from any other creators in that regard; we depend on your help and shared love to bring something new to life. There are universal challenges to all Kickstarters and Dan, via Elderwood Academy, has been integral in five successful campaigns.\n\nThe biggest challenges of this project are twofold. First, we need to build a product that is seamlessly fun to use while playing tabletop RPGs. While we love playing with the demo, we're certain there are extensive opportunities to make it more fun for everyone.\n\nSecond, we're basically trying to create an MMORPG's worth of digital assets from the ground up, to be optimized for iOS and Android and serve you the most attractive digital garden of animated monsters and heroes ever. We've lined up everything we need to get it done, but it's no mean feat, and half done will probably mean undone. To help insure against that, we've set the funding level high to cover the absolute costs we expect to incur over the next year.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Elder Labs\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nElder Labs was founded by Elderwood Academy co-founder Dan.

But your friends took a peek and now they all want to grow their own god. You\u2019ve got your trusty twelve-gauge handy to blast a tentacle here and there and make sure your creature grows to completion first. To do otherwise would be madness!\n  Building An Elder God is a fast-playing card game of Lovecraftian construction for 2-5 players ages 8 and up. The rules are easy to learn and a typical game takes from 15-30 minutes, depending on the number of players. Build a Cthulhu-esque tentacled monstrosity to completion before the other players, using damage cards to blast your opponents\u2019 creatures (and slow down their progress) in order to win! There are 115 standard cards in the set, plus 10 Necronomicon pieces. A full-color rulebook is included.\nGameplay: Draw a card, play a card. You either choose a tentacle card to grow or heal your own beast, or play a damage card to blast off the tentacle of an opponent's monster. The Necronomicon and Elder Sign pieces provide additional options to heal yourself or punish your foes!\nThe game is complete, and in fact sold through its first printing a few years ago! We're running this crowdfunding campaign to bring Building An Elder God back to gamer shelves and into stores while making a higher-quality product the second go-around.\nWhat's Changed? We are making sure the stock and coating will make the cards sturdy yet easy to handle and shuffle right out of the box. The Head and Body cards now have alternate sides so that everyone's monster can look unique at the table. The Necronomicon pieces are now punch-out cardstock rather than cards the players are expected to cut themselves. And we've done a light rewrite of the rules for clarity and are printing them in full color.\n  Building An Elder God got a shout-out as Best Kids Game of 2011 in episode #239 of The Dice Tower podcast by Chris of The Secret Cabal.

In addition I have run three Kickstarter campaigns in the past\u2014all funded, and all shipped out the primary rewards to backers. But I discovered how easy it can be to underestimate the time and expense necessary to deliver stretch goals and secondary rewards. It's important to avoid those pitfalls, so I'm implementing the following for this campaign:\n\nSimplicity: It's tempting to chase a high-dollar total by adding lots of stretch goals and extra rewards. Being a one-man company working with a talented-but-busy freelance artist, I'm going to keep the focus on the core game. We may add a few stretch goals but they will likely be digital rewards or improvements to the core product.\n\nTransparency: I'm separating the funds from this crowdfunding campaign in a separate account, and will create a backer-accessible spreadsheet that shows each expenditure and explains what the funds are being used for. This will remain live until all rewards have been shipped.\n\nThe only delays to delivery I can foresee would include unexpected hold-ups from the printer, overseas shipping, or delay in customs when the product enters the United States. We've built-in some time to help account for those and give us enough resources to get things shipped to our backers!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jamie Chambers\n5 created \u00b7 137 backed\nJamie Chambers is an award-winning, best-selling tabletop game designer with nearly two decades of publishing experience.

The Altered:Nozzle is the worlds most extreme water saving nozzle. It installs easily into your existing tap. By atomizing water we can use 98% less water and still retain full functionality. And if you need a little more, then you switch to our regular saving mode. Still 75% savings, but all the water you need.\nMist & Save Mode\nFits into your existing tap.  \nSuper easy installation. 30 sec.\nPays for itself in a couple of months! \nMultiple finishes and sizes.   \nLead Free Eco Brass\nPerfect for kitchen and bathroom taps everywhere. In your home, your boat, at the office, in your vacation home or wherever you have a tap and want to save water.  \nWater stress is a truly global issue affecting over one billion people today, and an estimated 3 billion in 2020. It is a problem we need to do something about. This is our small contribution to this huge issue.\nPLAY\n\nThe old solution for saving water has been to restrict the flow of water. But that only works up to a point. When you're left with only a drizzle, you need a shift in technology. We looked at the problem from another perspective. Instead of restricting water, we wanted to use as much of the water coming out of the tap as possible. The issue with regular taps is that you only use a fraction of the water coming out of your faucet. It bounces of the surface of your hands or plates. Or even worse, it just passes right by and straight down the drain.\nPLAY\n\nWhen atomizing the water we break it up into millions of tiny droplets. Creating a high speed, heavy mist, shooting out of your tap. This increases the surface area of the water drastically and makes it possible for you to come in contact with almost all of the water coming out of your tap. \nPLAY\n\nThe result was even more extreme than we thought. We could have full functionality in washing hands, greens, doing dishes, brushing teeth etc, with only 2% of the water compared to a standard saving tap!\nOne big issue. 2% is not so great when it takes 2 minutes to fill a glass of water. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed a switch to a more regular Saving Mode. You still save 75% compared to your old tap, but you get all the water you need. Perfect for filling glasses, pots and pans.\nPLAY\n\nBeing good to the environment should not have to mean being bad at design. The faucet is part of our interior design, something we spend a lot of money on. So if it doesn\u2019t look good sitting at the end of your tap, then it\u2019s just going to end up in some drawer. And there it won\u2019t do much good at all.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the design of the Altered:Nozzle. We wanted it to stand out and make a statement, but at the same time it needed to look as an integrated part on a variety of different faucets. Finally we ended up with this drop shape. It clearly makes a visual statement at the same time as it makes it easy to switch between Mist and Saver Mode. \nFirst of all we think you should feel great about having saved the planet a bunch of water. But lets talk specifics. Even compared to the lowest limit of the Water Sense US standard, the Altered:Nozzle saves you up to 98%. And except for saving water, that means less energy and emissions to heat and transport the water. That is great for planet Earth. But it is also great for you. For an average household in Europe this translates to savings of \u20ac203/year. In US that number is around $255/year. Basically, you\u2019ve just bought a great looking product that pays for itself within a couple of months.\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign we will contact you so you can choose the finish and size you like for your very own Altered:Nozzle.The Altered:Nozzle will be available in the finishes below.\nIf you think it is difficult measuring your existing aerator, you can easily determine the size with the help of a nickel and dime. First remove the insert and washer from the inside of the aerator. Set a nickel on top of the aerator, and if it\u2019s almost the same circumference, the aerator is a regular size. If it\u2019s not a regular size aerator, use a dime. The dime will fit inside a junior size aerator and will sit on top of a Tom Thumb size aerator. \nThe Altered:Nozzle fits into your existing tap and it takes less than 30 seconds to change it.\nPLAY\n\nApproximately 18% of the water used in our homes is water running through our taps. That is equivalent to 32 gallons per household per day. If we do the math and look at some of the most water stressed cities in the world, that means: 40 million gallons running through the taps in Los Angeles, 50 million gallons in Rio de Janeiro, 220 million in Tokyo and 240 million gallons in Shanghai. \nEvery Day.\nAnd most of it straight down the drain.\nThere are already millions of faucets in the world. That\u2019s why we've developed the Altered:Nozzle to easily install into your existing faucet in just 30 seconds. By altering your existing faucet, rather than buying a whole new one, we get the same effect at a fraction of the cost. It also means lots and lots more people can buy our product. And that in turn means we can save a lot more water which is kind of the point. Saving money. Saving resources. Saving water. Sounds good to us!\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since Kaj first got the idea of atomizing water in the faucet. We have a final product, produced by the final manufacturer and we have come out and met the market. It has really been a long road, but we are so excited to finally get the Altered:Nozzle out to you. We believe that water is a basic human right. We must find ways to get clean water to all people in the world. It is not enough just saving water. We must find ways of only using exactly what we need. That\u2019s what the Altered:Nozzle is about. We also think water stress is such a huge issue that we must find many small solutions in order to have a chance to solve the problem. It\u2019s not a single solution problem. This is our small solution. We hope you love it as much as we do.\nMikael, Kaj and Johan\nWe have a small core team of founders who are all experienced professionals in various fields. We also have partnerships with established contract manufacturers and parts producers, both locally in Sweden and abroad. \n\nProf. Kaj Mickos \u2013 Inventor & Head of R&D Prof. in Innovation Technique. Has worked as a professional inventor for numerous years resulting in 14 companies and more than 30 individual patents.

We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, and have now just finished up production on Mythica 4 and 5, thanks to the generous backing of our community of fans.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes, Mythica 2: The Darkspore and Mythica 3: The Necromancer have been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers. Mythica 4: The Iron Crown digital rewards have been delivered, and physical rewards are currently being manufactured.\nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 5: The Godslayer - the final, and definitely the most epic Mythica film yet!\nYou can learn more about Mythica at: http://www.MythicaMovie.com\nOr join the Mythica fan group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/531601233681817/\nIf you missed the first four Mythica films and want to get them right away, you can order digital downloads here:\nhttp://watch.arrowstormentertainment.com/\nYou can order Blurays and DVDs here:\nhttps://mythica4.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Godslayer\nAs the Lich King's zombie legions ravage the world, a cursed young sorceress (Marek) embarks on a quest to obtain a weapon from the gods, with her friend Dagen, a self-serving half-elf rogue. But when she joins her sworn enemy in a desperate attempt to save the world, she must recover the good in herself before her friends are all dead, and defeat the Lich King before the gods are destroyed and the world forever enslaved.\nWatch the trailers for the first four Mythica films below!\n          Melanie Stone plays Marek, an escaped slave and natural-born necromancer. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, Riot, and Miracle Maker.\nKristian Nairn plays Tek, God of the Forge. Kristian is from Northern Ireland, and is a real-life giant, standing 6'11\" tall. He is a world-renowned DJ and actor, best known for his role as Hodor in Game of Thrones.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his long-awaited appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew's voice. He is also Dungeon Master supreme over at Critical Role, and just DM'd for no less than Vin Diesel. Not too shabby.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known to his scifi and fantasy fans for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars, Once I was a Beehive and Dudes and Dragons.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nNicola Posener plays Teela, a priestess of the Order of Ana-Sett. Arrowstorm fans will recognize her from her starring role in Dawn of the Dragonslayer, while she has also starred in several British films and TV series. You can see her in the upcoming TV series, Age of the Living Dead.\nThe film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all under way. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, lots of magic, giant CGI sets, armies, etc. We want this finale of Mythica to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\nYou may have noticed, we really stepped up the VFX game in Mythica 4, all because of your contributions. We want to really take it to the next level now, and are confident we can blow you away if you give us a chance.\nBackers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $85,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $85,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better! PLUS, our films release at all different times around the world. Our Kickstarter backers usually get to see the finished product months ahead of the general public.\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution. We love fantasy and science fiction and know there are others out there like us, who we aim to please.\nWe've done several films on Kickstarter in the past - including The Crown and the Dragon, Osombie, The Shadow Cabal, Orc Wars, Survivor, The Christmas Dragon and Mythica 1 - 4, and most of our supporters keep coming back, which means we're doing something right :)\nClick on a name to see our IMDB profiles:\nJason Faller - Writer/Executive Producer\nKynan Griffin - Writer/Executive Producer\nJohn Lyde - Director\nJennifer Griffin - Producer\nYou can learn more about our film-making philosophy and purchase our past projects on our website:\nwww.arrowstormentertainment.com\n$110,000 - MYTHICA BOARDGAME\nIf we reach $110,000 you will unlock the creation of an awesome Mythica boardgame, that will be available as an add-on in Backerkit.\n$400,000 - MYTHICA PREQUEL\nThis is an ambitious one, but let's all dream a bit. If we reach $400,000 in pledges, we will make a Mythica Prequel, featuring backstory's of your favorite characters. How did Marek meet Gojun? What was Dagen up to before he was an adventurer? What were Teela and Caeryn up to? Hammerhead? Gojun? Thane?

As Luna, you\u2019ll solve devious puzzles and battle monsters with your arsenal of mystical potions. With a little help from your grandmother (a powerful witch in her own right), you\u2019ll explore enchanted lands inspired by your favorite fairy tales \u2013 often with an unexpected twist!\nAs powerful as your potions are, you\u2019ll find yourself up against monsters that can shrug off your most powerful attacks. You\u2019ll have to think on your feet and act quickly to sidestep danger. Manage your resources carefully, or you may find yourself with an empty satchel when you need your elixirs most. \nEver wonder what happened after Miss Muffet was frightened off her tuffet?\n\"Put the kettle to the meddle.\"\nConflict resolution that goes beyond pure combat\u2014calm, charm, tame and scare your enemies\nStrategic combat\u2014use potions, the environment, and even other monsters to defeat your enemies\nQuirky storyline featuring rich characters from folklore around the world \u2013 all with a unique spin\nCrafting system that rewards experimentation\nCountless environments to adventure and search for rare ingredients\nResource management, with a vast number of potions and ingredients\nLuna\u2014Your resident witch-in-training and strong, female lead\nBeautiful, illustrated art style reminiscent of your favorite storybooks and animated tales\n\"Potions: A Curious Tale is a wonderfully charming visual delight that promises a tongue-in-cheek storyline and lovely characters.

Fun!\"\nCombat is fast-paced, non-linear, and highly customizable. Set your own play style with the potions you use and the way you choose to face threats. Go full-throttle with an arsenal of deadly potions that burn enemies to ashes, or drop a confetti bomb and escape before they can blink. \nPotions\u2019 effects can work together, allowing for powerful combinations of different attacks. They can also trigger helpful and deadly reactions in the environment. \nTiming is key, any pause taken in battle to throw one of your potions leaves you vulnerable as your enemies barrel down upon you. You\u2019ll have to time attacks just right to take down tougher enemies. All potions are friendly-fire, so be careful where you point that incendiary vial! \nSome creatures will even need to be coaxed by other methods to share their goods. You must think carefully about which monsters to engage with and which to avoid or trick. Sometimes, using your enemies against each other is the most efficient solution. \nGet too carried away fighting and you\u2019ll use up your precious potions and have to re-arm before your next adventure. \n\"Every problem... has a solution.\"\nOn Luna\u2019s path to master potion brewing, she must gather rare ingredients to craft new potions. While her grandmother will teach her some potion recipes, most recipes must be discovered through experimentation with ingredients. \nEach ingredient has descriptive text that hints towards its potential use. These descriptions, along with additional hints from characters in the game, can lead Luna to craft undiscovered recipes. \nLuckily, Luna also learns from her failures. So, while an unsuccessful experiment may ruin her ingredients, it also provides her insight that will lead to the discovery of new recipes as her skills grow.\nIf she\u2019s just refilling her potion satchel, Luna can use her trusty recipe book, where she records all of her previous concoctions. \nLuna must manage her potion supplies by avoiding unwanted trouble and exploring to find ingredients for recipes, or go out and hunt exotic monsters to gather rare ingredients for experimentation! \nEnchanted creatures, large and small, dwell in the forests, caves and mountains around Old Haven. Some are harmless or even benevolent. Others are licking their chops at the prospect of having a lovely young witch for supper.\nEach creature in the Deep Dark Forest has its own strengths and weaknesses. While your potions of flame may burn spiders to ash, they\u2019ll have little impact on the lava-loving salamander. Think of each creature you encounter as a tiny puzzle, with abilities, vulnerabilities, and behaviors you can exploit to your strategic advantage (and monetary gain).\nAlthough many monsters hold the ingredients you need to brew more powerful potions, most will be reluctant to part with them. Some may be persuaded by force, others by charm, still others by guile. It\u2019s up to you to brave the wilderness while using tricks, cunning, and an arsenal of arcane connections to win the components you\u2019ll need to become a potions master.\nA good witch chooses her battles wisely! Remember, not every creature needs to be defeated, and picking the wrong fight may be the difference between being the cook and being the meal.\n\"Go stir crazy!\"\nNot only will your wits and potions help you with the monsters you encounter on your adventures, they will also be key to solving the countless puzzles strewn across the lands. Some obstacles will need a special potion to pass, while others will require creative problem solving to unlock their secrets! \nHidden items are scattered all over this mystical land, so don\u2019t be surprised if any rock or thicket conceals a hidden artifact or ancient potion recipe forgotten over the ages. Even your talks with characters can unveil important pearls of wisdom. \nLuna lives in a world inspired by fairy tales and folklore from around the globe, from African folklore to Western nursery rhymes. Luna's wit and intellect help her overcome challenges posed by these enchanted lands. However, in her quest to become a Potions Master, she also learns important coming-of-age lessons in the tongue-in-cheek story line. Respect is earned, advice can be deceiving, and adults aren't always right. \nLuna never quite fit in with her peers as she was always off exploring and experimenting. When one of her experiments explodes spectacularly, Luna learns that she has an aptitude for brewing magical potions. Unable to train Luna herself and desiring to keep the young girl out of further trouble, Luna\u2019s mother sends her to live with her grandmother to learn potion crafting. \nGranny lives in a small village to the north on the edge of the Deep Dark Forest. Her little town, Old Haven, is the last stop for adventurers on their way to find fame, fortune, and glory in the enchanted lands beyond. A respected Potions Master, Granny has more than enough business selling potions and remedies to the townsfolk and travelers. However, with her advanced age, she is happy to take on an apprentice who can venture into the enchanted forests, mountains, deltas, and grasslands on her behalf. \nWhether it\u2019s helping Mary Muffet with a spider problem or assisting the monk, Tripitaka, and his unlikely crew of disciples on their pilgrimage, Luna finds a way to lend a hand with her cunning wit and, of course, her potions. \nFull Release \nThe full release will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux via direct download (DRM-free) and Steam.\nAlpha/Beta Access \nAccess to the alpha and beta will be granted on Steam for Windows initially, with Mac to follow.

No, it isn\u2019t a deep strategic challenge, but it does present players with numerous choices and forces them to adjust their plans as the game progresses. But much more important than that, the game is simply fun to play\u2026and you get to play the bad guy!\"\nUltimate Scheme is @FailroadExpress's Kickstarter Game of the Month for May!\nOwen K.C. Stephens says: \u201cI thoroughly enjoyed Ultimate Scheme when I had the pleasure of crushing Rich Baker in a game session. As a result of the X Factor, it has HUGE replay value, creating new opportunities to try different strategies with every game session. If the idea of using complex plots, ninja agents, the global coffee supply, and schemes requiring Unobtainium sounds like fun way to conquer there world, this boardgame is for you! Five of five stars. Would scheme again.\u201d\nRob Schwalb says: \"I had the opportunity to play Ultimate Scheme with Rich Baker at AcadeCon and I had a great time! Everyone at the table picked up the game quick and by the end we could see the intricacies of the design and how it facilitated a variety of win strategies. This is a fantastic game and I can\u2019t wait to add a copy to my library. Highly recommended!\"\nJennifer Clarke-Wilkes says: \"Power corrupts, but absolute power is for the experts. This is a fun and eminently replayable game of plots and counter plots.\"\n\"I had more fun than I thought I would!\" - Russ at Gamerati Game Day.\nHere's part 1 of a play-through video featuring the Dead Gentlemen's Nathan Rice and Steve Wolbrecht (part 2 and part 3 are also available on YouTube):\nMore to Come!\nUltimate Scheme works for 2 to 4 players, and takes about an hour to play on average - slightly more than an hour with four players, and a bit less than an hour with just two. In the video above, Rich provides an introduction to the game and a walkthrough of the turn order. The card types are listed below, and we have a detailed breakdown of the rules components on our website.\nSetup\nIn Ultimate Scheme, you play as one of the 10+ Factions of the game, such as Gigaton Industries or W.R.A.I.T.H. You also draw one Ultimate Scheme, which might be something like Found an Evil Coffee Empire, Start a Land War in Asia, or Ruin Christmas.\nYou begin play with two minions, placed in the starting location indicated on the Faction card. You'll also draw three Scheme cards and an Action Card.\nTurn Order\nEach turn is broken up into five steps. Starting with the First Player, all players complete the first step, then all players complete the second step, and so on. After all steps have been completed, the player to the left of the first player becomes the new First Player for the next round.\nDraw Step. Each player draws one criminal, subversion, or genius scheme from his or her choice of one of the three Scheme decks.\nMove Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and moves the minion to an adjacent location. After all players have moved one minion, they each take a second move in turn order. During this phase, a player might end up moving one minion twice, or two minions once. A player can always elect to not move a minion.\nResource Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and gains resources from that minion's location.. After all players have collected resources once, they collect a second time, in turn order. Resources cannot be gained from a location more than once per round, regardless of whether the location was depleted by an ally or enemy minion.\nExecute Step. Each player can execute a Scheme, provided the player has the appropriate resources to spend and has a minion in the Scheme's location. There is no limit to the number of schemes a player can complete in a given turn, provided that the resource and location requirements are met.\nEnd Step. If Victory has not been achieved, any minions in hidden locations return to their home cities. The First Player changes, and play continues in the next round.\nHere's a closer look at the primary game elements::\nA Faction Card. Each Faction has its own start location and a special ability. Professor Roboto here starts with additional schemes, and gains more Science every turn.\nAn Ultimate Scheme. Each Ultimate Scheme has its own unique victory condition.\nA close up of three locations. New York provides two Finance Resources, while San Francisco provides one Science and an Action Card. Area 51 is a Hidden Site (you must first get access to the site), and grants Science plus Action and Scheme cards.\nAn Action card. Each action card specifies the effect and indicates when you can play it.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s even better than pulling off scores of nefarious plots and capers? Pulling off dozens more, of course! Plan Number B is an expansion to the Ultimate Scheme game that provides you with more factions, more schemes, more action cards, and more mayhem in general. \nPlan Number B begins as a set of 40 new cards, introducing the Interpol Agent to the mix and up to 4 new factions for the Ultimate Scheme game, but here's the best part - Plan Number B gets bigger and better as we hit our stretch goals. What's on the table for Plan Number B stretch goals?  \nInterpol Agent: A new game element that lets you use the forces of law and order as your unwitting pawns to obstruct your rival's plans.\nThe Event Deck: a set of cards that puts a new twist on each round of the game.\nMore Schemes: a new category of nefarious schemes you can undertake.\nSingle Player Mode: for when you want to play with yourself.\nMore Factions, Locations, Ultimate Schemes, Madness, and Mayhem!\nTo add Plan Number B to your Ultimate Scheme reward, select the DELUXE ULTIMATE SCHEME reward, or any of the rewards above $65. Depending on manufacturing time frame, the expansion may be shipped separately after the basic game is delivered.\n\nIf we surpass our initial goal, we'll be able to increase the value of the reward levels by adding more content to the Plan Number B expansion.\n\nAt 250 backers at the EXPANDED and DELUXE levels combined, we'll add the Event Deck to Plan Number B!\nAt $20,000 raised, we'll include cards for single player mode in Plan Number B, and make a digital version of the single player mode available online for download.\n\nWe'll unlock more stuff as we hit our stretch goals!\n\nWe have no other add-ons planned for Ultimate Scheme beyond what is offered in the reward tiers. We want to keep fulfillment simple and straight-forward, so that we can quickly get the game printed and shipped out to all of our backers. That said, if there's something special you want, or if you want to combine reward levels, let us know in the Comments thread or feel free to message us privately and let us know what you're looking for, and we'll see what we can do!\nShipping rates are calculated based on your country when you select your reward tier, and is not reflected in the base reward pledges.\nWe are partnering with Ship Naked to provide delivery to backers. We had a positive experience with them in shipping our previous Kickstarter project, Primeval Thule 5e, and we think they'll be more than ready to handle our Ultimate Scheme. They'll ship all over the world! \nWe are using Ship Naked's Customs-Friendly Worldwide shipping option, which means that not only is the shipping cost a little lower for us, shipments will be EU-, Canada-, UK-, Aussie-, NZ-, and US-Friendly. \n Ultimate Scheme has been in the works for quite some time. We first brought a version of the game to the First Exposure Playtest Hall at Gen Con 2014, and have been testing and refining the game ever since. At Gen Con in 2015, we provided demos in our booth and continued to get feedback and reactions from fans. We've been to local groups like Gamerati to show off the game and get even more feedback.\nSasquatch Game Studio is a small game publishing company formed by three longtime game industry professionals. We initially came together to produce the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting for multiple RPG platforms, and also produced Princes of the Apocalypse, a big adventure for 5th edition D&D. We are all Wizards of the Coast veterans, and we have longstanding relationships with some of the top talent in the biz. For Ultimate Scheme, we brought in two excellent artists: Lee Moyer to help us nail down the game board and design elements, and Claudio Pozas to provide our card illustrations.\nRichard Baker is a best-selling author and award-winning game designer. In addition to extensive RPG design credits, he\u2019s worked on several boardgames and miniature games of note, including the Origins award-winning Conquest of Nerath and Axis and Allies Miniatures game. He also contributed extensively to Risk Godstorm and Axis and Allies Revised.\nDavid Noonan has more than 50 RPG products among his credits, and has written extensively for video games, including Motiga's upcoming Gigantic team action game for Windows 10 and Xbox One.\nStephen Schubert is an award-winning game designer/developer mostly known for his extensive work for D&D and the D&D Miniatures Game.\nLee Moyer has worked as an illustrator on numerous games\u2014RPGs, computer games, CCGs, and more. He collaborated with Keith Baker on The Doom that Came to Atlantic City, published by Cryptozoic Entertainment, and served as the art director (and lead illustrator) for the 13th Age Roleplaying Game.\nLast but not least, Claudio Pozas contributed to Fantasy Flight\u2019s Star Wars and Lord of the Rings LCGs, the Dungeon Crawler ECG by Gifted Vision, and the Ennie Award-winning Counter Collection series by Fiery Dragon, as well as numerous RPGs.\n\"Hitman\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second campaign for the Ultimate Scheme game. After the first attempt failed to fund, we reviewed our campaign from top to bottom to figure out how we can reach success. We took in feedback and created a (hopefully) more engaging cover design, and shot a new pitch video with better production values. \n\nWe also looked for a manufacturer that could work in smaller quantities, so that we won't incur as big of an expense to create more product than we might need. We simplified the components, replacing the more expensive wooden resource cubes with punch-out sheets, which also allows us to create art more representative of the game's resources. Overall, we reduced the cost of the game, and by reducing weight and box size, we've reduced the expected shipping costs as well. \n\nAs a result, we can offer the game at a lower price point, passing our savings on to our backers. In addition, the smaller quantities means a smaller funding threshold, which means that the project success is even more likely.\n\nWe've run two successful Kickstarter campaigns, both for RPG products. Ultimate Scheme is our first board game Kickstarter project, and we've made an effort to anticipate the additional work this project requires to follow it through manufacturing and shipping. We will keep backers apprised of our manufacturing and shipping timelines.\n\nPlan Number B will require some design and playtesting as we extend the expansion through additional stretch goals. We anticipate having the expansion ready to deliver at the same time as the core game.

Rather than give them rules to live by, KAZOO gives girls, ages 5 to 10, tools to create, build, explore, dream, play and ask questions.\nKAZOO will be published quarterly and feature sections on art, nature, science, tinkering and tech, cooking, travel, sports, emotions, citizenship, and critical thinking. Regular features will include: science experiments; comics; art projects; recipes; interviews with inspiring women from athletes to astronauts; and fun activities, including secret codes, jokes, mazes, search-and-finds and more.\nEvery story in each issue will be either developed or inspired by top female artists, explorers, scientists, chefs, athletes, activists, writers and others. Here are just a few of the inspiring women, who have already confirmed their participation in the first issue: \n\u2022MacArthur Genius Alison Bechdel, author of Fun Home is creating a full-page tutorial called, \u201cHow to Draw a Cat.\u201d (It\u2019s the first original, full-length comic she\u2019s published in a year.) \n\u2022New York Times best-seller Lucy Knisley, author of Relish, is creating an original 4-page comic on Elizabeth Robinson, the first American woman to win an Olympic gold in track.\n\u2022Artist Mickalene Thomas, who has shown her work at The Guggenheim, The Whitney, The National Portrait Gallery and MOMA, is adapting one of her portraits into a color-and-glitter-by-number project.\n\u2022James Beard nominated chef Fany Gerson, owner of La Newyorkina and author of My Sweet Mexico is developing recipes for paletas, or Mexican ice pops.\n\u2022Caldecott Honor winner Doreen Cronin, author of Click, Clack, Moo and Bloom, is debuting an original, 4-page short story, featuring a strong girl protagonist.\nGerson's La Newyorkina and Cronin's Bloom\n\u2022National Book Award winner Jacqueline Woodson, author of Brown Girl Dreaming is rounding up her must-read books for girls.\n\u2022Cosmochemist, Fulbright Scholar and Guggenheim fellow Meenakshi Wadhwa, Ph.D., Director of the Center for Meteorite Studies at Arizona State University is contributing to a story on the Perseid Meteor Shower.\nWoodson's Brown Girl Dreaming and Dr. Wadwha with a meteorite\nThe video above was created by Courtney and Peter Hutchens, the amazing filmmaking duo behind Back East Media.  \nWhen girls are young, they not afraid to ask for what they want. They\u2019re not shy about taking up space or making noise. They own their bodies and are proud of what they can do, how fast they can run and high they can climb. They ask questions (and, as any parent knows, sometimes endlessly). And yet, by adolescence, too many begin to question their own voice. The fallout is real. Take a look:\n\u2022Six in ten girls stop doing what they love, because they feel bad about their looks. And by age 11, 30 percent of them have already put themselves on a diet.\n\u2022Seventy five percent of girls are interested in engineering and related fields, and yet only 11 percent of practicing engineers are women.\n\u2022Young girls earn higher grades than boys in science, yet feel less confident in their abilities.\n\u2022By adolescence, girls are less likely than boys to act, and feel, like a leader.\n\u2022Adolescent girls are nearly three times as likely to have suffered from depression in the past year, compared to boys. \nBy celebrating girls for all that they are\u2014smart, inquisitive, creative, brave, strong and, yes, loud\u2014KAZOO will help shore up their foundation, so that by the time they enter adolescence, they\u2019ll be more likely to question anyone who makes them feel small than they\u2019ll be to question themselves.\nOne more point, here: Girls and women are completely underrepresented in our culture. Look at Congress (80% men); the modern art section of the MET (95% men); the engineering profession (89% men); Oscar-nominated cinematographers (100% men); even children\u2019s books, where boy characters are 3 times more likely than girl characters to appear. \nWhen you\u2019re excluded from the political process, museums, professions, awards, even your own bedtime stories, there is a consequence. The less girls see themselves in positions of power, the less likely they\u2019ll be to believe they can achieve such power. KAZOO is the antidote to this invisibility. It will feature some of the most powerful and inspirational women in their fields, thus giving girls a more well-rounded sense of the world and the possibilities within it. \nMy dream is to get KAZOO into every little girl's hands, so she can not only read, laugh and learn, but also see the world from a new perspective, one where she is celebrated for being true to herself. Making that happen will take time and money. If you help fund this project, it means I could: \n\u2022Pay for printing and postage, the biggest expense\n\u2022Hire an ace designer to help make every page spectacular \n\u2022Hire illustrators and photographers to help bring the stories to life \n\u2022Hire a copyeditor to save me from mortal embarrassment\n\u2022Dedicate more of my time to create a truly awesome magazine (and less to freelancing full-time for other magazines)\nOf course, with every dollar you donate, you'll earn some serious feel-good vibes from knowing you could potentially be changing a girl's life. And if that doesn't convince you to back this project, here are a few other perks:\nThe sticker, hoodie, T-shirt, onesie and tote.\nOn Twitter and Facebook, lots of great people are getting behind KAZOO. Some highlights as of April 2nd.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven the increased competition from digital media (and the rise in postage fees), the landscape for print magazines may seem a little bleak right now. But there's one area of exception: kids' print media. Children\u2019s book sales, for instance, increased 13 percent last year. That\u2019s because kids still enjoy, and indeed crave, turning real pages, and they still get a thrill to see personally addressed mail waiting for them in their mailboxes. \n\nAs parents, too, we want our children to spend less time staring at screens and more time reading, thinking and tapping into their imagination. A printed magazine, which your child can actually hold in her hands and leaf through at her own pace, is the perfect antidote to an otherwise frenzied media culture.

Led by a merciless witch doctor, an army of sinister creatures and terrifying beasts plot to awaken a long-forgotten terror. Should they succeed, the lives and homes of countless swamp-dwelling tribes will face a fate worse than death. As the inhabitants of Widower\u2019s Wood find themselves trapped in the grim maw of ghoulish horrors, their last hope is a team of ravenous monsters with the cunning and ferocity to bite back.\nWhere heroes fear to tread, only monsters can save the day!\nJoin this daunting band and venture into Widower\u2019s Wood in this fully cooperative adventure board game for 2\u20134 players. The harrowing wilds of the swamp are filled with dire perils and dreadful villains, and it will require teamwork and the unique strengths of your adventurers to prevail. If you\u2019re smart enough, tough enough, and courageous enough to face the greatest horrors of the Iron Kingdoms, you might just be monster enough to survive.\nWidower\u2019s Wood is the latest in the expandable Iron Kingdoms Adventure Board Game series, designed by William \u201cOz\u201d Schoonover and produced by Privateer Press. Inside Widower\u2019s Wood, you will find dozens of miniatures created by the award-winning sculptors of Privateer Press, creators of WARMACHINE and HORDES,  and a character-driven narrative campaign that unfolds over the course of seven detailed scenarios, each of which can be replayed again and again for a different experience every time. The story takes place on a richly designed board with tiles that change from scenario-to-scenario, all accompanied by hundreds of tokens and cards for tracking the progress of your heroes. Powerful game mechanics ensure that the enemies always present new and exciting challenges for the players for a tremendously re-playable game experience. \nTogether, the players comprise a band of daring monstrosities working together to defeat their enemies, achieve tactical objectives, and become more powerful over the course of the expansive, persistent campaign.\nEach character has a unique sheet of statistics but as the campaign progresses you will spend experience points on feats and ability cards allowing you to customize and enhance your adventurer.\nChoose your monster\u2026\nFor illustrative purposes only.

When comparing the Widower\u2019s Wood rules to those of The Undercity, the most notable difference will be found in the map details. The Undercity takes place in the dark tunnels beneath the city of Corvis while Widower\u2019s Wood\u2019s seven chapters explore a swampy forest. Instead of walls and gates, players must navigate through clumps of trees, pools of water, and around piles of fallen ruins. In addition, there is a new villain tactic in Widower\u2019s Wood that allows the enemy leaders to goad their underlings into attacking the heroes, as well as new rules for magic attacks.\nGerman Language Edition\nWe are pleased to announce that a German-language edition of the Widower's Wood rules will be available when the game launches, courtesy our partners Ulisses Spiele.

And if you are already a fan of The Undercity or plan to check it out in the future, the Dead Men Walking expansion, included in the Deluxe Edition and Premium Collector\u2019s Edition reward levels, contains scenarios for use in both The Undercity and Widower\u2019s Wood, maximizing the overall playability of your rewards.\nWhether you paint your miniatures or not, Widower\u2019s Wood is also a tremendous resource for players of Iron Kingdoms Full Metal Fantasy or Unleashed. The figures contained within the game are perfect for use as villains or NPCs in any roleplaying game set in the wilds of western Immoren. Used alongside the game board and tiles, you can create compelling and immersive environments for your RPG sessions!\nWidower's Wood figures make great additions to your Iron Kingdoms Unleashed Roleplaying Game sessions!\nPrivateer Press RPG Producer, Matt Goetz, has written some advice on how to integrate your Widower's Wood miniatures with Iron Kingdoms Unleashed! \nShipping costs will be collected from our backers through the BackerKit pledge manager after the campaign ends. This option allows us to charge the most accurate shipping costs and to avoid overcharging our backers during the campaign, ensuring we have enough funds to cover changes in postal rates or in our estimated weight of the game contents. Backer rewards will ship from our shipping hubs in the UK, EU, and Australia. Our estimated shipping costs are below but may increase or decrease depending on the number of stretch goals that are unlocked as well as changes in postal rates, especially for international customers.

While Privateer is well known as a publisher and manufacturer of miniatures games, our board games\u2014which we are just as passionate about\u2014have not reached as wide an audience as we believe would appreciate them. So, after much consideration and discussion, we concluded that Kickstarter presents the opportunity for us to raise awareness of the board games we make and hopefully get them into more hands than we have been able to through traditional marketing. Plus, it gives us a chance to give our gamers what they want: tons of extra miniatures, extra scenarios, extra tiles, extra everything! \nBy being able to accurately gauge our audience\u2019s interest in a project, we can pack our board games with everything they want without the risk associated with publishing through traditional methods. It also lets us explore things like the Premium Collector\u2019s Edition box for Widower\u2019s Wood. These kinds of items are difficult to adequately determine market demand for in advance, but with Kickstarter, we can order exactly what we need to fulfill everyone\u2019s wishes. While we have no intentions or plans to use Kickstarter for our miniatures wargames, our drive to create new games and load them with extra content is something we can\u2019t contain, and we are excited for the opportunity to use Kickstarter as a platform to bring this project to life.

Right now, Widower\u2019s Wood and the vast majority of its components are already written, edited, designed, illustrated, and modeled.

The most pressing challenge with this sort of project is ultimately one that is out of our hands: overseas manufacturing delays.\n \nWhile we have extreme confidence in our overseas partners after working with them for years, it is always possible that machines can malfunction, weather can delay shipping, or freight containers can be held up by customs.

A software solution that has the potential to save thousands of reams of paper from being used by the entertainment industry and will save all of us TiMe.\nMORE LIFE. LESS PAPERWORK.\n*Startwork (Startwork Packet or Start Paperwork) | noun: A 15-30 page packet every crewmember fills out to join a new production. It contains forms from the payroll company, production company and the financier (normally a studio or network). \nTiM allows you to create an Electronic Profile that only you can access or modify. Using a proprietary process, TiM converts scans or digital versions of startwork into a file that your Electronic Profile \"talks\" to, eliminating the need for physical startwork packets.\nLet's start at the beginning...\nSETTING UP THE PRODUCTION\nA production is created within TiM by the UPM, Line Producer or Studio. \nThe production's startwork packet is uploaded, customized, and saved within TiM. \nCopyright CrewBridge Technologies\nProduction documents can also be uploaded into TiM, at any time, after the production has been created. \nJOINING THE PRODUCTION\nThe production invites you (or your department head) to TiM via text or email. A department head can invite new crewmembers to their department the same way.\nLog in and fill out your Electronic Profile, once.  This information is stored in TiM for all future productions and only you can access or edit it using your password protected login. \nYour digital startwork packet for this production is standing by and automatically populated using the information from your Electronic Profile.\nReview, sign, and submit. \nThat\u2019s it. \nYOUR PRODUCTION HOMEPAGE\nOnce your I-9 is approved within TiM you can be granted access to the all of the production\u2019s documents in one place.\nCheck it out!\nPRODUCTION HOMEPAGE\nBACK AT THE OFFICE\nYour accurate and complete digital startwork packet lands in the Payroll Accountant\u2019s \"Startwork Inbox.\" From here it is sent for approval signatures and easily tracked within TiM's \"Startwork Approval Pipeline.\"\n\"STARTWORK PIPELINE\"\nOnce approved, the Payroll Accountant sends a PDF to the studio and payroll company with one click.\nNo more sorting through piles of startwork or tracking down missing information!\nYOUR STARTWORK\nYour fully executed deal memo and start paperwork are saved within TiM and accessible to you at any time, for all past and current productions.\nIN SHORT: Enter your information once, forever. Period.\nAccess any productions you\u2019re working on, anywhere, on any device, at any time.\nElectronic Profile: your information will be securely stored in TiM and used to fill out your startwork packet for you. Choose what information is visible to the crew and modify your Electronic Profile at any time.\nMy Contacts: access and manage the contact information of people you work with across productions all stored within TiM. No more searching through paperwork for a crewmember's Emergency Contact information.\nProduction Homepage: your hub for all of the most recent production documents, announcements and information in ONE place: \n        - Call Sheet \n        - Schedules (One Liner, DOODs, etc) \n        - Other Production Docs (Script Revisions, Box Kit Rental Forms, etc) \n        - Daily Call Time, Crew Lunch, and Camera Wrap \n        - Digital Crew List and Department Specific Information \n        - Production and Payroll Company Information\nPermission Based Access: all documents in TiM can be set up with custom permissions;  you decide who sees what.\nInvite: invite new crewmembers to your Department or Production via email or text message. Save them as \"core crew\" or \"dayplayer\" and their contact information will be saved in TiM automatically. \nStartwork: Access your approved startwork packet (deal memos & rates) at any time for any past or current production.\nDigital Approval: Electronically sign and submit your startwork packet. No more missing information or missing signatures. \n FOR THE PAYROLL ACCOUNTANT:\nScan and upload paper startwork packets or digital forms into TiM and customize them for any production. Save templates to re-use for future productions.\nAssign accounting codes and rates to new crewmembers as they are invited to the production.\nStartwork Inbox: Completed startwork packets, with all required fields double-checked by TiM, can be easily reviewed and sent for higher up approval the moment they are submitted by the crewmember. \nStartwork Pipeline: Track startwork packets as they are approved within TiM. \nOne-Click-Send: Send a PDF of completed deal memos and payroll forms to the studio or payroll company for every crewmember directly from TiM. No more sorting and scanning. \nSecurity\nTiM is designed without the need for long-term storage of sensitive personal information (like social security numbers) and retains only info that is publicly accessible (like name, email, phone number, etc.). Documents will be stored in Amazon S3 using ServerSide (\"at rest\") encryption as well as an additional layer of encryption (using AES256 which is Government level security).\nI-9 documents (passport #s, driver license #s, etc.), won't be stored in TiM, as many studios/networks/production companies require a designated crewmember (like an AD or Best Boy/Key) to fill in the document information as he/she approves the I-9, not ahead of time. TiM doesn't change the I-9 process, it just makes it easier, faster and less prone to errors.\nHow much is your TiMe worth? \nBy eliminating the tedious process of filling out start paperwork TiM saves at least 15 minutes of productivity for each crewmember on a production. TiM will cost a production significantly less than the time savings it generates per onboard (with respect to the average hourly rate of crewmembers).\nTiM also empowers production staff, that are traditionally saddled with the time-consuming task of putting together hundreds of startwork packets, to focus on more important duties.\nIt saves a production thousands of pieces of paper, countless boxes of staples, several cartridges of printer toner, and a hefty amount of electricity.\nLastly, by virtually eliminating errors or omissions in startwork and facilitating a blazing fast approval process, Accounting, Production Managers and Producers will be able to spend a fraction of the time \"processing\" startwork.\nWhy the low price-point? We want using TiM to be a no-brainer (because it is!). An affordable price-point will help us roll TiM out to as many productions as possible. The more productions that use TiM, the better the onboarding process is for everyone. (Plus, we don't want to fill out startwork anymore either!)\nHigh value. Low cost. Greater good.\n\"I wish I didn't have to fill out all this paperwork!\"\n\"ugh hurry up with that app already... I think of you guys every time I fill out paperwork. The system is so broken!\"\n\"Yes for no more paperwork!\"\nOf the hundreds of crewmembers we've surveyed, 95.5% say they are unhappy with the current startwork process.\nHere's a glimpse of this process...\nSomewhere, right now, there is a heavy duty printer that's been running for hours. An office PA or Payroll Accountant is monotonously separating these mountains of printed paperwork and stapling 20-or-so-page packets one by one, for every single crewmember (200 packets? 500? 1000? Depends on the gig).  These startwork packets are then schlepped by the hundreds to set; lugged to each truck and passed off to each department in heaps so no one finds themselves short at the end of a long, grueling work day.\nDay 1 on set of a new production: We\u2019re already low on startwork\u2026 call the office\u2026 more printing, more stapling, another set run, lugging more stacks around and then tracking down that guy who\u2019s only with the production this one day.\nEnd of day 1: Lug these hundreds of crumpled, coffee stained, torn, often incomplete startwork packets back to the office.  The Payroll Accountant then reviews and sorts them one by one. A missing signature... send it back to set. Imagine doing this 1000 times.\nDay 2: Same thing.\nThank you to our Payroll Accountants for getting us paid all these years. We appreciate everything you do.\nEvery startwork packet asks for the same information (multiple times per packet): name, address, email, phone number, etc, yet no two are the same.  Why are we wasting all of this time and paper on every production?  We've spent the past ten months investigating this and the reasoning we've most commonly heard is, \"because this is how it\u2019s always been done.\u201d  \nWe firmly believe....\nA SOLUTION FOR THE CREW, BY THE CREW\n                               TiM isn't just software, it's a movement, and startwork is just the beginning. This is a chance to change an established process for the better\u2014to create a solution that benefits each of us, all of us, and therefore the production and the system as a whole. \nWe have a working prototype (thanks to our amazing CTO and developer, Carmine Guida), but it will take several resources to make TiM the seamless, streamlined solution we envision.\nTogether we can make TiM a reality.\nThese kickstarter funds will be used for:\nSoftware developers to build out TiM\u2019s database. \nPurchasing developer licenses for PDF importing and conversion.\nPurchasing licenses for clerical software like Quickbooks.  \nLegal advisement.\nTrademarking, copyrights and business registrations, etc. \nAmazon Web Services to ensure TiM is fast, reliable, scalable, and secure when supporting any number of users at a time. \nEmail and SMS services for instant notifications. \nWebsite and software development.\n LEARNING, BUILDING, WORKING, and CELEBRATING TOGETHER! \nJoin the movement!\nPlease know, when it comes to beta testing, receiving exclusive updates, and becoming a TiM Architect to help shape the features and future of TiM, your level of involvement is up to you.

Between the both of us we\u2019ve worked in film for about a decade and our distinct paths allow us to see film from the inside looking out and the outside looking in.\nOur partner, Carmine Guida, is the \u201cunicorn\u201d developer that anyone starting a tech company dreams of and hopes for. A vet in start-up tech land, an experienced businessman, and a skilled musician--he is the perfect compliment to two ADs who have personally struggled with the inefficiencies prevalent in the film production industry. His business savvy and communication skills are unparalleled, which is important when building something that, above all else, is meant to address the needs of the people it serves. We are very lucky to have him onboard.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA UNIQUE INDUSTRY\nNo two productions are alike and for any single production, the work force, locations, and obstacles change on a daily basis.

For the first time in history, the prevalence of Internet connected devices has made it possible to bring a truly mobile, technological solution to the filmed entertainment industry. Since we are creating tech to move an entire industry away from the paper processes that are so ingrained in its identity, the primary goal is to make sure TiM actually is easier than current practices; not just technology for technology\u2019s sake. We will accomplish this through extensive user testing and an ongoing dialogue with our fellow crewmembers.\n\nCOMPETITION\nWhere a market exists, so does competition.

Do you bring majesty, wealth, and power to the lands or are you a creature of legendary terror? \nExperience dragons in their proper role as the monstrous, complex, and epic protagonists that they are. In this open world action role-playing game you bring your dragon's story to life. As you hunt, eat, and age, your dragon develops. You improve and customize its wings, tail, claws, and breath weapon. Over the centuries, you develop your inner draconic magic and other latent abilities, claim territory, and impact the course of history. \nBecome a terrifying or benevolent dragon powerful enough to threaten city states and reshape kingdoms.\nWhen YOU are the dragon, it is up to you to decide if you want to be a destroyer of enemies.\n...or a protector of your city-state...\nYour influence is inevitable\nThe Gameplay\nDTG is a unique blend of action, exploration, freedom, and power. \nThe game as been described as Grand Theft Auto meets Skyrim.  A \"dragon simulator\" with role playing and city-building elements.\nGameplay is emergent. Whereas most games follow the story of a frail mortal aspiring to be great, DTG puts you directly into a flying, fire-breathing, awe-inspiring, customizable, extremely powerful dragon. \nA dragon surveys its lands. Improve your senses to unlock the minimap and other tools of the hunt.\nAs we all know, dragons do as they please. So immerse yourself in the lore and story of the world.  Fulfill quests, rescuing (or eating) princesses, collecting artifacts and wealth. Or, venture out into the world on your own, live off the land, uncover the lost history of dragons, explore the countryside, and leave your own claw-mark in this world.\nSearching for a snack.\nCompletely destructible cities and castles are planned for the full game. Some dragons have adapted to eat nearly anything from wooden beams to rooftop shingles.\nMany villagers are slow and weak, easy prey for an unscrupulous drake. But remember, your actions will create your reputation.\nFlames spread across the ground and ignites near-by grasses and trees. Frost breath causes fliers to freeze and drop from the sky. Acid dissolves your opponent and their gear. Your dragon's breath is a fierce and dynamic weapon.\nFly solo, or soar across the skies with your friends in co-op or PVP games.\nChoose your draconic heritage. Each color, or race, has its own specialty. Don't like the options? Create your own hybrid dragon.\nDragons occupy an enormous creative space and many games include dragons, or riding dragons, or hunting dragons, or being dragon-born, but none have set to the task of building the greatest \"draconic experience \" possible...Until now!\nThe five core draconic races\nImagine the possibilities.  How do villages and kingdoms react when you fly over-head? Do you seek to work with the races of humanoids or do you extort them? Do you build alliances with your draconic brothers and sisters or do you dominate, displace, or slay them? DTG allows you play through an unparalleled draconic experience in a sandbox fantasy universe.  The player guides his dragon through it's life: hunting, eating, and growing powerful over the centuries.  Becoming more powerful, you progress from day-to-day survival to a mighty beast whose presence is felt across the lands. Our goal is to create a story that engages, but does not dictate your experience: \nA dragon sleeps best near her hoard.\nThe lore provides direction but the real story of DTG is created by the player and it evolves organically, in response to the cities and characters you help and those you destroy.  During each play-through your choices as a dragon will shape the world, your actions affecting the centuries to come. Over time technology and magic will advance--the cities, enemies, and draconic rivals you meet will grow increasingly dangerous over the course of the game.\nTo survive and thrive you will need to eat, seek out a lair, and amass wealth; using food and treasure to purchase new body parts, customizations, and weapons, leveling up abilities, and upgrading your dragon's instinct and senses. Receive gifts or demand tribute from nearby kingdoms to accelerate your growth.  Exploration is key. The world is large and filled with gold, magic, and peril.  Every location contains a potential quest event...\nBurn down an infected forest before the blight can spread\nRespond to slavers demanding your surrender or dragon hunters seeking your hide\nDeliver supplies to impoverished village\nPatrolling your territory\nSlaying prides of griffins\nSurvive in an uncharted world\nOther draconic quests to come...\nDaming a river for a near-by village. A day of your dragon's labor is worth months of manpower. Gold and tribute will surely follow your good deeds.\nTornados, thunder storms, high winds, and other weather events present challenges and opportunities for airborne wyrms.\nThe Final Game\nWe've build a strong foundation for this game and poured our hearts, lives, and money into getting DTG to this point.  Your support will allows us to create an unmatched draconic experience for your PC, Mac, or Linux.  We plan expansion to XBOX One and PSN when possible.\nFull Customization: Choose your dragon's bloodline, body type, and anatomy. Choose its color, face, look, and abilities. Customize and upgrades your weapons and armor such as scales, breath weapon, bite, tail, and wings. Adorn its body with spikes, armor, scars.   Are you lean and fast, choosing razor sharp claws, with talons for extra reach and deadly bleeding? Or are you an armored behemoth, careening through the skies with arrow repelling dragonhide.  All combinations and possible.\n5 Core Draconic Races: We are working on 5 core dragon races that have unique abilities, starting areas, advantages, and disadvantages. Customize and empower your bloodline over the generations by passing on traits and achievements to your descendants by completing quests, leveling up, and choosing a mate.\nHunt and feast on tribute as you grow more powerful through the years. Hoard gold, claim a lair and expand your dominance throughout a dragon-sized sandbox fantasy world.  \nChoose who to help and who to eat. Choose which cities will benefit and thrive under your protection and which will burn...\nSingle and multi-player modes for all of your dragon co-op and PVP needs; work together in peace or find out who's the top dragon.\nUsers Mods - The creativity of our players will help this game become greater than we could imagine on our own. Integration with Steam Workshop is planned as well.\nSeveral possible conclusions; never-ending play.\nDeep RPG elements: From background traits, to titles, and rewarding statistics--you've never been able to make the dragon with so many options.  Become the dragon you've always imagined.\nIncredible soundtrack: We have four great songs so far, but our musician S.J. Tucker is working hard to give us a full soundtrack that greatly enhances and narrates your draconic experience.\nOur Challenge--How funds will be used\nRed Level Games has already built a great deal of the world of Dragon: The Game over the past 14 months. Our Early Access release last year on Steam brought in over 12,000 players!  Since then the vision and technology behind DTG has grown and we need our communities support to deliver this remarkable game.\nUnfortunately, we've disappointed some of our fans along the way and earned some negative reviews with progress that hasn't been as fast as they would like, or features that have been removed, tweaked, or temporarily broken along the way.  We hear them, and understand their complaints.  \nAs we have developed Dragon, it has grown us as a team and a studio to create this game. We also recognized the opportunity to upgrade to Unity 5 and \"swing for the fences\" with a much deeper game and more robust codebase. This has been a long but worthwhile path to follow. Now we're on the other side of the time-consuming pivot from a simple prototype released last November to the current multiplayer, 3d Unity 5 dragon experience.\nWhich is why we need your help.\nWe've solved many of our most complex technical hurdles and need your support to make this game incredible.  In addition to what RLG has already invested into this game, this Kickstarter will allow us to....\nThe first set of features, colored blue and stamped with our dragon logo, are slated for completion. We need your help to accelerate development! With your pledge, we can remain an independent studio and deliver a tremendous draconic experience.\nAccess to the game\nPledge today! Your donation of $15 dollars or more will get you access to the current version of Dragon: The Game via a Steam, Humble, or GOG digital download.  We'll send you your activation key ASAP upon reaching our KS goal so you can join the fun right away.  \nBACKER CHALLENGE\nDragon Supporters, We are offering a unique, custom-made piece of Dragon art from our artist Rob Carlos to the next three backers that donate at the $100 level or above.

In the time that Red Level Games undertook to complete Phase One of the creation of Dragon: The Game, we have already learned about many of the risks and challenges that await us here in the crucial Kickstarter funding phase of this games development.\n\nOne risk is that early players of our game are not able to envision the game as it will ultimately be. In allowing for players to become the dragon, it was necessary first to have a flyable dragon and a world in which that dragon could fly. As this was created and shown, the ultimate Role Playing style of the game was not immediately evident. Without that in mind, Dragon: The Game can feel like a simulator alone.\n\nAs we build out our world, populate it with both dragons and humans, and as players begin to create their own dragon narratives, this misunderstanding will dissipate. We anticipate an increasing desire from our community to have main and side quests to follow, more and bigger lairs to inhabit, and new ways in which their own dragon can become differentiated. Growing our community and getting this feedback is one of the most important aspects of this Kickstarter campaign, and it will allow this community to collectively build the universe of Dragon: The Game.\n\nIn addition to real-time progress towards the ultimate experience of Dragon: The Game, we will also develop many uniquely generated skins and enhanced visual creation. After building the world, we want to make it beautiful for our dragons, even if they eventually burn it to the ground! Our goals are ambitious, but with a successful campaign here, our artists and writers are ready to execute and deliver an immersive and innovative experience!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Changing of the Guard", "update_content": "Hi, everyone!\nAs we move into the new year, there are some changes underway.

We\u2019re partnering with a top-line game manufacturer to deliver an attractive game made with high-quality components. Your quest for world domination includes:\nGame Board: An attractive 21\" by 21\" mounted game board.\nPlayer Pieces: 25 minion tokens (meeples) and 25 control markers, in five colors for up to five players.\nResource Markers: 120 wooden cubes, 40 each for finance, occult, and science resources.\nUnobtanium: 12 acrylic crystal resource markers\nGame Cards: 136 poker-sized illustrated game cards, including:\n10 Factions\n10 Ultimate Schemes \n63 Scheme cards \n48 Action cards \n5 X-factor cards\nRulebook: Full-color rulebook.\nOther Stuff: The Ninja token, Anarchy marker, and first player token. Maybe a little factory lint.\nWe sat down with Will James of GeekDad - http://geekdad.com/2016/01/kickstarter-ultimate-scheme/\nMore to come!\nUltimate Scheme works for 2 to 5 players, and takes about an hour to play on average - slightly more than an hour with five players, and a bit less than an hour with just two. In the video above, Rich provides an introduction to the game and a walkthrough of the turn order. The card types are listed below, and we have a detailed breakdown of the rules components on our website.\nSetup\nIn Ultimate Scheme, you play as one of the 10+ Factions of the game, such as Gigaton Industries or W.R.A.I.T.H. You also draw one Ultimate Scheme, which might be something like Found an Evil Coffee Empire, Start a Land War in Asia, or Become a God.\nYou begin play with two minions, placed in the starting location indicated on the Faction card. You'll also draw two Scheme cards and an Action Card.\nTurn Order\nEach turn is broken up into five steps. Starting with the First Player, all players complete the first step, then all players complete the second step, and so on. After all steps have been completed, the player to the left of the first player becomes the new First Player for the next round.\nDraw Step. Each player draws one criminal, subversion, or genius scheme from his or her choice of one of the three Scheme decks.\nMove Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and moves the minion to an adjacent location. After all players have moved one minion, they each take a second move in turn order. During this phase, a player might end up moving one minion twice, or two minions once. A player can always elect to not move a minion.\nResource Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and gains resources from that minion's location, flipping the minion on its side to indicate that the location has been depleted for that turn. After all players have collected resources once, they collect a second time, in turn order. Resources cannot be gained from a depleted location, regardless of whether the location was depleted by an ally or enemy minion.\nExecute Step. Each player can execute a Scheme, provided the player has the appropriate resources to spend and has a minion in the Scheme's location. While players take turns executing schemes, there is no limit to the number of schemes a player can complete in a given turn, provided that the resource and location requirements are met.\nEnd Step. If Victory has not been achieved, then players reset their minions used to deplete resources, and any minions in hidden locations return to their home cities. The First Player changes, and play continues in the next round.\nA Faction Card. Each Faction has its own start location and a special ability. Professor Roboto here starts with additional schemes, and gains more Science every turn.\nAn Ultimate Scheme. Each Ultimate Scheme has its own unique victory condition.\nA close up of three locations. New York provides two Finance Resources, while San Francisco provides one Science and an Action Card. Area 51 is a Hidden Site (you must first get access to the site), and grants Science plus Action and Scheme cards.\nWhat\u2019s even better than pulling off scores of nefarious plots and capers? Pulling off dozens more, of course! Plan Number B is an expansion to the Ultimate Scheme game that provides you with more factions, more schemes, more action cards, and more mayhem in general.\nPlan Number B begins as a set of 40 new cards, introducing the Interpol Agent to the mix and up to 4 new factions for the Ultimate Scheme game, but here's the best part - Plan Number B gets bigger and better as we hit our stretch goals. What's on the table for Plan Number B?\nInterpol Agent: a new game element that lets you use the forces of law and order as your unwitting pawns to obstruct your rivals' plans.\nThe Event Deck: a set of cards that puts a new twist on each round of the game.\nMore Schemes: a new category of 23 nefarious schemes you can undertake.\nSingle Player Mode: for when you want to play with yourself.\nMore Factions, Locations, more Ultimate Schemes, more Madness and Mayhem!\nTo add Plan Number B to your Ultimate Scheme reward, select the DELUXE ULTIMATE SCHEME reward or any of the rewards above $80. Depending on manufacturing time frame, the expansion may be shipped separately after the basic game is delivered.\nIf we surpass our initial goal, we'll be able to increase the value of the reward levels by upgrading components and adding more content to the Plan Number B expansion (see below). Our first couple of stretch goals include:\nAt $35,000, we'll illustrate each of the faction cards with a handsome portrait of the Faction leader (these cards start off with simple graphic treatment). We'll also add two more Ultimate Schemes to the base game!\nAt $40,000, we'll add the Event Deck to Plan Number B. We'll also add two more Factions to the base game!\nAt 300 backers of Plan Number B, we'll add the single-player mode to the Deluxe game.\nAt $50,000, we'll replace the wooden resource cubes with specially designed resource tokens: gears for science, dollar signs for finance, and pentagrams for occult.\nWe'll unlock even more stuff as we hit our stretch goals!\nAt this time, we have no add-ons planned for Ultimate Scheme. That said, if there's something special you want, or if you want to combine reward levels, feel free to message us privately and let us know what you're looking for, and we'll see what we can do!\nWe are partnering with Ship Naked to provide delivery to backers. We had a positive experience with them in shipping our previous Kickstarter project, Primeval Thule 5e, and we think they'll be more than ready to handle our Ultimate Scheme. Ship Naked provides Customs-Friendly shipping to our overseas backers, and we'll work with them to provide an optimal experience for shipping overall.\nUltimate Scheme has been in the works for quite some time. We first brought a version of the game to the First Exposure Playtest Hall at Gen Con 2014, and have been testing and refining the game ever since. At Gen Con in 2015, we provided demos in our booth and continued to get feedback and reactions from fans. \nSasquatch Game Studio is a small game publishing company formed by three longtime game industry professionals. We initially came together to produce the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting for multiple RPG platforms, and also produced Princes of the Apocalypse, a big adventure for 5th edition D&D. We are all Wizards of the Coast veterans, and we have longstanding relationships with some of the top talent in the biz. For Ultimate Scheme, we brought in two excellent artists: Lee Moyer to help us nail down the game board and design elements, and Claudio Pozas to provide our card illustrations.\nRichard Baker is a best-selling author and award-winning game designer. In addition to extensive RPG design credits, he\u2019s worked on several boardgames and miniature games of note, including the Origins award-winning Conquest of Nerath and Axis and Allies Miniatures game. He also contributed extensively to Risk Godstorm and Axis and Allies Revised.\nDavid Noonan has more than 50 RPG products among his credits, and has written extensively for video games, most recently Motiga's upcoming Gigantic team action game for Windows 10 and Xbox One.\nStephen Schubert hasprovided extensive work for D&D, and also worked on the D&D Miniatures Game, and the short-lived Dreamblade competitive miniatures game.\nLee Moyer has worked as an illustrator on numerous games\u2014RPGs, computer games, CCGs, and more. He collaborated with Keith Baker on The Doom that Came to Atlantic City, published by Cryptozoic Entertainment, and served as the art director (and lead illustrator) for the 13th Age Roleplaying Game.\nLast but not least, Claudio Pozas contributed to Fantasy Flight\u2019s Star Wars and Lord of the Rings LCGs, the Dungeon Crawler ECG by Gifted Vision, and the Ennie Award-winning Counter Collection series by Fiery Dragon, as well as numerous RPGs.\n\"Hitman\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUltimate Scheme is nearly complete, and the remaining tasks of the core game are incorporating card art and rulebook layout. We foresee no challenges with this, and will press forward with completion once we know we are likely to successfully fund. \n\nPlan Number B, the expansion deck, will require some design and playtesting as we extend the deck through additional stretch goals. Some concepts, such as additional schemes or factions, are less complicated than other elements in the expansion, such as the Interpol Agent or the Single Player mode. We anticipate having the expansion ready to deliver at the same time as the core game. If it is not ready in time, we'll ship it separately after the core game. \n\nUltimate Scheme is our first board game Kickstarter project, and we've made an effort to anticipate the additional work this project requires to follow it through manufacturing and shipping.\n\nIn our previous Kickstarter efforts, we successfully worked with manufacturers in China and external shipping companies, and we are confident that we'll be able to work with a board game manufacturer to get this project completed. We are also confident that we can overcome any additional challenges that arise during the process.\n\nAs of the launch of this project, we are still involved in shipping the last of the stretch goal rewards to our Primeval Thule backers (still within the timeframe we expected when we launched that Kickstarter), but we do not anticipate any conflict in completing that process and running this Kickstarter campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sasquatch Game Studio LLC\n5 created \u00b7 12 backed\nSasquatch Game Studio LLC is devoted to delivering top-quality hobby game experiences.

We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, and have now just finished up production on Mythica 4 and 5, thanks to the generous backing of our community of fans.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes, Mythica 2: The Darkspore and Mythica 3: The Necromancer have been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers.\nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 4: The Iron Crown - the most epic Mythica film yet!\nYou can learn more about Mythica at: http://www.MythicaMovie.com\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Iron Crown\nWhen a team of unlikely heroes hijacks a steam-powered battle wagon, a daring young wizard (Marek) steals the final piece of the all-powerful Darkspore and embarks on a desperate quest to deliver the cursed artifact to the gods for safe keeping; but when they are caught in a death race between a ruthless team of elite mercenaries and a trinity of demons, Marek must learn to believe in herself before her friends are killed and the Darkspore is lost, to stop the evil necromancer (Szorlok) from uniting the Darkspore and flooding the living world with his legions of undead.\nWatch the trailers for the first three Mythica films below!\nMelanie Stone plays Marek, an escaped slave and natural-born necromancer. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, Riot, and Miracle Maker.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known to his scifi and fantasy fans for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his long-awaited appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew's voice. He is also Dungeon Master supreme over at Critical Role, and just DM'd for no less than Vin Diesel. Not too shabby.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars, Once I was a Beehive and Dudes and Dragons.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nThe film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all under way. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, lots of magic, giant CGI sets, zeppelins, etc. We want Mythica to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\nWe especially want to make the magic effects better in this film... if you use the trailer as a guide, you'll see examples of our efforts to improve the look of our magical effects.\nBackers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $75,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $75,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution. We love fantasy and science fiction and know there are others out there like us, who we aim to please.\nWe've done several films on Kickstarter in the past - including The Crown and the Dragon, Osombie, The Shadow Cabal, Orc Wars, Survivor, The Christmas Dragon and Mythica 1 - 3, and most of our supporters keep coming back, which means we're doing something right :)\nClick on a name to see our IMDB profiles:\nJason Faller - Writer/Executive Producer\nKynan Griffin - Writer/Executive Producer\nJohn Lyde - Director\nJennifer Griffin - Producer\nYou can learn more about our film-making philosophy and purchase our past projects on our website:\nwww.arrowstormentertainment.com\n STRETCH GOAL #1 - $85,000 \nA behind-the-scenes diary - with essays, Q&A's, and notes from the cast and crew of Mythica 4, with on-set photos from Andrew James, the set photographer. All backers will get a PDF copy sent to them. \nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - $95,000 \nA new Mythica song! We will commission another song to play in the end credits of the film, and we will send you ALL a digital copy of said song. \nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - $100,000 \nA Mythica short story, expanding the universe with whole new scenes and information that you haven't seen on screen. Maybe it's an adventure that Marek and Egan had before the start of Mythica, or maybe it's some Redthorn's adventure between Mythica 2 and 3... I don't know what it will be yet, as we have tons of material to work with... but Jason and I will write it personally -- even though we only really write screenplays, and this will be a new experience for us.

I'm Joel Hodgson. \nOnce upon a time, a television series called MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 was born. We debuted on Minneapolis' KTMA, local television, on Thanksgiving Day 1988, as the world was in the final throes of Teddy Ruxpin-mania. That was almost thirty years ago, but for some reason, people still seem to like the show \u2013 it\u2019s a mitzvah!\nOur show has had a long, strange run. Across a UHF channel, a cable network, cancellation, a feature film, then another cable network, the show lasted for 12 years, two generations of hosts and puppeteers, 2 Emmy nominations and a total of 197 episodes before we got canceled again for good in 1999. Sadly, it was just as Prince predicted.\nBut maybe that's not where it all ends.\nStarting today, we finally get a chance to bring back MST3K.\nWith your help, we can create a new season of MST3K, prove there's still an audience, and maybe even convince a network to bring us back for more.\nGreat question.\nThe simplest answer is that there are a lot of cheesy movies left to riff, and a lot of people who would still enjoy watching them with us.\nPlus, I think there's a place for us. Nowadays, riffing is everywhere! Many people claim that MST3K created a shift in the way people watch TV shows, and that now, as a result, the fields of entertainment have been plowed and readied for a riffing renaissance.\nI mean, look at the influence it\u2019s had... Everyone riffs on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Hell, there are ten to twelve people who are still, unironically, riffing on MySpace and Friendster.\nIn a world where riffing has become as common as our national pastime, baseball, it makes sense: like baseball, everyone knows how to play, but sometimes it feels good to just sit back and watch the original movie riffing team take a whack at it. And if we came back, imagine all the riffs we could make about things like Uber or Cards Against Humanity!\nAlso, there\u2019s a pile of scriptural evidence in whichever sacred text that you hold dear to prove that we need more seasons of MST3K\u2026 so when you share on social media, you know you\u2019re not going to offend anybody.\nYou know, I just read that last sentence... and actually, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re going to offend everybody. But at least you can rest assured that you\u2019ll offend everyone equally.\nWe do, and here's why: I think it's because MST3K is more than just movie riffing. It's a stranger and denser recipe than just saying smart aleck things to a forgotten movie, but I think this is the secret ingredient: we believed that it's easiest to survive the cheesy movie that we're living in with friends who keep us from taking it all too seriously.\nNow, I don\u2019t want to get too maudlin about it, because being too serious is the enemy of comedy. We weren't trying to send a message: job #1 was always to make a funny show. But while we were doing that, I hope we also helped show the kids that society, and the stupid things we say and do to each other, are \"just a show, and you should really just relax.\u201d\nYeah, this is what I was afraid of. Now I\u2019m starting to sound like the Dr. Bronner's label. Next question?\nThe simplest answer is: until now, we couldn't bring MST3K back.\nI've been thinking about ways to re-animate MST3K for over a decade... and over the last 15 years, I've met thousands of you who said that you wanted MST3K back too. But two things have finally changed that make this the right time. And I'm not talking about the legalization of marijuana or the proliferation of water jet pack use.\n1. Crowdfunding gives fans the power to get what they want.\nIn less than two years, I've watched fans use crowdfunding to bring back Veronica Mars, Reading Rainbow and Super Troopers \u2013 all cult favorites, like us \u2013 and it made me wonder how MSTies would respond if we had the chance to return. Now we're going to find out\u2026 and then maybe LeVar Burton can finally stop acting like he\u2019s so much better than us.\n2. We had to work through some complicated legal issues.\nEven though we've always wanted to bring MST3K back, it wasn't that easy. Thanks to the Last Will and Testament of one eccentric old heiress, the rights were tied up for years. It took time to work those issues out, but with the help of my friends at Shout Factory, a special chokehold I perfected in WuDang that I like to call \u201cThe Persuader,\u201d and a night I had to spend in a haunted house as a term of the the old lady\u2019s will, we succeeded.\nThis summer, we finally got all of the rights cleared up\u2026 and now, like Orpheus, we can now descend into hell to hang out with a couple of wisecracking robots.\nNow we're talking!\nOur Kickstarter campaign has two really important goals.\nAs soon as we reach our minimum goal of $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three new feature length episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But then, for each additional $1.1 million we raise, we can make three more... up to a full season of 12 episodes!\n(If you're wondering why new episodes cost so much \u2013 especially the first three \u2013 keep going down the page to \"HOW WE'LL USE YOUR MONEY,\" or take a look at the Backer Update where I explained the budget in detail.)\nHere's a simple diagram to help you remember our goals:\nIf we can raise even more than that, I'd love to shoot some (or all) of the new season LIVE in front of an audience \u2013 and maybe even stream the show live on the internet! (Oh yeah: I just saw your eyes light up.)\nFinally, if we raise $1 BILLION \u2013 stay with me on this one \u2013 we\u2019re going to adopt a real live teenage boy and \u201cTruman Show\u201d him into believing he is the Pumaman!\nHear us out, because this goal is just as important: we're not just crowdfunding because we need funding. \nWe're also doing it because we need the crowd!\nIf we want a lot more MST3K, we need to work together to prove that there's still an audience out there that wants MST3K \u2013 and that this isn't all some pitiable delusion \u2013 so that we can find a network or online platform who will agree to pick up the show and keep it going\u2026 hopefully for another 200+ episodes.\nEven if you can only spare $5 or $10, every extra backer helps us send a message to the networks: it's time to #BringBackMST3K.\n____\nOkay. It's time for me to put away the grease gun and give you your marching orders.\nIf any of this rings true to you, we need your help now to spread the word. Back in the day, every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged fans to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes.\u201d And you guys did.\nThose grassroots efforts helped MST3K find friends and fans at a time when the rest of show business didn\u2019t quite know what to make of us. It was social media in its most primitive form... and because of you, it worked.\nToday's, it's time to update that phrase for the internet age. If you're with us, this is your call to action, MSTies.\nAnd while you're at it, you can help out even more by taking a minute to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. (Apparently those matter more than Nielsen ratings, now!)\nListen, I know this Kickstarter idea isn\u2019t for everyone. Neither was Mystery Science Theater 3000. But just like MST3K itself, I know the right people will get it.\nThanks for reading. I hope you'll join us. \nJoel\nDear People of the Internet,\nWelcome to my first-ever Official Crow-Funding Campaign.

Plus a few hat parties.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to open up a long-overdue public dialogue on Cee-Lo Green and his fashion choices.\n\nThen, I plan on turning at least a thousand dollars\u2019 worth of funds into pennies, which I will press into elongated souvenir coins at theme parks and fairs.\n\nFinally, if you are still undecided, I ask you to consider this: after years of waiting, I will finally get to decide who lives and who dies. You don\u2019t want to be on the wrong list, do you?\nI look forward to your loyal service in the many years of the New Golden Age to come.\nYour Future Supreme Being,\nCrow T. Robot\nHello, Ladies.\nI'm pleased to be with you again. It's been too long. Now that we're about to be a huge crowdfunding hit, I've got a few things I'd like to discuss with you.\nIt turns out that the last 15 years have been kind to our legacy: we're famous now. And not internet famous, either. Real famous. I have lots of female fans.\nAngelina, Scarlett, and many women named Madison: I've got parts in the new show with your names on them. You can come over and we can run lines in my bungalow, and I\u2019ll make us a curry. Then if things get \u201cconsensual,\u201d so be it.\nI\u2019ll also pretty much be the \u201ctroubleshooter\u201d on this Kickstarter campaign, because I understand how you think and I\u2019m a master of social media. My god: you do realize that I\u2019m the uncredited creator of both memes and avatars?\nI\u2019M ALSO THE FIRST SENTIENT BEING TO TYPE A MESSAGE IN ALL CAPS.\nWhat are you waiting for? Get out to the Kickstarter polls and start voting.\nYours,\nTom Servo\nHey everyone. It's Joel again.\nLook, I know what you're wondering, so go ahead\u2026 just say it.\nBelieve me, man. I get it. If it cost $2 million just to make three episodes, we'd be spending almost $700K per show! And you're right: by itself, an episode of MST3K doesn't cost nearly that much. \nThe real explanation is pretty simple.\n1. We don't get to keep all of the money we raise on Kickstarter! \nCAMPAIGN FEES: Out of the first $2,000,000, we have to pay about 8% \u2013 that's $160,000 \u2013 in fees to Kickstarter and the credit card processor.\n\nREWARD & SHIPPING COSTS: Then, we have to design, produce, print, sort and ship all of the rewards we're offering in exchange for your pledge. (Those t-shirts aren't free, you know!) That costs about 27%, so that's another $540,000.\n(We're not charging you twice for shipping, I promise. Even though Kickstarter asks you to add more for shipping, they count that money toward the total we've raised, even though we still have to spend it on, you know\u2026 shipping!)\nSo, out of the first $2,000,000 we raise, we have to spend $700,000 just on the costs of this Kickstarter campaign!\n2. Then, we have to spend a lot on startup costs just to get the show going. \nTo shoot new episodes, there's a lot we'll need to do: creating concept art and designs, building sets, making models, creating costumes, adding new features to upgrade the robots, and all sorts of other things. All of that work costs money, which is why our first $2,000,000 includes $550,000 for startup costs. The good part is that every penny of that ends up on screen where you can see it.\n3. But... the more episodes we make, the less each episode costs! \nWe have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we make. If we only make 3 episodes, these costs increase the budget for each episode by $183K\u2026 but if we make a full 12, they only increase it by $46K each!\nAnyway, once you take out the CAMPAIGN, REWARD and STARTUP COSTS, there's a lot less than $2,000,000 left. In fact, that leaves just $750K for three episodes, which \u2013 I hope \u2013 sounds a lot more reasonable than $2,000,000!\nAt the end of the day, our goal is to make each episode for around $250K.\nTo put that in perspective, that means we're spending less to create 90 minutes of MST3K than even the low-end reality shows spend to make 22 minutes! (Really makes ya think, don't it?) \nNow, if you're as tired of reading as I am of writing, here are some wicked cool graphics that explain all of this:\nI know not everyone will want this much explanation, but if I'm asking you to trust me with your money, I think it's important to be crystal clear about how we're using it. \nPlus, $750K for each set of three episodes feels a lot better than $2,000,000. \n(But man, I'd hate to try to sell a car to you people. Tough crowd!)\nHopefully by now, you're already on board. Maybe you're not even reading this. Maybe you've already made your contribution, selected your rewards, and are now rushing around the internet helping spread the good word to all of your MST3K-deprived friends!\nBut if you're still on the fence, maybe I can make it easier for you.\nPersonally, I think the most compelling reason to help out is that you want to see new episodes of MST3K\u2026 and not just for you. Think of the friends and family who you can finally introduce to the new MST3K: the one with a fresh new cast, fresh new riffs, and zesty new cheesy movies!\nOn the other hand, let\u2019s not any of us forget: this is Kickstarter. I know that you know that that\u2019s gonna mean some cool rewards for helping us out. And for a show that\u2019s never really been about cool merch...I think we\u2019ve finally got some!\nUPDATE! We've gotten a lot of questions asking exactly what's included with each package, so we've put together another helpful little chart:\nYou can see all of the rewards on the right side of the page, but here are a few highlights:\nBecome... Part of MYSTERY SCIENCE HISTORY!\nAll backers \u2013 no matter what you pledge \u2013 will be invited to join the new MST3K Information Club. (It's like the old MST3K Info Club, only better. And modern. And more exclusive. And wider in the hips.) Over the next year, we'll invite you to help us rediscover MST3K and get it oiled up and running smoothly. You'll be part of the process!\nRead... Our Page-Turning Insider Updates \nWe don't just want to take your cash and walk away: we want to take your cash and talk away! Most Kickstarter projects promise \"exclusive behind-the-scenes updates,\" but this time, I mean it: I've already started planning things I want to share with you. It'll be like getting email from me, Crow and Servo for at least a year.\nPossess... Amazing, Terrifying, Heart-Warming New MST3K Swag\nBefore the end of the campaign, we'll start sharing the designs we're planning for some of the #BringBackMST3K swag you can get, including the OFFICIAL T-SHIRT ($50+), OFFICIAL MUG ($75+), OFFICIAL KEYCHAIN ($100+), OFFICIAL POSTER ($150), and many more. We've got several amazing artists working on this stuff. I can't wait for you to see it.\nTake Control.... of the New Episodes!Bringing back MST3K isn't enough power for you? Great! For real high-rollers, we're offering all sorts of ways to be part of the episodes themselves. You can\u2026\nSteal the hearts of millions when you... APPEAR IN AN EPISODE! \nThrow your weight around and\u2026 BECOME A PRODUCER! \nKickstart your new riffing career and\u2026 HELP WRITE AN EPISODE!\nImmortalize your favorite inside joke with\u2026 A PERSONAL RIFF!\nOwn and Command... Your OWN Robot Friend!\nThis one is difficult for me, but I want to make sure this Kickstarter succeeds, so I'm willing to make the sacrifice: a very limited number of you can KEEP THE ACTUAL CROW and/or SERVO FEATURED IN A NEW EPISODE! They'll record a personalized video for you, and then we'll ship them off to your doorstep. When we're done shooting.\n1. FOLLOW \"@MST3K\" ON ALL OF OUR SOCIAL CHANNELS.Be sure to follow our official accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Ask your fellow MSTies to follow them too! Tell them that those numbers have a really big impact when we start asking networks to #BringBackMST3K for more new seasons.\n2. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGES AT THE END OF EACH UPDATE. At the end of each Backer Update, Crow or Servo will share a message or image that you can copy and paste to share with your friends, to help spread the word.\n3. KEEP CIRCULATING THE FACTS\u2026 NICELY! I know there are still some fans out there who are skeptical about this Kickstarter, about why MST3K costs so much money and how we'll spend it, about bringing in a third cast, about who is and isn't going to be involved\u2026 So, like they say on the subway, \"If you see something, say something!\" If you hear fans insisting that $2MM is more than we need to make three episodes, or that the old team isn't invited back, I hope you'll share the facts with them. (Please be nice, though! The internet needs a lot more of that.)\n4. JOIN (OR START) A LOCAL MST3K MEETUP GROUP.\nThe internet is great, but sometimes riffing is even better when you can meet old (and new) friends in person! There are already a lot of MST3K groups on meetup.com, but if there's not one near you, start one now and invite your friends! We've got some events planned for this month, and we'll be calling on all the local groups to be part of them.\nAs long as we have the funds we need, we'll be able to produce new episodes. That part is easy! But over the last month, I've had lots of time to think about all the possible risks and challenges MST3K could face...\nMAYBE THE WORLD HAS CHANGED!\nMST3K has been away for a long time. YouTube didn't even exist when we shot the last episode of MST3K. (Yes, Virginia, there was a world before YouTube. People laughed more back then. Colors were brighter. There were concerts in the park.)\nI've imagined many hypothetical risks:\nWhat if no one enjoys watching B-movies anymore? \n What if you don't want us talking while you do? \n What if there is an unknown virus that has killed mankind's ability to enjoy a good solid ironic viewing? \nWhat if kids playing in \u201cGarry\u2019s Mod\u201d on Twitch have made the whole thing meaningless? \nWhat if robot-shaped puppets don\u2019t have the overwhelming cultural significance they once did? \nWhat if our collective consciousness can\u2019t take the excitement, and the entire world becomes a flash mob, and we all steal our own TVs?\nWhat if all eight billion people on the planet become a single \u201cImprov Everywhere\u201d troupe, but don\u2019t have anyone left to surprise?!?\nAs you can see, this whole endeavor is fraught with risks.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been over this!

Why a kickstarter now you may ask? Well, for the past few years Frank has come straight out of pocket and that pocket is now empty... or it has a hole in it... either way there's nothing but lint and a pawn shop receipt in there and neither buys anything.\nWe just need a little help (miniscule really) getting past the post production finish line. All six episodes of season one are shot, picture is locked and 95% color corrected,  and audio is near a final mix. We just need to get a few dollars to pay for music composition, cast and crew screening (the crew went above and beyond they deserve it), web space and design, a handful digital FX work, and a few post production odds and ends.\nThis production has spent at least $15,000 (... I lost count after a while) on this labor of love (maybe an albatross at this point). Many people on the cast and crew have contributed hundreds of man hours already for a web series we consider to be pretty special and unique.\nPlease help us get it across that line!\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nTony Tibbetts (Executive Producer)\nAutumn Perrotta (Co-Producer)\nMichael Scott Robinson (Associate Producer)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risk with any crowd funded project is that the project will never see the light of day. Which is not really a huge risk in this scenario because the project is at least 90% complete. Will Frank get completed without fundraising? Probably, but not very soon and not at the level of quality we think it deserves. I think the cast and crew who have contributed their time and energy deserve the best product possible. \n\nIf the project is successfully funded I believe any obstacles will be minor and easily surmountable.

This campaign is also featuring an all original cyberpunk themed boardgame, CYBER:RUN! The 1-4 player, co-operative strategy boardgame will blend film and boardgaming to a whole new level.\nThe Gamers: Natural One\nIn 2013, our partners at Zombie Orpheus Entertainment teamed up with Lynnvander Media and created 2 awesome movies in The Gamers universe: The Gamers: Humans & Households and The Gamers: Natural 1. Since then both projects have won awards, and The Gamers: Natural 1 recently won Best in Genre at the 2015 Gen Con Film Festival.\nThe Gamers: Natural 1 takes The Gamers property to a new genre of gaming, the futuristic cyber-punk style games. With the story taking two of Dead Gentlemen's and Zombie Orpheus' well known characters from our movies The Gamers: Dorkness Rising and The Gamers: Hands of Fate, Gary & Leo, Natural 1 expanded Gary's family and established a new terrific cast and storyline.\nBy successfully funding this Kickstarter we will be able to continue this story as well as create an epic board game to go along with it.\nThe Budget\nSo where is all this money going? How does it all break out? Pretty much like this:\nThe Gamers: Natural 20 picks up six months after The Gamers: Natural 1 left off. Monica and Ryan are preparing for their wedding. Gary and Leo have come to wish them well. But happiness is short lived as Ryan\u2019s business partners make a deal with a nefarious CEO without his consent. His only chance to make things right? MURDER. No, wait. CYBER:RUN. And murder. Oh, come on. A little murder? No? No murder? OK, fine. On this exhaustingly murder-free journey, Monica and Ryan team up with old friends and new. To victory? Who knows? We just know it\u2019ll be on the low end of the scale when it comes to most murders on film. Thanks a lot, standards and practices.\n\nHow Social Stretch Goals Work\nUnlocking Social Stretch Goals enhances reward levels or unlocks a reward for all backers.

We're also excited to announce some new cast being added to the CYBER:RUN line-up. Some of the cast will be flying into Ontario, Canada from the US and other faraway places to make this production nothing but awesome. We need your help getting them here to make an amazing film.\nDead Gentlemen Productions and Lynnvander Media Inc are poised to make an amazing sequel. \nThe Gamers: Natural 20 is based off the works \"The Gamers\" created by Matt Vancil. The\"Natural 20\" universe is created by Thomas Gofton and written by Andy Dopieralski. The film will be directed by Andy Dopieralski and will employ the avenger-like powers of the creative team Zack Ready (Director of Photography), Chris Wilker (VFX Supervisor - N1), Johnathan Karkar (Score - N1), Rob Mayer (Make-up), Mitch Mommaerts (Steadi-cam) and Aaron Soch (Sound Design - N1). The project will be produced by Scott C. Brown, Don Early and Thomas Gofton.\nCYBER:RUN is a fully cooperative action-strategy board game for 1-4 players. The game takes place in a corporate headquarters where players must work together, fighting the security forces, hacking security systems, and collecting resources to complete a series of objectives. As the turns pass the game gets more difficult, forcing players to work quickly to complete their objectives. CYBER:RUN is drenched in the humor and style of The Gamers: Natural 20, and includes a series of optional video-clips that feature the characters of The Gamers: Natural 20, and replace many of the game's cards.  \nKey:\nYellow means you choose either DVD or BluRay, but not both.\nPurple means you get 2 each.\nThe DVD - The DVD will contain the movie, a trailer, and any special features we are able to include. This may include Outtakes, Deleted Scenes, Commentaries and more!\nThe BluRay - The BluRay will be identical to the DVD, just in HD.\nMockup of CYBER:COIN in Ultimate CYBER:RUNNER Package\nCYBER:PARTY - We are holding a CYBER:RUN party at Gen Con Indy 2016 and we hope you can make it.

Duties are not included in your shipping charge. However, they may not apply anyway.\nOnce the campaign has reached its goal, we have some great Stretch Goals planned. These goals will enhance both the movie and the board game!!! There is a lot we want to add and make this already amazing movie CYBER-AWESOME!!! Things like cameos, new scenes, etc.\nAfter the campaign is over there is typically a survey you as a backer need to fill out. This will provide us with the necessary information to ship your rewards to you. Additionally you will be able to pick up extra copies of the movie, the game, and any other Add-On\u2019s we offer that you can\u2026 wait for it\u2026 add on to your order.

With 3 live action films and 1 animated film, we\u2019re focusing on characters from myth, legend, and faery tale.\nWe\u2019re here to explore intimate, magical stories found in poetry and bring them to life on film.\nStill from \"The Worn Out Shoes\" photoshoot by Kat St. John Photography\nWhen artists collaborate, something magical happens. Something new that reflects many intentions, many ways of seeing and responding to the world. It\u2019s easy to find beautiful, ongoing collaborations between poets and dancers, photographers, textile artists, and even graphics artists\u2026 but what about poets and independent, narrative filmmakers?\nTell Your Children is for people who love independent film, for people who love contemporary, original poetry, and for people who love faery tales, myths and legends. We want to create something new, something layered and engaging to present to an audience. Ultimately, we hope to inspire and encourage more collaboration among artists of varying genres.\nOur main focus is to make a quality poetry short (the first of hopefully many!). The second is to fairly pay the professional cast & crew who will help us make it. That\u2019s why we want to show our appreciation for YOUR support in 3 basic categories: \nDigital rewards are delivered digitally, with no shipping overhead, and put your contribution directly into the film. For instance, The Poems at the $30 level will be delivered digitally, saving shipping and paper, and will be pretty enough for you to print out and display, share, or fold into a poetical origami swan, if you choose!\nArtist rewards are works of art, created just for this campaign by artists whose work inspires us, and are placed at reward levels that allow us to compensate the creators for their time to craft and deliver.\nProducer-level rewards offer a big, personal thank you for Super Contributors.\n...of course, we have a couple of extra special rewards for good measure! \nFor those who love our makeup co-artists, Espionage Cosmetics, we have a limited quantity of  \"Tell Your Children Faery Tale Nails,\" a specially curated 3-design set of high-quality, adhesive nail art (which includes the digital link to the film). Learn more about the Faery Tale Nails in the FAQ.\nFaery Tale Nails\nAnd for those of you who clicked over from the Dead Gentlemen, ZOE, or JourneyQuest, Emilie plans to have a little too much fun recording a series of downloadable Wren ringtones.\nStretch Goals\nOur goal is $6,000, which will allow us to produce 3 live action poetry shorts.

We can't wait to reveal them to you as the campaign progresses!\nWe are scheduled to shoot the 3 live-action films this coming November, 2015. Each short will be filmed (or drawn!) on location in the Pacific Northwest. We live in a beautiful, moody, mysterious place, and it\u2019s bursting with creative talent at every seam.\nThe creator of Tell Your Children is Emilie Rommel Shimkus, a poet, actress, vocalist, and 3rd generation NW native. Her poetry has recently appeared in the anthologies Sarasvati Takes Pegasus as Her Mount and In Tahoma\u2019s Shadow. As an actress, Emilie is perhaps best known as Wren, a bardic graduate student on the trail of her epic in the fantasy comedy JourneyQuest. Emilie has also appeared in many other short films, commercial campaigns, stage productions, playwrights' festivals, and as a voice actor in video games. In addition to writing the 4 poems in TYC, Emilie will direct 1 short, act in 1 short, and provide voice-over for the entire project.\nOur producer, Rose Hall is also a PNW native and has produced short, feature, and commercial projects. Recent work includes Brothers, (writer, director), Valley of the Sasquatch (associate producer), Marla Mae (co-producer), and her feature film Fugue, currently in development (writer, producer, director).\nOur directors and director of photography are all active, experienced members of the Puget Sound film, theatre, and poetry communities.\nWe are also lucky to add the varied talents and expertise from working artists for our animation, sound track, poster design, and makeup/special effects design.\nTell Your Children is the inaugural film production of The Northwest Renaissance, a non-profit (501c3) organization with more than 30 years committed to the mission to bring poetry to the communities of the Puget Sound area in Washington State. We do readings, workshops, and publications, and we\u2019re excited to add film as a whole new way to inspire and welcome.\nWe are supported by our producing partners, The Tacoma Arts Commission and 4Culture\u2014who have already awarded the Tacoma Artist\u2019s Initiative Program grant to this project\u2014 and by Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, who will provide added distribution venues after we complete and publicly screen the films.\nWe are so proud to be a female-centric, inclusive, and family-friendly film set. That means that all of our key crew positions are female, including the creator, producers, directors, director of photography, assistant director, and several other positions. It also means our set and shooting schedule will be purposefully designed to accommodate working parents and mothers of infants.\nThank you so much for reading ALL of this! Thank you in advance for any contributions you are moved to make to help us create new, engaging art. And please help us spread the word!

Click here for details: \nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arrowstorm/mythica-3-the-necromancer-starring-kevin-sorbo/posts/1373239\nMythica is the most ambitious indie fantasy project ever undertaken. We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, with two more films in the Mythica series planned, thanks to the generous backing of our community of fans.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes and Mythica 2: The Darkspore have been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers.\nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 3: The Necromancer - our favorite of the Mythica films thus far!\nAlso, if we don't make our goal, Kevin Sorbo is going to be very... DISAPPOINTED!!!\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Necromancer\nWhen her most loyal friend is taken hostage by Peregus Malister, the cruel master of the Thieves Guild, Marek must embark on a corrupt mission to serve the Thieves Guild with her team of would-be heroes. But when the mission leads them into the clutches of Szorlok - their greatest enemy - Marek must sacrifice her ambitions and perhaps her own soul before her friends are killed, to stop Szorlok from obtaining the Darkspore.\nWatch the trailers for the first two Mythica films below!\nMelanie Stone plays Marek, a natural-born necromancer with a club foot. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, and the off-broadway rock opera, Deep Love.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars and the upcoming release, Dragon Warriors.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nNicola Posener plays Teela, a priestess of the Order of Ana-Sett. Arrowstorm fans will recognize her from her starring role in Dawn of the Dragonslayer, while she has also starred in several British films and TV series, including Disney's Life Bites.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his long-awaited appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor, and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew. He is also Dungeon Master supreme over at Critical Role, and just DM'd for no less that Vin Diesel. Not too shabby.\nPhilip Brodie plays Betylla, evil henchman of the Thieves Guild. Philip is an extremely talented British actor and writer, known for Zombie Diaries 2, Dawn of the Dragonslayer and A Landscape of Lies.\nRobert Jayne plays Peregus Malister, the sinister head of the Thieves Guild. Robert is a veteran actor and writer, best known for Tremors, Pearl Harbor and Different Strokes.\n The film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all underway. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, dragon sequences, etc. We want the movie to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\n Backers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $75,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $75,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\n We're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade.

I'm excited to share our newest project, Women in Practical Armor.\nEdited by Ed Greenwood and Gabrielle Harbowy, this project is important to all three of us because we feel showcasing an already empowered female warrior is essential. If women in fantasy are capable and intelligent enough to lead in battle, wouldn't they also be intelligent enough to protect their abdomens, tie their hair back, and cover their faces while fighting?\nEvil Girlfriend Media is passionate about breaking stereotypes and creating new mythology, and our goal with this project is to bring you high quality, well-edited stories that will take the fantasy genre to a new level.\nOur authors are a talented and energetic bunch, and as the campaign progresses we'll be sharing interviews, anecdotes, trivia, and special pledge levels from some of the biggest names in science fiction and fantasy. \nEd Greenwood-Editor: An award-winning Canadian writer and game designer, Ed's books have sold millions of copies worldwide, and his writing credits would easily fill this entire page.\nGabrielle Harbowy-Editor: In addition to being the Managing Editor at Dragon Moon Press, Gabrielle is an award-nominated short story writer and anthologist whose first novel comes out next year. This is her fourth anthology collaboration with co-editor Ed Greenwood..\nErik Scott de Bie: The author of eight novels and counting, speculative fiction is only one of Erik's many talents, which include designing tabletop RPGs, mentoring new writers, fencing, and frenetic rock karaoke.\nJudith Tarr: An award-winning fantasy author and frequent finalist on World Fantasy and Locus award ballots, Judith has been writing steadily since her first novel released in 1985.\nTodd J. McCaffrey: New York Times bestselling author Todd McCaffrey has written more than a dozen books and numerous short stories.\nMary Robinette Kowal: Hugo Award-winning author, award-winning puppeteer, and voice actor, Mary Robinette Kowal also won the 2008 Campbell award for Best New Writer, and is one of the hosts of the Hugo Award-winning podcast Writing Excuses.\nBecause we not only want to do this book, we want to do it right. With your generous pledges, this campaign has covered the costs of production in advance. Our continuing goal is to secure funds to properly market Women in Practical Armor as a major release, as well as pave the way for similar projects in the future.\nOne important component of our Kickstarter that we want backers to know is that the first month of royalties of the book will go to a PTSD charity chosen by Gabrielle Harbowy and me. Every day can feel like a battle for those with PTSD, and we want our backers to know that because of them funding the book, we want to give back.\nWe've got an armory full of great rewards for our backers, so why not try one on for size? As the campaign progresses, we'll be unveiling special offers from our authors, add-ons for your pledges, and more!\nHere's a look at a couple items besides the anthology itself included in our backer levels.\n\nStarting at the PATENT OF NOBILITY level ($50 or more), backers receive a limited edition medallion keychain, crafted by Eloise J. Knapp.\nAt the CLOTH COIF level ($150 or more) Editor Gabrielle Harbowy is offering to knit a \"yarn mail\" hood for five lucky backers. Crafted from a design by (and used with permission) Etsy creator WeeBeeUniquesByJulie, it's the perfect thing to keep your head warm and protected while reading our mind-blowing stories!\nThis coif is only one of the special offers put forth by our creators. For example, Contributor Eric Landreneau has offered an e-book copy of his novel Break! A Tale of Cursed Blood to all backers at the CAP level and above.\nBut this book is bigger than just us, and as mentioned above we want to market and promote it as a major release. Your pledges enable us to do just that, and now that we've funded, we're counting on your help to spread the word about how awesome it is.\nSo let's talk about\nThanks to your support, we've covered the costs of production, including paying our authors and artists professional rates. We know all the places we'd like to market this book, and we know more or less what it costs to do so.\nAnd it costs a lot. Money most independent publishers don't have to spend, so many great projects never go out to more than a few hundred people. We're looking to all of our new friends to help us spread the message in the time we have left, so that we can give Women in Practical Armor the launch it deserves.\nOur first two stretch goals are modest ones, but they have significant impact on how we move forward in marketing the book.\n$7000\nBacker T-shirts (UNLOCKED)\nThanks to our backers, our wonderful Women in Practical Armor T-shirts are now included in all backer levels $100 and up, and are available as $25 add-ons to backer levels MAIL SHIRT and higher. So check out this awesome backer exclusive in the Add-Ons section below, and get ready for our next stretch goal of...\n$10000\nRaises for WiPA contributors (UNLOCKED)\nWe're already paying our authors professional rates, but we'd love to pay them more. So if we raise at least $10000 with this campaign, we'll be re-writing our contracts to compensate them at 8 cents a word.\nThat's kind of a big deal. And it will certainly raise some eyebrows in the publishing world. Which is exactly what we want. We're changing the world, remember? It starts story by story, one word at a time. And with your help, we'll be there before you know it.\n$12500\nEd Greenwood and Gabrielle Harbowy (UNLOCKED)\nYou probably know by now that our esteemed co-editors can put together a great book, but did you know they can write? Because if we can raise least $12500 with this campaign, they\u2019ve agreed to co-author an original story for Women in Practical Armor! We\u2019re really excited about this stretch goal, and hope you are too.\n$15000\nBackers-only Release Party (UNLOCKED)\nNorwescon 39 in Seatac, WA is a major science fiction event in the Pacific Northwest, and just so happens to fall right in our expected release window. We\u2019re going to be there promoting the heck out of Women in Practical Armor and other EGM releases, but we also want to recognize all the backers whose support made this project possible.\nSo let\u2019s be honest, of course we\u2019re going to have a party. But instead of just a noisy affair in a cramped convention hotel room, we want to invite the entire legion to celebrate with us at once! So if we raise at least $15000 with this campaign, we\u2019re closing the doors to the general public, and opening it up the entire world.\nThat\u2019s right, if we hit this goal the WiPA backer party will be broadcast live on the web, and you\u2019re all invited! We\u2019ll have contests, prizes, contributor interviews and advance readings, as well as a few surprises. (I have it on good authority that Queen Katie loves to sing).\n$20000\nBecause some women like to do it alone, in the shadows.\nThis stretch goal is one we\u2019ve wanted to announce since this campaign started. Women in Practical Armor was never meant to be alone on your bookshelf. It was meant to be the first of several anthologies featuring already empowered female protagonists. So with this in mind, we're now proud to announce the second volume in the series, and our final stretch goal for this campaign.\nWomen in Comfortable Shoes will present stories of rogues, thieves, assassins, and other self-assured ladies, and with your help, we can do it in style. Right now we can't share much more information than the title, but if we hit our stretch goal we'll be able to guarantee the same pay rate of 8 cents a word to all our authors that we're offering for Women in Practical Armor.\nBut wait, there's more.\n Battle Ready Poster ($10)\nActual woman in practical armor Ann Shilling\nWe teased our Battle-Ready backer poster on day one, and are now prepared to share more about it.  \nAs a $10 add-on for backers at PAULDRONS level and higher, we're offering this full color, 12 x 18 poster detailing the armor worn by real-life woman in practical armor Ann Shilling during our Kickstarter video.\nAnd if that weren't enough, we've got a special reward for our backers at MAIL SHIRT and higher levels. It's this crazy new book called...\nExtra Copy ($12)\nYou've already secured yourself a copy of our trade paperback, and possibly even an e-book as well. But what about your friends? No matter how successful our campaign is, or our subsequent marketing efforts, there will always be someone down the line who's looking for a good read and just doesn't know what to pick.\nBut you do. As a $12 add-on, you can order an additional trade paperback of Women in Practical Armor to share with them. This backer-exclusive price is only available through this campaign, and is available multiple times per pledge.\nBacker T-Shirts ($25)\nSo cool. So Comfortable\nWe've been talking about \"mobile marketing\" for a while now, and although some Kickstarter campaigns lead with extras like this, we wanted to keep the focus on the book and our authors. Now that that's out of the way, we're happy to announce our Women in Practical Armor backer shirts.\nThese great shirts are available as a $25 add-on to backer levels MAIL SHIRT and higher, and automatically included in all backer levels $100 and higher.\nTo add any of these great bonus items to your existing backer reward, increase your total pledge (using the \"Manage Pledge\" option) to cover the cost of each item you want. \nFor a poster, add $10 to your pledge\nFor an additional trade paperback, add $12 to your pledge\nFor a backer t-shirt, add $25 to your pledge\nThere's no need to change your backer level\u2014in fact, we recommend you do not, unless a different level has other options you want (signed copies, medallion keychains, etc). Changing your backer level does not automatically qualify you for an add-on\u2014you will still need to pledge additional funds for additional items.\nAfter our campaign is complete, we'll send a survey to all backers through which you can identify the items you want. If you want to make sure we know your wishes, send us a message as well (Not a comment, though we'll read that too).\nSo what do you say, backers? Are you ready to march an extra few milestones with us? Because we guarantee there's more cool stuff waiting for us down this road.

It was a financial strain for my husband and me; we no longer had to pay daycare, but we were still looking at a bit of stress from losing my income. \nAt the time, I was teaching music classes at my daughter\u2019s daycare twice a week in exchange for two days of childcare. I learned a bunch of standard children\u2019s songs, including \u201cThe Wheels on the Bus.\u201d At home, we sang the song often, and the Mommies on the bus and the Daddies on the bus always said \u201cI love you.\u201d At school, the Mommies on the bus said \u201cshh shh shh,\u201d and the Daddies on the bus said \u201ckeep the baby quiet!\u201d complete with finger wagging and stern faces.\nThis floored me. Daddies are just as capable as Mommies of soothing their distressed children, and the whole idea that a Daddy would sternly tell their partner in parenthood to \u201ckeep the baby quiet\u201d was upsetting and unfair. I took my outrage to social media, telling the story, and saying \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be funny if I wrote an album of progressive, feminist children\u2019s songs, with titles like \u2018Only Yes Means Yes\u2019 and \u2018Princesses are for Everyone\u2019 and \u2018Wheelchairs are for Wheelies.\u2019\u201d\nThe response was a resounding \u201cYES YOU SHOULD DO THAT, I WOULD BUY IT.\u201d A friend of mine even replied with \u201cThe Mommies on the Bus Say Smash the Patriarchy.\u201d (Ok, he didn't say \"smash.\" Use your imagination.) After much deliberation, I decided to name the project \u201cYes Means Yes!\u201d and adopted a new children\u2019s music persona named Ms. Cacie (my nickname). \nMy aim is to help people educate children about being good to each other and themselves, embracing diversity, and supporting each other with understanding and compassion. I now have 14 songs ready to be recorded, but I need your help to offset the cost of recording and producing the album.

September and October are my busy season with music and other part-time work; I'm hoping to start recording as soon as possible, but there is a chance I won't be able to start until early November, which gives me four months to accomplish recording, mixing, mastering, getting album art, and printing CDs.

Coloring is fun and calming for me. \nI started drawing people I love and respect because, let's face it, the world can be pretty sh**ty sometimes and adoringly painting the faces of friends really made me feel better.\nColoring a picture of my sister\nI have been sharing some of these pictures on social media and the response has been wonderful - turns out a lot of you enjoy coloring AND feminism! From those drawings, the idea for the Badass Feminist Coloring Book was born.\nWho's in this book?\nThis book has a collection of well known feminists like writer Lindy West and comedian/writer Jenny Yang and everyday badass feminists that you haven't met yet, but who have awesome things to say. These people are writers, comedians, mothers, daughters, sex workers. There are feminists of different ages, races, body types, gender identities - this is the intersectional feminist coloring book you've been waiting for.\nFeatured Feminists so far(note, this list is very likely to grow and change):\nWagatwe Wanjuki, Lindy West, Hari Kondabolu, Kimya Dawson, Feminista Jones, Jenny Yang, Jennifer Pozner, Margaret Corvid, Madison Foster, Marcella Arguello, Elicia Sanchez, Betsey Brock, Kaylani Perisho, Avital Nathman,  Michi Trota, Talcott Broadhead,  AND MORE\nAwesome pictures, inspiring quotes - and you can scribble on their faces- this book has it all!\nGimme the book details.\nThis is a coloring book printed on high quality paper made by - you know- professional book makers. I plan on featuring at least 20 different feminists - however, if the funding is there, I'll definitely add more. Each feminist gets their own page and a badass feminist quote, like this:\na page from the Badass Feminist Coloring Book\nWhere does the money go?\nI think it's obvious from the goal that nobody is trying to get rich here, but let me break down where the $4k is going:\n25% gratuity for the feminists featured (I don't believe feminists should work for free)\n30% printing and shipping\n30% labor and artwork fees (I'm drawing every one of these pages)\n15% fees, unanticipated costs etc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProvided I don't suddenly lose my ability to draw - there aren't many risks to this project.

He is a man of stern political beliefs, ones that he is more than willing to kill for.\nIn the first film, Bill went on a rampage in his hometown of Tenderville, Oregon that left 93 people dead. He disappeared soon after, leaving a video that promised he would rise again...\nIn Rampage: Capital Punishment, Bill took over a TV station in Washington, D.C. Using a hostage camera crew, he let the world witness the carnage. As the police tried to intervene, he detonated explosives hidden within the station, killing everyone inside.\nBill however escaped, and has been waiting, biding his time until now...\nUwe Boll on the set of Rampage: Capital Punishment\nOver 35 years of making films, good and bad, exciting and depressing, controversial and amusing, I have found in my Rampage films something I am truly proud of. Rampage is my favourite of all of my films, and the first time I felt I made something that both reflected me fully as an artist, and engaged the audience in the way I intended.\nEver since we made the first film, fans have been clamouring for more from Bill Williamson, and I felt that we should strike now. Bill, his politics and ethics aside, is a character who believes what he is doing is for the people, and the first two films have struck a chord with audiences in a way that surprised even me. So why not get them involved?\nI want to give you the chance to be a part of the action. Let's make a film for the people, by the people.\n- Uwe Boll, Director of the Rampage trilogy\nBill Williamson (Brendan Fletcher) delivering his message to the world\nUpon making Rampage: Capital Punishment, we were hindered in raising finance due to how much the first film had been pirated online. I love that Rampage reached so many people, but to those who finance films it was obviously worrying that they would not see a return on their investment, and so we had a much smaller budget than the first film.\nThe money we raise here will support entirely Rampage 3's final action scene, which will leave the streets of Washington ruined, in a sequence more explosive than anything scene before in the Rampage trilogy.\nHelp us by simply pre-buying the film, so that we can guarantee we will get to make the film we want to make, and you will want to see. We also really do want you to be in the action, and are offering our backers the chance to actually be there amidst the chaos!\nSo join us, and together we will conclude the trilogy in the biggest way possible!\nJust a few of our amazing rewards!\nWe're offering you the chance to be a part of the final chapter in the Rampage trilogy. Through simply buying the exciting rewards along the right of this page, you will help make Rampage 3: No Mercy the best film possible!\nWe have a variety of rewards for backers, from copies of the film, to posters, to the costume, to chances to join us on set or even be killed on-screen in the film (with a full on-set actor experience, including a hotel and travel to and from set).\nLook out for one-off special items and opportunities, and make sure to get involved at any level to ensure you get to be a part of the behind the scenes backer-only content that will continue throughout the film all the way up to release.\n-\nWas ist die RAMPAGE Trilogie ?\nDie Trilogy folgt dem desillusionierten Bill Williamson w\u00e4hrend er versucht die Erde von Idioten, Betr\u00fcgen und L\u00fcgnern zu befreien. Er hat ein klares Konzept und startete mit einem Amoklauf in seiner Heimatstadt Tenderville in Oregon, wo er die halbe Stadt ausl\u00f6schte. Dannach versteckte er sich \u00fcber ein Jahr, um dann wieder aufzutauchen und eine ganze TV \u2013 Station als Geisel zu nehmen. In einem Live Interview macht er Amerika klar, dass wir es leider vers\u00e4umt haben die Welt zu retten und deshalb die Erde untergehen wird. Das einzige was jetzt noch helfen kann ist das T\u00f6ten der politischen F\u00fchrer und der Superreichen.  Am Schluss sprengt er den ganzen Sender in die Luft und entkommt selber durch einen L\u00fcftungschacht. Die Polizei h\u00e4lt ihn f\u00fcr tot.\nWarum ist Uwe Boll hier?\nNach 25 Jahren Erfahrung im produzieren von Filmen, bin ich auf RAMPAGE besonders stolz. RAMPAGE 1 bekam die besten Kritiken von allen meinen Filmen und entfachte die besten Diskussionen mit den Zuschauern.  RAMPAGE 2 kann so nicht alleine stehen bleiben ---- wir m\u00fcssen sehen wie es mit Bill Williamson weitergeht. RAMPAGE 3 wird der letzte Teil sein und weil es sehr schwer ist den Film zu finanzieren, brauchen wir eure Hilfe. \n- Uwe Boll\nWarum KICKSTARTER?\nRampage 2 wurde so oft illegal downgeloaded, dass es schwer ist mit einem sich stetig verkleinernden DVD Markt RAMPAGE 3 zu finanzieren. Wir waren in der Lage schon 20 L\u00e4nder zu verkaufen, aber as Geld reicht nicht, um die grossen Actionszenen, die wir planen auch umzusetzen. Denn diesmal attackiert Bill das WEISSE HAUS. Wir brauchen eure Unterst\u00fctzung.\nWelche Preise bekomme ich?\nIn der Liste findest Du tolle Preise und sogar die M\u00f6glichkeit beim Film mitzumachen ----aber haupts\u00e4chlich geht es ja darum den Film \u00fcberhaupt zu erm\u00f6glichen. Von DVDs, \u00fcber Poster, Kost\u00fcme bis zu Sprechrollen ist alles drin.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEveryone involved in this film is an industry professional, together having decades of collective experience.

We can also be found on localized social media in Polish, Czech and Russian.\nActual Handmade Reliquary Box\nWhy the Bard's Tale?\n30 years ago, a small company by the name of Interplay produced a cRPG titled Tales of the Unknown I: The Bard\u2019s Tale. This game was crafted at a time when the RPG genre was growing and being defined by an endless stream of innovative releases. In this period dominated by Wizardry and Ultima, The Bard\u2019s Tale was an unexpected hit, putting Interplay on the map. Brian went on to produce many of the RPGs we still love to this day, including Wasteland, Baldur\u2019s Gate, Fallout, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and many more. The Bard\u2019s Tale was also one of the first members of the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame, and The Bard\u2019s Tale III was featured in the Smithsonian\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Video Games\u201d exhibit.\nDuring our successful crowdfunding campaigns for Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, our legions of generous backers stunned us with their outpouring of support, proving those games still had an audience that was willing to help make them happen.\nAs we began to look into our next project, we were flooded with requests from many of our supporters who wanted us to return to The Bard\u2019s Tale universe. The dungeon crawl genre it represents has largely been forgotten by mainstream publishers. What better time than the 30th anniversary of the original for us to bring The Bard\u2019s Tale back to life with a true dungeon crawling sequel, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV!\nCraft your party, your way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to develop, progress and grow a party of adventurers as you see fit. Build a combat-hardened warrior to lead the way, or a spell-flinging Conjurer to provide support from the back lines. A character\u2019s class provides the basic archetype, but as you progress you will tweak and evolve your party to suit your play style.\nThe original Bard\u2019s Tale games allowed you to evolve your magic class characters from the Conjurer and Magician to the more powerful Sorcerer, Chronomancer, Geomancer, and even the feared Archmage, each providing new spell trees to explore. We\u2019re extending this system to all class types for increased levels of customization and tinkering. As your magic and combat abilities grow, you will combine spells and skills from your different party members for increased effects greater than the sum of their parts. Deciding when to evolve your characters has a major impact on the types of spells that become available.\nThe eponymous Bard is of course returning. The Bard is an important member of each party, with magical songs empowering the group in combat or providing a helping hand while exploring and solving puzzles. Your band of adventurers will be influenced throughout the game by the Bard's music. By playing the Rhyme of Duotime, your party will regenerate spell points at increased speed. Switching to The Archer\u2019s Tune will greatly increase your party\u2019s missile damage. Just make sure your bard is well stocked with ale...so his throat doesn\u2019t dry out. \nWe are also bringing back many popular races like humans, elves, dwarves, and including some newly inspired races like the Trow. The races all have their own unique culture and history, integrating your choices more into the game\u2019s narrative. The world and citizens of The Bard\u2019s Tale IV react to your party\u2019s make-up, branching the quest structure and providing a unique experience depending on who is joining you. \n\"In mist-shrouded Skara Brae, in the darkest hours of a winter's night, sometimes can be heard a voice on the wind. The Song of the Maiden the locals call it, a song sung since before the standing stones grew moss, a song of ill fortune, that lures those who hear it to their doom, and drives the melancholy to madness, a song, they say, that must never end, for if it does, the world ends with it.\"\nWhat did the wizard Mangar seek when he cast his spell of Eternal Winter, locking Skara Brae in ice? Why did the invading archmage Lagoth Zanta shatter the Destiny Wand and end seven hundred years of peace? Why did the mad god Tarjan cross the outer planes to burn Skara Brae to the ground and slaughter its people? What secret could drive beings of such great power to again and again lay waste to these ancient isles?\nThe adventurers who put a stop to these fiends never learned the answer to these questions, but now, a hundred and fifty years after its destruction, and the building of a new town on top of the old, another power, greater than all those before, has turned an eye once again to Skara Brae and the time-lost catacombs beneath it, seeking the secret its predecessors failed to find - and once more, a small group of hapless adventurers are all that stands in its way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV brings you back to locations you know and love in the bustling, under-construction town of Skara Brae, though the events of the past years have changed it in ways you might not expect. As always, many taverns dot the city for the party to quaff down large tankards of ale and wet their parched throats. The Adventurer\u2019s Guild is still open and ready to assist. The descendants of the original Skara Brae have picked up where their ancestors left off, so magic users can regenerate at the reliable Energy Emporium (Roscoe Jr.) and restock in the ever-ready Garth\u2019s Equipment Shoppe.\nYou know us as lovers of reactivity, choice, and consequence in our games, and naturally The Bard\u2019s Tale IV is no different. Your actions in and around Skara Brae can change the town forever! As you make choices and complete your quests, other local bards will sing songs of your exploits, which may change the attitude of noblemen, modify the friendliness of merchants, or unlock previously inaccessible buildings. Quests are either offered or revoked based on your influence in the world, so you must choose them wisely.\nTell me more\u2026\nBeing a dungeon crawl, you\u2019ll get to explore the dungeons, forests, crypts, and castles within, underneath, and around Skara Brae as well as worlds beyond the lands of men. The emphasis is on exploration, mystery, discovering new locations, and fighting your way through traps and monsters. Secrets abound in these dungeons, and the world is shrouded in mystery. Like the originals, movement and dungeon design is grid-based, but the game allows you to toggle the grid off and move freely if you prefer.\nWe have a passion for non-linear level design and The Bard\u2019s Tale IV embraces this concept. While you explore the world, you will reach areas, obstacles, and monsters you won\u2019t be able to defeat. By venturing out into new areas, developing additional skills and spells, or finding enchanted weapons and armor, you can return with a new set of tools better equipped for the job. Definitely expect a challenge; this game won\u2019t be easy.\nChallenges beyond combat await you. Dangerous traps dot the dungeons, and you\u2019ll need a deft hand to find your way through them \u2013 as well as a keen sense of mapping. With the full rights to use all of the content, story, and setting of the original games, we are returning to many of the familiar trappings and challenges. But don\u2019t worry.  If you find yourself completely stuck, just turn your way to a Magic Mouth, those perfectly ordinary hint-givers that come in the shape of giant talking stone walls.\nA big part of true dungeon crawls is the combat. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV utilizes a dynamic phase-based system to resolve such encounters. What do we mean by that?\nCombat is resolved in a phase-based manner, meaning your entire party takes its turn, and then all enemies take theirs. In the original trilogy, you\u2019d make all of the decisions at once and only then see the results. For The Bard\u2019s Tale IV, we want a more dynamic experience: as soon as you decide what a character will do, they immediately act. This is the first way in which battles dynamically change, as your rolls and effects can have a variety of outcomes which might make you rethink your next action.\nWhen we say that combat is dynamic, we also relate that to the game's pace and feel. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to give your commands as quickly as you want, even while the animations of your previous commands are still playing out. This removes the tedium of waiting around for animations to finish before the system accepts your next input. And of course, your enemies are a major part of keeping the system dynamic \u2013 you'll need to examine the battlefield and react accordingly to win, including being aware of abilities that directly counter other abilities.\nSpecial abilities will also be a huge emphasis for the game. The Magician class, for instance, uses their powers to enchant and change the properties of objects by manipulating their physical environment. By casting Ybarra\u2019s Mystic Shield, the air in front of the party becomes an invisible shield. Illusions and summoning is a pillar of The Bard\u2019s Tale universe too, so expect your foes to be summoning their own monsters while constantly evolving the tactical nature of the combat at each turn. Running backwards will not be a viable survival strategy!\nPhysical Manipulation of Items and Puzzles\nItems, weapons, armor, and specialized loot are a big part of dungeon exploration. You will want to equip (and conjure) yourself with the best gear, including armor, gloves, helmets, shields, weapons, instruments, rings, and wands.\nThe sense of discovery and mystery doesn\u2019t stop with the environment. Many items hold their own secrets that you\u2019ll need to discover by carefully examining them. Similar to the intriguing video game series The Room, by thoroughly studying special objects, you can unlock ways to enhance or modify their properties. After looting a chest, for instance, you might find a dagger with suspicious holes dotting the blade. After examining it closer and rotating two oddly shaped discs on the hilt of your newly found weapon, a small compartment opens revealing a clock-like dial. Twisting this dial properly and locking it into place, you notice a viscous poison dripping from the blade which will add additional damage to each attack.\nPLAY\n\nWe extend this physical manipulation element into a rich variety of challenges. Dungeons are filled with diabolical puzzles that unlock anything from shortcuts to secrets, to extra loot, and often you\u2019ll need to think of clever ways to use your arsenal of spells and skills to get through them. \nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV has a strong fantasy heritage and represents a leap forward for this genre. We intend to craft its world and creatures with a unique stylistic approach to make the game all the more memorable, with a distinct artistic theme that is instantly recognizable and layers of rich detail that make the bustling world come alive.\nIn both its music and visuals, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV draws heavily from many elements of Scottish culture. We plan to integrate Scottish architecture in the look of Skara Brae and the game\u2019s dungeons and wilderness.\nReference photos from inXile's Scotland trip\nIn many cases we directly take real-life objects, specially photographed, and convert them into 3D objects using the process of photogrammetry. We then take the processed 3D objects and tweak them to end up with authentic and gorgeous game assets that perfectly suit our stylistic approach.\nPLAY\n\nWho is making The Bard\u2019s Tale\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is brought to you by inXile Entertainment, led by Brian Fargo.

We\u2019re Joey Comeau and Emily Horne and we\u2019ve been making our webcomic A Softer World since 2003. You can go look at the comics for free on our website - www.asofterworld.com. For twelve years we\u2019ve been making sad, weird, harsh and sometimes ridiculous comics. Our whole adult lives, it feels like. And now we\u2019re going to stop. A Softer World is ending.\nTo celebrate the end of the world, we want to make a book. A collection of our favourite comics, from the very first to the very last. The final day of this Kickstarter campaign will coincide with the final comic in A Softer World.\n Over the years, people have said some nice things about our comic.\n  \u201c[like] finishing a really good short story, in a fraction of the reading time.\u201d \u2013 Rolling Stone\n\"Touching, horrible, depressing, and blackly funny.

And that\u2019s part of why we\u2019re stopping. We love doing the comic, love what we\u2019ve created, but we don\u2019t want to do the same thing forever. So, we\u2019re going to stop now while we STILL love doing the comic. Before something dies inside of us and all that\u2019s left is the work. And, as Emily pointed out \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s better to burn out than to get old and weird and pathetic.\u201d\nwhere it all started\nOur previous books have been collections in a more traditional sense. The first book collected all of the first 200 comics in chronological order, the second book picked up where that left off, and so on. But we have more than 1200 comics now, and we want to create a book that is only the very best. Sometimes when you look back on your life, you just want the important memories. Not the happiest necessarily. Don\u2019t get us wrong. Skinned knees and childhood funerals helped make us who we are, too. First kisses and broken hearts.\nWe want to make a book that captures (as much as possible) what the comic meant to us over twelve whole years. And so here we are \u2013 The Best of A Softer World. 200 comics. 2 per page! And we\u2019ll be including some of our six-panel comics, for the first time ever in print. All our favourite comics, plus their alt texts, in one beautiful hardcover package. \nWe present:\n\n* To explain the Remix thing: we'll create a PDF of 40 wildly illegal remixes of our own comic text with images from our favourite pop culture shows and comics and release it into the wild on Bittorrent.

Hence, 10th-ish Anniversary Edition Blu-ray. :) Hey, 2005 counts for something, right? The movie received a ton of support from the tabletop gaming industry, enabling real products to be featured in the movie, like Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 Edition, Munchkin, X-Crawl, as well as nerdy comics like Knights of the Dinner Table and Nodwick. This support legitimized The Gamers: Dorkness Rising in a major way. It exploded over Netflix and Amazon and is now considered required viewing in RPG circles worldwide.\nHOWEVER! This movie was our first film ever shot in HD, and it has never been released on Blu-Ray, until now. That means no one has seen this movie how it was originally intended! Even those who have seen the HD digital download have not seen this movie look as good as it does now. Thanks to Ben Dobyns and his digital mastering wizardry, The Gamers: Dorkness Rising is now in the format for which it was intended.

We will not get to fulfilling this Kickstarter until after Gen Con, so mid to late August. Please be aware we are intending on selling this inventory at Gen Con and have factored in the extra inventory into the cost. Do not worry, we will not sell your copy(ies).

The other rewards however, will not be offered at Gen Con.

We will make every effort to be clear in our communications and set the correct expectations so that we get the best quality Blu-Ray possible, and reach our fulfillment goals. If all goes well we hope you will be receiving your rewards by the end of August or beginning of September at the latest. \n\nWe will be using BackerKit once again, which has proven invaluable for fulfilling rewards efficiently, as well as raising more money for the project after the campaign has ended.

Once reported, users will have the option of keeping their report private and cataloguing it in case it escalates, or they can make the report public. If they choose to make it public, they will be able to choose from a menu of options on how they want bystanders to support them, take action, or intervene. They will also be given extensive resources including: safety planning, materials on how to differentiate an empty threat from a real threat, online harassment laws and details on how to report their harassment to authorities (if requested), and referrals to other organizations that can provide counseling and legal services.\nBystanders looking to provide support will receive public requests, along with chosen actions of support. You can \u201chave someone\u2019s back\u201d and know that you\u2019re helping them out in a time of need while directly contributing to safer spaces online. HeartMob staff will review all messages and reports to ensure the platform remains safe and supportive.\nWHY: According to a Pew Research Center survey from late last year, 40% of people have been harassed online, and 73% of people have witnessed someone else being harassed online. Among people between the ages of 18 and 29, this figure jumps up to 92%. For too long, many people have left online spaces because they feel unsafe or unsupported. For too long, many of us have sat back and watched, unsure how to ask for help or how to provide support and resources. With HeartMob, you\u2019ll have a system of supporters beside you, and a user-driven set of actions you can take right now to lend a helping hand. HeartMob can change the internet, making sure that we all feel safe, supported, and empowered online. But we need your help to make it a reality.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO: Hollaback! needs to raise $10,000 in three weeks to support the development of the HeartMob platform. With just as little as $1, you can show your support for the project and get in on the ground floor. And thanks to support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation -- your dollar will go over further. If we hit our goal of $10,000, Knight will kick in $2,500 if we get 250 backers, $5000 if we get 500 backers, and $10,000 if we get 1000 backers.

ON TO THE STRETCH GOALS!\nSlay the Budget. Donate Now.\nBecause we had such gosh darn fun making season one and our fans are demanding more, it's time to gear up for an even magical-er second season of After Forever!\nSeason two picks up right where we left off in season one: The dragon scale worked! After 600 years as the People's Guardian, Cade is mortal and finally free to fulfill her life long dream of opening Lady SconeHearts' Bakery. But in a world where modern technology and disposable culture have forced most wizards, dragons and other magical beings into hiding, it's up to Cade to bridge the gap between the simple, magical culture she once belonged to and the fast paced present in which she's found herself. Joining Cade are Tucker-- a devoted fan-boy, LOTR guru and graphic designer-- and his journalist sister Vivian. Together, they help Cade adjust to her 21st century retirement.\nBut when a handsome warlock from Cade's youth reappears and threatens to destroy modern society and return to the old, magical ways, Cade's bonds with Tucker, modern life, and bakery retirement are put to the test in our particular brand of fantastical realism.\nIf you haven't already, check out our first season!\nOrigin Story\nThe first season was produced purely for the joy of filmmaking by a team of full time students at Western Washington University on a budget of $300. (Most of which went to feeding the crew on set, since SetGrumps are the worst kind of Grumps.) \nWe were honored to be selected as an Editor's Pick on The Web Series Channel's website, (http://www.webserieschannel.com/forever/) and the first season premiered in front of over 100 people at Western Washington University at a live screening. Since then, After Forever has been included in the Middle Women Film Festival, and the Bellingham Film Festival's online database.\nWith all the joy that season one created, our freshly graduated writer, director and producer Natalie Fedak and her team of delusional film friends are eager to unite their learning with an actual budget and create their best screen adventure yet. \nAfter Forever's Season One Premier\nMoney = Magic\nGood fantasy films require a little movie magic, and movie magic requires a lot of money. With the warlocks, giants, and medieval bakeries we're introducing in season 2, we need funds to construct sets, stitch costumes and pay for special effects worthy of our earth-bending warlock, Pax. We weren't able to do a lot of world building in season one with such a small budget, and we are excited to explore what happens when the magic-medieval universe Cade comes from bumps up against modern culture. \nRest assured that we aren't going to write in fancy explosions and pod races just because we'll be able to afford them in the second installment, *cough* we're looking at you Lucas *cough,* but we want some flexibility in the amount of wonder we're able to put on your screen. We plan to DaVinci together as many on-set effects as possible, but some things, like re-growing chopped trees and hurling vicious pet rocks into magma will simply look better in CGI. (Our current alternative to CGI magma is to boil hot sauce in a glass dish on the stove. Please don't let us do that.)\nBut good filmmaking isn't just about good stories or good special effects, it's also about having good people on board to help make each other's dreams come true. This isn't a student project anymore, and we want to be able to give back to the talented crew that's working on season 2. We aren't going to earn living wages with this project, but every donation goes towards making sure our team members can live happy, healthy lives so they can bring their happy, healthy selves to set. \nOther less exciting costs include upgrading some of our basic equipment so that what you hear and see sounds and looks better, and taking care of some little nitty gritty office costs that get overlooked and then bite us in the bum, ala printing costs, website fees, and endless dry erase markers.\nDon't Be a Monster. Be a Backer.\nMany producers like to give pie chart visuals of the budget break down, so we've decided to see that pie and raise it a scone.\nThis Budget reflects the bare minimum that we need to make Season 2. If you help us slay this Budget, a second season will rise from its ashes. \nBUT, if you help us super-slay it, then we can make a super second season. Any money we raise beyond our goal will go straight back into the production, so the more we raise, the more detailed the sets, the nicer the costumes, the cooler the locations, AKA, the more magic you'll get to see on screen!\nBattle Plan\nSeason 2 will feature 9 episodes of about 10 minutes each. As of now, we plan to spend May through July in Pre-production (making costumes, props, rehearsing, scheduling locations etc...) and we plan to begin filming in August. Depending on team schedules and Bellingham's often rainy weather, we should be done by late September and into post production by October. (See RISKS SECTION Below for more details.)\nDepending on our CGI budget, we will spend a couple months in post-production, and plan to premier the second season in late winter/early spring of 2016 on our YouTube channel and at public screenings around the Northwest.\nOur Mountain of Why's\nIt's important to us that funders understand why we do what we do. Sure, on the surface, we make goofy movies and swing around swords, but our content and our production process come out of a very intimate place, and we want you to understand the gooey insides of this project. \nOur writer, director, and producer Natalie wrote After Forever for many reasons, but a chief motivation was to see audiences react to a woman written as a conventionally male archetype (ie, warrior, guardian). BOOM: Cade. Similarly, Natalie wondered how people would accept a more emotional, supportive male character, since the gender stereotypes in Hollywood are equally pervasive for men. Enter: Tucker.\nHer mission wasn't to swap the archetypes just for giggles, it was to subvert the way we label certain traits as male or female, and show that every trait is simply \"human.\" Based off people's reactions to season one, audience humans liked it when movie humans felt human. Huh.\nWith season 2, Natalie's excited to show how dynamic characters can be when they aren't shoved into a box, and unless you're a vampire and enjoy dwelling in boxes, we hope you're excited too.\nOur last little dose of inner-gooey comes in the form of Earth friendliness. Our team has been offered a special deal on a solar powered generator from the sustainability engineers at Goal Zero, and regardless how the Kickstarter turns out, our team will be purchasing the equipment to make our future films with renewable energy. A solar power generator isn't the answer to all our prayers, but it's a start, as is composting and recycling on set, using recycled construction materials, drinking from re-usable water bottles and carpooling everywhere possible. \nWe need a planet to make movies on, and for now, Earth is the one we have and the one we should take care of.\nYou can read more about our Team and their inner gooies on our website under the ABOUT US page.\nwww.afterforeverwebseries.com\nPERKS!\nA Sneak Peek at our Stand Alone Perks:\n$50 pledge: A hand crafted Mini Cade Plush Doll\n $50 Pledge: Miniature Creature Figurine\n $300 Pledge: A hand made youth Toth Bow.\nStretch Goals:\nIf we reach $7000, we can afford to fly in The Sorceress from season one! \nIf we reach $8000, we will make miniature models for some of the epic battle scenes at the end, where we need to destroy a whole bunch of buildings. BOOM.\nIf we reach $10,000, we will include a flashback scene of a little Cade and her warlock friend Pax growing up together.\nIf we reach $15,000, we will film Cade giving a scone-baking lesson at Lady Scone Heart's bakery.

But if we raise, say $50,000, then the possibilities for what we can create will expand exponentially, and we'll need time to readjust and implement our new potential (a daunting challenge we are more than willing to take on.) \n\nThe other risk lurking in the dark is staying on schedule. While this has never been a problem for us before, we believe in quality over quantity, so if trolls steal our footage or the rain gods decide to pee on us during an outdoor shoot, we will extend our schedule to make sure we deliver our best movie when it's ready, not a crappy one on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Where the Road Has Led", "update_content": "Nearly three years have passed since last I wrote, and honestly, I didn't know if I would ever post on this page again. \nThe collapse of After Forever was devastating.

Soon, I embraced our play group style and started writing adventures that were more like raunchy cartoons. After all, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. \nOur philosophy: It can't be wrong if it makes us laugh!\nI moved to LA after film school and began film-making and animating. Along the way, I met many fellow gamers and artists. After exchanging hilarious gaming stories with Edward Shannon and Patrick Carpenter, we created the Game Knights half-animated series. We needed a prop, parody version of D&D for the characters to play, so Beasties & Bygones was born! We ended up filling this fantasy game world with so much satire, silliness and raunchy comedy that we realized B&B was too big for just a show, so we started creating the real B&B RPG using storytelling techniques I learned in film school.\nWe are making this ridiculous, possibly offensive parody of D&D because it's funny! \nPlease tell your friends (with a sense of humor) about this campaign. \nEvery pledge that includes a print copy will get one limited edition Afrodo the Archer Meeple FREE*!\n*Afrodo the Archer Meeple is available as an addon to any pledge for $3 each! \nAdventure in the world of the Saytrs & explore sexuality with the Sexuality Supplement!\n We are very close to unlocking the next stretch goal!\nIf we raise $4000, We will create a supplement tat explores the traveling circus in Al'tearth!\n If we reach 150+ backers, this Supplement will be added to the Season One Adventure Bundle.\nTo share click on \"Share this Project\" and then the \u2018f\u2019 button under the video at the top of the page.

They can invoke the Taint to cause randomness and impossible things to happen but they have no control over it. Some of their spells/jokes require people to laugh and most of them feature what we call a Targeted (AoE) Area of Effect.\nDownload Sneak Peek #2 The Ivory Tower of Decency Quick-Start PDF!\nClick here to download the Alpha Version of the Quick-Start!\nAdventure Overview\nNot long ago in a quaint town, a powerful Wizard's child came home and said a bad word. This strict puritan Wizard was so offended, he cast a \"Protection from Words\" spell on his own child, so if he ever spoke that bad word again it would be bleeped. The Wizard was pleased with himself until he noticed that his child was coming home every day, depressed and defeated. He was considered an outsider for not being able to curse while his friends could freely f-bomb each other. The angry Wizard decided, to protect his children from exposure to what he called \"bad words\", he had to cast the spell on the other children as well. He gathered the most powerful wizards and convinced them that to protect their offspring, they had to join forces. They did cast the \"Protection from Words\" spell and not just on all the children but the whole town. Now children could never hear damaging words again and the Wizards Communication Cabal was born. \nOur adventurers stumble into town and are greeted by merchants selling wares, children playing in the streets and somber adult faces. They start noticing the townsfolk are using nonsensical words in place of curses. Eventually, they hear the bleeping as someone attempts to curse. The wizards flex their magic muscles, as more and more words are deemed indecent and thus bleeped out of existence. Soon they target the evil flesh that could tempt our children and a \"Protection from Flesh\" spell is cast. Everybody in the town, including the players have blurry ankles because the wizards decided they didn't want their children seeing a naked ankle. An underground resistance called the Coalition of Cussing (CoC) has been gathering. They've been meeting to curse at each other, define codes for \"bad words\" and to look at each other's ankles. ;)  Will the Wizards accomplish their sanitized goal of having a town full of blurry people bleeping at each other?\nWatch our half-animated comedy series, Game Knights!\nA sophomoric, spoof-filled, fantasy world and the tabletop RPG played in Game Knights, the series.\nBeasties & Bygones is an irreverent, upside down RPG that gives you permission to go too far. Satirical, edgy, social commentary with a comedic overtones. There will be no titillating nudity, but there will be mature themes explored for comedic lampooning. We created a parody game world called Al'tearth where your characters can attack taboo topics while exploring, socializing and misadventuring.\nAll books will be available in Dungeon World and 3.5 Open Game License. To learn about the Dungeon World Rules System click here: Dungeon World!\nNow all we need is finishing funds and support in unlocking stretch goals so we can commission more artwork and writers!\nTheme-based, parody storytelling!\nEvery episode/adventure is crafted around a subject and a thematic question. The players can be aware of the subject but they shouldn't know the exact thematic question. The subject for The Ivory Tower of Decency adventure is censorship, but the thematic question could be: Is freedom of expression worth the risk of Tainting your children?\nBeasties & Bygones adventures are written in a loose 3 act structure.\nMost fronts/encounters represent a different angle/bullet point that will either support the one point of view or support the opposite point of view through challenging dangers/encounters within a loose three act structure. B&B adventures are always designed as if the antagonist is the main character. The players decide how their characters change/grow through role-playing, spending XP, and bonding. Also, it gives the antagonist more depth.\nIf players get too distracted or stagnant the GM can play a Plot Twist. That will change the direction of the whole adventure and move the story along. The Plot Twists typically represent the opponent's actions off-screen!\nAl'tearth is a low tech magic-infused clone of Earth!\nAl'tearth's geography is almost an exact replica of Medieval Earth because it was created with a powerful clone spell by an earthborn wizard from middle ages named Gareth Guygaxian. Since it was created to protect the creatures of magic, it is a low-tech world. The clone spell drained Earth of it's magic, superstitions, \"Mythical Creatures\" and Ancient Gods.\nMany Mythical Creatures call Al'tearth their home but most Beasties were tainted upon arrival:\nSome creatures were but a daydream on Earth & now exist in Al'tearth, like the Dingle Faeries; tainted faeries that serve the Excremental Gods. \nSome creatures were merged into one like the Chupasasquatch; The Chupacabra of Mexican lore merged with the Sasquatch or like Mime-pyres; who were Vampires that merged with Mimes.\nAncient Gods from all mythologies have been twisted into bizarre bygones of their former selves. They govern each other with a yearly award ceremony and grant each other positions in the Zodiac Council. Sampling of Bygones:\nPenetor, the God of Fertility was Priapus in Ancient Greece.\nHermaphrodite wasn't always the androgynous lord of sexual ambiguity, s/he was once Aphrodite, Greek God of love, beauty, and sexual passion:only \nThe races are fragmented across this medieval alter-earth and are as varied as the lands they originated from on earth:\n\nSatyrs are a debaucherous society that elects it's king every four years with a triathlon that includes competing in a drinking challenge, a talent show and public intimate performances. They must have intimacy every 7 days or they frenzy.\nThree-Quarterlings are halflings that grew a little taller then their halfling cousins and have formed a a society that is pretty close to Utopia. They come in all colors and the only judgement they make on each other is size. The taller they are the more status received.\nHalf-Ettins are, essentially a race of co-joined twins. They are rather rare and their life involves heavy co-operation because each head controls half of he body. (Note this will be a cool role-play option as two players can play one half of a character. Wrestling for control of each action or cooperating and making two heads truly better than one.)\nFunding Goals\nThis Kickstarter funds the creation of the Beasties & Bygones Corebook and the Season One Adventure Bundle.

That means two different sets of books/PDFs, albeit with a lot of content overlap, each with their own rules. For this print run of the physical books, we are going with a print-on-demand publisher who has a strong reputation to ensure that printing/shipping goes smoothly.\n\nOur backers are very important - that's why we've researched and received guidance from several successful Kickstarters like Ron Newcomb (The Rangers), Andres Salazar (Pariah, MI), and others. Critical Hit Media is committed to bringing you entertainment with no boundaries. Why? Because It's Funny! And that has been the driving force behind our vision. We pledge, alongside your pledges, that we will be resolute in our attention to this project, and that we'll provide you with many great adventures to adventure upon!\n\nOur goal is to deliver an irreverent, funny, high-quality product on time. We padded the delivery times a little bit because this is our first Kickstarter. The game world is bursting with loads of content, the book is being laid out in rough form, and some of the artwork for the book is complete. With two different versions of the book, however, there is the potential for possible delivery delays due to unforeseen circumstances. It is possible that we may need to adjust things with the printer to make sure the book looks amazing and accurate.

You'll have a chance to play some of your favorite classic Nintendo characters in a 2-tiered race to the finish line (top 3 advance). The good people of ExplodingRabbit.com have not only given their blessing, but have asked us for footage of the race To that end we'll be recording the performance of our top 3 and uploading them to Youtube for posterity.\nPrize support will also be provided by our pals from across the bridge at i play videogames!\nCosplay Event\nDo you have stuff?

Oh, hello! We didn't see you there...\n50 Shades of Shame\nSaturday night  will feature a grownups-only event that will see Scott, Brian, and Conner reading excerpts from 50 Shades of Grey in the voices of various cartoon characters and celebrities drawn at random from a hat.

To that end, we'll be reimbursing our judges, organizers, and gamemasters who run a certain number of hours worth of events. A 1-day badge will be reimbursed for anyone who runs 8 hours of events, and a 3-day badge will be reimbursed for anyone who runs 18 hours of events.\nJust our way of saying thanks!\nSee you in May!\n\nMULTIPLE REWARDS\nSo you want to buy more than one badge? No problem! Just pick the most expensive of your rewards, and after clicking through, simply add on the price of any other rewards you also want. For example, instead of making two accounts to get a couple of 3-day badges, simply pick the 3-day reward once, and then donate 90 dollars instead of 45.

It's a really good time. Here's the trailer link to Orcs!: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7NPGypXGZk\nMythica is the most ambitious indie fantasy project ever undertaken. We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, with several more films in the Mythica series planned.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes, has been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers. \nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 2: The Darkspore with you. It is even bigger, better and more epic than the first film.\nHere's a quick word from the creators of Mythica:\nHOW CAN I WATCH MYTHICA 1?\nIf you'd like to catch-up and watch Mythica 1, it premiered in the US on CONtv, so click on the CONtv Originals logo below to create a free account and watch Mythica 1!\nIf you live outside of the US, you can download Mythica 1 directly from our website. Go to: http://watch.arrowstormentertainment.com\nHere is a trailer for Mythica 1:\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Darkspore\nWhen Teela\u2019s sister is murdered and a powerful relic stolen, Marek and her friends face a sinister new enemy - Kishkumen, a foreign mystic bent on reclaiming the Darkspore for his master Szorlok. Armed with twin maps, Marek and her team race Kishkumen and his horde through creature-infested lands, to a long abandoned underground city \u2013 all the while pursued by bounty hunters intent on returning Marek to slavery.\nJoined by the mysterious dark-elf warrior \u2013 Qole \u2013 the team journeys deep underground to discover that the ruined city is now home to an undead dragon. Trapped between Kishkumen and the dragon, Marek and her team must employ all their skill and magic to battle the beast, and combat Kishkumen for their hard won treasure and their lives.\nMelanie Stone plays Marek, a natural-born necromancer with a club foot. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, and He Knows My Name.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars and the upcoming release, Dragon Warriors.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nNicola Posener plays Teela, a priestess of the Order of Ana-Sett. Arrowstorm fans will recognize her from her starring role in Dawn of the Dragonslayer, while she has also starred in several British films and TV series, including Disney's House of Anubis.\n Rocky Myers play Qole, a mysterious Dark Elf warrior. Rocky is a very talented actor who has starred in previous Arrowstorm films Survivor and Cyborg X. You can also catch him in the action-thriller Safari and the kids adventure, RoboRex.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his first appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor, and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew.\n The film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all underway. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, dragon sequences, etc. We want the movie to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\n Backers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $75,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $75,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe've sent Mythica: A Quest for Heroes (the first film in the series) out to a few reviewers and have received some stellar feedback:\nMOVIE PILOT REVIEW\nGEEK DAD REVIEW\nTV EQUALS REVIEW\nALEX BLEDSOE REVIEW\nFAITH GEEK REVIEW\nDUNGEON CRAWLER REVIEW\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade.
