It\u2019s a wacky roleplaying game of action comedy! \nYou can pick up the core rules in PDF for just \u00a37 or softcover for \u00a314!\nHardcover collector's omnibus, softcover rules and adventures, blank ID cards, monster cards, hero role cards, VTT tokens\nAre you a fan of the Ghostbusters RPG from the 1980s? Danger Mouse or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Bill & Ted or Rick & Morty? Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, Dracula, or sci-fi adventures on the final frontier? Do you enjoy chortling at TV tropes or chuckling at pop-culture parodies? Then the Awfully Cheerful Engine! is here for you!\nACE! is brought to you by Russ 'Morrus' Morrissey (EN World, WOIN, Judge Dredd & The Worlds of 2000 AD), Dave Chapman (Doctor Who, Star Trek Adventures), and Marc Langworthy (Hellboy, Judge Dredd & The Worlds of 2000 AD). With a foreword by Sandy Petersen, co-author of the Ghostbusters RPG!\nACE! is designed for everybody! From talking animals to pulp heroes to eldritch horrors, kids and adults alike will find adventures to love with the Awfully Cheerful Engine!\nThis tabletop roleplaying game, which we\u2019re calling ACE! with an exclamation point, is one of fast, cinematic, action comedy. To play you need a handful of six-sided dice, a pen, and some paper. Each player plays one Hero, except for one player who takes the role of the Director.\nThink of ACE! as an irreverent, fun-packed movie. You might play as ghost hunters in New York City, a band of plucky galactic guardians, vampire slayers, or soldiers of fortune in the Los Angeles underground. Heck, you might even be cartoon animals. Good grief!\nThis is a multi-dimensional, time-hopping, genre-mashing, pan-galactic portal into any type of adventure you can imagine! Want to play in a fantasy world full of elves and orcs? Crew a starship as it explores the galaxy? Hunt vampires in Victorian London? Play as animal detectives, robot cowboys, wizards, ninjas, or time traveling bounty hunters?\nThe only limit is your imagination, and the requirement that you have fun.\nThis Kickstarter is for the full five-book set.\nWhat? Five books, you say? Fear not -- they're pretty small books! They include the core rules, and four hilarious genre-hopping adventures. Each book is about 30 pages long. Except for one which is longer, but we wrote 'BUMPER SIZE ISSUE' on the front of that, so it's OK. If you\u2019ve ever held a comic-book in your hand, the Awfully Cheerful Engine! will feel very familiar! \nThe core rulebook is just 30 pages in a bright, colorful comic-book sized format. We even gave it an issue number, like a comic-book! After that, each 'issue' is a standalone adventure, designed for one-shots or short campaigns with new characters each time. One week you might be fighting ghosts on the streets of Manhattan, and the next you might be exploring the frontiers of space in your trusty starship!\nYou don't have to play them all, or in order. The standalone format means you can fit them in whenever and however you feel like it. GM can't make your regular game? Go bust some ghosts instead! Pickup game at a convention? Investigate the strange goings-on in a small American town in the 1980s. Running a livestream? Board a starship and fight the Kulkan Empire! Play one of them, some of them, or all of them! It's up to you!\nAre they comics? Or are they RPGs? (They're RPGs)\n ACE #1: Introducing the Awfully Cheerful Engine! With a foreword by Ghostbusters RPG author Sandy Petersen, this book tells you the rules, how to create your Heroes, and gives you a bunch of Extras (NPCs & monsters) to use. By Russ Morrissey.\n ACE #2: Spirits of Manhattan. Strap on your Anti-Plasm Particle Thrower, grab your Electromagnetic Field Detector, and jump into your Ghostmobile. New York City needs your help! By Dave Chapman and Russ Morrissey.\n ACE #3: Montana Drones & The Raiders of the Cutty Sark. At the request of Army Intelligence, Montana Drones and her team travel the globe in search of lost or hidden artefacts, often exploring dangerous sites and racing against hostile enemy agents to keep the objects of their quests from falling into the wrong hands. Striking locations, exciting chases, dangerous enemies and monotonous classroom lectures await! By Marc Langworthy.\n ACE #4: Strange Science. Welcome to Wilden Falls, your average American town in the heart of the country. Surrounded by trees, nature, and there\u2019s a wonderful waterfall that brings the tourists. It\u2019s a quaint little town. Until weird things start happening at the local research facility, people go missing, and there\u2019s a sudden influx of fitness nuts in the town. That\u2019s before we get to the time travel, bodysnatching, and portals to other dimensions. Maybe \u2018strange\u2019 isn\u2019t strong enough a word for it! By Dave Chapman.\n ACE #5: Beam Me Up! These are the voyages of the starship FSS Brazen. Its continuing mission: to recklessly go where plenty of people have probably been before\u2026 and hope a major interstellar incident isn\u2019t sparked in the process. In this highly illogical adventure for the ACE! roleplaying game, you\u2019ll explore frontiers you never thought you had. By Marc Langworthy.\nPlus unlocked Stretch Goals:\n ACE #6: Orcs & Oubliettes. You've played warriors and wizards before. You've delved into dungeons and battled with dragons. But not like this you haven't! Join the Dusk Watch and save the city of Heq Moreveg in ORCS & OUBLIETTES, a Pratchett-esque parody of the world's most popular roleplaying game.\n ACE #7: BITE ME! From Victorian London to the heart of Transylvania, you'll meet werewolves, ghosts, zombies, and worse in your hunt for the legendary vampire himself, Count Dracula!\n ACE #8: Domes of Thunder. Battle mutants in a post-apocalyptic wasteland! Explosions, armored trucks, and villainous cults feature in DOMES OF THUNDER as you fight for limited resources of petrol. Mayhem awaits!\nAnd up next:\n ACE #9: Accidental Anthropomorphic Animal Heroes. Fan of Danger Mouse or TMNT? In ACCIDENTAL ANTHROPOMORPHIC ANIMAL HEROES you'll play a wisecracking animal hero and defend your city's streets from evil villains. Who are also probaby animals. Cartoon action! \nWe give you four adventures to start with, and we have plans for more (see the Stretch Goals, below), but there's also a free compatibility license so anybody can write and publish material powered by the Awfully Cheerful Engine!\nHardy Hobbit. Teenage Samurai. Cheerful Stuntman. Clumsy Vampire. Squeamish Ghost. Who knew you could say so much in just two words? The possibilities are endless.\nIt\u2019s not just Awfully Cheerful! It\u2019s fast and fun, too!\nYou won\u2019t get bogged down in endless rules and character sheets that look like tax forms. Your ACE! ID Card contains everything you need to know, and it\u2019s only about the size of a credit card! But don\u2019t try to spend it. It\u2019s not a real credit card. Honestly, we tried, and it didn't end well.\nYou can download blank ID cards from our website. Don't worry, there's a printer-friendly black-and-white version too!\nMaking your Hero takes about five minutes. And that includes a coffee break. \nYou can choose from an array of talking animals, alien and fantasy species, and occupations from a bunch of genres. Play a cat, a crow, or a turtle. An alien, an elf, a robot, or a vampire. A knight, a pirate, or a wizard. An astronaut, a burglar, a reporter, or a spy. The core book has dozens of Roles to get you started with, and each adventure book introduces more!\nEven better, you can already use our online character builder and make a character in about 30 seconds! It's so quick! Give it a try! And if you felt like sharing your Hero on Twitter with the hashtag #awfullycheerful and a link to this page, well, we'd be most awfully grateful!\nBuild your Hero online!\nAlternatively, each adventure comes with its own selection of pre-generated characters. If you don't want to make your own characters, you can simply use those - perfect for one-shots or new players!\nDownload the pre-gens for all four adventures from the official website!\nIn A.C.E! each Hero (that's you!) has a Role. Your Role gives you a special ability only you can use. Here's a quick look at some of the Roles you can play!\nTalking animals like Ape, Cat, Crow, Dog, Kangaroo, and Turtle.\nSpecies like Alien, Dwarf, Elf, Ghost, Goblin, Golem, Hobbit, Monster, Ogre, Robot, Vampire, and Werewolf.\nFantasy roles like Alchemist, Assassin, Barbarian, Cleric, Druid, Knight, Ninja, Outlaw, Pirate, Ranger, Samurai, Slayer, and Wizard.\nOccupations like Actor, Archeologist, Astronaut, Athlete, Bounty Hunter, Boxer, Burglar, Chef, Con Artist, Cowboy, Detective, Doctor, Engineer, Gambler, Gangster, Hacker, Hermit, Inventor, Musician, Pilot, Priest, Professor, Reporter, Scientist, Smuggler, Soldier, Spy, Student, and Stuntman.\nEven a couple of superheroes like Speedster and Vigilante! \nYep, you can play a Ghost. You don\u2019t take damage unless its from a holy source or some special sci-fi ecto-gadget. But you also can\u2019t pick things up. So there\u2019s that.\nEach of the adventures adds some more Roles (or recommends some old ones)!\n Spirits of Manhattan adds Ghost, Demonologist, Doctor, Engineer, Exorcist, Inventor, Priest, Professor, Scientist, and Student.\n Raiders of the Cutty Sark adds Botanist, Double-Agent, Socialite, and Witch.\n Strange Science adds Brain, Cheerleader, Outsider, Protector, Radio Presenter, and Tycoon.\n Beam Me Up adds Captain, Chief Engineer, Comms, Hologram, Gunner, Counsellor, and Pilot.\nACE! is a pretty fast, light game. If you played 1986's Ghostbusters RPG, you'll see the influence immediately.\nStats! The AWFULLY CHEERFUL ENGINE! is a d6 dice pool system*. You have four Stats -- Smarts, Moves, Style, and Brawn. If you have a Moves score of 3, you roll three six-sided dice when you try to jump a motorcycle over a ravine. If you roll high enough, you succeed. It's pretty simple!\nFocuses! For each Stat you also have a Focus. For Smarts it might be a science, or chess, or history. For Style it might be bluffing, singing, or fashion, and for Brawn it might be brawling or swimming. You can choose from plenty of focuses. Foci. Focuses. Whatever.  Anyway, if the thing you're trying to do relates to a Focus, you get to roll an extra two dice.\nTrait! You choose a trait, like Angry or Cheerful or Rebellious or Despondent. This, combined with your Role, makes you a Gullible Vampire, a Brave Turtle, or a Squeamish Scientist.\nKarma! Finally, you have a bunch of Karma points. These can be spent for extra dice or to absorb damage from attacks, and they're recovered by using your trait.\n\n*Fun fact -- did you know that 1986's Ghostbusters RPG, by Sandy Petersen, Lynn Willis and Greg Stafford, was the first ever dice pool RPG? Also Sandy Petersen has written an awesome foreword for the AWFULLY CHEERFUL ENGINE!\nWhat, I hear you ask, is a CALAMITY DIE?\nThe Calamity Die is how you find out that your friends really aren't your friends. You see, when you make a roll, one of those dice is a different color, and is called the Calamity Die. And if your roll fails, and also the Calamity Die rolls a 1, your so-called 'friends' decide what happens to you. It won't kill you or anything, but...\nWell, we'll leave that thought with you.\nNooooo! And it was all going so well!\nWe bet you just can't wait to take a peek inside. Well, fear not! We've got some top-secret sneaky previews for you. But sssshhhhh! Don't tell anybody.\n\nWhat game of action comedy doesn't feature an array of colorful monsters and NPCs? Fantasy, modern, or sci-fi, we've got dragons, cops, vampires, wizards, even hunter-killer cyborgs!\nEach book introduces some new Roles for your Heroes. In Spirits of Manhattan you can play a ghost, a demonologist, a doctor, an engineer, an exorcist, an inventor, a priest, a professor, a scientist, or a student. Yes, we said you could play a ghost.\nTake a look at the equipment pages of Spirits of Manhattan -- an array of hi-tech totally reliable (honest) ecto-gizmos designed to help your ghost-hunting. From ElectroMagnetic Field Detectors to \"Spirit Stopper\" Anti-Plasm Particle Throwers, we've got it all! We also have a little rule there which collates the dollar value of all the collateral damage you do.\nRaiders of the Cutty Sark will have you fighting Nazis for ancient artefacts in the late 1930s. From ambassadorial parties to occultists at Halycon Hall to ancient temples and monsters with horrible tentacles, don't leave your whip and hat at home!\nIn Strange Science, your Heroes will visit the town of Wilden Falls in 1984, when the town is being overrun by a host of creepy artificial pod people called Steve... \n... and its precursor, Wildenville, in 1884! Of course to do this they'll need the help of an eccentric scientist and a time machine.\nWe're sure this abandoned mine is perfectly safe. Nothing to worry about there. Nope, nothing to see here. \nIn Beam Me Up you play a starship crew in the Federated League of Planets (FLoP). You'll meet a super soldier out for revenge, encounter a strange, powerful entity called R, and cross blazer pistols with the Kulkan Empire.\nThe crew of the FSS Brazen and its continuing mission: to recklessly go where plenty of people have probably been before\u2026 and hope a major interstellar incident isn\u2019t sparked in the process. \nThis super-special omnibus 7\"x10\" 180-page hardcover collector's edition contains all five books -- and it gets bigger and better as we unlock stretch goals!\nThis book also includes a bonus appendix with pre-generated characters, and full-page maps. \nThe Collector's Omnibus Edition costs \u00a3100. At present it contains ACE! issues #1-5. But we want to make it bigger and better! As we unlock more issues through stretch goals (see below) these will be added to the hardcover. The price will remain the same!\nWe have created three card decks. You can add these decks to your pledge once you have selected your reward tier. To select a physical card deck, you must have selected a physical reward tier. Each deck costs \u00a310 (about $14).\nShipping! Unlike our books, the cards are only printed in the US, and the international shipping fees for cards are pretty high, and beyond our control. We know that sucks, and we're sorry, but we've left the choice up to you. Please make sure you check the shipping cost when selecting an add-on! We've included a 'combined shipping' option for all three card decks to help save on shipping costs.\nCustoms! Cards are not books, so they may trigger a customs charge at your location if you are not in the US.\nPDFs! Alternatively, all three card decks come in a handy PDF format so you can print them out at home. The Blank ID Cards are free in PDF; the other two decks are \u00a34 each.\nBlank I.D. Cards\nA deck of 40 blank A.C.E! ID cards, in four colors (10 each of green, blue, yellow, and black-and-white). \nThese come in blue and black-and-white, too!\nThese are glossy cards. These cards can be written on with wet or dry-erase markers. They can't be written on with a pencil. We also provide free cards which you can print out at home.\nExtras Card Deck\nAlso available as an add-on is an Extras card deck containing nearly 60 cards. This deck contains a card for each of the monsters and NPCs (non-player characters, which we call 'Extras') found across all five books, color-coded based on the book they came from - 22 yellow cards from the core rules, 8 brown cards from Raiders of the Cutty Sark, 11 green cards from Spirits of Manhattan, 8 purple cards from Strange Science, and 6 blue cards (including 3 starships) from Beam Me Up. \nWe call monsters and NPCs 'Extras'. Like in a movie, geddit?\nRole Deck\nFinally, we have a deck for players, with each possible Role on a card. Robots, vampires, dogs, cats, ninjas, scientists, elves, trolls, aliens, ghosts, the whole works! There are dozens of Roles in this deck, from different genres, taken from all five books.\nIt's role-tastic!\n\nWe've written the first 5 issues of ACE! We want to write more and we'll be able to write them if we make certain funding targets. Please help us write them! Here's how it works.\nEverybody who backs the \u00a345 I'm ALL IN! (PDF) tier or higher gets all the unlocked PDF adventure stretch goal issues for free. Yep, you will get more issues of ACE! in PDF format.\nEverybody who backs the \u00a370 ACE! The Full Set (Softcover) tier or higher will be sent coupons which allows them to purchase the softcovers of each unlocked issue at half price plus shipping (plus the PDFs for free of course).\nAll the unlocked adventure stretch goal issues will also be included in the hardcover Omnibus: Collector's Edition. That book will get bigger and better with each stretch goal we unlock.\nEach tier (over on the right) also tells you which stretch goals it includes. \nWe'll reveal the first stretch goal soon. We can't wait! This deal just keeps on getting better... we can't help ourselves! We're so excited, and we just can't hide it!\nStretch Goal Delivery\nWhile the initial 5-issue set will be delivered very quickly (in PDF and softcover format), the stretch goal issues will be be delivered to you one-by-one as they are completed, so you could be be receiving new ACE! issues periodically into 2022 (depending how many stretch goals get unlocked) to add to the five adventures you will already have. It's basically like a comic-book subscription which gets better in value with each stretch goal.\nThe Collector's Omnibus Edition won't be completed until the stretch goal adventures are completed. Because of causality.\nWe've designed the Awfully Cheerful Engine! with one-shots and streaming in mind. It takes a couple of minutes to make a character and a couple more to learn the rules. It's light and flexible, and doesn't need miniatures or battlemaps. And it'll make you laugh. It's the perfect streamable game!\nWe're VTT ready, baby! A character sheet, art, tokens, and maps!\nBut there's more! We know that many of you like to play online using Virtual Tabletops (VTTs). We've made VTT packages for the four ACE! adventures in this Kickstarter. These include dozens of tokens, plus maps and images from the adventures which you can use immediately with any VTT of your choice. You automatically get these free with the adventures. Yep, you heard that right. Free!\nVTT token packs!\nWe've also already made a character sheet available on one leading VTT! You can start using it right now!\nBelow you'll find a one-hour actual play run by Morrus. It features four talking animals (a Greedy Crow, a Fickle Cat, a Despondent Robot, and an Unruly Turtle) as they try to save a department store from a gang of apes! If you prefer an audio format, this actual play is also available as a podcast episode on Morrus' Unofficial Tabletop RPG Talk.\n You can also watch the stream below, courtesy of our friends at Tablestory as they play through a custom adventure of their own making! We'd tell you they weren't paid to say nice things about our game... but let's face it. They were.\nThere's a lot of stuff available in this Kickstarter. 5 softcover books, 1 hardcover book, and 3 card decks, plus PDFs and VTT assets. The image below helps to summarize all that at a glance. We've also provided an \"I'M ALL IN\" reward tier so you can grab everything at once without having to sort through add-ons.\nLet's talk about shipping. At the moment we are shipping to US, UK, Canada, EU, Scandinavia, and Australia. Our books are printed and shipped from the US and the UK. Our cards are printed and shipped from the US.\nWe know that shipping can be a pain point for many, especially those outside the US. Unfortunately, we have no control over the shipping costs. \nYou will be advised of the shipping costs to your country when you select your pledge tier, before you complete your pledge. Generally US is the cheapest, while Australia and Scandinavia are the highest.\nCards! Shipping for cards is very high outside the US. We have given you the option, but reward tiers which include cards will attract higher shipping fees for non-US backers. We also offer PDF alternatives for the three card sets, which can reduce your shipping fees considerably (you can get these as add-ons when you pledge).\nPlease note that cards and books are printed and shipped separately, so pledge tiers with both will add the total for both packages.\nEU! If you're in the EU, you might see extra tarriffs or customs charges added by your country. We can't predict this, and again it's not something we have any control over.\nHere at EN Publishing we have built a reputation over the years for fast and reliable Kickstarter delivery, often fulfilling Kickstarters immediately upon completion. Here's what you can expect from us:\nPDFs of ACE! issues #1-5 will be sent when the Kickstarter campaign ends. Expect those to go out in June 2021.\nOther digital items (card deck PDFs, VTT tokens, maps, etc.) will also be sent out at the same time as the PDFs.\nSoftcovers of ACE! issues #1-5 will be printed and shipped as soon as the Kickstarter funds are collected and cleared, which takes about two weeks. Expect to have those by August 2021.\nCard decks are printed and shipped separately to the books. We'll order them at the same time as the softcovers, but they do take longer to ship, especially outside the US.\nPDFs of unlocked stretch goal issues #6+ will be sent as they are completed over the coming year much like a comic-book subscription.\nThe Collector's Omnibus hardcover will be printed and shipped when the stretch goals have been completed (because the stretch goals are being included in it). Expect to see that in 2022. Obviously the more stretch goals we unlock, the longer that'll be. \nSo you'll be able to start playing the Awfully Cheerful Engine! as soon as the Kickstarter ends! You won't have to wait. And by the time you finish the first five adventures, more will have arrived.\nWe have the proofs already. Just awaiting funding for the print run! See! No waiting!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe PDF versions are ready to go! There's no risk to you, and we'll send the PDFs out as soon as the Kickstarter campaign ends. For the softcover version, we will be able to fund the print order as soon as the Kickstarter ends, and will print and ship them to you as fast as possible. The only possible delays would be COVID-related. NOTE: We print EU books in the UK. Brexit may cause delays and additional fees on on shipments to the EU.

In these pages you'll find jackalopes, wampus cats, dreaming trees, and flower mice, plus fey beasts inspired by folklore; and you'll venture into the Hedgegrove, the realm of Princess Dandelion, an immortal Archfey of the Summer Court. This content is brought to you in softcover format for the first time ever!\n\nThis is a \"Quickstarter\" -- it's only here for two weeks, so don't miss out! Note that if you pledge for the digital (PDF) versions, they will be delivered as soon as the Kickstarter campaign ends. The softcover booklets will take a little longer.\nHere's a look at the contents of this 33-page book.\n Adventure in the Feywild. An adventure from Kiel Chenier. The adventurers are trapped in a strange land - can they find their way home? And can they navigate the labyrinthine Hedgegrove, domain of Princess Daneliean Dendelion? Illustrated by Egil Thompson.\n From Stranger Woods. Four fantastical new fey monsters for your 5E game! The goat-horned ochokochi with a bony cleaver; the capricious trickster poludnitsa; the angelic-looking samovila, ladies of drought and harvest; and the repulsive via, with their gaze of dread. These creatures are inspired by Eastern European folklore. By Artem Serebrennikov; illustarted by Sade.\n Fearsome Critters. Writer John Bupp takes a look at a handful of fearsome fey critters! The small, apelike agropelter hurls branches from nearby trees; the infamous jackalope can mimic any sound it hears; the short, pudgy puckwudgie can be helpful, but a terrible foe if slighted; and the six-legged campus cat can terrify its prey with its mere gaze. Illustrated by Vanessa Bailey.\n Beasts of the Feywild. More summer means more fey! This time we have a bunch of new fey beasts for your 5E game - from the Dreaming Tree to the Sylvan Spaniel, from the Moon Horse to the Flower Mouse, these creatures from writer Jason Reilly are sure to enhance your game sessions! Illustrated by Vanessa Bailey.\nWe knew you'd want a list of the monsters in this book. They range from CR 0 to CR 11.\n Agropelter (CR 1). 3-ft. villainous ape-ducks able to hurl tree branches.\n Dreaming Tree (CR 5). A fey tree which feasts on the dreams of those sleeping nearby.\n Flower Mouse (CR 0). A tiny fey creature sometimes used as a mount by flower fey and faeries.\n Golden Goat (CR 1/4). A radiant creature with a shining fleece. You've heard of this one.\n Hazel Fish (CR 1/2). A shy fish able to grant wisdom to those who eat it.\n Jackalope (CR 4). A rabbit... with antlers, and a talent for mimicry.\n Mirage Butterfly (CR 1/8). Mounts of the flower fey with minor illusion powers.\n Moon Horse (CR 2). The preferred mount of the Summer Court, this horse appears to be made of ivory.\n Ochoduchi (CR 6). An 8-ft tall horned goat humanoid with razorsharp claws, based on a monster from Georgian folklore.\n Poludnitsa (CR 4). A capricious trickster which adopts different guises, based on a creature from Polish, Russian, and Slovak folklore.\n Puckwudgie (CR 1/2). A short, grey-skinned shapeshifter, capable of good or evil.\n Samovila (CR 9). A tall winged fey of drought and harvest with otherworldy features which holds great power in the faerie courts; based on a creature from Serbian and Bulgarian folklore.\n Swarm of Flower Mice (CR 1/4). Flower mice are not dangerous alone, but can swarm their enemies.\n Swarm of Mirage Butterflies (CR 1/2). A swarm of mirage butterflies can combine their illusion powers to greater effect.\n Sylvan Manx (CR 0). These cats come and go as they please.\n Sylven Spaniel (CR 1/4). Companion dogs for fey princes, sometimes used as mounts by tiny fey.\n Viy (CR 11). A loathsome, evil fey with a gaze of dread, inspired by a creature from Ukrainian folklore.\n Wampus Cat (CR 3). A fetid-smelling six-legged black cat with a frightening gaze.\nBut if you buy this book for anything, buy it for the sylvan spaniel. How cute is this?\nIn addtion to the 18 fey monsters, Adventure Into The Feywild is a 15-page adventure by Kiel Chenier included in Into the Feywild. In this adventure for 1st-5th level characters the adventurers are trapped in a strange land\u2014can they navigate the labyrinthine Hedgegrove, domain of Princess Daneliean Dandelion, and find their way home?\nWhen it was originally released for EN5ider's 100th issue back in 2016, the included adventure got some glowing reviews.\n\"If you are comfortable improvising and roleplaying, this is one of the best and easiest modules to run. The charts are amazing, hilarious and lead to some truly great moments. I needed very little prep time which was much appreciated. I think my players will remember this session fondly for a long time.\"\n\"The random tables alone are incredible.  The adventure is great, too, but I'll be re-using these tables!\"\n\"My party loved this adventure so, so much.

As Black men who grew up having to actively seek out information on our historical figures, we understand the significance of sharing these stories with the youth in a way that is both fun and entertaining. \nBlack children need to know that they were more than slaves and contributed heavily to creating what America is today. These aren't just Black heroes, these are OUR heroes. \nAnd we are hoping that you see the value in telling these stories through animation, science fiction and Hip Hop. By creating this pilot episode, we hope to create an entire series on our unsung heroes. \nOur Heroes Rock also has plans to expand and tell the stories of unsung heroes for all minority groups.\nIt's not about making money, it's about making something that deserves to exist.\nConceived as a hip-hop odyssey through Black History, \u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d is an animated series that shines a spotlight on history\u2019s unsung Heroes of color through infectious music, stunning 3D animation and a family-friendly, sci-fi-flavored narrative designed to appeal to both parents and kids alike.   \nJoin Electronic Tour guide E-Tour and explore the Heroes of Black History!\nExecutive-Produced by world-renowned talent and TV personality Ettore Ewen, award-winning artist and narrative designer Jonathan Davenport and award-winning sports and cultural historian Andreas Hale, \u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d has one simple goal, to create an educational vehicle that\u2019s so visually and musically appealing that audiences would watch it regardless of the content. \nOur aim is to place American Heroes such as Medgar Evers, Ida B. Wells and Nina Simone in the same historical echelon reserved for George Washington, Thomas Edison and Neil Armstrong.  \nEarly concept art of the Hall of Heroes - the Museum of the Future!\n\u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d takes place in a futuristic, hologram-heavy museum known as the HALL OF HEROES (imagine the Smithsonian if it was designed by Tony Stark), where students from all over the world are able to tour the exhibits virtually via robotic avatars called K.I.D.D.O.s. \nCompact and sturdy, K.I.D.D.O.s allow kids to safely explore the vast Hall of Heroes!\nLeading them on this \u201celectronic tour\u201d is E-TOUR, a wisecracking, larger-than-life robotic tour guide! As E-TOUR leads the KIDDOs through the Hall of Heroes, each stop spotlights a single exhibit featuring an American Hero from Black History. When activated by E-TOUR, music starts pumping and the exhibit explodes around the KIDDOs into an immersive music video-style narrative performed by a curated stable of hip-hop artists who tell that Hero\u2019s story through rhythm and rhyme.  \nEarly concept art of E-Tour, your Electronic Tour Guide!\n The lesson we learn from each Hero\u2019s experience will tie directly into an emotional obstacle, fear or insecurity that one of the kids is feeling at the beginning of the episode, summarizing the theme of the episode and illustrating how empowering history and representation can be.  \nEarly concept art of American Hero Ruby Bridges.\nAs creators, we know from our experiences growing up that educational content for its own sake is just not that attractive. As a kid, you can smell it from a mile away. That\u2019s why our goal is to make \u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d feel like a show that would\u2019ve been produced on the merits of its visual and narrative trappings alone.  \nEarly concept art of your electronic tour guide, E-Tour!\nElements like VR drones, futuristic settings and living robots are all there to make this series feel more like a theme park experience than a classroom one. Our dream is that this series lives year-round, not just during Black History Month. When \u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d is shown in classrooms, we want kids to feel transported rather than talked to. We want parents to NOT have to roll their eyes and cover their ears when their kids want to watch this show in a nonstop streaming loop at home. \nEarly concept art of a few of the KIDDO's many hidden features!\nWe believe we have all the necessary pieces in place and hopefully, with support from our backers, we can make these dreams a reality and bring \u201cOur Heroes Rock!\u201d into the homes, schools and mobile devices of families everywhere.\nWith your help, we can shine a light on unsung American Heroes and Kickstart History!\nOur Goal: (FUNDED!!!)\nMaking an animated short is expensive and a significant amount of work for a small, dedicated team. From the animation to the original song, it's going to take a great deal of effort. We set our goal to $75,000 to make a pilot episode that is 4 minutes long and will cover everything from artist fees to Kickstarter reward expenses. However, we are hoping to raise $150,000 to make the highest quality project that will extend the length of the short and allow us to create a narrative that will truly honor Ruby Bridges. \nReward Bundles!\nAs you may have seen, we\u2019ve also added two new reward tiers with OHR hoodies and socks. We know, you've already supported us and it tears you apart knowing that you can only support one thing.\nWell, what if we told you that we fixed that for those who want multiple rewards?\nWait for it\u2026\nBUNDLES!\nNow you don\u2019t have to worry about missing out on our most popular rewards.\nStarting now you can bundle your rewards together.

Before we get started, I know it's been a really long, strange, difficult 12 months for a lot of us, so I hope everyone is doing okay and staying safe.\nSo... where were we?\nIn the not-too-distant past \u2013 about 6 years ago, November 2015 AD \u2013 we ran a Kickstarter to BRING BACK MST3K after 15 years in hibernation.\nIt was a little bit stressful, and a lot of work, but I've gotta tell you... the whole experience went better than we had ever hoped:\nThanks to you, our campaign broke a bunch of Kickstarter records.\nOver 48,000 of you took up the cause... and together, we raised over $6 million.\nWith your help, we got picked up on Netflix and made 20 new episodes!\nAnd you know, you can't ever please everybody, but it seems like most of you were pretty happy with 'em.... and the critics were too: \nAlso, having those new episodes on Netflix, along with a lot of our \"classic\" episodes, helped a lot of folks discover Mystery Science Theater for the first time. So, if you weren't there to help #BringBackMST3K... Welcome! We're glad you're here to help  #MakeMoreMST3K.\nThanks to our Kickstarter, we also built up enough momentum to experiment with taking MST3K in new directions, including three live national tours, where we got to meet thousands of you in person!  Also, during our live tours, it became really clear to me that MST3K works best when you can experience it together, with your family and friends, or your fellow MSTies.\nAnyway: as you know, nothing good lasts forever.  Sometime in late 2019, during our third live tour, we got word: even though Netflix liked how our new episodes came out, they wouldn't be renewing us for a third new season.\n(Sometimes, business is just business, you know? Was it disappointing not to get renewed? Well, sure. But starting now, we want to focus on looking forward, not back. And when you see what we're planning now, I hope you'll agree that this could end up being the best thing for MST3K in the long run.)\nThen, the day after we finished the live tour, the whole world shut down for a year. And you know, as terrible as COVID has been, it did mean that I had plenty of time to think about where Mystery Science Theater can go next.\nWhen I thought about it long enough, I realized three important things:\n 1. The world isn't done with MST3K yet.\n We still want to make more episodes of MST3K.\nA lot of you still want us to make more MST3K.\n2. It's time to try something new.\nIf enough of you want more MST3K, maybe we don't need anyone to renew us.\nFrom now on, we want you to decide how long MST3K keeps going.\nWe don't need a network to \"let us\" make more MST3K. We can make it for you. \nWhen we do, you should be the first ones to see it.\n3. We need a better space for sharing MST3K, and watching it together.\nWithout a network, we'll need a home for new MST3K, and...\nWe want it to be easy to enjoy MST3K live with other people, so...\nWe need our own online theater for live screenings and events! \nI'm glad you asked, friend... because that's what this new Kickstarter is all about.\nThanks to all of you, Mystery Science Theater 3000 has come a long way since our first Kickstarter.  Now, if you decide to get involved again, here's what we can do next:\n1. MAKE MORE MST3K episodes with a new, sustainable model, that lets you decide how long we should keep going, and lets us bring new episodes directly to you, without depending on a network to distribute or keep renewing us for new seasons.\n2. BUILD THE GIZMOPLEX, our own virtual online theater, where we can host frequent live screenings, premieres, and community events \u2013 and you can host MST3K watch parties with friends whenever you want. More on that in a minute. \nMan... you're way ahead of me. \nIf you were part of our first Kickstarter, this next part might sound familiar:\n If our new Kickstarter can raise at least $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three more new episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000...but we'll also have enough to build the Gizmoplex. \nAnd then \u2013 just like last time \u2013 the more we raise, the more we can do! Here's what we'll be able to do at each of our goals, all the way up to our final goal of $5.5 million: \nUPDATE (5/8): We hit $6.4M, which means JOEL ROBINSON will return to HOST 2 NEW EPISODES and we'll add a 13TH NEW EPISODE!\nAlso, you know, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but if things go well, we've got a lot of other ideas we'd like to add into the mix. You can find out more about that below, and also in this Backer Update.\nNow listen, I hope you're already convinced that the best reason to join our new Kickstarter is because we'll able to #MakeMoreMST3K and #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nBut since this is Kickstarter, let's talk about REWARDS.\nI'm really proud of how most of the rewards from our first Kickstarter campaign turned out, and ever since then, a lot of you told me how much you loved them too. So, this time around, I want to do our best to \"raise the bar.\" You'll have to decide for yourself if we pull it off, but I'll tell you that we've got a few rewards this time that I'm really excited about \u2013 especially the Gizmoplex DIY Concession Pack, our new Challenge Coins, and a pretty amazing design for an MST3K Musical Snow Globe! \nUPDATE \u2013 Since there are so many rewards to keep track of, and we want to make sure you know what to expect in each pledge level, we've also put together this chart, which has been UPDATED to include the ALL-DIGITAL EXPERIMENT 85! \nSo yeah, as you can see, until you get above Experiment 500, most of the rewards \"stack\", which means you get all of the rewards listed in all of the lower pledge levels,  not just the new rewards listed with each pledge level. And unless it says otherwise, all reward levels above Experiment 500 include everything listed on this chart. I'm telling you, it's a lot of cool stuff. \nUPDATE (MAY 5): Joel has shared some \"sneak peek\" images of the designs for our new rewards, including TWO T-SHIRT DESIGNS, TWO POSTER DESIGNS, the MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE and the just-released MISSION PATCHES!\n FIRST LOOK: T-SHIRT DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: POSTER DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE \nYou can read more about the Musical Snowglobe in this Backer Update, but you should know that it will have a \"wind-up\" mechanical element in the base which plays a new rendition of the MST3K Theme Song, composed just for this reward by Paul Sabourin:\nFIRST LOOK: NEW MISSION PATCH (ADD-ON) \nAlso, one big change since last time is that we're now able to offer \"Add-On Rewards\" right here on Kickstarter. That means that we don't have to guess exactly what you'll like, or create a million different confusing pledge levels. \nHere are some of the Add-On Rewards available right now:\n\n SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED!\nAlso, just in case you missed the notice in the description of each reward level: We're not collecting shipping costs for any rewards until after the Kickstarter ends.\nAbout 2-4 weeks after our Kickstarter campaign ends, you'll get a reward survey to give us all of the details we need, like your t-shirt size, or the name(s) you want us to use for each of the \"Special Thanks\" rewards. When you give us those details, we'll also collect shipping for any rewards that go in the mail!\nREWARD TIMING\nWhile a handful of rewards \u2013 like the \"MST3K Season 13: Collector's Box Set\" on DVD and Blu-Ray \u2013 might not be available until as late as June 2022, other rewards \u2013 like Weekly Production Updates \u2013 will start within just a few weeks of when our Kickstarter campaign ends. So, don't let the \"June 2022\" delivery date scare you. Kickstarter just asks us to list the latest date when we expect all rewards to be sent out.\nNow, I know this is already a lot of information, especially if you already watched our video, and I think I've told you most of the really important stuff.\nAnd, if you still want more information, there's a lot more detail below, so keep reading if you want to know more about...\nHow the Gizmoplex will work!\nHow the Gizmoplex can make MST3K better! \nHow we set our funding goals!\nHow we'll spend whatever we raise!\nAlso, one of the things I like best about Kickstarter is that it's not just a \"monologue,\" but a really great way to have a conversation with all of you who care about the show. So, if there are other things you want to know about, I hope you'll take a look at our FAQ... and if the answer isn't there, I hope you'll ask!\nWe'll also do our best to read and respond to all of your comments. But just so you know, I'm pretty sure that our first Kickstarter also got more comments than any project that came before it! So, if that happens again, please be patient if it takes us a little while to get to everything. We've got a whole month, and a lot more to tell you!\nThere's one more thing I need to say before you go, and it's pretty important:\nOver the last year, as I was trying to imagine where Mystery Science Theater can go next, I also spent a lot of time thinking about how we got here.\n(It's kind of crazy to realize that it's been almost six years since our first Kickstarter, and almost thirty-three years since we first aired on KTMA on Thanksgiving in 1988.)\nAnyway, when I look back on everything that's happened, it's really clear that our first Kickstarter was one of the defining moments in Mystery Science history. For our first campaign, we asked you to help us make new episodes, and to prove to \"the networks\" that there was still an audience for MST3K... and you did!\nBut together, we've done a lot more than that. Thanks to you, Mystery Science Theater has been able to produce 2 new seasons, 20 new episodes, 6 comic books, 3 live national tours, and 1 record-breaking Kickstarter.\nToday, I hope you'll join us again to write MST3K's next chapter: to prove that we can #MakeMoreMST3K without depending on a network to keep us alive, and to #BuildTheGizmoplex, a unique online theater where MST3K can continue to grow.\nBut \u2013 and this is the important part \u2013 I also want to be cautious. We're all just crawling out from COVID, and it's been a difficult year. I know that things are more difficult for a lot of people than they were during our first Kickstarter. If you decide to pledge, please: only give what feels comfortable, even if it's just a few bucks. And if you can't afford anything, that's okay too! We'll find other ways for you to stay involved, and to make sure you can still get access to all of our new episodes and Gizmoplex events.\nThat's all: more than anything, please just take care of yourself... and if you can't help out right now, don't think twice about it. We'll still be here when you're ready.\nI guess that's everything, so... we've got 30 days. Let's see how this thing goes.\nCheers & Thanks,\nJoel\n\n\nHey, you're still here. So, I guess you want more details, huh?\nOh yeah, that's right. Thanks for reminding me.\nI think the Gizmoplex might be the biggest \"new idea\" we're working with this time around, so there are a lot of details and possibilities I'm excited to share with you as we go. Here's what you should know right away.\nHaving a Gizmoplex All-Access Pass has three important benefits:\n1. Live Premieres & Events: The Gizmoplex will host at least TWO LIVE EVENTS EVERY MONTH for our first year, where you can join me, our cast and writers, and some special surprise guests. Each event will be like a night at the theater, and will have a lot of fun surprises. Some of our ideas include theme nights hosted by our cast and special guests, live commentaries, and maybe even live riffing! Also, we won't just screen episodes: it'll be a real show, and could include new sketches, trailers (done \"MST3K style\"), live Q&A panel discussions, interviews, contests... and the return of the MST3K \"viewer mail\" segment! (And yes, if you can't make one, you'll be able to see it after.)\n2. The MST3K Watch Club: To make it easier to watch MST3K with your friends, the Gizmoplex will also be the official home of the MST3K Watch Club! Each month, you'll get on-demand access to a new selection of episodes, and the ability to host your own live screenings for up to 10 people! Anyone with a Gizmoplex Pass can join for free, and if you want to invite someone who doesn't, they can get a \"Day Pass\" for just $0.99!\n3. Gizmoplex Apps: Since we reached our second goal ($3.3M) we'll be able to develop apps that bring the Gizmoplex to mobile devices and TVs! Right now, the plan is to include apps for six of the most popular platforms: iOS, Android, AppleTV, AndroidTV, FireTV and Roku. And no promises, but we're also looking into apps for XBOX, PlayStation and Samsung TVs. Like Crow says: we're gonna conquer cyberspace, man! (Read more about the apps here.)\nSo, if you think about it, we think it's a pretty different model than we could pull off anywhere else. I really want the Gizmoplex to feel like something new: less like another Netflix with nothing but MST, and more like a charming, off the radar, suburban cineplex that plays movies for 99 cents, long after their first run.\nIf we get this right, the Gizmoplex Pass won't just give you a monthly subscription to a catalog of MST3K episodes, or a place to watch the episodes you own on-demand: it'll be more like a \"Season Pass\" that gives you tickets to every show at your favorite theater: front row, opening night, every time. Take that, Moviepass!\nYou can read a LOT more about our plans for the Gizmoplex in this Backer Update.\nAlso, even though this won't make a lot of sense until I give you more details, there's one more thing I want you to understand:\nThe Gizmoplex won't just be our new online theater and event space. It's also going to be an important new location that The Mads are creating on the show, and inside the world of Mystery Science Theater, as their next step toward world domination: the first cineplex on the moon!\nAnyway, I think it'll all make sense when you see it... but until then, remember, \u201cIt\u2019s just a show, I should really just relax.\u201d\nSo, there you have it: in a nutshell, this is what we want to do. After 33 years, it's time for Mystery Science \"Theater\" to have an actual (virtual) theater that MSTies can call their own. It's time... to #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nAny other questions?\nOh, wait. I think I know what you're going to ask. \nJust like last time, I'm sure some of you are wondering, so go ahead and ask. \nI knew that's what you were gonna ask! And since we're asking you to pledge some of your hard-earned money \u2013 especially after a difficult year \u2013 I want to be really open and transparent about this. So, let's break this down a little bit.\n1. Without a network supporting us, we need to fund everything ourselves. During our first Kickstarter, we estimated that, once production was up and running, we'd be able to produce new episodes for about $250K each. In the end, though, the budget for each new episode ended up being closer to $350K. For the last two seasons, we were able to cover the difference through our deal with Netflix... but this time, we're on our own. We've got a lot of ways we can keep the budget lower, but, you know... it's still going to cost something. And when you think about it, $350K for 90 minutes of television is still one of the best deals in show business.\n2. We still can't spend everything we raise on Kickstarter to make the show.\nCampaign Fees: Between Kickstarter and the credit card processor, we pay about 8% of your pledge in fees. There's also a fee for CrowdOx, the platform we'll use to manage all of your surveys and rewards after the campaign ends.\nMaking Rewards: We reserve about 20% of your pledge in order to design, produce, print, sort and pack all of your rewards. And that's not even including shipping, which we're not collecting until after our Kickstarter campaign ends!\nDedicated Support: During our first Kickstarter, we underestimated the amount of work involved in providing customer support and creating detailed backer updates, so we had to depend on volunteers to do a lot of it. This time, we want to make sure we're prepared, so we budgeted about 4% of each pledge for that.\nBuilding & Running the Gizmoplex: We really want the Gizmoplex to be great, but getting it started will take some work \u2013 and keeping it running also means we'll have some monthly fees to cover. We also need some budget to support all of the special live events we're planning to host. So, we're using about 3% of your pledge for that.\nWhen you put it all together, we have to spend about 35% of what we raise just to cover Kickstarter expenses, and to keep all the promises we're making to you.\n\n3. The more episodes we make, the less each one costs! Like we explained during our first Kickstarter, the basic idea is pretty simple: for some parts of production, we have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we're making.\nFor example, let's say that our writers realize the show needs a custom-built oversized rubber chicken. No matter how many episodes we have, it's going to cost $1000 to make. So, if we only use it in three episodes, we have to spend $333 per episode on a rubber chicken. But, if we use the chicken in twelve episodes, that $1000 goes a lot farther, and our rubber chicken kaiju only costs us $83 for each episode. Make sense?\n     Based on those numbers, you can see that the cost for each episode gets lower as the number of episodes goes up:\nSo yeah, just like our first Kickstarter, I know that a fair number of you won't care about these types of details... but since some of you will, we want to be as clear as possible.\n1. KEEP CIRCULATING THE URL. Back in the day, MST3K wasn\u2019t seen nationwide and we encouraged people to record the shows on VHS and send them to their friends and loved ones. It was our version of \u201cI Want My MTV.\u201d Every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged MSTies to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes,\u201d and you guys did. Then, in our last Kickstarter, we updated that to \"Keep Circulating the URL,\" and you did that too. Now, we've got a new URL, so we're asking you again:\n2. FOLLOW @MST3K ON SOCIAL MEDIA. Be sure you're following our account on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Those are one of our best ways to keep everyone up-to-date on what's going on, so encourage your fellow MSTies to follow them too! We really appreciate it, and we couldn\u2019t do it without you. You\u2019re like our virtual street team!\n3. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGE FROM EACH UPDATE. From now until our Kickstarter ends on May 7, most of the backer updates that we send will include a suggested message or image. Copy, paste, and post them on your own social accounts to help spread the word. It's as simple as that! \n4. CHECK IN WITH YOUR FELLOW MSTIES.  We don't want you to pressure anyone, but we do hope you'll check in to make sure they know about this Kickstarter.  And when you do, be sure to remind them that pledging even a $1 token pledge will still help us unlock more Challenge Goals, Bonus Rewards, and get them weekly updates all the way through the production of Season 13!\n5. JOIN OUR \"VIRTUAL STREET TEAM.\" If you've got a little extra time, and want to make sure we reach our final goal, there are more specific ways to volunteer and help. If you want to get specific \"assignments\" to help us #MakeMoreMST3K, you can sign up to be part of our elite volunteer team.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we learned last time, there are always risks with Kickstarter... and the world is a little crazier right now than usual.

There are 9 other books you can pick up as part of this Kickstarter. Scroll down to check out all the add-ons available!\nThis is a \"Quickstarter\" -- it's only here for two weeks, so don't miss out! Note that if you pledge for the digital (PDF) versions, they will be delivered as soon as the Kickstarter campaign ends. The softcover booklets will take a little longer. \n Here's a look at the five dragons you'll find in this book.\n Syndrathrax the Soul Hoarder (CR 27). A mighty CR 27 monster! While technically an ancient red dragon, Syndrathrax\u2019s necromantic transformations and attempted apotheoses have forever altered her. Though she shares the massive size of her fellow red wyrms she is gaunt and skeletal, and her scales sapped of their red luster and now bone white. Thanks to the necromantic energy that permeates her body she radiates a faint spectral glow that she can mask when she chooses\u2014the souls of those that she has swallowed are sometimes seen struggling vainly to escape in this light. By Christopher Rippee; illustrated by Indi Martin.\n Bezkusmet the Unscaled (CR 10). Dragons are known to be terrifying but all pale in comparison to Bezkusmet the Unscaled. As his name suggests there is no hue or substance to his draconic scute leaving his musculature and skeleton bared for the world to see, lattices of finger-thick veins and arteries the size of a human\u2019s wrist inexorably pumping blood across his utterly naked body. Only a thin sheen of transparent magic holds Bezkusmet\u2019s organs and muscles in place, the last of the twisted supernatural energies of his birthright all that keeps him intact. By Mike Myler; illustrated by Claudio Pozas and Ekaterinya Vladinakova. \n Glamdrellyxxana the Gold (CR 19). A gold dragon druid under the influence of an ancient curse, Glamdrellyxxana believes the only way to ensure that the world remains \u2018good\u2019 is to destroy all humanoid life. From her lair in a mountain lake she's amassed an army of plant creatures to sweep down across the world and cleanse it of the blight from meddling civilizations destined to bring ruin with their advancement, yet the dragon often feels melancholy about the need to destroy so many living things. Glamdrellyxxana is resigned to this course of action however, convinced by fell visions of an industrialized future\u2014and distracted by mind-altering plants when the guilt becomes too much to bear. By Will Gawned; illustrated by J\u00falio Rocha.\n Teyladin the Reclaimer (CR 9). There are those among the fey who look at bustling cities and thriving towns, fishing boats, and lumber camps only to see a plague ravaging the natural world, plundering and despoiling its ancient beauty. When those ageless, cunning folk came upon a green dragon egg they knew they held a potentially powerful weapon\u2014thus Teyladin was raised to be a champion who in time will help end the scourge of civilization and return the world to its primal, pristine state. Written by Ben Green.\n The Librarian of Orban Tur (CR 25). According to legend the sigil of the library\u2014a snaking silver dragon\u2014isn\u2019t just for show. Some say the mosaic depiction of the creature (hundreds of feet long with dozens of short powerful legs) comes alive to protect the collection from thieves and vandals. What no living soul knows, though a few of the wise quietly suspect, is that the true Dragon of Orban Tur is the librarian herself. For centuries she has dwelt there collecting histories and writing countless volumes of her own by scrying on those who keep her Library Silvers. In her true form she is an ancient silver memory dragon, consuming the minds of those who provoke her wrath. Written by Ben Green; illustrated by Alba Palacio and Ellis Goodson.\nPlus the book also includes a bonus section of dragon-themed rules and player options from GM Lent! \nThe Marked by the Dragon background.\nVarious draconic environmental objects such as the Draken Sigil, Draconic Obelisk, Vasssal Reliquary, Dragonvein, and Petrified Fundamentum.\nA draconic plot generator.\nA new Inspiration mechanic called Draconic Favor, which grants PCs the ability to activate a dragonvein, roar a draconic curse, be granted a draconic audience, to learn draconic knowledge, to invoke draconic fortitude, and more.  \n Let's take a quick peek inside!\nThis is the 10th in this series of mini-quickstarters. If this is the first time you've seen these books, you can pick up the whole lot by selecting the 'I'm New Here!' reward tier in either PDF or softcover format (which is the cheapest way to get the whole collection). For a full list, scroll down a little and check out the add-ons section!\nThe 9 previous books in softcover format!\n\n10 books is a lot of material, and we understand if you only want some of them. While the  'I'm New Here!' reward tiers (above) are the cheapest way to get everything, if you only want one or two additional books you can grab them as add-ons. Here's how that works!\nSelect an existing reward tier as normal and proceed to make a pledge.\nBefore you finalize your pledge, you will be offered a menu of add-ons from the list above. You can pick and choose which ones you would like, including softcovers and PDFs.\nYou cannot add physical (softcover) add-ons if you haven't picked a physical reward tier. \nEach PDF costs \u00a310 and each softcover costs \u00a320. If you add-on a softcover, you also get the PDF for free, of course.\nShipping for add-ons is an additional \u00a31 (\u00a32 for Canada and Scandinavia) per book on top of your base pledge tier's shipping cost. \nIf you're not familiar with EN Publishing's Kickstarters, prepare to be amazed! We've built up a solid reputation over the last few years for quick reward delivery. There's no waiting around. What that means for you:\nPDFs go out the moment the Kickstarter ends. Literally. \nSoftcovers print runs are ordered the moment the Kickstarter funds clear. \nWe don't add stretch goals, as those would delay fulfillment of the project.\nA small caveat -- if you have ordered PDF add-ons they will go out over the days after the Kickstarter ends. That's simply due to Kickstarter's interface -- the regular reward tier PDF download links we can send out immediately en-masse, but the system makes us send out add-on download links manually one-at-a-time. They will take a few days to work through.\nAt the moment, we can only ship physical rewards to the UK, US, Canada, Australia, Scandinavia, and the EU. If you are not in one of those locations, we encourage you to select the PDF tiers!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe PDF versions are ready to go!

You feel softer, lighter. There is something strange going on with this place. There is something strange going on with you.\nMycelium Madness is a mushroom-filled adventure for 5e DnD: the world\u2019s most popular roleplaying game. It tasks a group of adventurers with trekking through a blighted and rotting wasteland, exploring a strange town with even stranger residents, and thwarting a sinister plot deep underground. \nBut what even is mycelium? I'm glad you asked! Mycelium refers to the massive networks of thin fungal threads that distribute resources and information throughout entire ecosystems. The threads, called hyphae, are five times thinner than a human hair, and a cubic inch of soil can contain enough of it to stretch for 8 miles. These vast mycelial networks serve many purposes essential to life on our planet, and even act as a sort of internet for intra-ecosystem communication between plants.\n\n\nThe adventure itself is balanced for a group of tier 2 player characters, but can be adapted to suit more or less experienced adventurers. It can be run as a one-shot or spread out into multiple sessions, and can be easily slotted into an existing campaign. \nFeatures Include:\nAn exciting adventure full of exploration, combat, survival, and mystery\nOver a dozen pieces of original artwork\nA host of memorable characters\nA trove of fungal-themed magic items\nCustom battle maps\nA brand new biome: the fungal wastes\nA ruthless new boss monster: the fungal dragon \nWhat do I need to play Mycelium Madness? In order to play through the adventure, all you need is a handful of friends and either a copy of the DnD Player's Handbook, or the DnD Basic Rules which are available for free right here.\n\nThe setting of the adventure is inspired by\u2026 mushrooms! I first got into the world of mushrooms because of my partner. She\u2019s a mycologist: a scientist who studies mushrooms and other fungi. In the spirit of fungus, Mycelium Madness is a trippy and surreal adventure where excitement and mystery is always hiding just beneath the surface.\n\n\nThe Adventure\nThe adventure begins when the player characters are hired to investigate a rural town called Shroomsville and put a stop to whatever strange corruption is spreading from it. Below is a brief overview of the adventure's three chapters. It contains spoilers for the the final chapter, so unless you plan on being the DM, skip to the next section!\nChapter 1\n The smell here is thick and earthy and alive. Millions of tiny spores hang suspended in the air, unmoving except for the disturbance of your breath, and they cling to you like static as you move through them. The ground is littered with decaying vegetation, the rotting detritus of fallen trees, and the occasional decomposing corpse. You have found yourself in the fungal wastes.\nSetting off on their quest, players will encounter their first challenge: a several day trek through the fungal wastes. A massive spore cloud has been spreading from the town of Shroomsville, laying thick and heavy over the land. Visibility is low within the wastes, and navigation difficult. Travelers' minds tend to wander here. There is a beauty in the kaleidoscopic hallucinations, and a sense of dread in the twisting shadows and quietly whispered mutterings.\nThe players must keep their wits about them if they are to explore the wastes and survive long enough to reach their destination.\nChapter 2\nStreets are broken up by mushrooms and lichen punching up through scattered cobblestones. Buildings are moldy and dilapidated. Strangely, the spore clouds are less oppressive here, like the eye of a storm, and patches of open sky can be seen above. \nWhen the party arrives to the town of Shroomsville, they find a population of people that have been morphed by their proximity to the strange spores. The dragonborn barkeep has tiny violet mushrooms growing out from between her scales. Whose portrait does she carry around in that locket? She can't quite remember. An elven woman has lichen growing from her skin. Perhaps you'd like to join her for a drink of mushroom tea. \"It makes you see better,\" she says. Maybe it does.\nSeveral locations and characters will allow the players to begin unfurling the mysteries at the heart of this strange town. They must be careful though, as no one person has all the information, and many are not who they appear to be.\nChapter 3 (Spoilers!)\nThe walls of this chamber seem to throb and pulse in rhythm with your heart beat. Tiny spores swarm the air here. They\u2019re pouring like smoke out of a crevice in the ground: the rift.\nThe players have explored the town, and investigated its secrets. The path forward is now clear. The source of the fungal corruption lies deep underground. The caverns are as warped and twisted as the minds of those living above. The players will have to contend with many dangers along the way.\nIn the heart of the caverns lies the players' ultimate goal, as well as their deadliest foe. The dragon Zandreth lies here, guarding an infernal rift. Once a majestic creature, Zandreth has succumbed to the rift's horrible corruption. Will the players be able to reason with him? Or will it be a fight to the death? Either way, their success will depend on two things: the cunning and bravery of the players, and a roll of the dice.\n\nStretch Goals (All Stretch Goals Unlocked!)\nI want Mycelium Madness to be the best it can possibly be. To that end, I have several stretch goals planned that will improve Mycelium Madness further as the campaign gains more support. The best way to help unlock these stretch goals is to share the campaign with your friends and on social media!\n$1,200 - Bigger Print Run (UNLOCKED!)

This faction, complete with NPC\u2019s, items, and story hooks, can be used as a sort of epilogue for Shroomsville, or inserted into any campaign setting. This zine will be included for all backers.\n400 Backers - 5e Mushroom Hunting Bonus Zine (UNLOCKED!) \u201cIntroduction to Mushroom Hunting in the Unterblack and Beyond\u201d is the life\u2019s work of infamous tabaxi druid Smoke Mountain.

I began writing this adventure as part of the Storytelling Collective's 2020 RPG Writer's Workshop. In addition to myself, I am working with three very talented local New Mexican artists:\n\nMax Bode - Interior Art\nClick the image to see more of Max's art\nHiroshi Sutter -  Sticker Design, Enamel Pin Design\nClick the image to see more of Hiroshi's art\nRewards and Add-Ons\nBy backing this project, you are supporting an independent writer and game designer as well as several young, up-and-coming New Mexican artists. In addition, you can snag some super cool rewards, such as...\nThe Book: The adventure is available in two formats. The digital version will be sent out as a tagged pdf, and includes cool extras like printable item cards, player handouts, and high-resolution maps. The physical version will be a high-quality printed booklet. The book will be 6\u201dx9\u201d, about 48 pages, and perfect bound.\nThe Sticker and Enamel Pin: We are creating a limited run, mushroom themed, 1.5\" soft enamel pin designed by Hiroshi Sutter, as well as a Kickstarter-exclusive die-cut sticker. More details for these will be released as the campaign progresses.\nThe Mycelium Madness D20 (Limited to 100): Custom engraved mushroom themed D20 dice crafted by Q Workshop. The design is below, and the colors will be voted on by backers (see update #7 for more info).\nThe Mycelium Madness Handmade 7pc Set (All Gone!): These super-limited sets are completely hand-made by James Harper of Crunch Dice. The dice feature swirls of earthy green and deep burnt orange, and contain fluffy mycelium, fuzzy lichen, and glittering spores. The result is a dice set that perfectly evokes the atmosphere of the spore-choked Fungal Wastes that surround the town of Shroomsville. Each set of dice is poured, sanded, and polished by hand with care and precision for dice that look gorgeous and feel great.\nThe Fungal Dragon Mini (All Gone!): A 3D printed resin miniature of Schlossbauer's incredible fungal dragon design. This is the perfect mini to use for Zandreth the Fungal Dragon when playing through the adventure. The mini stands at about 90 mm, and will be printed in black, grey, or green resin. The fungal dragon mini can be added as an Add-On to any tier that includes a physical book.\nSchlossbauer's Fungal Dragon Model. Click the image to see more of Schlossbauer's work.\nBecome a Character (All Gone!): Amidst the chaos in the town of Shroomsville, a coven of evil witches have laired in the town's midst. The nefarious trio wish to feast upon the nightmares of hapless townsfolk. Using their occult powers, they disguise themselves to better blend in with the town. Who do the witches disguise themselves as? Maybe you! Backers at the Bleeding Tooth Fungus tier will have their likeness (or that of a loved one) drawn into the book as one of these three dastardly villains.\nGame DM'd by the Creator (All Gone!): Backers at the Golden Teacher tier will be treated to a play-through of the adventure by me, the writer of Mycelium Madness. I will run a mini campaign for you and up to four other players. The campaign will take place online over Roll20 or another virtual tabletop, and should last around three sessions. In addition to being the first backers to play Mycelium Madness, each player will receive a digital copy of the adventure and a custom portrait of their character by Max Bode, artist for Mycelium Madness.\n\n\nProduction\nThe writing for the adventure is nearly complete, and is in the process of being edited and polished. I have also commissioned a handful of very talented artists. I'm excited to share what they\u2019ve been working on as the campaign progresses. As the artists finish up their pieces, I will begin the process of laying out the text and images into a beautiful book that will be just as enjoyable for the DM to read through as it will be for the players to experience. Once the layout is created, it\u2019s off to the printers. All digital items will be delivered at this time. Once the printed books arrive to me, I will begin shipping them out to their new homes.\nThe image shows progress bars for the various stages of the project. Writing is at 90%. Editing is at 60%. Art is at 20%. Layout is at 10%. Production is at 10%.\nThis image shows the projected timeline for the project. Art and Writing should be finished by mid-May. Layout should be finished by mid-June. Digital files should be sent out by mid-July, and physical rewards in August.\n\n\nBudget\nThe campaign goal of $550 covers the cost of an initial print run of the book, the cost of shipping those books, all applicable fees and taxes, as well as the cost of paying the artists. Any funds raised over this amount will go towards stretch goals that further improve the physical quality of the book and add even more content.\nThis image shows the breakdown of campaign funds. The largest portion will go to printing the rewards. The next largest portion will go towards paying the artists. Next will be shipping costs, followed by Kickstarter fees and taxes.\nThank you so much for checking out Mycelium Madness! In order for it to become reality, though, we need your help.

A Mature-rated experience.\nSangrde\nHer unique style as an artist helps separate our vision from other JRPGs.\n Story \nTaking place over 30+ hours of gameplay, written for those wishing to be the bad guy from start to finish. Influenced by ideas such as how playing as Magus in Chrono Trigger would influence the world, the gameplay, and the visuals. What would playing as Kefka change for Final Fantasy 6? How would his madness translate into gameplay, allies, playable characters, etc. If you were Ghaleon in Lunar, would it feel different to experience the same story compared to Alex. \nPLAY\n\n                                         Boss Battle Explained with Story Elements\n\n Combat Key Features \n* Designed to always have max characters in combat. Switch between them at ease, use one character for all your Soul Points (Think Action Points from Shin Megami: Digital Devil Saga), or multiple ones to exploit weaknesses or handle various objectives. No character sits at the castle waiting for their turn in your party.\n* JRPG turn-based combat that is created from the ground up recognizing the best and most influential elements of Lunar, Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, Shin Megami Tensei, and Final Fantasy Tactics.\n* Two-tier combat flow in which you cannot mash the A button to attack everything and win. Spells are only useable against enemies that have been \"Contaminated\" with Black Dragon blood, requiring creativity and guile on how to use each character appropriately to both infect and exploit the enemy through their fears.\n * Play as Bosses! As a villain, there will be times you corrupt NPCs and monsters to combat enemies, not always Rubin or Lady Death. These will be Boss fights that you have the option to control! (At this time this feature is not meant to be mandatory, but instead offer additional rewards). \n* Multiple Screens of Combat: Fight from Land, Air, and Sea in the Battle System.\n* Fights known as \"Cinematic Encounter\": A battle that will take place over multiple screens and locations, usually reserved for Boss Fights, but not always.\n\nThe Last Supper of the Blood Glutton\n Horror RPG, not Jumpscare RPG \nHorror will be experienced through visuals, activities, and the world around you. The heaviest influence on the horror elements come from Silent Hill. Our philosophy on horror is that we hope for you to think about what you've done or seen after you put the controller down. \nOne of the Many Atrocities You'll Commit: Turning Many Into One\n\n Character Skins  \nBacker-created Bromides, will influence a character's combat abilities and appearance. \n Lucid Soul's music is composed by Nate Combs, featuring Hayley Nelson of Haylizbeth fame on Youtube,  Diwa de Leon of String Player Gamer fame on Youtube, and Lauren Kinkade from Youtube, The combined force is what we hope conveys the world of Trebezia in the proper light, from mysterious depths of forgotten dungeons, to insurmountable battles testing your cunning and tactics. To Nate and myself, nothing is more important in an RPG's experience than the music, and we hope to emulate the memorable nature of the greats. While Diwa's involvement in the project will be a Stretch Goal at first, we've incorporated him in several songs so as to hear the power of his violin and passion.\n\nBefore we get to the music, first a word from the man, the myth, the legend himself, Nate Combs:\nPLAY\n\n Main Character's Theme Song (Featuring Diwa de Leon on Violin) \n Domain of the Drowned Goddess, Hecuba (Featuring Diwa on Violin AND Hayley vocals) \n Battle Against Heroic Bosses (Featuring Diwa on Violin) *in Lucid Soul you will fight monsters, heroes, Rubin and his party, Lady Death and her party, and even Gods and Goddesses. Our goal is to have music which will distinguish each of the types of combat, this one intended for our first boss music against a Grey Paladin named Ashur. \n Rubin Domingo's Theme *in Lucid Soul you'll be making enemies with this young man early in your adventure, albeit not directly. His story is linked tightly to yours, as is those he partners with to thwart you. Eventually you might even have to resort to nefarious deeds involving his sister... \n Erzbet's Theme (Featuring Diwa on Violin and Hayley vocals) \n A Whisper in the Forest of Delusion \n A Tragic Memory \n A Cryptic Invitation \nThe Alpha, The Omega, THE Castle: Wyrmsgate\n Deathtouched... Those cursed with Black Dragon blood in their veins, whether by bonding with one like the Dragon Knights of Lasserburg do by drinking the contents of the whelpling's egg at birth, or by forced feeding of a living dragon. Whatever the method, the very design of the body is altered from the inside out, all organs cease to function normally, and certain powers begin to flood the embiber. \n Some, not all, are horribly corrupted in the process. Some change appearance completely, some lose their sanity like the Ancient Black Dragon, Malganon, did. All are a threat to life, however, as all must feed off the living, through blood and flesh, to live. \n   It's this need to feed that starts our story and tale of Lucid Soul, the Town of Guillen is housing foolhardy humans that decide it's time to return to harvesting the woods around our castle. Silly little things, but how can they not feel comfortable; the world has Grey Paladins with holy powers governing every hamlet, a Priestess of Medina to relay all activities to others of their order, and above all, no fear of what lies outside their walls. \nThis all is about to change...\n Well... for you at least. I make no promises for the others destined to bleed for our Lord's amusement. Hytwart, King of the Goblins, now known as The Enfeebler, the longest living Goblin in history, is a thirsty deviant and it is... after all... our duty to slake his thirst! Elderly, women, children, all are used to feed the ever guzzling gluttony of the Deathtouched. Don't look at me like that, you'll be given an opportunity few others are given: a rare gift... if you survive the trial... A pit both deep and dark... filled with cadavers and meat from ancient raids and conquest.  \n   A singular Black Dragon Egg, relic of the last known nest of the Dark Lady, Umbryss, second concubine to Malganon... shall be your prize. Oh, and we've chosen others to join you in that fetid catacomb buried within our tower... Do bring an appetite, a strong stomach, and a desperate need to survive, by any... means... necessary.\n\nDragons\nThe Ancient Jewel Dragon - Last of his kind - A hidden reward perhaps at the end of the Campaign?\nBlue Dragon Liza Domingo near her son, Rubin\n Dragons have 6 distinct colors and flights: Red, Green, Blue, White, Grey, Black, and Jewel. Through your journey, you'll interact with many of each flight, save the Grey Dragons, as they're all but wiped out, and see just what's become of those infected with Black Dragon blood from the fights of yester year.\n\nGods and Goddesses\nLaurana, Aldaryn, and Medina Statues in the Town of Guillen\n*Hecuba, The Drowned Goddess\nHecuba and a school of her Aquamazons\n  She, how should I put this lightly... has a rather known disdain for men. A sordid affair with another heavenly being and creating An all-female race of Aquamazons will do that to you. It's widely believed that her sister, Laurana, took her by the throat and dove out of the sky with such ferocity and hatred that she strangled her for several years during the descent into the frothy depths of the sea, and confined her there for all eternity unable to ever breath air again. \n Patron Goddess of the Blue Dragons and Aquamazons\n\n*Laurana, Goddess of Love and Beauty\n They say she's a sight to behold, that no earthly creature can match her beauty, charm, or grace. Now I don't particularly judge beauty by anything more than taste, but I can't argue the statues of worship to her paint her as quite the image. It's said she abhors conflict, but most good stories with the Gods sure seem to involve her at the center of it, either fighting 'for' her or 'because' of her. I consider her the Goddess of Ironies, but I've never met her. \n Patron Goddess of the Humans and White Dragons\n\n*Runefaust, God of... actually I'm not sure? Being Laurana's Husband?\n I know him for only 2 stories, being the husband of the Goddess, Laurana, and for the creation of his brother, Charnel's, physique. I forget the finer details, but they were fighting over something or another, as you do, and his anger and fury escalated to such a degree that he slammed his brother's face into a volcano for so many moons and seasons that the poor God's face actually melted off permanently to expose an ever-flaming skull. Now that's hate! Come to think of it... why are the only stories I know about Runefaust and Laurana that they're married and both committed horrific acts upon their siblings? \n...Oh that's right... Justice. That's what he's known for. I think?\n Patron God of Green Dragons\n\n*Charnel, God of War, Flame, and Healing\n This is one God I can get behind, as I'm a bit fond of the broken and beaten. I can only imagine having my face pressed into a volcano until you start thinking about how to get your vengeance. This God, however, is notoriously calm and rational, despite his suffering and battle scars. Horrible disfigurement is a guaranteed quality among those that worship him. I'm not sure his divine powers are worthwhile though, in order to attain them you need to undergo the Ordeal of Flame, and douse yourself head to toe in oil-fueled fire. I don't consider myself vain but, even I would like to have an arm or two and both eyeballs intact by the end of the day.\n Patron God of the Ithra and Red Dragons\n\n*Aldaryn, The Allfather, the Maimed God, God of Creation\n All I know of Aldaryn is that his prophet is merely a stump of a man; immobile, tongueless, eyeless, and limbless. From his position down to their Grey Paladins, everyone sacrifices some portion of their body, and to rise  through the ranks you offer more and more. The less of you there is, the closer to the God you become, or so they say. The military are well known to be eunuchs.  Oh, one other quirky thing of note: a Grey Dragon is hatched with a part of its body missing or maimed as well. \n Patron God of the World and Grey Dragons\n\n*Medina, Goddess of Fate\nPriestess of Medina\n   Never represented as anything more than a young teen at most. The Goddess is known to be blind, but they say she has one green eye and one red eye; something I heard from a man who knew a woman who knew an uncle that slept with a loose-tongued Priestess of hers. One eye sees only the future, and the other eye sees only the past. The Priestesses, like this Goddess, must always wear a blindfold, and part of their commitment and devotion to her is that they must remove their own eyes, becoming a hive vision through a single thread they put into that blindfold, sending sights to others in their order. \n   Not a patron to any known race or Dragon\n\n*Luta, Goddess of Wisdom and Magic\n I'm not exactly a fan of the slow-moving Lutarians, or their preachy aloof nature. When Malganon's attack ended, they continued as they always had, isolated and separated from the world. The few Lutarians that take their pilgrimage in pairs to witness and record the outside around them don't talk much about the Goddess, favorable or ill. She is known as a female, but under thick robes and a hood, could be a beast and we'd never know it. Come to think of it, I just realized.... Luta... Lutaria... Lutarian... what a vainglorious bitch of a Goddess she is! \n Patron Goddess of Lutarians and Jewel Dragons\n *Side note, Lutarians killed all the Jewel Dragons\n\n*Exodus, God of Death, Madness, Hardship, Strife, Discord, Bickering, Controversy, Depression, Depravity... you get the gist\n   At one time, this God was only known for death. Malganon sort of... changed that a bit, little skew to the far side of what \"Death\" means in our world. Now anytime you think of destruction or a mental illness, Exodus is immediately its patron saint and cause. In lieu of his Black Dragon's little tantrum that reduced much of the world to a blazing inferno of corruption, most statues, if any, that used to pay homage to him are destroyed.\n Patron of Black Dragons... and little else now\n\n Trebezia, the World Around You \n* Humans\nDuke Rachon of the Dragon Knights\n Grey Paladins, Dragon Knights of Lasserburg, Republic of Laurana. These 3 factions in the world will affect your experience the most, as 2 of these groups have become peace keepers against the corrupted blood abominations left behind by the Malganon Wars. What do I hate about the humans? I could call them entitled brats who don't leave the tits of the Goddess Laurana long enough to be killed one at a time... A bit like cockroaches in numbers... but luckily for us... I find them the best tasting of all the races...\n Tastiness Factor, 10/10\n\n* Ithra\n So get this... A desert people who don't identify as humans because they feel they're more children of the God of War, Charnel, the Flaming Skull. Fine fine, I call you 'dinner' but we won't quibble over semantics... Capable of an ancient technique called the \"Fingers of Death.\" If you believe them, it's said they can kill you simply by pointing at you... I believe only one being in this world is capable of that: Synella, and only after she's filled that diaper of hers and points at you to recognize the odious death that's impending.  Oh! Right! The best part... So get this, in their culture, women aren't allowed to be assassins, but they're trained for athletic combat to hone their bodies for, dun dun DUN, breeding!  Don't look at me like that...\n\n*Lutarians\nOne of only two Lutarians I've ever met... *Side note, zero desire to meet more\n Those long ears aren't simply for gripping onto and doing the dirty work of breeding, oh no... actually I'm not even sure if they DO breed... I mean they must but... well one aspect of this fanciful race aside from being taller and thinner than all others, is that they're hairless and slow due to their blood density; is that two aspects?  Wick keeps her ears hidden under that massive hat of hers, but I've seen them a time or two. When born, a Lutarian has a primal element infused into their DNA, altering the hue of their flesh, and determining the magic they're capable of. Our Wick, for example, was born a Fire Lutarian, giving her blood a unique mix of Black Dragon with Fire, and creating the Shadowflame user you see before you. The world calls them patient, but honestly, I call them boring. \n\n* Goblins\n Despite their size, this race is whole-souled on war. Built like roided tiny soldiers of pure fury and muscle, they were once protectors of the world, until Malganon manipulated Hytwart into making them little more than pawns in a global game of death and destruction. Call it a quirk of their creator, or an unnecessary function, but there are no female Goblins... instead Goblins are made from the Spawning Pools around Castle Wyrmsgate. Our King, Hytwart, The Enfeebler, is a Goblin that survived this process in a most unusual fashion. But that's for you to find out...\n\n* Fae\n The adorable all-female race of winged fairykind. One of Malganon's first acts of insanity that, to this day, was considered the catalyst for the maddening, was during a routine diplomatic visit. Now I can't say for sure, wasn't there after all, but the rumor around the castle is, he managed to secure a private audience with their queen, Jolyanna. How or why isn't known, but be certain, the aftermath is. He plucked that beautiful little empress' wings and limbs one at a time until only pieces of her mystical form were left, and he presented them to all, pinning her severed remains to many trees. It's an act no one forgets. Now a Dragon and their Knight are tied by blood to one another, so I've no clue how Malganon managed to subdue Darhyn, but his death was considered even more elaborate. As you may or may not know, Dragons can assume human form at will, before the Gods cursed the Black ones to never be able to 'leave' their human form. I've a suspicion that curse relates to how Malganon disposed of his former master. I'll spare the details of 'how' he gained entrance into the Knight's backside, but once within he made sure to parade him around as a puppet for those gathered by providing another, more obscene spectacle. He transformed during the act, and, well, not to put a fine graphic point on it, exploded the poor helpless human in a shower of gore the likes of which  stain the imagination. Any wonder the Fae hate us?  \n\n*Aquamazons \nDive into the Oceans of Trebezia - Hecuba's Domain\n They don't bother us, and we don't bother them. Never seen one and doubt we ever will. Fish girls aren't really my thing anyway.\n *Side note, known to have a giant fish's tail grafted to the back of their skull, allowing them to swim extraordinarily fast. Since I'm not a great swimmer I doubt I'll ever taste one. If I do, boiling and buttering might be in order.\n *Side note 2, Creep has the likeness of a horribly disfigured one, mutilated beyond recognition, then reconstructed. Will consult The Fleshweaver if such a thing is possible.\n *Side note 3, picturing Creep as even a relative reminds me, if I ever encounter one, never put any part of my body near one of their mouths. I've no desire to join the Grey Paladins as a eunuch.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nExample of Giving the Town of Guillen to Lucretia, the Spider Broodmother\n One of the many ways you'll progress your characters, is after conquering a town or city, you'll have the option of leaving it in the hands of one of the main characters. The above is an example if you leave the Town of Guillen in the hands of Lucretia. When you visit the town again, the visuals will reflect her rule, as you can see a hint of what happens at the town's shrine.\nInfamy Meter\n Infamy is the experience you'll receive as you win battles and perform certain tasks around the world. It will increase the potency of all your Dragon Powers, allow you more Soul Points, and possibly affect many other things in the world around you. \nBromide Examples from Lucid Soul's Art Contest Entries!\n Bromides are Equipable skins that will alter the appearance of your characters, as shown here by our contest winners. They will be able to equip in 2 ways... the Attributes of the Bromide, affecting combat, and the Visual of the Bromide, affecting the appearance. This will allow players the freedom to look how they want but function how they wish as well.\nSouls - Currency and Equippables\n\n\n\n\nYour Character Will Physically Appear (Or non-physically, as it were) As a Haunt in Castle Wyrmsgate\nYou will create an Equipable Icon to represent your Soul\nPoster of Lucretia in front of Castle Wyrmsgate\nAugustinas Raginskis Red Dragon Tier Commission Examples\nSangrde's Red Dragon Tier Commission Examples\nZeitDieb's Red Dragon Tier Commission Examples\n Villain Protagonist stories, written ground up as the one doing evil in the world. To me personally, this is one step that I hope many others wish to see, in which villain protagonists, can be just as compelling or memorable RPG characters as heroes. Morale systems have been around for many years, Undertale a recent example, Knights of the Old Republic, Fable, etc. But what in our opinion has always been lacking, is that these stories are written fundamentally as a hero's journey, with options to be a bastard or kill people sprinkled in. Death to us, is only a means to an end, when it comes to being evil. That is why we hope Kickstarter feels the project is worthy in their eyes, to provide a story that, to our knowledge, doesn't exist in the JRPG world. This is a game dedicated to those of us who got Magus in our party in Chrono Trigger, and just wanted more of him, his story, his badassery. To those of us who wanted a mod to let Cloud wield the Masamune in FF7, while doing more along the lines of Sephiroth (finally answering how he managed to kill that Midgar Zolom by himself). Games like Overlord exist, but they choose the route of cartoony vs maturity. How would a villain see the world, how would a villain interact with it, what would his motives be, and how would he progress to make his journey interesting. This is why we seek you, Kickstarter, each and every fantasy gamer who feels there's a little villainy scratch that craves to be itched. Thank you again so very, very much for making it to this point in our campaign, and don't hesitate to ask any questions as they come up! \nExpenses of Lucid Soul / Where the money will go / Erzbet's Edited Chart", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA moment of sincerity,\nAs this is my first Kickstarter, and my team is putting their faith in me to coordinate and succeed on this project, I feel the best possible way to prove my intent, and reduce the risk to anyone who backs Lucid Soul, is to take accountability on a personal level. I will not be using an LLC or company name to divert any finance to, this will be a complete and utter stake on my personal honor, livelihood, and integrity, to earn respect from the community by providing a finished product the likes of which we saw with Blizzard of yester-year. Delays should be communicated to the backers and fans, but above all, respect of the trust and faith everyone interested in this game has shown to me.

Bird-folk rule in a shaky balance of power between the Aarakocra\u2019s military/agricomplex and the Kenku\u2019s numerological predictive magics. Under the bird-folk, the land-bound races scramble for survival amidst a Pittsburgh that has crumbled and been remade more times than anyone can remember. A troll under every bridge, a danger over every hill, and a mystery at the black and gold heart of the city. Welcome to Blackvale...\n Ok but what is this?\nBlackvale is a campaign setting made for D&D 5e. The zine includes the political powers of Blackvale, religious history, a map of Blackvale, and fully detailed sheets for the major NPCs and relics. It's set in real-world geography, with reference to real-world history, playing with how magic and time might shift the meanings of class, industry, and technology.\n The Powers of Blackvale\nThe Kenku Numerologist and Aarakocra Army hold Blackvale in their talons\n\nThe Aarakocra Military Agricultural Complex- ages ago, the Aarakocra arrived in Blackvale, which they say was a ruin. With their magic and might, they \u201csettled\u201d the land, making it \u201csafe\u201d for land-bound races to live and work. In exchange for the protection of the Aarakocra, the peoples of Blackvale agreed to work the mines for them, and offered their children up to be mages to serve them.\nThe Kenku Prescients- The Kenku are the second pillar of power in Blackvale. They can\u2019t fly, but they have powerful magics that let them see far into the past, present, and future. The Kenku resent their winged cousins and regard the non-birdfolk with condescension. \n\nThe Congress of Trolls- Every bridge in the city is held by a Troll, some only a decade old, others hundreds of years old. They answer only to the Troll Congress, a gathering of the trolls, goblins, and humanoids they command. When people fall through the cracks of society, the trolls will teach them little magics to survive.\nThe Church of Ayn- The Church of Ayn worships strength, individuality, self-possession, self-sufficiency, self-actualization, even self-creation. The Church awaits the prophesied Self Made Man, and any leader in the church must claim to be him. To pass through an area held by a Church of Ayn is to expose yourself to robbery, capture, or death.\nThe Neighborhood of Saint Roger in Friendship- The largest safe place for humanoids in the city is the Neighborhood. It was established by clerics of the god St. Roger, who welcomed all to live as neighbors. Now it is protected by brave warriors and priests and is given a measure of self-governance under the Birdfolk.  The Neighbors can extend shelter and kindness, but never too much too fast, or they would be seen as a threat to the birdfolk, and punished.\n  A Taste of Blackvale\nShortbeak, Kenku Speaker and Talent Scout\n  Shortbeak is the walking embodiment of cunning. He is intelligent and accomplished. He is the most well-known of all Kenku, acting as their ambassador to the peoples of the valley. He is enjoyed by some, feared by more. He walks the streets maintaining relations, predicting weather and crop growth for the people, and bringing in new mages for the ranks of the Kenku Numerologists. He usually travels with an entourage of young numerologists, people hooded so deeply that their faces can\u2019t be seen, and Kenku battle-trancers.\nThe Lost Kenku Eye\nWhen adventurers gain a bit of fame, it's never long before the Birdfolk come 'round asking for favors, or worse, offering them. Shortbeak has asked you to retrieve a mysterious eye that he believes is currently held by a shady woman that the locals just call \"Little Sister\", who lives alone in the north hills. How could a person survive alone beyond the watchful eyes of the birdfolk?\n\n The Lay of the Land\nStretch Goals\nAt 1k, we get to rolling and you get to enter Blackvale/Pittsburgh as it has always truly been.\n4K- All backers will receive a SECOND PDF zine, The Church of Ayn and the Aspirant Kings. This zine will detail out the lives, triumphs, and dangers of the adherents of the Church of Ayn and their brutal religion of the self. If you want to fight GWAR mixed with Mad Max villains mixed with horrible moral objectivism, let's get this bad boy to 4k.\n???-???\n???-???\nWho's making this?\nVILLINI is a small, Pittsburgh-based operation making games and accessories for them. 20 years of RPGs, 15 years of Pittsburgh. Something is definitely haunted in Western PA, and it's always been fun to try to imagine what it was. Making real places into fantasy settings is fun for everyone. If you've ever thought about which kinds of fey live in your neighborhood or debated whether your boss had low Int, Wis, or just low Cha, Blackvale will feel familiar to you.\nHaunted Meat makes comix, zines, games, patches & other dank swag for dungeon punks. They'll be contributing insert art and worldbuilding on our stretch goals.\nsome dope ass Haunted Meat stylings that will stink up this zine\nExalted Funeral (your online home for weird literature including indie RPGs, heavy metal zines, and occult texts) will handle fulfillment, so please do direct all of your important, non-bird-supremacy-related questions to them. Speaking of which, let's talk about...\n\nShipping!\nDomestic Shipping & Handling will differ by tier, but it'll work out to around $4 - $5 per physical zine. You'll sort this all out in pledgemanager after the campaign. \n\nBetween COVID and Brexit and who-knows-what's-coming-next, International shipping is currently obstacle-ridden and outta-whack. We hope that things will be moving more smoothly by the time that Blackvale is printed.

It's because mythical beasts still rove the lands outside the city. But what are these beasts? So I'm developing some monsters, called either Carnechimera or Monchimera (not sure on which name). They're chimeras (of course), with one head of an Appalachian animal, like a buck or a black bear or coyote, and one head of a dinosaur skeleton from the Carnegie Museum, and one \"head\" that's abandoned drilling/excavation/construction equipment. I wish I could include sound in the zine, because the sound of something that roars, rattles, and squeals like grinding steel would make a dope noise. For ease of play, I think I'll just make the heads based on a table, so you can roll to create a monchimera, but I also REALLY like the idea of a sort of Shadow of the Colossus styled 10 Great Monchimera, each one with a unique ability. Breath weapons on these guys? Unsure. If anything,  I think they'll puke some kind of cursed frack-slurry? Or even just mud to encumber opponents?

THESE ARE AN ADD ON OPTION. \n As of the creation of this campaign, the page count is well over 200 pages. \nBUCKSKIN SUMMONING SCROLLS ARE NOW UNLOCKED!\nPLEASE KEEP READING, ALL WILL BE EXPLAINED...\nPLAY\n\n\n\nI started gaming in the early 80's, and I'm pretty sure I started at a way too early age. By the time my friends and I got a handle on how to actually play the game of D&D, the Satanic Panic had hit.  And so like a lot of young players, into a box in the basement my books went, for fear that I might make a pact with the devil with just a simple roll of a D20.\nThe fan-art based books that I create are the types of tomes that I would have loved to have had as peripherals as a young player, and even now more than ever.  I want to create something that makes the game more immersive and cater to the individual player, such as the illustrated spellbooks that are almost at completion for the 8 schools of magic.  (Back issues can be found here -  PhilStoneIllustrations )\nWhich brings me to The Demonology of Lire Goest. \nArtistically, this grimoire is modeled after several books from the past, most notably, The Demonology of King James the 1st (who actually coined the term Demonology), The Grand Grimoire, and The Lesser Keys of Solomon.\nThere are 3 to 5 pages for each named demon or creature complete with stats from either 3.5 or 5e.  There is also a summoning spell and sigil should the Dungeon Master or player decide to make things more interesting during the game.  A personal grimoire is added at the back for your own inscriptions and conversions.\nLire Goest was evil to the point of insanity.  His personal recordings while travelling through the abyss have been recorded on the living skins of the residents of Eastbourne, only to be flayed off the carcass to be used as summoning scrolls for later use.  Lire Goest desired power and infamy.  This is the one and only recorded tome of his existence, his interplanar travels, and his diabolical magic.  It has been so extensive, that two volumes had to be created.\nWHAT IS THIS BOOK, AND WHY IS THERE NO PDF??????\nNo, there is no PDF version of this book.  It is not formatted as a quick reference piece.  It is a grimoire to haunt your bookshelf.  Although there are stats and what not for each summoned demon,  it is not like my spellbooks (which will always have a PDF) where one can pull up something on the fly.  No, I want you to be able to touch it, peruse it, experience it.  This is how I always wanted a Necromantic tome to be.  I want you to hold it, show it off.  I started these projects as immersive peripheral props to be the character that you play.  There are summoning circles, protection wards for those who are summoned, and one hell of a backstory to the most infamous necromancer who started this grimoire.  \nThe Demon List for Vol. 1\nAdaru, Alkilith, Armanite, Babau, Balor, Baphomet, Barlgura, Bebilith, Bulezau, Carnage, Charon, Chasme, Demogorgon, Demonthorn Mandrake, Destrachan, Draegloth, Draudnu, Dretch, Evistro, Fraz-urb'luu, Gadaacro, Glabrezu, Goristro, Graz'zt, Hezrou\n\nSUMMONING SCROLLS\nAt 5k I will unlock the ability to pledge for the one of a kind buckskin scrolls.

By burning designs into traditional brain-tanned buckskin, he sculpts the leather into a three-dimensional relief that brings the images to life! Any color added is done with natural pigments, applied with bone tools.\nScrolls:\nSize- The scrolls are roughly 11x17\u201d in size, but may vary depending on the specific design. Each is one-of-a-kind, and some may have additional pieces attached to them.\nWeight- Roughly 4oz\nTurnaround- Assuming all materials are on hand (quality buckskin can be difficult to acquire), a scroll can take many hours to create, and probably up to 2 weeks per scroll.\nPrice- Each scroll is a 450.00 pledge plus shipping.\nThe scrolls WILL NOT go into production until the money has been collected from Kickstarter. Regular updates will be given as scroll production is ongoing.\nPLAY\n\nAt 10k, we will unlock PRINTS of the scrolls.\nScroll prints are 11 x 17\nEach print is a 20.00 pledge plus shipping\nExample of scroll print", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only challenge is not being funded\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Hardcover Leatherette copy of the book", "descp": "Get a hardcover, leatherette bound, and foil stamped cover version of the Demonology Grimoire.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["138 backers", "Add-ons"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Enchantment spellbook is live and more!", "update_content": "The feedback through messages and comments for this book have been amazing, and for that I want to thank you all!

There's always that weird noble, right? The one that insists on wearing some obscure scent, or only eats pastries, or refuses to travel without their own carriage, or keeps rust monsters as pets. Eccentric people like Lady Philomina\u2014who keeps rust monsters as pets.

Let's take a quick peek inside!\nOne-page adventures are short and to the point. As an exercise in writing economy, they are distilled down to the very basics. Monsters and NPCs always use standard stat blocks referenced in bold (the usual 5E style), and area descriptions are kept to the bare minimum. \nFor example, Two-Lips' farm in the The Business of Emotion is described thusly: \"Flower fields and a small farmhouse. TWO-LIPS, a gnome noble, directs a crew of six gnome commoners.\"\nThe wonderful writers and designers whose works inspired these One-Page Adventures include Jeff Gomez, Jen Tracy, Aaron Infante-Levey, Nick Cramp, Paul Oklesh, Jacob Gobhar, William Fischer, Kiel Chenier, Esper, Charlie Brooks, Kyle Carty, Cole Grandel, Greg Pest, John Karatovic, Tyler Omichinski, Jim Miles, Chris Rippee, Andrew Engelbrite, Will Gawned, and Jensen Toperzer.\nThere's cartography by Dyson Logos, and art from Claudio Pozas, Phil Stone, Jen Tracy, Sade, Savage Mojo, Ellis Goodson, Xanditz, Rick Hershey, Marcel Budd, Herman Lau, IgorNP, Alba Palacio, Indi Martin, Guilherme Sommermeyer, and Melissa Tillery. \nMost of these adventures are converted from longer adventures I have commissioned from other writers elsewhere (you can see the original creator of each at the bottom of the adventure). The layout is my own work, as is the conversion and distillation. \nNot persuaded yet? Here's one of the 25 adventures. For free!\nThis is the 8th in this series of mini-quickstarters.

With new weapon properties, the new Fisticuffs fighting style, and two new spells, designer Josh Gentry will have your characters brawling in the taverns!

However, due to the use of game settings owned by other publishers, none of these works could be published and brought to the public as a standalone adventure. When Storm Bunny Studios licensed The Game Academy full rights to create and publish within the World of Alessia, they also granted us the opportunity to develop the content for one of Alessia's main continents, Shiran. When presented with this land of verdant forests, frozen tundra, a barrier mountain range, and the frozen wasteland of The Vastness, The Game Academy fell in love and got straight to work. While we are being intentionally vague about the plot of our story (we don't want to ruin it for anyone who desires to play), we will give you a teaser of what you might expect. \nOur story is one that can only happen in Shiran and playing through this adventure will introduce players not only to the land of Shiran but also to its people. The adventure begins in Kulg, a city of contradictions standing firm against the elements on the edge of civilization, protecting its traditions, and preserving its future. Anomalous data readings collected by several factions in Kulg, bring the players together to investigate the source of the readings, and to report back on what they find. \nThe party must navigate their way through The Vastness and find the source of this strange data, so they appeal to a spiritual sect of weaseling Shangpa known as the Seekers of the Sacred Way. This troupe accompanies wayward travelers through The Vastness and strive to keep them safe through the land of ice, snow, and ravaging shard storms. Along the journey, the party has opportunities to meet many people who inhabit Northern Shiran and the reaches of The Vastness. They may find members of an Ancient Order of dwarves given the charge to protect the crystal caves which broach the planet\u2019s magical ley line network. They may happen upon a society of rabbit folk called the \u2018Jir\u2019 who inhabit the belly of giant megafauna that roam The Vastness. Their paths may cross an infamous group of drifter and dasher pilots known as the Frigid Flyers who rove The Vastness and claim it as their home. The adventurers must expect the unexpected while they seek causes to mysterious happenings in a region that few survive, and even fewer understand. What will happen, what will they find, and what does it all mean?\n\nWelcome to Scourge of Shiran.\nScourge of Shiran is an adventure written by The Game Academy, set in the World of Alessia, a 5e-compatible (and soon to be Starfinder) game setting published by Storm Bunny Studios. Scourge of Shiran is the published version of one of four summer adventures to be featured in The Game Academy's 2021 Adventure Gaming Summer Camp. The adventure is designed to be played over 5 to 6 four-hour game sessions with provided 3rd level characters and taking the characters through 5th level. \nThe final published adventure book will be 96 pages for our standard edition, and 120 pages for our special educator's edition, which will feature educational sidebars and call-outs for integrating the events in the adventure with real-world academic STEM subjects. Along with the educator's edition, we are also publishing an accompanying 96-page student workbook for student players to track their progress through the adventure, as well as record their reflections on the educational aspects of the game, and answers to related puzzles and exercises created to blend perfectly between the game and the classroom.\nAlong with our internal staff, and in partnership with Storm Bunny Studios, we are fortunate to include a cadre of RPG superstar writers and developers taking our project into the A-level game. Here's a peek at our epic team of heroes...\nWelcome to the Kickstarter for the Scourge of Shiran Adventure \u2013 an educationally themed space fantasy adventure set in the World of Alessia. Designed for the 5th edition of the world\u2019s most popular roleplaying game, this adventure takes player characters out into the Vastness, a dangerous northern wasteland where an alien threat slowly spreads\u2026\nSet exclusively in the World of Alessia Campaign Setting, this collaboration pairs The Game Academy\u2019s organizational goals with Storm Bunny Studio\u2019s vision for Alessia, creating an immersive adventure that teaches while entertaining.\nWhile all good adventures distract us, the Scourge of Shiran Adventure entertains while encouraging communication, collaborative problem-solving, and divergent thinking.\nThis adventure combines top-level writing from a host of industry RPG authors with educational pedagogy and social awareness, creating a tool that educators can use in an academic setting that encourages positive and constructive behavior.\nUsing classic themes adjusted for today\u2019s age, this adventure empowers the heroes to change their environment, the Vastness, and with it, the world.  \n\n Born from the combined vision of game designers Jere Manninen and Jaye Sonia, the World of Alessia is a futuristic utopia whose native y\u00f6kai mingle peacefully with dozens of alien species of which are carefully protected by the divinely crafted Rings of Heaven.\nWith all its advantages, Alessia remains a place filled with threats \u2013 both inside and out. While its Rings of Heaven keep outside invaders unable to penetrate the planet in force, smaller assaults remain a constant threat to the people below.\nAlessia is a rich setting that focuses on the heroic, mixing elements of Wuxia with science fiction to create an alternate, non-human centric campaign setting that encourages the heroic alongside the inquisitive.\nA Different Approach to Conflict Resolution\nAlthough the World of Alessia has many of the same problems of any modern society, the historical struggles of Alessia\u2019s proud y\u00f6kai and their alien allies have given rise to a truly wondrous future \u2013 a future worth defending.\nAlessia\u2019s cultural norms, especially in places like the Empire of Xian and the Free Cities of Shiran, encourage and practice de-escalation techniques whenever possible; in places where the Empire\u2019s Peacekeepers hold the front, this is doubly important.\nEvery encounter in the Scourge of Shiran Adventure has been carefully tailored to showcase the many non-violent solutions available to heroes while still giving the players opportunities to take action when necessary.  \nWorld of Alessia 5e Primer Version on SALE (334 pages)\nWe at The Game Academy (TGA) are a 501(c)3 educational non-profit organization committed to the social, emotional, and academic success of learners of all ages through the use of tabletop role-playing games and live-action role-play. We provide collaborative storytelling experiences that encourage academic and social/emotional skills in youth ages 8-18 and adults through our innovative enrichment classes, summer camps, and custom made curricula for educators.\nWhile we are based in the San Francisco Bay Area, we have been working with educators across the country to accomplish our mission since our inception in 2016. Our staff has worked in education and educational gaming since the early 2000s.  \n Storm Bunny Studios is a small, Wisconsin-based tabletop roleplaying game company that publishes several campaign settings, including the Rhune: Dawn of Twilight Campaign Setting, Mike Myler\u2019s Mists of Akuma, and the World of Alessia Campaign Setting, in which the Scourge of Shiran Adventure takes place.\nFounded in 2012 by author Jaye Sonia, Storm Bunny Studios has maintained an informal relationship with The Game Academy since 2016. They are excited to be officially teaming up to create some world-changing content.  \n\n\nThe Game Academy has served children and adults through their various programs since 2016, continuing the work that the founders Joshua Archer and Bert Holcomb were doing for at least 5 years previously under Iocari Games. In founding The Game Academy, Joshua and Bert adopted a new mandate to bring professional educational tabletop role-playing games to a wider audience, including the underrepresented, economically disadvantaged, and at-risk youth who would not afford the programs run under a for-profit model. TGA operates under the principle of never turning away a child from their programs due to economic hardship. At any given time, 30% or more of the participants are on a partial or full scholarship. \nWith their year-round Enrichment Gaming Program (EGP), Adventure Gaming Summer Camp (AGSC), Winter and Spring Break mini-camps, and their Game Master Training and Certification Program (GMTP), The Game Academy has served over two hundred individual children and adults during their four years of operation, with concurrent enrollment reaching over 100 students at its peak.\nThrough their various programs and offerings, The Game Academy has become a community of participants and their families that supports each member with a safe environment in which they place their trust and find belonging. Over a third of the programs' participants have some type of physical, emotional, or intellectual challenge, which the TGA staff are equipped and prepared to support through normalization and open communication. Every participant has an opportunity to find belonging and support, from which they can build confidence, trust, and deep relationships.\nThe Game Academy has also worked with school systems to create game-based learning units for the classroom. One engagement was a year-long adaptation of a high school Spanish class into a live-action role-play focusing on real-world skills and practices pertaining to life after high school. Another engagement was a ten-day middle school unit educating the class on the American Industrial Revolution. Both projects were well-received and increased motivation and engagement in the materials of the class.\nWhen our nation experienced the shutdown in March 2020, The Game Academy made a hard pivot from in-person classes to an entirely online delivery model within a matter of weeks. We were able to continue our programs with most of our students, and consequently able to retain most of our staff. Through this new model, TGA has been able to reach new populations that live in diverse and remote locations and provide gaming sessions for adults, which offer relief from social isolation and general anxiety experienced as a consequence of living through a pandemic.\nIn many cases, The Game Academy has shown resilience, resourcefulness, and flexibility that has allowed them to continue to serve their community's needs and thrive in times that have been less than ideal. TGA is adept at identifying advantages in times of hardship and strives to provide its community with top-quality educational and entertaining experiences. TGA views the collaboration with Storm Bunny Studios, through The World of Alessia, as a significant advantage in addressing the inequities and social stresses of our current age through the defense and development of a utopian society.  \n\nADD-ONS\nWe have a few add-ons available for those wishing to show further support to our project and to educators.\n$10 - Gift a PDF copy to a qualified educator.\nWe strive to get Scourge of Shiran into as many educators' hands as possible, and with your generosity, we can make this a reality. Pledge an extra $10 and we will give a PDF copy of the Scourge of Shiran to a qualified educator - of your choice, or our own.\n\n$25 - Get your very own  Master Tenzin Tee!\nShow your support for Scourge of Shiran by wearing this high-quality Tee with Master Tenzin\nWhile we will be releasing Scourge of Shiran in October 2021, show your support early by wearing this finely-crafted tee-shirt printed with Master Tenzin on the front. With Master Tenzin, you will never lose your way.\nThe Game Academy and Storm Bunny Studios view our collaboration on Scourge of Shiran as an opportunity to bring educational pedagogy and creative excellence together and produce a top-notch adventure that will be useful in the classroom as well as exciting to play for all.\nAs a non-profit, The Game Academy focuses on the combined good we can do through this project. Fortunately, Storm Bunny Studios shares our values and is excited to work with us on a series of adventures that bring together the industry's best talent and challenge assumptions, introduce scientific concepts, and educate in critical and divergent thinking. Scourge of Shiran serves as our first collaboration of many to come.\nPart of the good we are celebrating in our project is the bringing together of talented writers, designers, artists, and educational experts and collaborating with them on a project of value and principle. We are also committed to putting as much of the operating budget as we can afford into paying our contributors as well as we are capable.\nWe are also committed to providing Scourge of Shiran to educators at as close to production costs as possible. Our launch on Giving Tuesday is an opportunity for early bidders to secure a free copy of Scourge of Shiran to verified educators and moving beyond the launch, we are providing an educator package that will equip them with everything they need to run a successful campaign for their students at a fraction of the retail cost. Each contribution to our project includes an offset amount that pays to supply verified educators with our products for free or at cost.\nDeliverables\nScourge of Shiran (Standard and Educator\u2019s Editions)\n We aim to deliver Scourge of Shiran in October of 2021, avoiding the possibility of spoiling the adventure for the participants in The Game Academy\u2019s Adventure Gaming Summer Camp 2021. We are producing this 120-page adventure with a standard edition as well as an educator\u2019s edition. The educator\u2019s edition will add call-outs and references to educational standards met and individual educational units that tie into the story's plot.\nScourge of Shiran Players\u2019 Guide\nBefore this, however, we aim to produce and release a Scourge of Shiran Players\u2019 Guide, which will provide backers with an exciting preview of the things to come in the main adventure. The Scourge of Shiran Players\u2019 Guide will contain character backgrounds, example characters, extra art, new character classes and options, and details on factions found in Shiran.\nScourge of Shiran Student Workbook\nAlong with the release of the Educator\u2019s Edition of Scourge of Shiran, we will also be releasing a 96-page 7\u201d x 9\u201d Student Workbook. In this elegant workbook, students will:\nTrack their characters statistics, experience, and possessions,\nWrite their character\u2019s backstories and motivations.\nTrack their character\u2019s progress through the adventure,\nTake notes, observations, and reflections, and\nRecord answers to surrogate puzzles and academic word problems used in bridging the content of the adventure and related classwork.\n$20k - Racing The Wind\nOnce we reach the $20k mark, we will produce a 24-page 1st-level Adventure in Shiran - Racing The Wind, to be delivered to all backers at $20 or more as PDF, and for all backers of $40 and more as a softcover print. Racing the Wind features the beast riders of Shiran and introduces many of the factions and locations in the lands below the Vastness.\n$25k - Finding the Sacred Way\nOnce we reach the $25k mark, we will open the \u201cSeeker of the Sacred Way\u201d pledge level. Backers at this level will receive all the perks of the \u2018Shadow Operative\u201d pledge level and will also be enrolled in The Game Academy\u2019s Game Master Training and Certification program\u2019s GMT 101 - Fundamentals of Game Mastery. On successful completion, they will receive a beautifully illustrated and signed certificate commemorating the course's completion.\nOn top of these rewards to you, you will also enable us to pay our writers & artists at a  higher rate. The Game Academy puts human value above all else and is happy to increase the rate for our talented and skillful writers and artists. \nTimes are difficult right now, and we\u2019re doing what we can to help creatives stay employed as creatives. In this way, we are doing our part to support the artists who feed our souls and who also are struggling to survive through the pandemic.\n$30k - Mastering the Vastness\nOnce we reach the $30k mark, we will launch the \u201cMaster of the Vastness\u201d pledge level. Backers at this level will receive all the perks of the \u2018Shadow Operative\u2019 pledge level and will also be enrolled in The Game Academy\u2019s complete Game Master Training and Certification program. Currently, the program consists of four classes: GMT 101 - Fundamentals of Game Mastery, GMT 220 - Storytelling for Interactive Media, GMT 330 - Adventure Production, and GMT 350 - Adventure Publication.\nOn top of these rewards to you, you will also enable us to pay our writers & artists a yet higher rate. The Game Academy puts human value above all else and is happy to increase the rate for our talented and skillful writers and artists.\n$40k - Starfinder RPG Edition\nAt reaching the $40k mark in pledges, we will publish a version of Scourge of Shiran compatible with Starfinder RPG. This will be for both the standard and the education editions.\n$50k - Increasing the Educational Power\nAt reaching the $50k mark in pledges, we will expand the size and scope of our student workbooks from 96 pages to 192 pages, including actual suggested standards-aligned STEM-based problems and experiments at different grade levels to include in your classroom or homeschool work, which mirrors the activities that your students' characters will be experiencing in the adventure itself.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is The Game Academy\u2019s first Kickstarter, but our risks are mitigated by a number of factors, including our own experience writing over 30 large-scale adventures over the last 6 years of our Adventure Gaming Summer Camp, as well as our superior choice of partners in this project. \n\nWe are working in close collaboration with Storm Bunny Studios, who have run and successfully managed 6 different Kickstarter projects. Our creative collaborators are professional writers and artists known for their skill and their reliability, some having worked for established companies such as Wizards of the Coast and Paizo for over twenty years. Additionally, because of our partnership, we will be starting this project with a large asset library which will reduce costs and expedite delivery.\n\nFurthermore, our parallel internal commitment to developing and releasing this adventure in time for our 2021 summer camp season guarantees that we are going to complete the story in plenty of time before we release in October 2021.

So terrible was its might, so bottomless its depravity, that it would lay siege to the very Gates of Heaven! Greatest of them all was Uyu-Yadmogh, First among Princes, Devourer of Children. Now Tzyan is dust and its atrocities long forgotten. But in the darkness something lingers\u2026\nA great quake splits the earth asunder. Hushed whispers in begrimed taverns speak of a necropolis, deep within the wastes. Soothsayers tell fortunes of riches untold, knowledge best kept secret, and evil that never sleeps but rages eternally inside a cage of rotting flesh. Those that would help themselves to the palace's treasures had best move swiftly. Others are coming. Riches, Madness and Death await\u2026in the Palace of Unquiet Repose.\nFirst Level of the Palace of Unquiet Repose\nHi! I'm PrinceofNothing. I am the co-writer of the critically acclaimed Red Prophet Rises, I've been a Creative Consultant on Venger Satanis's highly successful Chaalt gonzo mega-dungeon  and I am the author of the popular RPG-blog Age of Dusk. For years on end I've reviewed countless RPG products. Today I present to you the distilled essence of 2 years of obsessive craftsmanship. \nSeamlessly integrating a uniquely horrific atmosphere with brutal location-based adventuring, Palace of Unquiet Repose is a 50-page thrill-ride taking place in the Age of Dusk setting; a brutal Sword & Sorcery epoch, where the Gods have been slain, nameless horrors prowl the wastes baying for blood, and mankind has been reduced to a dim shadow of its former glory. Your players will face horrors never seen before as they explore the subterranean underworld realm of the Palace of Unquiet Repose.\nPalace of Unquiet Repose is likely to be the most challenging, intense, harrowing and insane adventure your players have ever experienced. They will descend into the mythical underworld of the Glass Waste and come face to face with an evil that time has forgotten. \nYou will begin your adventure in distant Iotha, Pearl of the Desert. In its opium-suffused boutiques and sweltering bazaars you will gather rumors, lies, prophecies and meet ferocious companions; the discerning Shing the Many-Tongued, the enigmatic Rastilir of Muir, the omniscient and abrasive Cent!\nI said Horrors never seen before, and this is no hyperbole. Nearly every monster, magic item, trap or effect in Palace is entirely new, never before seen. Are you ready to face such blood-freezing terrors as:\n* The beautiful but deadly Nzembarian Concubines\n* The enigmatic Azarog, whose limbs are the bodies of Dead Men\n* The reality-devouring horror of the Wolf of Final Night\n* The all-seeing, angle-annihilating gaze of the Sartoom\nThese are but a few of the countless sanity-blasting terrors that await those who dare to venture within the Palace of Unquiet Repose!\nCharacters will have to rely on more then their brawn. Other factions are exploring the Palace. The fanatical Children of the Silver Tree. The invincible Sial-Atun mercenaries. And the Nine, worshipers of old Tzyan, have come seeking for terrible secrets. These will have to be used, betrayed and cast aside to stand any chance of overcoming the Palace's countless guardians.\nIn order to make it compatible with most oldschool games but accessible for newer players Palace has been written for the elegant Labyrinth Lord ruleset and can be easily adapted to both older and the newest edition of the world's most popular role playing game. It is suitable for character levels 3 - 5.\nPalace of Unquiet Repose has the potential to be not just one of the finest modules ever written, but the next evolution in OSR adventure design. Joining forces with Malrex of the Merciless Merchants once again, we have broken our backs and crawled through miles of broken glass trying to bring this monster into being. We have done all we could. The rest is up to you.   \n After two years, the writing is all but complete, the editing almost done, the maps complete, but there's something missing. The art! We want to give Palace of Unquiet Repose the type of art that can properly invoke the otherworldly horror and bottomless antiquity of the Age of Dusk. For that we need YOUR HELP.\nThe Azarog by James Vail\nWith your support, we can afford fantastic artists like Chris Cold and James Vail to bring the Palace of Unquiet Repose to life and give you an adventure that looks every bit as disturbing as it plays. \nA note about the Uyu-Yadmogh Reborn Tier: Anyone who lends their aid to such a terrible endeavor will have their name inscribed forever on the credit section and receive not just coupons of the Print+PDF of Palace of Unquiet Repose, but also Red Prophet Rises. But tread lightly; For each petitioner who reaps such vast rewards Uyu-Yadmogh's hit points will increase by one.  \nPilgrim on the Osseous Road; A true devotee deserves something...special. The deluxe edition of Palace will feature additional artwork and content, including the 5-8 page bonus adventure The Screaming Caverns, and will NOT BE AVAILABLE ANYWHERE ELSE. Tread even lighter; Uyu-Yadmogh's Power will increase by two hit points for every traveler on the Osseous Road! \nFulfillment for digital rewards (PDFs) is handled by DriveThruRPG.

It's all set against a sprawling metropolis in a medieval world and delivered to you as a single-volume hardcover book or PDF. You'll find everything you need to make your next campaign super.\nInside there are thematic subclasses, superhero origins, sidekick options, an epic setting, an adventure or two, supervillain and monster stat blocks, lairs and strongholds, and optional rules to elevate your campaign to heroic levels.\nWhat Is the Setting?\nThe world of Ghaistala was uninhabited until 400 years ago when inter-dimensional portals opened up, drawing people from all over the multiverse to a strange obelisk standing in the center of a seaside valley surrounded by tall peaks. These diverse peoples founded a city and named it Beacon, so called for its power to draw folk to it.\nThe populace of Beacon has a propensity for power. Waves of energy known as arkwaves ripple through the cosmos every twenty years, instilling strange abilities seemingly at random. But beyond that, the people themselves often strive for greatness through engineering and physical prowess. And the obelisk that called people here has mysterious properties and secrets of its own. With all this, Beacon truly is a city of supers.\nToday, Beacon is a shining city on a hill but with a seedy underbelly. Its Protectorate Peaks keep out fearsome monsters abroad, though threats abound in the city as well, from the dangerous steets of Lowcity to the corruption at the highest levels of government. The Portaleers, the premier superhero team, safeguard the city, but even they can't be everywhere at once. And sometimes even heroes fall.\nWill you take up the heroes' call? Will you stand against injustice and criminality? Will you root out corruption and throw down tyranny? Will you fight the monsters threatening at the door and bring down the villains with powers to match your own?\nAll this and more awaits you in Supers & Sorcery! \nStretch Goals\nEach stretch goal gives the writing team a pay increase for their hard work bringing this world to life.

Despite societal backlash and anti-Chinese laws, they have turned a profit and their quality of life has recently improved.\nNight, however, brings a new terror.\nPlayers take on the roles of members of the Chinese family (mostly from Guangdong province), spanning three generations, who face threats of jiangshi (hopping vampires) at night and racism by day. It has players balancing the responsibility of maintaining their family business with protecting themselves and their community from the dreaded Jiangshi. This is primarily a game about storytelling. Combat is limited, but horror, drama and sometimes comedy are the primary vehicles for driving the game forward.\nJiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall is a tabletop roleplaying game which combines elements of RPGs with those of traditional board games. The game can be played as a \"mini-series\" or a one-shot.\nEach game takes place over a number of days (usually five), alternating between day and night scenes where the roleplaying scenes take place.  Day and night have different threats - in the daytime, the restaurant may experience racism or gang violence, while in the night time, Jiangshi are seeking warm bodies. During the day characters complete assigned restaurant tasks in order to keep the family business running. \nEvery morning, the Game Moderator deals out a tableau of Restaurant cards that the family will need to complete before diners start to arrive. Each Restaurant card needs from 1 hour to 3 hours to complete. Usually, the oldest member of the family takes charge and starts delegating the tasks to specific players. Each player uses their Resilience slots to complete tasks, indicated by the time and energy they have available to do it.\nOnce the tasks have been completed to the best of the family\u2019s abilities, the GM takes any Restaurant cards that were left undone and places them on the central Restaurant board, rotating them such that the consequences face the players and cover the restaurant\u2019s slots.\nRestaurant Board\nPrior to starting the morning scenes, the first thing each character must do is see how they\u2019re feeling from the trials and tribulations of the previous day. Each player rolls 1D4 and receives that many Mung cards from the GM which represent the dreams and nightmares of the characters. \nSome of the Mung cards are in color which represent good dreams. Other Mung are in black and white, which represents bad dreams. When a player receives a bad Mung card, they place it in one of the card slots on their Character sheet, covering a trait (Item, Skill, Facet, etc.), in numerical order. While covered, a trait cannot be used. To rid themselves of a bad Mung, a character needs to talk about the bad Mung card with another player character during the afternoon or evening scenes. Once they\u2019ve talked about it, they can discard the card.\nArtwork by Sadia Bies\nAfter receiving their Mung cards, players take turns explaining their dreams to each other and the GM. \nDescribe the dream or nightmare based on the image on the cards\nWhat are these visions like and what do they mean, if anything?\nOn subsequent mornings, any remaining Mung cards from previous rounds are kept as recurring nightmares that continue to plague the player character. They will roll the 1D4 as usual for more Mung cards, but instead of adding that number of cards to their character sheet, the result indicates the maximum number of Mung cards that the player character has to deal with this day.\nCharacter Sheet\nThe Character Sheet has several details about the player character that a player can fill out. During the game, Resilience slots may get covered up by Mung cards or Jiangshi cards. A character takes a Jiangshi card when they take stress or physical damage. When a Resilience slot gets covered by a Jiangshi card or a Mung card, that detail about the PC gets removed from play until they are healed. If a PC gets a Jiangshi card on a slot that already has a Mung card, they will remove the Mung card and replace it with the new Jiangshi card.\nOnce they have all 8 slots filled with Jiangshi cards, the player will then become a Jiangshi and they would flip over all the Jiangshi cards to reveal their new Skills. Though this fate can be terrifying, these cards can be healed and removed through game play. \nArtwork by Steven Wu\nPlayers can create Spirit Papers by taking a slip of paper and writing a short phrase or sentence on it that captures how the family of characters stays strong and together. Spirit Papers can only be used once during the night time phases.\nThe GM must count to ten in secret while the family is thinking of their word or sentence. If the time expires and the family has not yet agreed upon what to write on the Spirit Paper, the Spirit Paper will not work.\nIf the Spirit Paper works (i.e. a meaningful phrase or sentence was written with the 10-second time limit), the Jiangshi has been immobilized and players can move onto healing their family member or evading the Jiangshi they\u2019re faced with.\nThe whole group of non-GM players starts with a Family pool of six eight-sided dice (6D8) on the first day. As they progress through the days, player characters start feeling the stress the hauntings levy on the family, reducing their pool of dice available. These dice are used to overcome challenges, or to help council and care for the emotional health of the family, removing Mung cards from their character sheets.\nWhen a player is determining the outcome of a challenge they are engaged with, they roll all the dice in the Family pool at once and take the highest single value from one of the dice that they rolled as their outcome. Once per scene, a character can use one of their skills to reroll the dice pool to try to achieve a better result. \nTo determine the highest single value from a roll, complete the following steps:\n Clean house! Check for 4\u2019s in the pool: For every die that is showing a 4 in the pool, cancel out a die from the pool that is showing the highest value in the pool along with the die showing the 4, placing them back on the Day/Night Tracker.\n   Check for highest valued D8 in pool: The higher the die roll, the better the outcome.\nMing is rolling the Family pool to cook a feast for visiting dignitaries on Day 1. Ming\u2019s first roll results in the following: 1 2 2 3 4 4 - their highest result is a 2 as the two 4s cancel out the 3 and one of the 2s, respectively! Wanting to impress their guests, Ming uses their Cooking Skill and rerolls the Family pool, ending up with the following result: 1 3 3 4 7 8. Their highest result is 7 because the 8 is cancelled out by the 4. Wiping their brow, Ming's character breathes a sigh of relief and serves a gorgeous noodle dish to the members of the San Francisco city council.\nArtwork by Steven Wu\n\nThis game rewards player characters for failing, because it makes for a more interesting story! When a failure happens, the player who rolled receives an Individual die. The GM will also give player characters a die towards their Individual Pool when something occurs that makes their character happy or hopeful towards their Hopes and Dreams (labeled on their character sheet).\nWhile the main use of Individual dice is to assist other players, a player character may add any number of their Individual dice to their own Challenge rolls. If they do this, ALL of the dice they use in this way are returned to the GM once the Challenge roll is resolved.\nPlaying a Chinese Character\nThis game isn\u2019t just for Asian-Americans - this game can be played by anyone! Just remember that the topics deal with some very real history and politics (Jiangshi aside).\n\nHere are some tips on how to play:\nAvoid using accents\nAvoid exoticizing the culture - mysticism sometimes paints a culture in a very flat and two-dimensional way, so try to stay away from fortune cookies\nTreating the characters with respect is very important, so try to stay away from stereotypes. Not every Asian knows kung-fu, for example. In fact, Martial Arts is a Skill that only some player characters might have chosen for their character sheet.\nDo a little bit of research before playing. You don\u2019t have to have a degree in Asian studies, but just know what you\u2019re getting into.

YOUR PLEDGE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COST OF SHIPPING.\nWe will be using BackerKit, a pledge manager, to collect information from backers.\nNOTE: The final cost of shipping may differ from our estimations, and there will be slight variation from country to country. We will also be charging applicable taxes based on your location.

With each one we have learned more about the industry and best practices. We are entering this project with the project almost completely designed, and developed, with only our final quantities left to nail down before sending to production. With the things we learned from previous projects, we are confident we can handle this project. Game and a Curry brings a wealth of knowledge to this partnership as well, and we know we'll be able to make this project as good as it can possibly be.\n\nQ: How much of the books are already finished?\nA: The game is pretty much complete and ready to send to production. The text potentially added by stretch goals is not written yet, but the writers will be able to complete their portions quickly. Many of these adventure stretch goals are to be digital goals, potentially collected into another volume later, and will have no impact on the delivery of the main product.\n\nQ: Have you produced all these items before?\nA: Between Wet Ink Games, Game and a Curry, and our production partners, all of these components have been made before and are well within our capabilities to produce using industry best practices.\n\nQ: What if shipping costs increase?\nA: Shipping costs are well beyond our control. We\u2019ve made our best projections and those shipping fees will be collected through Backer Kit. Once that money is in hand, we\u2019ll send the items, even it we end up eating a cost increase.

To ensure that we remain respectful and authentic, we have employed a range of expert cultural consultants: Daniel Kwan, David Pena, Heba Elsherief, Mehr Husain, and Sachiko Burton. We would also like to thank our consultants, Salt and Sage Books, for their services in arranging specialist readers.\nHere are just some of the many mythological figures and maleficent monsters that you will find within. \nThis 230-page full-colour hardcover contains over one hundred stat blocks drawn from myths, legends, and history all across the world, each beautifully illustrated with full descriptions and designer's notes, with Challenge ratings from 1 to 35 (well, we had to include Lucifer, Cthulhu, and Fenrir!) \nForeword by James Ward (Deities & Demigods)\n\nMythological Figures is a weekly column on EN World by Mike Myler. It includes both historical and fictional figures built as NPCs using class levels and standard ability scores, and mythical monsters designed with statblocks that adhere to the stories told about them in our world. A new entry appears every week on Monday. The first entry was Achilles, in March 2018. This book compiles the column with all new art!  \nEntries come from origins as wide-ranging as British, Chinese, Norse, Greek, Japanese, Middle Eastern, American, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, European, and more.   \nThe back cover\nSo, who's in? \nThe 100-or so entries included in Mythological Figures & Maleficent Monsters were those requested to be featured in the weekly column by Mike Myler. They represent a fun and eclectic sprinkling of different archetypes, encompassing myth, legend, and history. Also found throughout the book are over 30 new magical items, such as Excalibur and Mj\u00f6lnir. Mike's column is ongoing, so if there's any mythological figure you'd like to see in the future, be sure to ask him on EN World!\nThe Masterclass Codex\nYou may note that some of the mythological figures in this book use classes not found in the 5E core rulebooks - Billy the Kid, for example, is a gunslinger. We have tried to keep to the core rules, but where the design demanded it, we recruited additional classes from The Masterclass Codex. \nThe Masterclass Codex, was a very successful Kickstarter we ran last year. It had over 2,600 backers, and is a very popular 5E book. You can pick up The Masterclass Codex, which contains 16 classes for your 5E games, right here.\nThis book contains the alchemist, cardcaster, diabolist, feywalker, morph, noble, occultist, bloodweaver, fatebender, gemini, geomancer, gunfighter, lodestar, monster tamer, savant, and tinkerer classes. \n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"Brand new, original and fully developed classes that will make the other players at your table jealous. These are balanced options that feel completely different from everything else out there.\" -Garin J.\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"My players have all been loving this book, maybe even a little too much since they keep passing it around the table!\" -Cole Dilworth\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"The classes were well thought out. Not overpowered in any way. Good read and good format.\" -NiceDM\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"Well written and an easy read.\" -Jody B\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"New and inventive\" -brettandrewdavey\n Alchemist: Scientific Sorcery. The alchemist uses an almost scientific approach to magic to make alchemical discoveries. Will your alchemist become immune to poison, or discover the Elixir of Life? Will you delve into the Science of Creation and build a homunculus, or research the Science of Destruction and devise explosives? We also expand on the alchemist class with three new advanced studies: the Science of Illumination, the Science of Mutation, and the Science of Regeneration. Also included are two new spells, and an update which gives the alchemist a little more \u201coomph.\u201d\n Cardcaster: Seers of Fate. The cardcaster uses a tarot deck to release magic, playing cards to cast spells\u2014although she doesn\u2019t always have control over what spells are currently made available to her by the winds of fate! Also included are three subclasses: the Knight of Swords, which embodies mental force and determination; the Page of Wands, which embodies the magical power of creation; and the Queen of Cups, with embodies the emotions. This class is also supported by new feats and new secrets, including the King of Pentacles, which pertains to thrift and wealth; and the Jack of Beasts, which unleashes the trapped spirits of monsters.\n Diabolist: Students of Darkness. Diabolists deal with forbidden secrets and dark entities, grasping for power through dark pacts. While they have things in common with necromancers and warlocks, diabolists are something entirely more\u2026diabolical! Also included are two dark paths: the Demonic path and the Devilish path. We also introduce some conjured horrors, such as the accuser devil, contract devil, and more!\n Feywalker: A Taste of Primal Chaos. The feywalker is a mysterious warrior with mystical powers. Feywalkers can teleport short distances, breathe in air and water, and enchant others with a glance. They can also choose from three primal spheres: Beasts, Plants, or Entropy.\n Morph: Changing Faces. The morph is a shapechanging specialist, able to slide between different forms. Morphs have a choice of three essences\u2014the Doppleganger, thePrimordial Beast, and the Trickster\u2014and a selection of Morph Talents they can choose from and acquire.\n Noble: Chessmaster and Commander. Leader, tactician, and a source of inspiration, the full 20-level noble class is able to command and inspire through three paths: the Path of the Heart, the Path of the Brave, and the Path of the Tactician.\n Occultist: Freeing the Monster Within. The occultist allows you to play a monster, with a choice of three distinct paths: Abomination, Vampire, or Werecreature! Delve into the dark and secret creatures of the night, cursed to exist as monstrous beings shunned by the world.\n Bloodweaver: Macabre Magician. Bloodweavers fuel their magical powers with their own blood, enhancing their own prowess, healing or bolstering allies, and flaying open their foes. They can sense the presence of creatures of flesh and bone, resist the cold reach of death, and manipulate a target\u2019s blood to spectacular, deadly effect. Choose from the Bloodbinder, Crimson Witch, and Scarlet Reaper subclasses!\n Fatebender: Destiny\u2019s Chosen. At the extreme edges of fate\u2019s tapestry, fatebenders pull upon its fraying threads, tugging at the strands of chance. Fatebenders manipulate their own dice rolls as well as those of allies and enemies, further relying on luck to make uncanny discoveries, avoid lethal attacks, and make the most of their own strikes. Subclasses include the Mascot, Jinx, and Weaver!\n Gemini: Two\u2010Faced Warrior. Evading and confounding enemies, gemini create dangerous semi\u2010real multiples of themselves and copy their foes\u2019 techniques. Their duality affects more than how they wage war however, and each embodies two major contrasting ideals, never certain which will be at the fore the next time they wake. Will you select the Atavist, the Equalist, or the Reluctant Hero?\n Geomancer: Nature\u2019s Hearthmage. These mages turn the surrounding elements into potent weapons and tools and fuel their spells with the primal components of creation. Geomancers can also protect companions from harm and draw upon nature outside of battle to reveal reality\u2019s secrets. Four distinct orders\u2014the Conqueror, the Apothecary, the Architect, and the Rune Knight.\n Gunfighter: Black Powder Desperado. These warriors shoot their way across the field of battle, pausing only long enough to aim their next bullets. Gunfighters are adept with the guns they choose to master, picking off targets hidden behind cover with precise shooting and aiming telling shots that leave enemies with catastrophic wounds. The Bushwacker, Drifter, and Maverick make your choice of subclasses!\n Lodestar: Fractured Soul Given Form. In combat lodestars are poetry in motion, their innate powers bringing both wonder and woe. To keep from unraveling into madness these fractured souls must train and hone their skills, becoming masters of body and mind\u2014and their lodestones, magical spheres used to attack, defend, and more. The lodestar chooses from three methods: Control, Imagination, or Instinct.\n Monster Tamer: Companion of Beasts. Monster tamers bond with monstrous pets, whether beasts, exotic aberrations, slimes, or even draconic in nature! Though significantly weaker on their own, tamers with companions make for a potent and unique addition to any group of adventurers able to tolerate the presence of a monster in their midst. Select from the Animalist regimen, Monstrous regimen, and Oddball regimen.\n Savant: Mind Over Matter. Sometimes saving the day means weaponizing knowledge. Savants are brilliant detectives, iconic martial artists, and adventurous physicians, each utilizing genius where others rely on magic or brute power. Repositories of lore, savants also use canny combat tricks to put enemies at a disadvantage. You might be an Adversary, a Chirurgeon, or a Coordinator.\n Tinkerer: Engineer of Wonder. Tinkerers bring life to impressive contraptions, create incredible devices, and forge legendary destinies! When not making or improving mundane items, tinkerers use their technical genius to unleash elemental fury upon their foes, relying upon their own brilliance to resist any magic that might subvert their will. Steam Knights, Bombardiers, and Mechanics make up the tinkerer's choice of subclasses!\nCollector's Gift Set\nFor collectors, and those looking for a great gift, we are producing a special Collector's Gift Set of both hardcovers with gorgeous faux-leather covers. We will only be doing one print run of these, so get 'em while you can!\nFinal design may change\nBonus Villain Spotlights! \nWe have a collection of additional villainous figures from the pages of EN5ider. Unlike those in the book above, these myths are not from our own world; they're our own fantasy creations! \nThese operate a little like 'stretch goals' -- each of the below Villain Spotlights is a PDF which all backers who have backed \u00a315 or more (the PDF tier or higher) will get for free as we reach certain funding targets. The higher the funding reaches, the more bonus free stuff you get! And not only that...\n... we give them to you as soon as we hit the stretch goal. Not after the campaign. Right away. Just as a little thank you for the trust you put in us and our project.\n REACHED! \u00a310,000 Villain Spotlight: Jaxi the Blightgunner. Although they are certainly places of decay and death, swamps are also home to a great deal of life and they bustle with activity\u2014the popping of gasses rising out of the muck, the chittering of insects ever searching for food, and in Chokewater, the clack of colliding lead firing off an explosive charge from Jaxi's rifle! The Blightgunner has fiercely protected her lair for 16 years now, though she has long since ceased loving her home and desperately searches for a way to escape its influence without giving up the powers it has bestowed upon her. In addition to her statblock (CR 7) this article includes a trio of magic items: an acid bullet recipe, drypowder, and Thorncase. Designed by Peter Martin, illustrated by Herman Lau and Savage Mojo.\n REACHED! \u00a320,000 Villain Spotlight: Rosie Arkwright. Halloween is the theme of this supplement, and to help spookify your games we've got an unassuming horror to titillate, captivate, and eviscerate adventurers: the undead ragdoll Rosie Arkwright. Despite her small size she is durable, deadly, and able to create legions of creatures like herself, vastly outnumbering victims before swarming upon them with mystical needle and thread used to sew up mouths, eyes, and lives! Brilliantly penned by Andrew Engelbrite with a wonderful illustration by Xanditz.\n REACHED! \u00a330,000 Villain Spotlight: Dras'a Wolf. This entry into the Villain Spotlight series is all about the scourge of the seas men know as Dras'a the Wolf, a hobgoblin pirate with incredible ambitions and the cunning to see them through. Originally master of the Drelway Chain of islands, after capturing a learned shipmaker from afar the monstrous buccaneer has been preparing for when his abductee's drafts and designs lead to ocean-worthy vessels, boats that will unleash him and his underlings to become a scourge upon the open waves.\n REACHED! \u00a340,000 Villain Spotlight: Skrivena Moc. Usually found deep within a dungeon near the site of a bloody battle, the blade Skrivena Moc seems at first to be a powerful weapon able to sear foes with fire and strike through even the toughest armor. What more it speaks to its wielders, offering advice and admiration in equal parts\u2014but only to gain their trust, convincing them that their unnatural attachment to it is nothing to fear all the while it slowly consumes their very soul! This devious intelligent magic item and creature was written by Andrew Engelbrite and illustrated by Rachel Maduro.\n REACHED! \u00a350,000 Villain Spotlight: Eshaq the Zealoutous. Eshaq was once the prophet of an evil deity. His reward for a lifetime of faithful servitude was being embalmed and interned in a temple but he was quickly forgotten with the passage of time. 200 years since the last of his disciples have perished Eshaq has risen to spread the gospel of his now dead god. A CR 17 undead creature from Robert Lashley; illustrated by Indi Martin. Also includes details and map of of Eshaq's lair, plot hooks, and the new Zealotous Undead template.\n REACHED! \u00a360,000. Villain Spotlight: Syndrathrax the Soul Eater. A mighty CR 27 monster! While technically an ancient red dragon, Syndrathrax\u2019s necromantic transformations and attempted apotheoses have forever altered her. Though she shares the massive size of her fellow red wyrms she is gaunt and skeletal, and her scales sapped of their red luster and now bone white. Thanks to the necromantic energy that permeates her body she radiates a faint spectral glow that she can mask when she chooses--the souls of those that she has swallowed are sometimes seen struggling vainly to escape in this light.\n REACHED! \u00a370,000. Villain Spotlight: Granny Buccus. Sweet, maternal, a dab hand in the kitchen, Granny Buccus is the heart of the town of Cridhe Briste. As the town\u2019s baker she provides the people with bread, cakes, and pastries\u2014on special occasions she even makes her famous  and beloved Boiled Tarts. The adoring townsfolk don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re under the spell of a succubus, ready and willing to do whatever 'Granny' asks of them!  By Anna Blackwell; illustrated by Alba Palacio.\n REACHED! \u00a380,000. Villain Spotlight: Glamdrellyxxana the Gold. A gold dragon druid under the influence of an ancient curse, Glamdrellyxxana believes the only way to ensure that the world remains \u2018good\u2019 is to destroy all humanoid life. From her lair in a mountain lake she's amassed an army of plant creatures to sweep down across the world and cleanse it of the blight from meddling civilizations destined to bring ruin with their advancement, yet the dragon often feels melancholy about the need to destroy so many living things. Glamdrellyxxana is resigned to this course of action however, convinced by fell visions of an industrialized future\u2014and distracted by mind-altering plants when the guilt becomes too much to bear. By Will Gawned; illustrated by J\u00falio Rocha.\n REACHED! \u00a390,000 Villain Spotlight: Vengar the Reader. Goblins are known for many things\u2014reading is not typically on that list, but it's not like Vengar is a typical goblin. Once a trapfinder for the Chokeleaf tribe, this errant necromancer went entirely off the deep end after selfishly stealing an ancient tome to fulfill his ambitions of power. The cursed book has sucked away his vitality and now Vengar travels from tribe to tribe posing as a shaman, utilizing everything he can to acquire more magics able to extend his piteous life before the dark entities he's pledges his soul to come calling for his debt. In addition to his statistics (CR 5), Vengar has access to a variety of enhanced undead that explode, ignite, poison, become conduits of deathly energies, and even hide other monsters inside their bodies. Designed by Charlie Brooks, illustrated by Renan Moraes.\n REACHED! \u00a3100,000. Villain Spotlight: Ezekial.Ezekial is a minotaur gifted (or maybe cursed) with intelligence and cunning beyond that of most of his kin. Ezekial is the leader of a small band of thieves who are on a crime spree stealing priceless artifacts and rare tomes of knowledge. This article describes Ezekial, his goals and personality, a description of his band of thieves, and lists possible plot-hooks that involve Ezekial.\nREACHED! \u00a3110,000. Villain Spotlight: Bezkusmet the Unscaled. Dragons are known to be terrifying but all pale in comparison to Bezkusmet the Unscaled. As his name suggests there is no hue or substance to his draconic scute leaving his musculature and skeleton bared for the world to see, lattices of finger-thick veins and arteries the size of a human\u2019s wrist inexorably pumping blood across his utterly naked body. Only a thin sheen of transparent magic holds Bezkusmet\u2019s organs and muscles in place, the last of the twisted supernatural energies of his birthright all that keeps him intact. By Mike Myler; illustrated by Claudio Pozas and Ekaterinya Vladinakova.\n\u00a3130,000. Monstrous Menagerie: From Stranger Woods. Four fantastical new fey monsters for your 5E game! The goat-horned ochokochi with a bony cleaver; the capricious trickster poludnitsa; the angelic-looking samovila, ladies of drought and harvest; and the repulsive via, with their gaze of dread.

We knew there was a demand for a more robust storytelling system using the d20 rules we loved, but at the time, we weren't honestly sure how ready the world was for our level of weird. \nAt the time, we were both working extensively with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game as our preferred d20 system. So, we wrote the first edition of Bloodlines & Black Magic as a variant ruleset for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.\nShortly after releasing the original Bloodlines & Black Magic in 2018, fans immediately started asking for a version that was compatible with the world's most popular roleplaying game - you know the one. We answered with a couple of class conversions (for the Brawler and Occultist) but realized that we would need to do more with that ruleset if we really wanted to make it work in the modern world.\nWe needed to update the skills, the Feats, the classes, all seven bloodlines, and every single spell in the game. But we also needed to better incorporate our iconic mechanical elements, as well - things like Pierce the Veil and The Arcana were big parts of the game we didn't want to just 'tack on' to a 5e conversion. We also needed to update firearms, armor, and a host of other details, as well. In short, we needed to do more than just convert the old book to a new system.\nWe needed to release a full system that gamers familiar with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, 5e, and other games could pick up and intuitively understand. This would require we create a much bigger book packed with everything you'd want to tell stories in a modern world. \nSo we did.\nWe've been writing, playtesting, and revising the newest edition of Bloodlines & Black Magic since the beginning of 2019. It's been a long process but one in which we've actively involved the larger gaming community. We've run games at Gen Con, GameHole Con, Gary Con, Sk\u00e5l Con, and online. You can see our most recent playtesting episodes, The Houses Of Halifax on Twitch). \nThroughout this process, we've solicited feedback from our previous backers, our fans, our developers, and our playtesters; we've made our active manuscript open and available to private groups who have played on their own, helping us identify elements we could improve, making this game even better. \nWe're pretty happy with how it's taken shape, too. \nNow, of course, it's time to share the game with the world again. We have a lot we want to do with this world and with your help, we can do so much more!\nLore | A Dark Reflection\nSo, what have we made? \nBloodlines & Black Magic is a darker, modern roleplaying game with strong occult and horror elements set in a world that mirrors ours. Unlike ours, it is a world filled with monsters - human and cryptid alike - that lurk in the shadows, just beyond the ken of most of the mortal realms. As such, it is also a game of heroes - calling on the player characters to step into the Invisible World to destroy the things that, left unchecked, would devour the very world they love.\nWant a quick preview? Check out this free PDF. \nBloodlines &Black Magic is also a game about people pursuing power for any number of ends, with some becoming powerful Sovereigns capable of ruling entire Domains inside the Invisible World. Others might take different paths, becoming Travelers who seek out the Invisible City and from there, all of the many Abhorrent Heavens beyond.\nBloodlines &Black Magic is a game about discovery. As heroes seek the truth, they learn to look for clues - Physical, Psychic, and Social - that help them distinguish the difference between the foul influences of the Infernal from the warlike radiance of the Celestial Realms. Of course, this search for the truth is where heroes like the Occultist, the Operative, and the Psychic shine - each of which might call on any number of potent powers or resources to help their allies get to (or cover-up) the truth about the world around them.\nLikewise, Bloodlines & Black Magic is a game about choices - the decisions player characters make directly impact their relationship with the world around them. Using a system of magical attunement, player characters learn to gain power by creating relationships with the world around them, forming powerful bonds with TheArcana, their bloodline abilities, other entities, magical items, magical locations, other people, and even their class skills!\nAs these players form these magical bods, they also begin to cement their place in the lore of the larger world. So, when a player chooses to bond with a powerful magical item, group, or even a powerful entity, that choice matters. \nStory-Focused, Narrative Driven\nBloodlines & Black Magic is a different kind of d20 game. While it uses a mechanical model most GMs will find incredibly intuitive, it does so with a completely different set of mechanical assumptions; Bloodlines & Black Magic doesn't track XP in the way a lot of fantasy roleplaying games do. \nSo, where some games mechanically encourage player characters to lean into combat to earn XP (producing a violent grind to power and wealth), Bloodlines & Black Magic encourages player characters to carefully choose how and when they engage their enemies - as any battle could be their last.\nWhile Bloodlines & Black Magic uses a CR (or Challenge Rating) system to help GMs gauge the power of foes, traps, and similar hazards, it does so only as a guide. PCs instead earn XP by participating in play, engaging with the story, pursuing their character's goals, and by completing episodes with their friends. \nTo help players and GMs alike, Bloodlines & Black Magic uses a unique storytelling deck called The Arcana.\nThis deck has already been proofed and printed. We need only place an order with our printer.\nWhen coupled with the clue cards, GMs can deploy two very powerful tactile elements at the table, giving them even more tools with which to encourage immersion and roleplaying.\nNo Stretch Goals\nTimes are tough right now for a lot of people working in tabletop game design. Shops are closed, distribution is limited, and a lot of smaller studios have suspended work (or laid people off) while we all try and navigate 2020. \nStorm Bunny Studios will be using all of our additional funds to ensure we survive while still being able to pay our favorite game designers. \nIf you want to help SBS weather this difficult time, this Kickstarter is one way to do that.\nShipping Prices & Times\nOur shipping prices are based on our anticipated book weight of 3.6 lbs, shipped from our office here in Wisconsin.

Whether it's exploring strange new worlds or telling tales of gripping battles, these are the frameworks that we use to inhabit powerful wizards, hardened warriors, and battle to save - or destroy - the world that they inhabit.\nToday we're bringing you two volumes - Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might - that greatly expand what's contained in that tool kit. Populated with entirely new sets of magical and martial powers, Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might will change the way you play magical and martial characters at your table forever! With years of development and experience behind it, the Spheres system is making the jump from Pathfinder to D&D 5th edition in a big way, and bringing tons of amazing options for character creation, world building, and storytelling along with it!\nWhat is Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might?\nSpheres of Power was a new approach to magic written for Pathfinder 1st edition in 2013 that changed the way magic-users and magical worlds were built. It took the 'how's' and 'why's' of magic and placed them into the hands of the players and the game masters, freeing them from the base assumptions of the game and giving them the power to create worlds and characters far beyond its common scope. Want to be a candy-mancer? A jedi? A thinly-veiled reference to a favorite anime franchise? All of this and more becomes possible with the Spheres of Power system!\nWith Spheres of Power, the very rules of magic and magic-power creation changed from spell-list based to concept based, allowing for worlds where magic is fueled by blood sacrifice, diagrams and alchemical exchanges, and more. For more information, see this video made for the Pathfinder 1st edition version:\nSpheres of Might was the Ennie-nominated martial book written as a follow-up volume to Spheres of Power, and granted all manner of new tactical prowess to martial characters. With Spheres of Might, combat became much more cinematic, and the abilities of martial combatants expanded to include not only tactical combat where the battlers must out-think each other before landing the final blow, but also expanded what martial characters were capable of outside of combat, granting all manner of powers and abilities one might expect from a real-world knight, scoundrel, or inventor.\nWith both Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might, players and GMs gain a whole host of new tools, allowing for the creation of characters, worlds, and stories beyond the scope of the core assumptions of Dungeons and Dragons and its various editions and spinoffs. \nWhat Is This Campaign Funding?\nWith this campaign we are funding is to fund the layout, printing, and distribution of both the Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might systems for 5th edition D&D. This will be done in two compatible books (one for each system) that will be available in both PDF and print, in both hardcover (for the shelf) and softcover (for rolling up and throwing in a bag on your way to game night).\nWe will also be using this campaign to conduct a playtest; by backing here, you will gain access to the material early and be able to make your voice heard on how the system works for you and how we can make sure not only that the translation is done well, but that the system is meeting your needs.\nWhat Do The Books Contain?\nBoth Spheres of Power and Spheres of Might are set to contain about 200 full-color pages each.

If you already have Drivethru RPG's screen, this add-on would be to get inserts.\nIf you do not want Drivethru RPG's screen, this would get you the second version printed elsewhere. (domestic shipping only)\nIf you don't have Drivethru RPG's screen but WANT their screen, it would probably be best to wait until this campaign is over and order the inserts and screen together later from Drivethru itself; due to the partnering setup they have with the people who make their GM's screen, it would be cheaper and much less hassle than having us try and send you one ourselves.\nGM Screen (vertical or horizontal PDF): $5 each\nGM Screen (vertical, horizontal, or custom print): $10 each\n For this campaign we will be using Drivethru RPG's print services, which not only prints the books, but also includes an almost completely international reach. \nThis means the book can reach a great many countries the world over, and while we cannot promise that it will be able to reach ANY nation, we will put in our best effort to get your books to you wherever you happen to be.

That's about eight hours of entertainment for five people, coming to $2.50 per hour, per person -- and that's not counting all the lower rewards on top of that. \nAt $7000, I will create a dozen new fantasy ancestries and cultures! Each new ancestry and culture will be based on a mythological creature that you will want to play! We're still working on ideas, but right now we are considering bird folk, giantkin, goblins, lizard folk, cat folk, snake folk, shapeshifters, constructs, minotaurs, centaurs, satyrs, medusae, rat folk, mer folk, dryads, dhampir, werefolk, and more! Once we've created them, we'll release it to backers as a separate PDF released to all backers at the $5 and up level.\n Have you ever wondered why there are half-elves and half-orcs in your favorite fantasy roleplaying game, but not half-tieflings, half-dwarves, or half-gnomes? And why only allow orcs and elves to mate with humans and not others? Why can't we play the child of an elf and an orc or a gnome and a halfling? \nWhat's more, what if we want to play a human raised by elves, like Tolkien's Aragorn, or a halfling who grew up among orcs? Wouldn't such characters be different than a halfling who grew up among her own people, for example? It would be a delight to be able play such a diverse cast of characters, with such a wide range of ancestries and cultures. \nWell, now we can! This 32-page zine of rules and original fantasy art allows for the easy creation of a variety of new ancestral and cultural combinations and types, without having to make big changes to the core game rules. What's more, they replace the problematic concept of race as it is traditionally used in character creation. Ancestry provides those heritable traits a character might receive from their parents, such as height, average lifespan, and darkvision, and culture provides such teachable features as weapon training and ability. This frees us up to play the characters we want to play and provides us many more options, just dripping with role-play potential.\nIn addition to the new character creation rules, Ancestry and Culture also features original art by Talon Dunning and layout and art direction by Aaron Acevedo. Talon's art has featured in such games and properties as Legend of the Five Rings, Mage: The Awakening, Mummy: The Resurrection, Scarred Lands, Ravenloft, Kingdoms of Kalamar, Thieves' World, and Mutants & Masterminds, among others. Aaron's layout and art direction work can be found in almost every Savage Worlds product, including Savage Rifts and Deadlands, as well as in TORG, Unknown Armies, World of Darkness, The Yellow Sign, and more. \nHumans and their adopted orc brother\n Why replace the rules for Race in character creation for the world\u2019s most popular tabletop roleplaying game, you might ask? First of all, because it makes even greater characters, more interesting story, and richer role-play possible. Think of the possibilities of playing an orc-elf, or a gnome raised among dwarves, for example. And imagine what diverse communities might be like, where dwarven and elven culture, art, architecture mingle! What would their buildings look like? Their weapons? In short, we want to replace race with ancestry and culture because replacing it is easy and makes for more fun!\nBeyond that, there is a more serious reason to replace the concept of race in your games with ancestry and culture: simply put, because the very concept of Race in this game we love is problematic.\nFirst of all, the concept of race used in roleplaying games comes from the analogous concept used in the real world. Biologists, evolutionary theorists, anthropologists, and race theorists have long since shown that the concept as it was used at least from the Enlightenment forward to the 20th Century is, frankly, bogus. This is not to say there is no such thing as ancestry, heritage, and genetic difference, of course. But those differences simply do not map cleanly onto anything in our biology as simplistic as the concept of race, as it is often used. After all, none but the most flagrant racist in the real world nowadays would say that one\u2019s ethnic ancestry, or race, causes a person to have a lower intelligence or gives them a tendency toward extreme violence or evil, yet our fantasy games employ exactly this concept of race. In other words, race itself is a tainted concept, but the way it is employed in fantasy gaming is an exceptionally bad example. Thus I would prefer not to use it, if I can.\nA tiefling-gnome prepares for battle\nFortunately, it is not difficult to replace Race in character creation in our favorite roleplaying game. As I show in this zine, we can acknowledge that gnomes and elves and humans and dwarves might in general have certain biological markers that distinguish them, such as height and lifespan and darkvision, without also ascribing intelligence or weapon mastery or good and evil to their biology. Obviously, those features are more a result of upbringing than genetics. Why not therefore separate out biological ancestry from cultural heritage? That is exactly what I have done here!\nSome advantages of this are as follows: this separates the value-laden concepts of ability bonuses and alignment from biology; it locates skills, weapon proficiencies, languages, and other behavioral differences where they belong, in one\u2019s upbringing; and these rules do so in a way that leaves the rest of the game mechanics largely intact. Indeed, one should be able to swap out the Race options from character creation for these rules without much change elsewhere at all, though it may change the way the fantasy world is depicted (hopefully for the better). Further, using these rules also allows for a lot of fun new roleplaying opportunities, as you can now have mechanics to account for someone of one ancestry growing up among different cultures, such as a human raised by elves or a gnome raised among dwarves.\nAnd as we suggested, these rules even include ways to create characters of mixed ancestry and unique upbringing. In the original rules, one could create only half-elves and half-orcs (themselves problematic and human-centric \u2013 why not call them half-humans? And why only those two combinations?). With these rules, one can create characters with one human and one elf parent, to be sure, but also human-halfling, dwarf-elf, orc-tiefling, or gnome-dragonborn offspring if you like. Surely a fantasy world with magic and dragons, and one that already contains offspring of humans and elves and orcs, has room for halfling-dwarf children as well!  \nAn elf-tiefling\nHi!

I will also complete the Print-On-Demand version before May, with an absolute deadline for everything of June. I expect the final product to be approximately 32 pages.

Members of the troupe have performed in Callisto 6, Shield of Tomorrow, and Clear Skies, all fantastic shows that showcase this supremely talented group.\nThe Streampunks crew.\nThe Streampunks will create a one shot adventure available to everyone on Twitch and YouTube. For each stretch goal we hit after the first, they will produce an additional episode, up to a full 12 episode season.\nA note on the direct bonuses to our production team: our artists, copy editor, layout designer, web designer, etc, have all been paid a fair wage based on negotiated contracts. But if this project does well, we believe they deserve to be compensated even more for their incredible work. \nOverview\nAt its heart, Descent into Midnight is a game about community, family, and hope. It\u2019s a tabletop roleplaying game that takes place in a technologically advanced aquatic civilization whose culture has never been touched by humanity. Bioengineering and psionic, or mental, powers allow the strange and varied species to communicate and interact with their surroundings no matter their physiology.\nIn the game, players take on the roles of guardians, defending their community from a physical, emotional, and even existential threat. The game focuses on the relationships between the guardians, the inhabitants they protect, and their internal struggles and dreams in the face of a corruption that threatens to change their world.\n\"The thing that we were building together was so hauntingly beautiful, that when something threatened to corrupt and destroy it, I felt it more viscerally than most experiences I\u2019ve had throughout many years of playing and GM\u2019ing games.\" - Jason Robinson, UX Designer, host of The Secret Cellar Podcast.\nMassive crustacean tending to purple coral gardens.\nThe Goal\nOur funding goal for this campaign is $25,000, which will allow us to produce the best quality copy of the game we can. That total includes the initial print run, paying our artists, the entire production team, web designer, Kickstarter, payments, accessibility and campaign consultants, and more.\nThe Book\nWe're producing two version of the book. Both are 6 x 9 inch hardcovers in color, featuring cover art by Devon George. \nMock-up of book with purple seascape and strange aquatic creatures.\nThe first is the standard hardcover copy. This is the version that is available at the $40 tier, and is the same version that is donated to an organization or recipient of your choice at the $80+ tiers. It will feature several full-color illustrations by Devon George and even more naturalist-style sketches by Taylor Livingston of just some of the weird sea creatures you and your group might create at your table.\nMock-up of blue hardcover with crustacean surrounded by kelp halo, in silver foil.\nThe second is the Limited edition, available at the $110+ tiers (which also include a standard copy for you, plus one donated standard copy). It has an alternate blue foil-stamped cover and an integrated purple ribbon bookmark. We will only be producing these in the initial print run funded by the Kickstarter, so once we place the order with the printer, that's it!\nThe Game\nDescent into Midnight uses the award-winning Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) system developed by Vincent and Meguey Baker and used in popular roleplaying games like Masks: A New Generation, Monsterhearts, and Headspace. PbtA is a story-focused system that incorporates the best of both narrative and mechanical gameplay. Though players familiar with other PbtA games will have a solid foundation with Descent into Midnight, we have developed the setting and mechanics to inspire your imagination in new and surprising ways.\n\"All of the things that you think you know about the world completely shift, and so the world building ends up happening on this level of continuous surprise. I don\u2019t think it could ever get boring.\" - DC, creator Mutants in the Night; Narrative Designer, Wizards of the Coast.\nCrab-like Cultivator with kelp growing from their back.\nPlaybooks\nUnlike other RPGs, we have no canon setting for Descent into Midnight. Instead, we help players create the species they want to play, then work with the other players to weave their cultures and histories together to form a civilization that\u2019s entirely unique to their table. Designed to welcome everyone, no matter their knowledge or understanding of our real-world oceans, Descent into Midnight guides you into a new and mysterious world, one that you and your friends help create.\n\"The way [the playbooks] guided me into the character creation was great and let me explore something that I didn\u2019t think I would do on my own.\" - Drew Corkill, UX Designer.\nInstead of classes or point-buy systems, Descent into Midnight uses Playbooks to guide you through character creation and to weave your story into all the others at the table. Each playbook is written around a familiar trope, giving you a narrative anchor in this alien environment, and then uses leading questions and evocative language to seed your imagination with ideas.\nOur playbooks are as much about what story you want to tell, as they are about what you do in the world.\n The Empath - Emotions, memories, and experiences flow through you -- both your own, and those of the inhabitants around you. At one time these energies overpowered you, pouring through the open door to your heart and mind. Now you have learned to ride the waves of emotion, flowing with and redirecting the anger, joy, fear, and corruption of others.\n The Cultivator - Gardener, bioengineer, aquaformer. You coax and shape the world around you to serve your needs, sometimes at great personal cost. You nurture life and those around you, growing the tools you need to solve some problems, and giving of yourself what is necessary to solve the rest.\n The Redeemed - You were created to excel at one thing: conflict. Whether through physical training, bioengineering, or psychic reprogramming, you are the center of the storm when challenges arise. Though your original purpose may have been to inflict terrible consequences on your enemies, the choice is now yours - are you a weapon of war, a symbol of peace, or something else entirely?\n The Awakened - You were once like the rest of your kind. Then you woke up. Some believe the planet chose you, awakening your Echo to fight the Corruption. Others worry you are a child of the Corruption, mutated to serve its ends. Yet something calls to you, from the Far Echo or the deep ocean. You were awakened for a purpose. If only you could find it...\n The Orator - Ambassador, politician, commander, or community leader. Your words, presence, and experiences inspire your community to work miracles. When danger lies at your community\u2019s doorstep, folks look to you for guidance. When people have disputes, they go to you to provide mediation. When the community needs a leader, you are there.\n The Traveler - Where many lives thrive within and around the cityscape, you have spent years, perhaps even centuries, studying the world outside. Whether as scholar, trader, explorer, or bounty hunter, you have collected a lifetime of knowledge and experience, and seen the best and the worst the world has to offer.\n The Muse - Crafters, sculptors, singers, and storytellers, you draw on the thoughts, hopes, and fears of your community and express them for all to see. The manifestations of your imagination exist beyond the physical world, weaving the essence of the Echo into physical expressions of beauty and emotion that live in two worlds, whether through a haunting song, a life-changing story, or an architectural wonder.\n The Specialist - You are an expert at getting your allies into and out of dangerous or questionable situations with skill and grace, whether rescuing the victims of a natural disaster, negotiating a lethal hydrothermal vent field, breaching the biotech security of an ancient civilization, or extracting psychic information from a coral hive-mind.\n The Seeker - The Far Echo calls to you, a current carrying you to the Echoes of other realities. Do you explore those realities for knowledge and insight, or do you draw on their strange perspectives to manipulate and control the inhabitants around you?\n The Touchstone - Corruption can never extinguish the wonder of life as long as life maintains hope. True, deep, and genuine compassion can transform not just a single life, but the world in which it lives. You are the innocent that befriends the grotesque or abandoned; the ally that reminds those around them their unique gifts create a better world; the stable friend providing shelter against the crushing tide of despair.\nLobster-creature radiating psionic energy.\nStats\nIn a game where sapient krakens and microscopic krill can create a complex society, how strong or dextrous you are isn\u2019t as important as the social, emotional, and existential impact of the actions you take. Descent into Midnight is a game about connections, so the statistics we use to describe your character describe your relationship to yourself, your team, and the people around you.\n Hope - Are you a force of optimism and inspiration, or do you struggle with feelings of despair? Hope is the cornerstone of the Muse and Touchstone playbooks.\n Altruism - Do you use your skills and abilities to support individuals around you, or do you struggle between your duties and your needs as an individual? Altruism is the cornerstone of the Empath and Cultivator playbooks.\n Community - Are you deeply aware of how everyone in an ecology fits together and able to see from other\u2019s perspectives, or is it difficult to work with others? Community is the cornerstone of the Orator and Seeker playbooks.\n Calm - Are you focused and at peace during stressful times, or are you quick to react and easy to anger? Calm is the cornerstone of the Specialist and Redeemed playbooks.\n Drive - Are you driven toward success and survival, or do you fold under pressure? Drive is the cornerstone of the Awakened and Traveler playbooks.\nFish with component parts physically separate, held together with psionics.\nWhat People Are Saying\nDescent into Midnight is a deeply personal project for us. Not only does it help us introduce players to the wonder, beauty, and terror of our real-world oceans, it works to build empathy in a way that is critically important to us as designers, and to the world we live in. Here's what some of our playtesters have to say about the game and the impact it has had on them.\n \u201cIt\u2019s very spiritual and very emotional, yet you are playing things that don\u2019t resemble you at all. It\u2019s a fascinating exercise in empathy.\u201d - Devon George, Descent into Midnight artist, www.devongeorgestudios.com.\n \u201cI\u2019m gonna say, my game is really really good, but this game is ridiculous!\u201d  - DC (@DungeonCommandr), creator of Mutants in the Night; Narrative Designer, Wizards of the Coast (creators D&D 5th Edition).\n \"Uniquely brilliant.\"  - Jeff Barber, ecologist, award winning designer of Blue Planet, Upwind, and the highly anticipated Blue Planet: Recontact. \n \u201cDescent Into Midnight achieves a poignance that captivates scientists and gamers alike, over and over. I can't recommend this transcendent game enough.\u201d  -Darcy Ross, biologist, game designer, Monte Cook Games Community Manager.\n \u201cIt's completely changed how I engage with my games and the people around my table.\"  - Aram Vartian, creator, editor, producer GodsFall and DemigodsFall.\n \u201cExploration without combat, co-op through building, not destroying. It allowed me to imagine a world outside our own perceptions. It was simultaneously a game and a meditation.\u201d  - @tembeep on Twitter, marine biologist, co-host @RSSDefiant.\n \u201cDiM is the most strange, beautiful, and emotional games I have ever played. I will remember my first experience with it forever.\u201d  - Playtester @explosiverunes on Twitter.\n \u201cThe playbooks were built in such a way that failure and hardship were exciting and beautiful things, and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it since.\u201d  - @kyle_krueger on Twitter, co-host @RSSDefiant.\n \u201cI playtested DiM at GenCon and it was one of the defining moments I\u2019ve had from ANY con.\u201d  - @billoftheforest on Twitter, Cast member @TalesfromtheGrim @DiceTribe.\n \u201cThe rumors are true. This game lives up to every expectation.\u201d  - @kwiksotic on Twitter, Cast Member #TheDyingKingdom @GreyhawkChannel.\n\u201cI\u2019m seriously missing this game already. Please, Rich Howard, may we have another?\"  - @gnomedic on Twitter, cast member DemigodsFall, Kobold Press Social Media Manager.\n Play the Game Now\nYou can get the Quick Start Guide to try the game right now. It has everything you need to run a session of the game, including the latest version of all ten playbooks. We will continue to update and refine it as we finish the accessible versions of all the materials.\nDescent into Midnight has been in development for the past 3 years and been playtested by game designers, artists, podcasters, streamers, scientists, and con-goers from around the world. We are polishing the current draft of the rules and filling in the sections that will help Guides run the best game possible. This campaign is to provide funds to bring you the best PDF and hard-copy versions of the game we can.\nActual Play & More Info\nWe have had the privilege to be featured on numerous podcasts, both actual play and discussions.\nActual Play:\n Game Closet: actual play with Kat Kuhl, Orion Black, Devon George, Rich Howard, and Richard Kreutz-Landry.(transcript).\n Party of One: actual play with two players.\n Tabletop Squadron (World Building): character creation and world building episode.\n Tabletop Squadron (Adventure): the adventure in the world created above.\n She's a Super Geek: 2-episode run of actual play.\n The RPG Academy (Trials): actual play sessions.\n The Redacted Files: actual play session.\n Nerds on a Roll: actual play sessions.\nDiscussion\n Modifier: discussion about the game with the whole design team.\n Character Creation Cast:  3-episode run of character and setting building actual play, plus discussion about the game.\n Character Creation Cast (Bonus): a bonus episode about the game and character creation.\n Secret Cellar (Weep and Whale): post-game discussion of an especially impactful GenCon 2018 playtest.\n Plus1Forward: combination discussion about the game, PbtA, and a short actual play scene.\n The RPG Academy (Show & Tell): discussion about the game.\n The Secret Cellar (Weaponized Hospitality): discussion about the game, and the creative process. (transcript)\n Table Top Babble: discussion about the game.\n The Roleplaying Exchange: discussion about why we're passionate about the game.\nShipping\nWe\u2019re going to be using BackerKit as our post-campaign fulfillment portal, and will be charging for shipping through them after the campaign. This reduces our costs slightly and gives us the flexibility to adapt to any unforeseen cost issues with shipping.\nFor US backers, we\u2019re going to be charging the full price of shipping and packaging. Because we\u2019re limiting the physical rewards to books, we should be able to take advantage of the USPS Media Mail option, which is very economical. We expect the cost per copy to be $7 or less.\nFor international backers, we\u2019re going to be partially subsidizing the cost of shipping. For each copy, we\u2019re contributing $10 towards the cost of shipping, and the rest will be the responsibility of the backer. Current international shipping rates as of the launch of the Kickstarter for a book the size of ours appear to be in the $22-$27 range. There\u2019s no getting around it. International shipping is complex and expensive, but we wanted to make sure the game was available in hard copy for folks everywhere who are passionate about it.\nRewards\nWe have 9 Reward Tiers. The tier we think many backers will be excited about is the Kickstarter Exclusive level.\n$2 - Thank you - Includes a thank you on our website along with any digital rewards we unlock.\n$20 - Digital Copy - Includes the $2 rewards, plus a full-color PDF copy of the game.\n$40 - Hardcover Reward - Includes the $20 rewards, plus a full-color hardcover copy of the game.\n$80 - Community Reward - Includes the $40 rewards, plus an additional full-color hardcover of the game will be donated to a school, library, after-school program, aquarium, or other organization of your choice.\n$110 - Limited Edition - Includes the $80 rewards, plus a Kickstarter Exclusive Premium Edition copy of the game. This level, and all higher levels, provide 3 physical copies of the game  (Limited Edition Hardcover, Standard Hardcover, Donation Hardcover), plus the PDF. In addition, if the campaign unlocks the streaming episode stretch goals, you'll be thanked in the credits of the show.\n$235 - Character Art Edition - (Limit 8) This includes the $110 rewards, plus you may submit a description for a player species or creature to be drawn by one of our artists to be included in the final version of the game.

In addition to being credited as a Producer, you may submit a description for a cityscape to be drawn by one of our artists to be included in the final version of the game.\n$985 - Executive Producer Edition - (Limit 3) This includes the $485 rewards.

Devon George and Taylor Livingston (Illustrators), Paulomi S.P. (Art Director), VJ Brown (Layout Editor), Tracy Barnett (Kickstarter Consultant, Developmental Draft Editor), Christine \"Rhi\" Scherer (Accessibility Consultant), Aser Tolentino (Accessibility Tester), Tyler Palermo of DOTS RPG (Accessibility Tester), Will Trufant (Web Developer), and I-Hsien Sherwood (Copy Editor).\nWe would also like to express our eternal gratitude to Ty Mabrey and Bang Zoom Studios for their work on our video.\nFor more detailed team bios, check the website.\nAccessibility\nWe\u2019re committed to producing a product that is as accessible as possible. To that end, we\u2019ve hired an accessibility consultant to help ensure the digital documents are screen reader-friendly and are working with blind/low-vision testers who use assistive technology regularly.\nThe Quick Start Guide we have available is not yet fully accessible, but we are in the process of revising and reviewing our playbooks and other documents. As the new documents become available we\u2019ll be updating it and notifying backers.\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding accessibility, please reach out to us. You can message us here on Kickstarter, email us at info@descentintomidnight.com, or message us on twitter @DiMRPG. \nKickstarter Union\nNews came on February 18th that the Kickstarter Union has been officially recognized! This is an amazing accomplishment. Congratulations to everyone who worked so hard to change the world.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDescent into Midnight has been in development for three years and has been run at conventions and online by both the designers and other Guides. The game works. As with any project, however, there are risks and challenges.\n\nThe core design team all have full time jobs. We are busy people. That said, over the three years of the game's development, we've taken turns driving the project and trust each other's judgment implicitly. Any one of us could finish filling out the text needed to turn the core rules into the book we want in the time allotted.\n\nGood art takes time. Our current projection for the artwork is to have everything for the main book complete by the end of August. Devon and Taylor have been extremely professional, delivering artwork on time and providing estimates that include time for unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, with an experienced art director like Paulomi on the project, we've been able to streamline the art process. \n\nProofing and printing can be complicated. Knowing that, we're working with Jostens for the printing of the books because they specialize in high-quality small print runs and they were recommended to us by others who had used them for RPG printing. We reached out early to the printing agent and are working within the specifications provided by Jostens for the files we'll be submitting to them to ensure they're right the first time.\n\nShipping is complicated and can be expensive. The only physical goods we're shipping are the books (except the origami figures for high level backers), which helps with costs. Shipping within the United States using Media Mail is inexpensive and straightforward. For international shipping, we're paying $10/copy of the shipping costs because those costs vary so much more, and the backer will be responsible for the rest. We would love to offer a flat rate internationally but there's simply too much risk involved to do so.\n\nLarge projects are hard to estimate for. We put together a team of very skilled folks and are paying them fairly, which means overruns on hours are expensive. To offset that, we started with conservative estimates for the hours required and we've built in a buffer in the funding goal for unforeseen costs. Moreover, even in the case of an overrun of a few thousand dollars, the core team is in a financial position to pay the team to complete the work and recoup the costs in long term sales once the book is produced.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Thank You", "descp": "You will be thanked by name in the finished book and on the website.

The numbers aren\u2019t in our favor right now and it\u2019s unlikely to reach the funding goal--but I\u2019m not abandoning this project and you shouldn\u2019t either!\nHere\u2019s the plan!\n1) First of all thank you for backing this Kickstarter! I am deeply invested in all the stories across the Kigari Islands, and I am incredibly thankful that you too want them realized as beautiful printed books.\n2) This Kickstarter is ending but the adventure path will be back! I\u2019ve already learned a lot with this crowdfunding campaign and am revisiting all aspects of the project to fine-tune it. Then in October I\u2019m launching a Kickstarter exclusively for Assault of the Stone Mother, to make it a 100 page book covering all of the Tier 1 (levels 1st-4th) material in the Mother of Monsters Adventure Path. Following that in January of 2020 I\u2019ll launch another project for funding more of the content.\n3) Free Player\u2019s Guide. Instead of the larger Campaign Guide (which is being tabled until a later date) in the next month I\u2019m releasing the Player\u2019s Guide for free on DriveThruRPG to better inform folks about the adventure path. Stay tuned to the Kickstarter project updates here for when that\u2019s available to download!\n4) Join the mailing list so I can reach you when Assault of the Stone Mother goes live on Kickstarter! At the bottom of the ZagoraGames.com website is a subscription form to sign up for the Zagora Games mailing list. The pledge levels are going to be lower (reflecting the reduced scope of the project) as is the funding goal--give me a few weeks to iron things out and I\u2019m positive that we\u2019ll fund the first part of this project in October. If you think you might want to help with the launch day push, definitely get on the mailing list!\nThank you again for backing Mother of Monsters!\nWho We Are\nZagora Games LLC is a tabletop role-playing game publishing company owned by me, Adrian Arduini. To create this product, I assembled a team of published freelance writers who all have experience writing adventures for either 5th edition or Pathfinder. I also looked for the best artists I could find. With affection I call this team the \"Gods of Creation,\" and you can read more about us and view links to our published products at the bottom of the page. \nMy most sincere hope is that you enjoy Mother of Monsters and ask for more\u2014nothing would please me more than to be able to pursue this full-time. \nThis 5th Edition adventure takes heroes from 1st to 15th level, and pits them against the minions of the Mother of Monsters. In this epic struggle the adventurers fight mythical beasts and dark cults, make epic voyages, and delve into the Underworld. If they survive their mythical journey they face off against Naehurdamia herself in a heart-stopping battle that elevates their legend to demigod status!\nThe book for the Mother of Monsters adventure path is approximately 350 pages of excellent Greek-inspired gaming broken down into 8 chapters of content. Each chapter has a beginning and a clearly defined end, so they can be played as part of an ongoing campaign or separated and inserted into other campaigns. Whether using milestones or experience points to level characters, there is more than enough content to smoothly keep the adventurers on track. \nAdventure Summary \nHere's a summary of each chapter. \nStone Mother's Assault\nThe first five levels of the adventure takes place on the island of Boskari where the characters make a name for themselves as heroes and learn about the Cult of Naegara. \nFalse Prophecies \nThe heroes are directed to consult the Oracle of Aelohor for guidance. Instead they find that the region is in chaos! This section is two levels of island-hopping mysteries where the party fights mythical monsters and battles dark cults. \nA Threatened Democracy \nThe party's fight against the Cult of Naegara takes them to the center of democracy and the largest city in the Kagari Islands: Lukatoi. These next two levels are full of urban encounters and political intrigue. \nBosnokan War Machine\nThe heroes are closing in on the leaders of the Cult of Naegara. They now must journey to Bosnoka, the most warlike nation of the Kagari Islands, and convince embattled city-states to make peace. This section is two more levels of high adventure, political intrigue and monster hunting. \nAncient Allies \nThe heroes have ended the war between Bosnoka and Kaluda and stopped the Cult of Naegara; however, they have learned of a greater threat. They now must make an epic journey (like Jason or Odysseus) to seek the advice of an immortal seer that lives beyond known waters. Afterward, they must negotiate with dwarves, elves, and bickering human kings to form an alliance and assemble an army. This section is a level and a half's worth of content starting the party's journey into tier 3 adventuring. \nWar of the Gods \nWar is once again coming to the Kagari Islands\u2014this time in the skies and the ocean depths. The heroes are summoned before the tabiski, the gods of the people of the Kagari Islands. They are drafted into the fight against devils and monstrous sea creatures that threaten all of the island nations. This level and a half of content contains epic battles which will solidify the heroes' names in Kagari legends.\nThe Underworld \nAfter consulting the immortal seer a second time, the party is directed to find and retrieve ancient seals hidden within a vast dwarven ruin deep in the earth. However, they learn that they are not the only ones looking! This section is a level's worth of dungeon-delving excitement. \nMother's Wrath\nThe heroes have the seals to Naehurdamia's prison\u2014now they must get to her to use them. To do this they must navigate a vast underground maze, deal with the tabiski lord of death and then fight one of the most powerful beings in Kagari legends: the Mother of Monsters. This final section is the climactic battle against Naehurdamia, a titan of incredible power. If they survive, the party will take their place as demigods among the pantheon of the Kagari Islands. \nSample Adventure \nHere is a sample of Chapter 1 from Mother of Monsters. In this section the heroes have already made a name for themselves and are summoned before the king to complete several quests.  Click here for a preview PDF from the adventure path! \nThis book of approximately 75 pages details the history of the people of Kagari and gives a world creation story. It includes their legends, the different races that can be found, and gives a full gazetteer of the islands. Each island description talks about its economy, culture, and government structure. In addition, a whole language was created for Mother of Monsters which includes a script and a glossary of terms two and a half pages long. Read about the process behind it here: Worldbuilding: Creating a Language.\nThe Player Options section includes a new human subrace (the piskari); be a warlike pibosnokan or a pikaluda socialite. There's also a new fighter archetype: the phalanx warrior, a combatant that excels in fighting with spear, sword, and shield. The campaign guide also has a strength-focused monk variant with the Pugilist subclass. Be a monk that uses ki to harden the body and take the hit rather than dodge blows\u2014and then deliver devastating strikes with fists of iron! A new feat, Two Weapon Master, equals the playing field for heroes who like to dual wield but have felt overshadowed by great weapon masters and sharpshooters. In addition there are new equipment options like the war spear, penteconter, bireme and trireme, and lastly there are new spells like call companion and steelwood. \nI love a book with good art! I wanted this product to be truly beautiful so I reached out to some exceptionally talented artists. Each chapter starts off with a half or full page of visual scene, and with character portraits, item illustrations, maps, and monster artwork. Mother of Monsters promises to have a piece of original art for every 10 pages of text\u2014for a 350 page book that's 35 pieces of original art! \nThroughout the Mother of Monsters adventure path the heroes are destined to fight on truly engaging battlefields! These maps are rendered in full color for both GMs and players (which will be available as a digital download). \nMap of Lukatoi\nOne of the maps is a fully detailed depiction of the largest city in Kagari: Lukatoi, the center of learning and democracy in the islands. This beautiful map is being crafted by Alyssa Faden, a well-known cartographer with a passion for ancient cities. You can watch her draw Lukatoi on Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/alyssafaden/, and see her earlier drawing of Lukatoi here: https://www.facebook.com/pg/AlyssaFadenCartography/videos/.\nHlabon - Citizen Soldier ($2+)\nYou've helped me achieve my dream and for that I thank you very much!

Get lost in the tales of baby-eating manananggals, divine diwatas, and tricksy duwendes.\nWith breathtaking, original artwork, Islands & Aswangs is far from just your supernatural encyclopedia. It's also an engaging reference piece for tabletop roleplaying games with haunting playable encounter stories.\nAt the very minimum, we'll handwrite a thank you to your name.

Postcards! bookmarks!\nStretch goal downloadables include: character sheets, tabletop map, overworld map, and character tokens.\nAs you can see below, most of the funds will be used for printing, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.

The haunted eyes of past visitors. A missing leader throwing a town into panic. These phenomena lead PCs into a battle against elemental evil \u2013 or, as one character describes it, \u201cPure Sin\u201d. \nThis is the premise of \u201cThe Mirror Tells Her Lies\u201d, a short roleplaying adventure module for the d100 system released under the Open Gaming License. It is also the starting point for Michael Hopcroft Press, a new company I am  founding. I'm Michael Hopcroft, the co-author of HeartQuest: Romantic Roleplaying in the Worlds of Shoujo Manga and The Kevin and Kell Roleplaying Game.\u201cThe Mirror Tells Her Lies\u201d is created under OpenQuest, an open-content version of the d100 rules. OpenQuest plays easily, yet is still compatible with the numerous d100 game systems out there in the wild. \nUnlike a certain set of systems, which I'm pretty sure you already know, d100 games do not have systems that rigidly enforce character morality. Also, for competent PCs death is still in the picture from any combat however one-sided it looks. \n\"The Mirror Tells Her Lies\" takes full advantage of this quality. It is a take on the moral quandaries faced by PCs, in a place where all the dark places of their souls will be used against them. It is a short adventure, playable in one to two sessions, designed for experienced characters and players who love roleplaying their characters as opposed to hacking away at everything they see!\nWhat the Money will be Used For\nAs a startup in a crowded field, I am trying to economize. Since it's a short module, the money will first be used to buy stock art. If enough money is raised, I will be using it to pay for technical assistance on layout. All in all, this will help me put out the module I would like, one I would buy if I were a customer, and the standard of detail expected of this platform.\nIf I get a LOT of money (comparatively), then I wilt make a print version available through DriveThru RPG's Print-on-Demand service.\nFinally, by supporting this Kickstarter you are helping me produce both current and future products. I have plans.\nStretch Goal\n$125 -- Print! If I can reach this amount, I will be making a Print-on-Demand version available through DriveThruRPG's service. I would also add a benefit level that includes it.

The module is written and read for layout, all that is required is a cover, interior art, and the expertise to put it all together in a finished form. Finding those might take a while, resulting in minor delays.\n\nI anticipate releasing the module by the end of September or early October.\n\nMy personal state of health might also delay the project.

Our editors and designers have meticulously studied the Fifth Edition style and mechanics, working very hard to achieve clear, concise language and mechanics for all the creatures, traps, hazards, character challenges and new magic items. \nIn addition, although the encounters are written for Fifth Edition, the concepts, characters, stories and situations can be easily adapted for use with other editions of the world's most popular fantasy roleplaying game, as well as other fantasy themed tabletop RPGs.\n  Out of the Box: Encounters for Fifth Edition contains:\n30 unique encounters \u2014 even more with stretch goals by RPG industry professionals and influencers\nNew monsters \u2014 including new legendary creatures, lairs and regional effects\nNew magic items adventurers will really have to earn \u2014 especially when the monsters are using them!\nMap packs for every encounter to put down on your table\nFlat plastic miniatures for each encounter                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nArc Knight developed a unique print-on-demand process to produce double-sided transparent plastic, leading to the Flat Plastic Miniatures line, and eventually the Roleplaying Spell Effects line.\n                     Enjoy quick reference guides indicate appropriate character level ranges, creatures involved in the encounter, potential encounter locations and treasure. \n\n                    The encounters themselves offer relatable examples to help you understand the dynamic scenarios, guidance and tips for setting the encounter in your campaign world, and a thorough walkthrough of all the moving parts. \n\n                    An addendum for each encounter discusses some of the more unusual complications that might arise from any of these compelling situations.\n\n \nSee some work-in-progress sample pages below!\n    Do you want a gorgeous high-quality map, and durable flat, plastic minis for every single encounter in the book?

That's what you get in The Graverobber's Sword. \nThe Book\nThe Graverobber's Sword is an epic fantasy novel featuring Kera No-Clan, a barbarian living in exile getting by (and getting high) by robbing graves, pilfering tombs, and looting ruins.\n\nWhile digging for fae ash - a valuable narcotic known as \u2018fairy dust\u2019, sought after for its potency and powerful magical side effects - Kera uncovers a living weapon, a psychic sword that calls itself Zephelous.\nZephelous senses a greatness in Kera, and believes she could be the next great champion of light against the forces of darkness. \nKera's pretty sure she can pawn Zephelous for a quick thousand gold pieces, easy. \nOne successful trip to a shady pawnbroker later, Kera celebrates her new-found wealth with a fae ash induced bender. When she finally comes to, she learns that she's wanted for arson. And robbery. And destruction of property, plus about ten other things. Deciding that it's well past time to leave town, Kera also decides it would be a real shame to leave a sword as valuable as Zephelous behind... \nA heist is planned, but unfortunately for Kera it goes poorly - very poorly. More arson is committed, and an innocent young girl is grievously wounded. In short order, Kera finds herself arrested and put in chains, standing before the high priest of Perrus, a man called Speaker Gerhardt. \nThe Speaker gives her an ultimatum; either she agrees to campaign with a motley crew - an irate artificer, his construct companion, a drunken wizard, a representative of Perrus, and the selfsame pawnbroker she tried to rob - with the goal of slaying a dragon to collect it's blood in order to save the girl\u2026\n\n    ...or else she faces execution. \nHaving little choice and armed with Zephelous once again, Kera finds herself finally forced to face the consequences of her actions... and hating every second of it.\nRead the first chapter here\nEd Greenwood approved!\nThe Goal\nMy only goal for this Kickstarter is for it to succeed so I can publish The Graverobber's Sword and begin my career as an author.\nThe Why\nI grew up on fantasy novels. As a teen and preteen, I spent at least as much time on the make believe worlds of Pern, Krynn, Faerun, and Earth-616 as I did in reality, and I cherish every one of the memories that came from them. \nSomewhere between Lord of the Rings and Hexwood, between Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy and Kingdom Come, I poked my nose up from the books and said, \u201cI want to tell stories too\u201d, and that was it. I have wanted to be an author ever since. \nTo date, I've published articles, short stories, and a slowly growing pile of TTRPG content, but The Graverobber's Sword will be my debut novel. \nThe Cover\nThe Graverobber's Sword cover, a WIP by Sam Darcy\nWhile the preview image features some lovely stock art, pictured above is the sketch of the book's slated cover. Samantha Darcy, an artist who has kindly agreed to work with me on this campaign, will be providing the art!\nWho is Sam?\nCrafted from only the finest twigs and glamours, Samantha Darcy was well-nurtured in exchange for her father\u2019s freedom. She was beloved by all her neighbors, though her presence would frighten the livestock and cause the room to chill. The families would vie for her attention on the hot summers\u2019 days, and found they preferred the taste of soured milk. Samantha saw her first artistic inspiration behind their straining smiles, and delighted in drawing all their prettiest nightmares.   \nAn illustrator for tabletop roleplaying games, Samantha has risen far above those humble beginnings. She has contributed to works both great and small, including Dragon+ magazine from Wizards of the Coast, the Uncaged Anthology, Rolled & Told, and countless commissions. She currently labors on the Adventurer\u2019s Fashion Primer, a book sorely needed by creatures of every type.   \nSamantha lives in a tower of toadstools and teeth, located somewhere in the strange wilds of Indiana. She dwells there with her loving husband \u2014 a musical clockwork filled with bartered voices, and their darling son \u2014 who she made herself, using only the finest twigs and glamours.\nWork Samples:\nCover, Uncaged Anthology Vol. 1, art by Sam Darcy\nCover, Uncaged Anthology Vol. 2, art by Sam Darcy\nTo see more of Sam's work, click here.\nAs you'll see in below in the breakdown section, the cost of paying Sam to complete the cover art is included in the goal. \nThe Rewards\nWell, for starters, the book! The novel is already written, and digital copies will be sent out as soon as I am physically able to do so once the Kickstarter ends. \nBesides receiving a copy of the book, anyone who backs the project will have their name listed in the back of the book on a special 'thank you' page.  \nThe $$$\n100% of the goal of this Kickstarter go to covering the initial costs of the novel's first print run, as well as paying for Sam's work on the cover art. Funding above and beyond the initial goal would allow me to pay for some advertising, a bigger print run, and maybe some bills so I can write the sequel.\nThe Breakdown\n $2,250.00 USD is the goal for this campaign.\n-$112.50 USD is taken by Kickstarter as their 5% ($2,137.50 remaining)\n-$510.00 USD goes to Sam to pay for her work. ($1,627.50 remaining)\n-$112.50 USD goes to Stripe as their 5% for processing payments ($1,515.00 remaining)\n-$1,515.00 USD goes to Tablo to cover the cost of printing 101 books at the cost of $15.00 apiece. ($0.00 remaining) \nThe Stretch Goals\n If this campaign generates 200 pre-orders, I'll be able to include high quality bookmarks with every softcover order, as well as custom D&D 5th Edition character sheets for each of the main characters with each physical copy. Buying the digital book gets you digital copies!\n If this campaign generates 500 pre-orders, I'll include a limited edition Zephelous item card for D&D 5th Edition, along with a booklet that outlines all the ways it can be used. Buying the digital book gets you a digital copy!\n If the campaign reaches $3750, I'll be able to offer a hardcover edition of The Graverobber\u2019s Sword featuring an alternate cover art. The hardcover will be available for purchase both separately as an add-on, or as an upgrade for softcover pre-orders. \nThe Timeline\n Once the campaign ends, digital copies will be sent out to all backers, as well as submitted to the print team at Tablo. It can typically take 2-3 business days for a book to be approved for printing, and from there the print process takes up to 4 weeks. Once printing is complete, shipping of physical copies and rewards begins, the timing of which will vary depending on your location. While this window is significantly smaller than promised delivery date of November, I'm opting to play it safe and have a chance to deliver early rather than promise maximum efficiency and risk disappointing anyone. \nThe Q&As\nWhere are you getting it printed?\nPrinting is being handled by the wonderful folks at Tablo. I've spoken with their representatives numerous times over the last several weeks, collecting information and learning about the process. \nWho is Tablo?\nTablo is a company that offers many useful resources for authors, up to and including including self publishing services and printing. You can check them out here.\nSeems a little pricey...\nBelieve me, I know. I wish I could make it cheaper, but the book is just too damn thicc.\n\"...The book in its current form is 175,000 words, so it'll be approx 600 pages in paperback. This is lengthy, so prices may be a little high for individual print copies. Printing individual paperback copies will then be between $15 (USD) - $17 (USD) each in print costs for volume runs around the 50-100 book mark... At 200 units the price comes down to $13 (USD) per unit. There are a few volume tiers along the way like this. But you're basically looking at a spread of 50/100/200 being $17/$15/$13 (USD) respectively... At 500 copies pricing drops to $11.70 (USD), and this is the final discount tier for your book :)\" - Ash Davies, CEO and founder of Tablo\nCan I just buy it from you in person?\nOnly if the Kickstarter succeeds!\nCan I just buy it online?\nIf the Kickstarter succeeds, the book will be available for purchase online after the campaign ends and the printing process for pre-orders has been completed.\nDo you make money on this Kickstarter?\nNo, no I do not. However, I will end up with a small surplus of books that I'll be able to distribute to reviewers and bookstores in an effort to get future sales, and -  if I\u2019m lucky - maybe a few extra copies to sell locally (or at conventions). \nAs corny as it is, the Kickstarter succeeding means I get something better than money - I get to achieve a lifelong dream, and that's quite literally priceless. \nSo you don't make ANY money?\nAny books sold above and beyond the initial goal will net me a few dollars apiece, and if the pre-orders are more digital than physical I'll end up with more books on hand - which is good. If I'm lucky, there will be enough physical book orders that the cost of printing will come down a little and I'll be able to pocket a few dollars per copy.\nIf I'm very lucky, I'll find an agent or a publishing deal.\nMy goal here isn't to try to get rich quick on a Kickstarter campaign, it's to establish myself as an author, and hopefully take the first step towards being able to write full time!\nSo... why Kickstarter, then?\nAs I showed in the Breakdown, self-publishing costs money. This campaign represents my efforts to raise that money in the form of taking pre-orders (by backing me at the \u201cSigned Paperback + Digital Copy\u201d level). Of course, I'm not going to lie and say there isn't a not-so-small part of me that hopes I'll sell enough books to be able to pay the bills for a few months, but as I said, my only goal for this campaign is for it to succeed.\nMy main goal, post-Kickstarter campaign, is to get the sequel out in as timely a manner as possible (I'm looking at you, George), and if I'm able to write full-time I could make it happen within a year.\nHow do I know? It took about a year to get this one done, and I'm only going to get better. \nAt the end of the day, this campaign succeeding means that I'll have successfully released my first novel, and that's a big deal. \nMaybe only a big deal to me, but I'm fine with that.\nAre there any more planned stretch goals? \nIf the campaign exceeds the current stretch goals, I would love to be able to fund making more content. Specifically, I'd love to be able to afford to do a comic book or webcomic!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project there are always risks, but in this case the book is already written.

It was incredibly popular, with nearly 2,500 backers. Now we're bringing you the sequel: nine new player classes in A TOUCH MORE CLASS, a 100-page full color book! \nYou can get either or both books from this Kickstarter, plus a unique set of cards for use with the cardcaster class in the original book.\n A TOUCH OF CLASS (REVISED): The original book has been revised and updated, and includes the alchemist, cardcaster, diabolist, feywalker, morph, noble, and occultist.\n A TOUCH MORE CLASS: This new book contains the bloodweaver, fatebender, gemini, geomancer, gunfighter, lodestar, monster tamer, savant,  and tinkerer.\nPlay as the brilliant savant, the black-powder gunfighter, or travel with exotic animal companions as the monster tamer! Harness the power of your environment as the geomancer, or create wondrous inventions as the tinkerer!\nAs with all of our Kickstarters, the books are ready. You'll get the PDFs within minutes of the Kickstarter campaign ending, and we'll commission the print run for the actual books the moment the Kickstarter funds clear! You won't have to wait for your rewards! \nThese new classes are fully detailed with exciting class-themed abilities! Each of these classes also contains a range of subclasses to further customize them. In this book you'll find the bloodweaver, fatebender, gemini, geomancer, gunfighter, lodestar, monster tamer, savant, and tinkerer.\nWant to read more? Find out more over on our website, download this free 12-page preview of the savant from DriveThruRPG, or this preview of the geomancer! \nThese nine classes originally appeared in EN5ider, the 5th Edition patreon. Since their publication we've revised and updated each of them after plenty of feedback from the community, and now they're ready to be presented in a beautiful full-color softcover book! Each is a full class along with subclasses and all the roleplaying information you'll need to play them at the table. \n Bloodweaver: Macabre Magician. Bloodweavers fuel their magical powers with their own blood, enhancing their own prowess, healing or bolstering allies, and flaying open their foes. They can sense the presence of creatures of flesh and bone, resist the cold reach of death, and manipulate a target\u2019s blood to spectacular, deadly effect. Choose from the Bloodbinder, Crimson Witch, and Scarlet Reaper subclasses!\n Fatebender: Destiny\u2019s Chosen. At the extreme edges of fate\u2019s tapestry, fatebenders pull upon its fraying threads, tugging at the strands of chance. Fatebenders manipulate their own dice rolls as well as those of allies and enemies, further relying on luck to make uncanny discoveries, avoid lethal attacks, and make the most of their own strikes. Subclasses include the Mascot, Jinx, and Weaver!\n Gemini: Two\u2010Faced Warrior. Evading and confounding enemies, gemini create dangerous semi\u2010real multiples of themselves and copy their foes\u2019 techniques. Their duality affects more than how they wage war however, and each embodies two major contrasting ideals, never certain which will be at the fore the next time they wake. Will you select the Atavist, the Equalist, or the Reluctant Hero?\n Geomancer: Nature\u2019s Hearthmage. These mages turn the surrounding elements into potent weapons and tools and fuel their spells with the primal components of creation. Geomancers can also protect companions from harm and draw upon nature outside of battle to reveal reality\u2019s secrets. Four distinct orders\u2014the Conqueror, the Apothecary, the Architect, and the Rune Knight.\n Gunfighter: Black Powder Desperado. These warriors shoot their way across the field of battle, pausing only long enough to aim their next bullets. Gunfighters are adept with the guns they choose to master, picking off targets hidden behind cover with precise shooting and aiming telling shots that leave enemies with catastrophic wounds. The Bushwacker, Drifter, and Maverick make your choice of subclasses!\n Lodestar: Fractured Soul Given Form. In combat lodestars are poetry in motion, their innate powers bringing both wonder and woe. To keep from unraveling into madness these fractured souls must train and hone their skills, becoming masters of body and mind\u2014and their lodestones, magical spheres used to attack, defend, and more. The lodestar chooses from three methods: Control, Imagination, or Instinct.\n Monster Tamer: Companion of Beasts. Monster tamers bond with monstrous pets, whether beasts, exotic aberrations, slimes, or even draconic in nature! Though significantly weaker on their own, tamers with companions make for a potent and unique addition to any group of adventurers able to tolerate the presence of a monster in their midst. Select from the Animalist regimen, Monstrous regimen, and Oddball regimen.\n Savant: Mind Over Matter. Sometimes saving the day means weaponizing knowledge. Savants are brilliant detectives, iconic martial artists, and adventurous physicians, each utilizing genius where others rely on magic or brute power. Repositories of lore, savants also use canny combat tricks to put enemies at a disadvantage. You might be an Adversary, a Chirurgeon, or a Coordinator.\n Tinkerer: Engineer of Wonder. Tinkerers bring life to impressive contraptions, create incredible devices, and forge legendary destinies! When not making or improving mundane items, tinkerers use their technical genius to unleash elemental fury upon their foes, relying upon their own brilliance to resist any magic that might subvert their will. Steam Knights, Bombardiers, and Mechanics make up the tinkerer's choice of subclasses!\nAnd if that's not enough, for those who don't already have A TOUCH OF CLASS, we have a revised edition of that book containing the alchemist, cardcaster, diabolist, feywalker, morph, noble, and occultist classes!  \nEach class has been tweaked and updated. \nThe cardcaster has been restructured to be more approachable.\nNew archetypes for the occultist and noble.\nExtra flavor and guides for making adventurers. \n Alchemist: Scientific Sorcery. The alchemist uses an almost scientific approach to magic to make alchemical discoveries. Will your alchemist become immune to poison, or discover the Elixir of Life? Will you delve into the Science of Creation and build a homunculus, or research the Science of Destruction and devise explosives? We also expand on the alchemist class with three new advanced studies: the Science of Illumination, the Science of Mutation, and the Science of Regeneration. Also included are two new spells, and an update which gives the alchemist a little more \u201coomph.\u201d\n Cardcaster: Seers of Fate. The cardcaster uses a tarot deck to release magic, playing cards to cast spells\u2014although she doesn\u2019t always have control over what spells are currently made available to her by the winds of fate! Also included are three subclasses: the Knight of Swords, which embodies mental force and determination; the Page of Wands, which embodies the magical power of creation; and the Queen of Cups, with embodies the emotions. This class is also supported by new feats and new secrets, including the King of Pentacles, which pertains to thrift and wealth; and the Jack of Beasts, which unleashes the trapped spirits of monsters. \n Diabolist: Students of Darkness. Diabolists deal with forbidden secrets and dark entities, grasping for power through dark pacts. While they have things in common with necromancers and warlocks, diabolists are something entirely more\u2026diabolical! Also included are two dark paths: the Demonic path and the Devilish path. We also introduce some conjured horrors, such as the accuser devil, contract devil, and more! \n Feywalker: A Taste of Primal Chaos. The feywalker is a mysterious warrior with mystical powers. Feywalkers can teleport short distances, breathe in air and water, and enchant others with a glance. They can also choose from three primal spheres: Beasts, Plants, or Entropy. \n Morph: Changing Faces. The morph is a shapechanging specialist, able to slide between different forms. Morphs have a choice of three essences\u2014the Doppleganger, the Primordial Beast, and the Trickster\u2014and a selection of Morph Talents they can choose from and acquire. \n Noble: Chessmaster and Commander. Leader, tactician, and a source of inspiration, the full 20-level noble class is able to command and inspire through three paths: the Path of the Heart, the Path of the Brave, and the Path of the Tactician.\n Occultist: Freeing the Monster Within. The occultist allows you to play a monster, with a choice of three distinct paths: Abomination, Vampire, or Werecreature! Delve into the dark and secret creatures of the night, cursed to exist as monstrous beings shunned by the world. \nA TOUCH OF CLASS got 4.7 out of 5 stars from customers in its initial print run on Amazon!\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"Brand new, original and fully developed classes that will make the other players at your table jealous.

When a paladin turns from the light, flaws of aggression, blind loyalty, and na\u00efvet\u00e9 provide corruptions of the virtues of bravery, loyalty, and wisdom.

Deities from ancient cultures\u2014the Aztecs, Egyptians, Greeks, and Welsh\u2014were rightfully wary of the gods of misfortune.

Carving out a domain of your own has been a part of the game since the beginning, and Ultimate Kingdoms is an ideal supplement to cover what your character can do when you get home from that epic journey or drag your loot out of the dungeon. There's more to the hero life than just buying the sharpest sword or the mightiest staff. Your character should really be somebody in the campaign world, make their mark, and build a legacy that will last, and that's where Ultimate Kingdoms comes in! \nThis hardback book contains the rules you need to build a kingdom and a legacy for your character! Legendary Games has compiled over 400 pages of our best-selling Ultimate line to bring you an awesome array of options for your characters outside of dungeon delving, including:\n Kingdoms  - core rules for creating cities, nations, and armies\n Ultimate Rulership  - expanded cities, improvements, edicts, events, governments\n Ultimate Battle - expanded tactics, command boons, terrain, environment, \n Ultimate War  - expanded commanders, sieges, air and sea battles, combined arms\n Ultimate Factions - power and politics, secret missions, alliances, influence, treason\n Ultimate Relationships - build robust relationships with key NPCs\n Ultimate Strongholds - classic castles and fantastic fortresses\n Ultimate Ships - ship-to-ship combat, fast-play fleet combat, ship modifications\n Ultimate Commander - a brand-new character class leading their squad on adventures!\n plus stretch goals featuring brand-new content, including the long-awaited Ultimate Armies rules for mercenary bands, logistics, a bestiary of troops, and more! \nThese rules are a terrific expansion to what's possible in your game, but they also are anchored to the character and party level of a campaign, especially when it comes to rules for ships, fortifications, and how your heroes connect with the key NPCs of their fantasy world! \nIn addition to the complete 5th Edition (5E) kingdoms and warfare rules, Ultimate Kingdoms is also available for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (1st Edition), incorporating all of our amazing expansions to the base kingdom-building and mass combat rules presented in Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Ultimate Campaign, authored by Legendary Games' very own Jason Nelson. It also includes expansions of subsystems from that volume like downtime, buildings, contacts, honor, and more, integrating them into how you run your kingdom.  The Pathfinder version of Ultimate Kingdoms will be a bit smaller than the 5E version, as we won't be reprinting the material from the Ultimate Campaign rulebook. \nAs the campaign continues, the book will get bigger and better with stretch goals aplenty, making the book itself more amazing, unlocking new artwork, and even creating new accessories to make building your kingdom even more fun! And we've got an awesome array of special guest authors lined up, including luminaries from the history of D&D, Pathfinder, and more like Ed Greenwood, Elisa Teague, Jonathan Tweet, and more!\nBest of all, this book is already written! The stretch goals include new previously unpublished material that's already done and new artwork, but our Kings, Queens, and special guests will have their new material in its own chapter at the end of the book, so layout can start while the Kickstarter is already going! You can make this book bigger and better, but it's already ready to rock! \nPledging for Ultimate Kingdoms is pretty self-explanatory: Choose your favorite system and then choose PDF or Print+PDF! That's about it! \nThe King (5E) and Queen (Pathfinder) pledges grant you all the following noble rewards! \n Create your kingdom (600 words): Describe the nation you rule or your own mercenary company, guild, secret society, or religion! \nDesign your own royal crest, flag, insignia, or sacred item, brought to life by our artists!\nCommission a royal portrait of yourself or your favorite character!\nBe listed among the Kings and Queens by your chosen title in the credits! \nHave your book personally signed and numbered!\nLegendary Games swag bag plus unlockable bonus items get added to your pledge FREE!\nBecause of the time sensitivity in getting this book laid out in timely fashion, we ask that you inform us of your choice as soon as possible!

For most domestic shipments, this covers everything and your book will be sent to you as soon as its available. For international customers and backers who pledge for multiple books, this $8 prepaid shipping credit is applied first to their shipping and handling cost and they will be invoiced for any additional amount when the book is ready to ship.  \nYou can find US international postal rates for a 3-pound hardcover to 5-pound multi-volume package here: https://postcalc.usps.com/\nWhy not Pathfinder 2nd Edition?\nThe kingdom-building and mass combat core rules for Pathfinder 2nd Edition won't be published until the end of 2020, so it's too far in the future to be part of this project. We definitely will publish expansions to those rules once they exist. \nWill there be HeroLab support for this book?\nThere will not be HeroLab files created for the new Ultimate Kingdom books at this time. However, you can other HeroLab files like the Mythic Hero's Handbook, Mythic Monster Manual, Mythic Spell Compendium, and Gothic Campaign Compendium from LoneWolf today! http://www.makeyourgamelegendary.com/hero-lab-files/\nHeroLab and Realmworks support for the Forest Kingdom Campaign Compendium is in review right now at LoneWolf for both Pathfinder and 5E, but since it is not currently available we are not offering it as part of this project. We will definitely send out a campaign update to all backers linking them to the LoneWolf site as soon as each version is ready!  \nWill there be virtual tabletop (Fantasy Grounds, Roll20, etc.) support for this book?\nKingdoms (5E), which provides the base kingdom-building and mass combat rules for 5E, is available as an add-on to your pledge for $10 (Save 33% off), and is available now directly from Fantasy Grounds - https://www.fantasygrounds.com/store/product.php?id=LGFG5EKINGDOMS.\nWe are looking forward to getting additional kingdom-building and mass combat resources uploaded to both of these systems, and if you are skilled at creating file packets for either Fantasy Grounds or Roll20 we'd love to hear from you at rfvrpg@gmail.com and makeyourgamelegendary@gmail.com!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven that art and writing are complete (aside from any extra items sponsored by backers), the risks on this project are very low. We've taken to heart lessons from prior projects and applied that wisdom here, getting all the heavy lifting done ahead of time. The layout people working on this project also are solely dedicated to this project right now and not multitasking on any other Legendary Games projects, and they are beginning layout now, while the Kickstarter is still underway, rather than waiting until after it is over.\n\nWith a small company, sudden illness or incapacity is always a possibility and could create delays, but reducing the remaining work to finishing layout, adding any sponsored material at the end of the process, and then preparing the print-on-demand files (rather than doing a full print run) greatly reduces any potential for delay.\n\nLegendary Games has run numerous crowdfunded projects before, completing all but two on time or early. Fulfillment of the massive Legendary Planet adventure series is finally nearing completion.\n\nDelays in printing and shipping are always possible but unlikely, as our experience with previous Kickstarters has allowed us to set up several options for getting your books to you!\n\nThe print option we use depends on the response to the project. If we have a low number of print backers, we can have a print-on-demand option available this summer. However, we expect a strong response to this project and anticipate an overseas print run, with print books likely ready to send out to backers by December.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Peasant... for now!", "descp": "Thank you for being a backer, now you can receive updates on this project and make add-on pledges through our backer survey after the project ends!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}], "stat": ["83 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Baron (5E)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["238 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Earl (Pathfinder)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["86 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Marquis (Both Systems)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) PDF\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["45 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Star Senator (Pathfinder/Starfinder)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF\nStar Kingdoms (SF) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Duke (5E)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) Hardback\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) PDF\n$8 Shipping Credit (Additional shipping may be charged when ship)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["395 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Prince (Pathfinder)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) Hardback\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF\n$8 Shipping Credit (Additional shipping may be charged when ship)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["163 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 110 or more", "title": "Royal Court (Both Systems)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) Hardback\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) Hardback\nUltimate Kingdoms (5E) PDF\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF\n$8 Shipping Credit (Additional shipping may be charged when ship)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["65 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 110 or more", "title": "Star Prince (Pathfinder/Starfinder)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) Hardback\nUltimate Kingdoms (PF) PDF\nStar Kingdoms (SF) Hardback\nStar Kingdoms (SF) PDF\n$8 Shipping Credit (Additional shipping may be charged when ship)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 400 or more", "title": "King (5E)", "descp": "Your Majesty!

The darker the shadow becomes, the world gets until the Destroyer of all Things finally emerges from the Void to swallow the world and everything in it. Are these the end times as foretold?\nPerhaps. Perhaps not.\nAcross the lands of R\u00fbl, great patrons have come forth to answer the threat posed by the Eternal Shadow by throwing back the darkness and sealing the rifts to the Demon Lord\u2019s realm. The Great Druid rouses the forests fight against demon and cultist alike, while the Queen of Faeries rallies the last of her children to make a final stand loosed by the growing unrest. These and others join forces to find the light they need to safeguard Urth for the rest of time.\nAgainst the Shadow is a cooperative board game designed by Adam Doochin and Dan Heinrich, where the patrons of R\u00fbl must come together to fight against the Demon Lord before this dreadful entity breaks through the cracks in reality and destroys the world. The patrons recruit heroes to undertake quests in the hopes of gaining treasures crucial for driving back the darkness. The Demon Lord, however, has many agents at its beck and call and sends cultists and demons to thwart these heroes\u2019 efforts. It\u2019s a race against time and the patrons must work together if Urth can be saved. Based on the popular horror-fantasy roleplaying game, Shadow of the Demon Lord, the board game gives you an all-new way to fight against the apocalypse. \nAgainst the Shadow is a cooperative race game for two to five players, with optional rules for one player or six. A typical game takes about an hour to play.\nWe need your help to make this game a reality. Even though the game has been designed and thoroughly tested, We still need to edit the rulebook and cards, finalize the layout, acquire a few more art assets, and, of course, pay for the printing and assembly. Given the expenses involved in these steps, We're asking for your help to bring this game to tables all over the world.\nThe best way to help is to choose a pledge level and back the campaign. The level you choose determines the rewards you get in return for your support. Provided the project funds, your dollars go toward covering the expenses incurred as we finishing this game. Now, if the unthinkable happens and the project doesn\u2019t fund, you pay nothing and the project doesn\u2019t happen. I do understand that not everyone can help, but if you believe in this project, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could help spread the word.   \nWant to see how the game works? Sure you do! Grab a prototype rule book here. Note, this is not the final rule book.\n(prototype)\nIn Against the Shadow, you become one of the mighty patrons of R\u00fbl, an individual who ranks among the most powerful in the land. You might become the High Jarl of the Jotun or the Faerie Queen. Each patron has special abilities that give you advantages in play.  \n(prototype)\nTo fight the Demon Lord, you need heroes. You recruit heroes from the land, finding dwarfs and clockworks, humans and goblins, and many other characters drawn from the pages of Shadow of the Demon Lord. Heroes, though, are meant to serve and fighting the Shadow means few will survive!\n(prototype)\nAs a patron, you issue commands that direct your heroes and change the circumstances in your favor, either to give you a much-needed edge against the Demon Lord or to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat! \n(prototype)\nAdventure awaits the heroes under your control. You send them into deadly situations to wrest treasures from terrifying locations and to find the light the world so desperately needs. Beware, though, for the Demon Lord has many tricks to thwart your efforts!\n(prototype)\nWhen your heroes complete quests, slay enemies, and explore the land, they find potent treasures to help you throw back the encroaching darkness.  \n(prototype)\nThe Demon Lord, however, will not give up without a fight. As you play the game, the Dark Lord of the Void places curses on the world, making the game harder to defeat. \n(prototype)\nAgainst the Shadow introduces a number of powerful patrons, each one the great movers and shakers in the lands of R\u00fbl. Patrons of the Demon Lord reveals their stories, histories, motivations, and servants. Packed with new lore, this 32-page PDF supplement is the perfect expansion for creating epic adventure for the Shadow of the Demon Lord roleplaying game.\nStay tuned for details!\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the table below.

We're ready to help thousands of children around the world, but we need your help! \nCritical Core is a tabletop role-playing game designed to help kids on the autism spectrum build social skills and confidence. It's a great way for parents to engage with their children at home, and for professionals and experienced gamers to use as a group social skills tool.\nCritical Core is brought to you by Game to Grow, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and co-developed with autism advocates, parents, therapists, and educators.\nPLAY\n\nSuitable for cognitive age 9+, including teens and adults.\n2 to 4 players recommended, plus one adult that acts as the facilitator.

Plus a few extra surprises that will unlock at higher levels!\nCritical Core is fit-for-purpose, designed to help neurodiverse players get started and stay engaged. At the same time, facilitators are provided with the right tools to make the experience effective without it 'feeling like therapy'.\nEach encounter the players face is targeted to help build strength in areas that are related to challenges associated with autism spectrum disorder.\nCritical Core is scaffolded around the DIR/Floortime model, and game encounters map to the FEDC framework. (Function Emotional Developmental Capacities)\nBut all of this is under the hood. At its heart, Critical Core is simply FUN.\nPLAY\n\nWhen kids engage in a world of fantasy play they are free to explore new ideas and relationships in a safe and fun sandbox. Skills learned while playing Critical Core can last a lifetime.\n Although designed for kids on the autism spectrum, Critical Core is just as beneficial (and fun) for all kids. It's an easy stepping stone into the fantastic world of tabletop role-playing games.\nCritical Core is built on established developmental frameworks and distills seven years of practical gaming therapy experience into an easy-to-use format. It is an amazing tool that can be used at home, at school, in a therapist\u2019s office, or out in the community. And above all, it's great fun.\nPLAY\n\n\nGame to Grow - Adam Davis (MA Ed) and Adam Johns (LMFT)\nCritical Core is brought to you by Game to Grow, a 501(c)(3) organization that runs tabletop RPG therapy gaming groups every week.

We also have some final artwork and design work to take care of, and of course there is the physical production.

Kickstarter is important for two reasons:\n First, you are an amazing community, and if anyone can help spread the word about the incredible benefits of role-playing games, it's you!\n  Second, there are costs involved in developing and manufacturing Critical Core, so Kickstarter helps us to produce this amazing project!\nPerhaps you already have a favorite role-playing game and are wondering how Critical Core can fit into your gaming life. Like many of you, we are avid gamers and have many games we\u2019ve loved for years. \nCritical Core can improve the games you\u2019re already playing.\nIf you\u2019re already playing an established RPG with your kids, your students, or your community, Critical Core can still help you improve your game and boost your outcomes. \nCritical Core contains a rule system, designed to be easily accessible to a neuro-diverse population as well as new facilitators, but that\u2019s not all! If you are already established using a game that you enjoy and find effective, you\u2019ll be able to use the other components of Critical Core that are designed to support a game facilitator in helping their players learn and grow.\nCritical Core contains a unique module design where in-game scenarios are targeted to real-world development outcomes. This can be translated to most established role-playing games. Additionally, the Critical Core kit includes a facilitator\u2019s guide which contains the learnings of the past seven years of facilitating role-playing games for social growth.\n  Do I need prior experience with role-playing games to run Critical Core?\n                          No. Critical Core is a 'rules-light' tabletop RPG, and the instructions will be designed to help brand new Game Masters quickly learn how to facilitate games that are enriching and fun. We are also planning to release video guides and tutorials to help you out! \nI'm already playing tabletop RPGs with my kids!\nAwesome! You already know the amazing benefits we're talking about. You also know from experience, that tabletop RPGs can be easy to pick up and play, but learning how to be a great Game Master can be challenging, especially for new players.\nWhy not use an established role-playing game platform?\nCritical Core's rule set is adapted from D&D's 5th Edition Open SRD. We have taken out some of the complexity for new players and Game Masters. Think of Critical Core as an entry-level platform: easier for parents, schools, and clinics to pick up and play.\nAre you trying to replace my favorite game?\nNo way! We see Critical Core as a stepping stone to the wide world of RPG gaming. Actually, we hope that as kids grow familiar and comfortable with the system, they can move on to your favorite platform. If you're already using some of the great games out there, then more power to you!\nSo how is Critical Core different?\nWe have applied our experience and best practices to help children (and caregivers) have the most effective and fun experience possible.\nMeticulously designed adventure content to help empower kids with social and problem-solving challenges.\nGame encounters, guidebooks, mechanics heavily influenced by established developmental frameworks (DIR/Floortime).\nRules have been adapted to be easier for new players and Game Masters to pick up.\nAdventures divided into 'one-shot' chapters that can be completed in 90 minutes.\nGoldilocks Content'  -  not too complex/scary and not too easy/cartoony.

I grew up pouring over and daydreaming about the gods and monsters that filled the pages of the 1st edition AD&D Deities and Demigods.  It was not only one of the foundations of my introduction to Dungeons & Dragons but of mythology as well.  The seeds planted by the pages of that book grew into a lifelong fascination with deities and mythology.  Soon after I had been captivated by Deities and Demigods. I discovered the gloriously bizarre world of Frank Mentzer's Immortal Rules and realized we aren't limited to contemplating the lives of the gods - we could become them!  My goal for Ascension is to bring the wonder and excitement I had for mythic gaming in the early '80s to the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons.  Throw in a bit of flavor inspired by the 2nd edition's Legends and Lore/Monster Mythology and 3rd edition's Epic Level Handbook and we have the foundation for the definitive Immortals/Epic supplement for 5th edition!\nSealtiel, the Defender\nWhy Ascension? Ascension offers a new type of gaming for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. Current epic options simply extend the game through feats, boons, and levels; they don\u2019t offer a fundamentally different way of playing the game. Ascension not only delivers epic equipment and monsters that can be used in a more traditional game, it also provides new rules and guidelines to extend the game into new spheres of play. With Ascension you can become gods and explore the multiverse with power and abilities beyond mortal comprehension.  It is a 5th edition epic homage to Set 5: Immortal Rules!\nZehir, the Midnight Serpent\nAscension will be a quarterly RPG zine (old-school black & white, 5.5 x 8.5) focusing on epic and immortal gaming for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.  Each issue will be 32-48 pages of epic and immortal goodness featuring:  rules for playing gods; lore, stats, and art for at least 4 deities/epic monsters; and mythic relics and artifacts for your epic games.  The primary goals of Ascension  are two-fold: \nProvide epic monsters and guidelines that can be used with the standard 5th edition rules and some the existing 3rd party epic supplements.\nProvide a set of variant rules and guidelines for taking characters and monsters beyond the realms of mortals.  Allowing players to grow their characters from mere demigods to the heights of the greater gods or even pantheon heads. These variant rules sit on top of the 5e chassis allowing players to shed the trapping of levels and class and instead embark on the quest to gain epic ranks, worship, and increase their Authority and Influence among mortals and Immortals a like.\nTake your characters and games where 5th edition has never gone before with Ascension \u2013 the Codex of Immortals.\nSample Deity: Athena ( 3 of 5 page spread)\nIs there anything for mere mortals?\nYes, there is! Though most of the content in Ascension is geared for epic gaming, there is content available for lower-tier games. Such as:\n Relics and Artifacts: The epic items are presented in a format that is usable by mortals and gods, with the power of the items increasing with the power of the wielder.\n Deities: Each deity entry has a section on its church and clergy. This section will include the typical classes of the clergy, cleric domains, extra spells granted, and sometimes new spells, class features, feats, or boons. \n Epic Monsters: Not all the monsters presented will be god-level threats. There will be monsters in the CR 21-30 range (including avatars of each god). That can still be a nuisance to a god and a real pain to mortals.\n Minions: There will be, on occasion, entries (lore, art, & stats) for servitors of the gods and other epic entities which are typically in the CR 10-20 range.  For example, there will be lore, stats, and art for warden archons as the prime servitors of Sealtiel, the Defender.\nWarden Archon\nOnce funded and first issue completed, the zine will become available on  DriveThruRPG and other outlets.  Print versions will be available shortly after release of the PDF issue.  Future issues will release at approximately three-month intervals.  Backers get their copy of the PDF and print version at the discounted rate provided by the reward level chosen (included with your reward).

The ultimate race creator lets you quickly make your very own player race. Want to play a were-iguana? How about a robot-scorpion? Elf-ghost with psychic powers? How about a manticore-man? We've done our best to cover just about every trait a character could possibly have. So if you can come up with it, you can play it. The Ultimate Race Creator is compatible with 5th edition D&D but can be easily adapted to other editions or systems.\n What we've done is come up with hundreds of traits. These traits are just like core race ones you're familiar with that define the racial abilities and features of a playable race. Then we've divided all those traits into categories, like mobility, offensive, age, or magic. You select one trait from each category and you've now got the traits that represent your brand new race! \n Well, to start with you have 10 racial points or RP to use on creating your race. Each trait has a cost associated with it, the more powerful the ability the more points it costs. So you'll have to balance your race out with weaknesses if you want a whole bunch of flashy features. Using these built-in checks and balances, these races avoid the min-maxing and common pit-falls that other systems have fallen into. A race made with 10 racial points is balanced with the existing core races, but you can use more for games where monstrous players are appropriate. We won't tell you that you can't make a 40 RP mechanical tiger race with demon powers and chainsaws for hands, but your GM can.\nSo GM's, rest assured that nothing your players make using this book will break your game (unless you decide that would be fun).\nWe started with a set of traits for the \"Beastmen\". It includes 24 pages of traits that cover everything furry, feathered, or beast-like. With it you can play as centuars, minotaurs, satyrs, Kitsune, panda-folk, moose-men, or just about any other variation of man and beast that you can think of. This was our first go at the concept so there's a bit of cleanup and refinement we'd like to do, but it shows off the creator system pretty well and it's completely free! Click the link below and give it a look.  \nFor the second book in the series we wrote the Scalykind Race Creator, 32 pages full of all the traits you need for a zillion varieties of any kind of dragon people, serpentfolk, boggarts, grippli, medusa-kin, hydrafolk, and every kind of reptilian or amphibious traits we could think of. Find it here:  \n We want to provide players and GMs with the widest variety of options available with the Ultimate Race Creator. When funded, the Ultimate Race Creator will include the contents of the Beastmen and Scalykind race creators, alongside 3 new race creator books, Robots, Insects and Gothic.  \nThis race creator will give you all the traits for anything and everything metal and mechanical. You'll be able to play as steampunk automatons, futuristic androids, magic-infused golems, and empty suits of armor. We need this book for the chainsaw hands alone. \nThis race creator gives us all the traits for the creepy and crawly range of the animal kingdom. This is where we'll put all the scorpion tails, the spider webbing, the wall crawling, and the butterfly wings. Play as great big beetle-folk, actual spider men, and mystical moths. Do you want to play as ants? Because this is how you get ants. \nIn this book we will include every trait you could possibly need for anything of the spooky variety. We have lycanthropy, ghosts and spirits, every variety of vampire blood and a ghoulish collection of undead traits like skeletal bodies and zombified flesh. You will find everything related to horror tropes and undead or cursed characters right in here. \nIncludes both the serious horror and spooky skeleton styles.\nWe admit that a spider robot character might not be appropriate for all campaigns. We separated the books like this to allow GMs to easily pick and choose what parts of the race creator to let their players access. It also lets us lovingly spread lore and fluff onto each book, which gives you even more content to add to your world. Each book will average about 30 odd pages, including 4 fully detailed pre-built example races alongside original artwork and in-depth lore.\nBecause having this many options is incredible! As a GM, if you have an idea for a race this book will give you everything you need for a finished and polished race in less time than it takes to roll up a character. Or you can turn it over to your players and just tell them to have fun and create something! You can do all of this without the worrying about balancing or keeping min-maxing in check because it's already been done for you. After all, the whole point of this project is to give GMs and players more options with less work. \nWe're also putting in a bunch of useful extras into the Ultimate Race Creator. \nEver wanted to play a half-orc half-dragonborn? How about a vengeful dwarf ghost or an elvish were-owl? We are going to dissect the core racial traits and give them point values just as if they were made using the Ultimate Race Creator. This allows you to create half-races, create undead and enchanted subraces, or any other mix and matched creation you can come up with.\nWe're also creating a set of 30 playable example races made using the full Ultimate Race Creator, both to show off what the book can do and to supply you with a ton of ideas!\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we are adding the Plantfolk Race Creator. It's Filled with all the traits you'll need for Ents and treefolk, mushroom men of countless shapes and sizes, flowering knights, and protectors of the forest. This book will have everything leafy, bark armored, or showering spores.\n If we reach this stretch goal, we will add the Divine-Touched Race Creator. In this book we will be expanding on aasimars and tieflings, and every other race whose fate has been altered by gods or fiends. Have your race infused with a plague demon's curse, or blessed with the judgement of the scales of fate. Do you want races blessed or cursed by the gods? I know I do.\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will add the Fey-Folk Race Creator. We will include traits for everything that the feywild holds, including pixies, sprites, redcaps, sinister banshees, and the feymad elven courts. If it's tiny and or whimsical, you'll be able to create it with this book.\n If we reach this stretch goal we will add the Aquatic Race Creator. Merfolk of every variety and traits that cover absolutely everything that swims scuttles or floats beneath the waves. Create crabfolk, stinging jellyfish men, or lure people to their doom with anglerfish-like lures. If it's beneath the waves this book has what you need.\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will add Dr. Vanvid's Mad Race Creator. This mad scientist's creations are certifiably insane so your race can have the most bizarre traits imaginable. Make an ooze race, have a race that's just a sphere from another dimension, how about a colony of tiny monsters in a trench coat? This book covers all the traits that just don't fit into anything else, and must have come from a deranged mind.\nIt's the final frontier, there's no stranger traits than alien traits. If we reach this stretch goal, we will add the Alien Race Creator. Including the weirdest of the weird, this book will contain traits for surviving in a vacuum, bizarre space-faring life, colors out of space, and more big gray heads and antennas than you can shake a ray-gun at.\nWe're posting a bounty! If we reach this stretch goal we'll be adding 10 NPCs with races built using the Ultimate Race Creator. This rogues gallery will include everything from serious villains and heroes to bizarre and wacky characters. Each one will include lore, a statblock and an original sketch by our talented artists.   \nI'm really excited about getting to add this one. If we reach this stretch goal we will add the ultimate pet creator! This is an extra rule set that allows you to create your own familiars and animal companions using the traits found in the ultimate race creator! I know I want a pet crocodile-squid, or how about a haunted lantern familiar? I can't wait to get to this one.\nThe core races get their own special backgrounds and feats, why can't yours? If we reach this stretch goal, we will add 2 new unique racial backgrounds and 2 new racial feats to each race creator book. That's a total of 20 new backgrounds and 20 new feats for you to customize your new characters even further!  \nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will add a full page color artwork created by the talented Rachel Maduro and Nick Carry for each race creator book! That's 10 more full color artworks in addition to the full color covers. With those the Ultimate Race Creator will now include 20 beautiful pieces of art depicting fantastical and amazing races for us all to enjoy!\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will include a whole new set of mechanics to the Ultimate Race Creator! With all these amazing abilities tied to racial traits, we wanted to use them with existing characters. With the new mutation and augment system, you'll be able to provide magical mutations to existing characters within your campaign or have them gain traits against their will through horrible curses or transfiguring magics. \nThis stretch goal will also include the RANDOM RACE GENERATOR!\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will include the random race generator, a series of tables that handle the complex steps of the point system and allow you to create a fully randomized race with a series of die rolls. Create something truly random and see if it sparks your imagination!\nPeople have been asking about it and we aim to deliver. If we reach this stretch goal we will add a physical print option provided using the DriveThruRPG print on-demand service. \nEach backer that at a pledge level that includes the PDF copies of the book (basically all of them) will also receive at-cost print vouchers for those books. \nThis doesn't mean your printed copies are free (we would bankrupt ourselves if we did that) but it does mean you'll be able to get these books for only the cost of printing and shipping them, we don't take a cut. For just the baseline costs of printing you will be able to get freshly printed copies of the Ultimate Race Creator or any of the component race creators!\nIf we reach this stretch goal, we will create an animation with our favorite DM (voiced by the inscrutable Jeremy Connal) personally thanking each and every backer by name. He didn't think we'd get anywhere near this many supporters so if we reach the lofty heights of 600 backers we will all get to enjoy his increasing frustration with his endless hours in the recording booth. If you want to see that as much as we do then go spread the word! \nSo after some due consideration and a day's worth of brainstorming for more content we've come up with the lore generator! If we reach this stretch goal we will add the lore generator, a set of mad-lib style bits of backstory and lore that you can randomly roll up for your races. We're already providing a ton of lore in each book but the idea of a FULLY randomized race sounds amazingly fun.\nSo Who are You Guys Anyway?\nWe are LootTheBoss!

Altogether, we gave you over 900 pages of incredible material to blow the lid off your Pathfinder campaign with literally thousands of mythic feats, spells, monsters, magic items, psionic powers, class features, path abilities, skills, traps, curses, and more to make your campaign dynamic and cinematic in ways it never was before. It was amazing and we thank everyone who made it possible.\nSince then we've continued creating even more magnificent mythic material, bringing you even more paths, monsters, magic, and more from around the world, and the time has come at last to close the circle and bring it all home to you. Welcome to MYTHIC MANIA II !!!\nMythic Mania II encompasses two books rather than three, and incorporates mythic material for hardbacks like the Advanced Class Guide, Forest Kingdom Campaign Compendium, Horror Adventures, Occult Adventures, Ultimate Intrigue, and Ultimate Wilderness, as well as potentially adding in more material from the Adventurer\u2019s Guide, Monster Codex, Planar Adventures, Villain Codex, Book of the Damned, Pirate Campaign Compendium, and more! \nMythic Character Codex \u2013 Three new mythic paths - the bound, mystic, and reluctant hero - along with over a thousand new mythic path abilities, hybrid class features, feats, spells, magic items, and more! \nMythic Monster Manual II \u2013 Over 200 mythic monsters\u2026 and maybe a whole lot more! Plus appendices and bonus content!\nWe\u2019ve had our team working behind the scenes on this project for months now, and we\u2019re pleased to inform you that THE WRITING AND ART ARE DONE. That includes both the primary core of the product and the planned stretch goals. Material for bonus goals is already written - it's just a matter of seeing how big these books can become and how much stuff we can include! There will be no lag time waiting to catch upon things to get finished with the authors. It\u2019s already in the can. The more pledges we get, the bigger the books will get and the more material will be included, but art and text is already finished for all of the material we plan to include.\nPDF-ONLY PLEDGES\nFor those who go PDF only, you have the following choices of which books to get:\n$30 - Monster Master: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Monster Manual II.\n$30 - Mythic Maven: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Character Codex.\n$50 - Mythic Master: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Character Codex and Mythic Monster Manual II.\n$50 - Monster Master II: You get the PDF versions of the Mythic Monster Manual II and the original Mythic Monster Manual.\n$50 - Mythic Maven II: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Character Codex and the Mythic Hero's Handbook.\n$50 - Mythic Maven III: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Character Codex and the Mythic Spell Compendium.\n$70 - Mythic Maven Complete: You get the PDF version of the Mythic Character Codex, Mythic Hero's Handbook, and Mythic Spell Compendium.\n$100 - Mythic Grandmaster: You get the PDF version of all five books: the Mythic Character Codex, Mythic Hero's Handbook, Mythic Spell Compendium, Mythic Monster Manual, and Mythic Monster Manual II. \nPRINT PLEDGES\nFor those who love print books, you can choose any of the options below. All print pledges also include the PDFs of the books you select. Unless otherwise noted, domestic shipping is included in your print pledge. \n$60 - Hardcore Monster Master: You get the print and PDF versions of the Mythic Monster Manual II.\n$60 - Hardcore Mythic Maven: You get the print and PDF versions of the Mythic Character Codex. \n$100 - Hardcore Mythic Master: You get the print and PDF versions of the Mythic Character Codex and Mythic Monster Manual II. \n$250 - Hardcore Mythic Grandmaster: You get the print and PDF versions of the Mythic Character Codex and Mythic Monster Manual II, as well as PDF versions and signed hardback print versions of the original Mythic Hero's Handbook, Mythic Monster Manual, and Mythic Spell Compendium. Plus a bonus Legendary Swag Pack which includes a red LG dice bag, 3 custom D6s, color changing pencil, and LG lapel pin!  - LIMIT 15 \nThere are also three unique pledges for backers who'd like signed deluxe leatherette versions of the original Mythic Mania hardbacks!  \nPRINTING\nWe\u2019ll be doing the print side of this project as print-on-demand, so the turnaround between completed PDFs and availability of print books will be much faster than with a traditional print run. HOWEVER, we also have a very limited number of print copies of the original three books, including the recent discovery of a few leftover cases of the Mythic Hero\u2019s Handbook (which we\u2019ve been sold out of for some time), and a handful of DELUXE editions from the original Kickstarter. Those books are available in the special deluxe pledges and as add-on pledges (see below), and when they're gone, they're gone. \nOf course, those who missed the original MYTHIC MANIA also can pick up the original PDFs as part of this massive project! PDF never goes out of print! \nWe'll be offering fun expansions and stretch goals to you as we go along to make these books even better. The more you pledge, the more amazing content we can stuff into the pages of these books! \nUNLOCKED! - $5,000 - Mythic Classes: Occult 1 - We add mythic class features for the kineticist, medium, and mesmerist to the Mythic Character Codex!\nUNLOCKED! $6,000 - Fatal Four! - We add four more monsters to the Mythic Monster Manual II, and you help choose them!

If we can do it, we will! \nNOTE: To expedite the layout process all sponsored materials will go into a special Backer Appendix at the end of each book. This is so we can get started with the layout on the rest of the book without waiting on those special items, to make sure everybody gets their books ASAP! You will have a very limited amount of time to turn in your special pledges to us once the Kickstarter ends, and in fact we'd advise you to get your requests in to us before it's over. Get them in so we can get the books out! \n$25 - Mythic Sponsor: Pick any published feat or spell from Paizo, Legendary Games, or another Pathfinder publisher to include in the Mythic Character Codex.

Your name will be listed as a Classy Creator! Note: A mythic class includes only the class features of the base class, not archetypes. Because of our quick time frame for this project, we won't be able to take on highly complex classes.\nFor all sponsorships that include artwork, you'll receive high-resolution files of your sponsored art. \nIn addition to the basic options listed above, we have a limited number of copies of the original Mythic Hero's Handbook and Mythic Spell Compendium: \n$50 - Mythic Hero's Handbook (print/PDF bundle) - Only 25 available.\n$50 - Mythic Spell Compendium (print/PDF bundle) - Only 50 available.\nIf you're pledging for one of these books, please let us know via Kickstarter message at the time you make your pledge so we can keep a running count of how many add-ons remain.

If you'd like to pick up some of the amazing base content enhanced by this mythic project, we definitely encourage you to pick up the following fantastic books:\nGothic Campaign Compendium - $20 PDF, $40 print+PDF\nForest Kingdom Campaign Compendium - $25 PDF, $50 print+PDF\nPirate Campaign Compendium - $30 PDF, $60 print+PDF\nAdditional copies of MYTHIC II BOOKS - $50 Bonus Book - extra copy of the Mythic Character Codex or Mythic Monster Manual 2.

All copies of those books will ship directly from our printer and is considered part of your base pledge. All other print books will be shipped separately and will ship immediately on completion of the Kickstarter and confirmation of pledges. Shipping charge for these add-ons is separate and is $5 per book domestic and $25 per book international.   \nWill you be doing any mythic projects in the future?\nThis project will close the book (literally and figuratively) on our mythic support for Pathfinder, though we also may potentially create a version of the mythic rules for the Starfinder roleplaying game and for Pathfinder 2nd Edition, and possibly even for 5E. We will see how it all shakes out in the future, but this project is specifically focused on Pathfinder 1st Edition and all its many fans who want to close the circle on all the awesome stuff your heroes can do!\nWill HeroLab Support be available?\nThere will not be HeroLab files created for the new Mythic Character Codex and Mythic Monster Manual 2. However, you can get HeroLab files for the original Mythic Hero's Handbook, Mythic Monster Manual, and Mythic Spell Compendium through Lonewolf, as well as files for the Gothic Campaign Compendium. http://www.makeyourgamelegendary.com/hero-lab-files/ \nWe've been working with LoneWolf to create a discounted bundle of all of our mythic products for HeroLab; we'll let you know in a Kickstarter update when that is available, probably in early December. \nStay Tuned!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven that art and writing are complete (aside from any extra items sponsored by backers), the risks on this project are very low. We've taken to heart lessons from prior projects and applied that wisdom here, getting all the heavy lifting done ahead of time. We've also brought on a new developer in Thilo Graf who is handling this project so that it does not interfere with teams working on other outstanding projects, like the 5E and Starfinder teams finishing the Alien Codex and Aethera Field Guide or the adventure team working on the final adventure and compilation of Legendary Planet. The layout people working on this project also are solely dedicated to this project right now and not multitasking on any other Legendary Games projects, and they are beginning layout now, while the Kickstarter is still underway, rather than waiting until after it is over.\n\nWith a small company, sudden illness or incapacity is always a possibility and could create delays, but reducing the remaining work to finishing layout, adding any sponsored material at the end of the process, and then preparing the print-on-demand files (rather than doing a full print run) greatly reduces any potential for delay.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Mythic Maven", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Monster Master", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Mythic Master", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["43 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Monster Master II", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Monster Manual 1 PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Mythic Maven II", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Spell Companion PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Mythic Maven III", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Hero's Handbook PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Hardcore Mythic Maven", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex Hardback\nMythic Character Codex PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Hardcore Monster Master", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Monster Manual 2 Hardback\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "Mythic Maven Complete", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Spell Companion PDF\nMythic Hero's Handbook PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Hardcore Mythic Master", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex Hardback\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 2 Hardback\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["74 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Mythic Grandmaster", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Spell Companion PDF\nMythic Hero's Handbook PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 1 PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF\nMythic Character Codex PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Hardcore Mythic Grandmaster", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nMythic Character Codex Hardback\nMythic Monster Manual 2 Hardback\nMythic Monster Manual 1 Hardback, signed\nMythic Spell Compendium Hardback, signed\nMythic Hero's Handbook Hardback, signed\nMythic Character Codex PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 2 PDF\nMythic Monster Manual 1 PDF\nMythic Spell Companion PDF\nMythic Hero's Handbook PDF\nLegendary swag pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 400 or more", "title": "Marvelous Mythic Grandmaster", "descp": "Note: Deluxe premium leatherette copies will be signed by Jason Nelson, Owen K.C.
