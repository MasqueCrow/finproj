[{"backer": "Eric V. Berry", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "From Mat Groom, the co-writer of Marvel Comics' hit ULTRAMAN comics, and artist Erica D\u2019Urso (CAPTAIN MARVEL and XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS) comes INFERNO GIRL RED, an all-new original graphic novel that combines the high school super-heroic drama of INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE with the dynamic storytelling and world-building of Japanese tokusatsu superheroes, and the intrigue and relationship drama of British boarding school fiction.\nArt by Erica D\u2019Urso and Igor Monti\nWe all need something to believe in.  Especially C\u00e1ssia Costa.\nAn ancient cult and their army of demons have stolen C\u00e1ssia\u2019s home, Apex City.  When a magical dragon bracelet rockets into her life and affixes itself to her arm, C\u00e1ssia\u2019s the only person equipped to stop the cult from offering the entire city to their dark lord.\nThere's just one catch...\nInferno Girl Red by Nicola Scott (w/ Annette Kwok), left, and Valeria Favoccia, right\nThe magical bracelet is powered by belief, and C\u00e1ssia \u2014 an intensely pragmatic, rational girl \u2013 doesn\u2019t have much to spare. She\u2019ll have to find something to kindle her faith, though, and fast \u2014because she has a secret legacy to live up to. Because her mother's life is on the line. And because Apex City needs Inferno Girl Red.\nHi! My name's Mat Groom. And this story, INFERNO GIRL RED, is one I\u2019ve been working on for about three years now. I\u2019ve always thought it was worthwhile, but I was never certain it would work\u2026 until I met Erica D\u2019Urso. Erica is just wickedly talented. You can see that in her work on JAMES BOND, CAPTAIN MARVEL and XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS. But it was her energy, her tremendous passion, that made me believe. Erica loves C\u00e1ssia, and C\u00e1ssia\u2019s world\u2026 and that love infuses every part of this project. There\u2019s nobody I would rather be co-creating this world with.\n\nInferno Girl Red Character Design\nTogether with colorist Igor Monti (who has a ultra-modern and vibrant style you'll recognise if you read MEGA MAN: FULLY CHARGED), letterer Becca Carey (a real star-in-the-making) and design agency For The People (a Top 10 Global Agency, according to D&AD), Erica and I are so excited to bring you this all-new 100-page superhero graphic novel.\nINFERNO GIRL RED Creative Team\nKyle Higgins is editing this book. Kyle and I have been friends for half a decade, at this point. He has mentored me, in many ways (he edited my first comics series SELF/MADE), and more recently we\u2019ve worked as a writing team on ULTRAMAN for Marvel Comics. We share a passion for the Japanese tokusatsu genre (which was a big influence here, along with British boarding school dramas and American superhero comics). And there\u2019s little coincidence that C\u00e1ssia was first introduced to the world in the back of the first issue of Kyle\u2019s series, RADIANT BLACK. In fact, the connections between RADIANT BLACK and INFERNO GIRL RED may run deeper than you think\u2026\nC\u00e1ssia\u2019s not shy\u2013 but bouncing around from city-to-city as her Mom bounced from job-to-job meant it was hard to make friends... and any friends she did make disappeared pretty quickly once they found out who C\u00e1ssia\u2019s mother was. So instead of socialising, she focused on learning\u2013 showing a particular aptitude for science.\n\nC\u00e1ssia Costa Character Design\n \n                     Now C\u00e1ssia has a chance for a fresh start in Apex City. Her impressive test scores have earned her an invitation to the world-famous entrepreneur Doctor Janine Caro\u2019s prestigious boarding school for promising young minds. There, C\u00e1ssia starts to settle in. She starts to make friends. She starts to see a future for herself.\nBut when a magical bracelet blasts through a window while C\u00e1ssia is studying late one night, everything changes. C\u00e1ssia's quickly drawn into a strange war that she previously only heard about from her mother... \nConcept Art \u2013 The Griffin and Other Manifestations of Darkness\nConcept Art \u2013 C\u00e1ssia's Mom, and Other Mentors\nConcept Art \u2013 New Friends\n\nReady to experience some of the story?

Something didn't save properly on that reward description but you will get a copy of the CD + a shirt. \n\nQapla' batlh je! Success & Honor!\nIn 2014, I asked the question, \"What would pop music sound like if it were entirely in Klingon?\" The world jumped on board with me and together we created the first EP of pop songs translated into Klingon, Warrior Woman. In 2017, we all said, \"Hey that was fun! Let's do it again!\" and Fierce Songs came out. \nOver the last couple years, more people have joined the fun as yIbuSQo' found its way into blogs and Twitter feeds around the world. \n2020 was going to see The Klingon Pop Warrior & her intrepid Red Shirt back in the recording studio and then.... well, **waving hands around** global pandemic! I had a bunch of songs and a desire to make this thing happen despite shutdowns. So, I enlisted musicians from across the country that I either know from conventions or have worked with in the past and we all made home studio magic! It's pretty amazing what you can do in your own home nowadays and when you bring in a professional sound engineer it's absolute wizardry. This has taken a village to make happen and I'm so proud of what we all accomplished.\nbommey! The Songs!\nI've got some really fun translations and what I am most excited about is that I actually have translated more than half of these songs myself. While my first 2 EP's were almost entirely translated for me, my comfort and confidence with the language and grammar has grown. The songs on this new EP are (in no particular order):\n No Scrubs - TLC - Translator: Jen Usellis\n Maneater - Hall & Oates - Translator: Chris Lipscombe\n Born To Be Wild - Steppenwolf - Translator: Jen Usellis\n The Warrior - Patty Smyth w/ Scandal - Translator: Chris Lipscombe\n Good As Hell - Lizzo - Translator: Jen Usellis & Juliana Bukoski\nAlong with some able assists from translators, this EP would not be possible without fantastic musicians arranging & playing. I called in some serious favors on this one.\n No Scrubs - TLC - Craig Allen Hecht (guitar/drum) & John Abbey (bass).\n Maneater - Hall & Oates - The Faithful Sidekicks\n Born To Be Wild - Steppenwolf - Craig Allen Hecht (guitar/drum) & Barry Alverman (bass)\n The Warrior - Patty Smyth w/ Scandal - The Faithful Sidekicks & Craig Allen Hecht\n Good As Hell - Lizzo - Jen Usellis & a painfully simple cobbled together midi track that was polished into a diamond with all kinds of extras by John Abbey.\nCraig & Barry are old bandmates of mine from when I lived in the Twin Cities. For almost 8 years we were in The Express Band together. The Faithful Sidekicks are an awesome filk duo originally from the Twin Cities but now out in the PNW and we did a trade! They did some tracks for me & I did some harmonies on their upcoming album. Me cobbling together a midi track was because we're in the middle of a pandemic and I felt bad bugging other musicians after how helpful and amazing everyone else had been. I decided to continue my trend of being a \"Jack of All Trades, Master of None\" and make it work!\nFollowing up on the heels of the musicians is the incomparable John Abbey of Kingsize Studios here in Chicago. I had the pleasure of working with John at Kingsize when I did backing vocals for a local musician back in 2018. It was such a great experience and I loved the work he had done so I asked if he was interested in taking on the Pop Warrior.  His enthusiasm helping to not just mix these songs but fine tune them with extra instrumentation has been nothing short of miraculous. Working with him via email has been wild but he's really taken these tracks and turned them into something special which is no easy feat since he is working with other people's recordings.\nBudget Breakdown\nProducing a bunch of covers in another language isn't cheap and while I was spared the expense of a recording studio other things add up:\nSong Rights ~ $400 (5 songs x 300 digital + 100 physical per song, may need to get more depending on final tallies) \nTranslators ~ $300\nCD's Printing ~ $660 (100 copies)\nT-Shirts ~ $952 (based on previous campaign quantities +higher quality shirts)\nSound Engineer ~ $1500\nEnamel Pins ~ $350 (based on a previous pin order, this could end up being a little bit higher)\nYou might notice that this math adds up to more than I'm asking for. I've managed to front some of these costs myself and use merch & digital sales that rolled in over the year to help get things done up to this point.\nRewards\nAlong with CD's, there are Kickstarter exclusive shirts with the CD cover art --NOTE: THE REWARD LEVEL \"Pledge $30 or more De' jengva' wep je (CD + T-Shirt)\" INCLUDES A PHYSICAL COPY OF THE CD! Something didn't save properly on that reward description but you will get a copy of the CD + a shirt. \nThe back says: ghom'a' le' QutlhwI' Kickstarter Supporter\n\nEnamel Pins: \nI have worked with Reppin Pins in the past & I have no doubt they will make this pin absolutely amazing. They are a Chicago-based design company and do great work! Any chance I can take to keep things local is a chance I love to take!\nNot a final proof - this is the pin design, it will be the center image with the jagged edges and approximately 1.25 inches.\nI will also make 8x10s of the cover art for signing & framing.\nZoom Listening Party for a group of backers - you will get a first listen to the finished EP as well as your mp3's ahead of all the other backers.\nProducer Credit as a special thank you on the CD jacket plus a really nice signed matte plaque commemorating the event.\nPrivate Zoom Concerts for you and up to 10 friends. Let's celebrate!\n\nStretch Goals\nMy Kickstarters have historically been very modest affairs and going \"viral\" isn't really something I anticipate based on that history. There are things I can potentially do if I hit additional funding goals with the first 2 being stepping stones to the 3rd & biggest one.\n\n$5000 - Lyric Pins -- all backers who receive a physical reward will get a set of limited edition lyric buttons, one for each song on the new EP. These have been something I've created for Starbase Indy in the past. Some examples of previous buttons: \nyIbuSQo' (Let It Go), HIchop! (Kiss Me), bIHar 'e' yImevQo' (Don't Stop Believin'), QuptaHvIS maHegh (Die Young), Har'ey DunDaq vogh 'oH, puv chapar (Somewhere over the rainbow, birds fly)\n$6000 - Emote Stickers -- all backers who receive a physical reward will get a set of die cut Pop Warrior emote stickers.  \nThe ultimate stretch goal though is......\n$7500 - GET MY ENTIRE SONG CATALOG ON SPOTIFY- Over the years, I've been asked why isn't my music on Spotify. The answer is complicated. While many would consider what I do fair use/parody, not all rights holders see it that way. Paying for song rights is really important to me and doing things correctly is important to me. Even parodies require a certain amount of due diligence. Getting on Spotify or YouTube and other streaming services requires special custom rights and jumping through some legal hoops that I have avoided up to this point. The main reason is the cost and time it takes. All of my songs will need to be fully documented with the original English, Klingon, & back translations. My usual rights clearance source can handle it but it's a significant cost both monetarily and with the labor it will take for documentation gathering/creating.  If I'm going to put in the effort for 1 EP, I might as well do them all to consolidate the costs as much as possible but it will take resources. If this is something you have wondered about or inquired about, now is your chance to help make Spotify a reality. -- the timeframe to complete this will be a bit of a moving target. My goal is by end of August 2021.\n\nI am so excited and proud to bring this music to you all. It has been a labor of love making this happen in the middle of a pandemic and I am so proud to be translating my own songs and having people continue to enjoy what I am doing. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am most at risk of not meeting deadlines due to vendor turnaround time on the physical rewards. However, this isn't my first rodeo and I am working with all the same vendors as I have in the past. Additionally, all of the songs are recorded and mixed. Where my 2017 Kickstarter fell behind due to the recording & mixing being done during & after the Kickstarter, reward fulfillment on this is entirely in the hands of vendors I know are reliable based on previous experience. I will have as much done as possible so that I can hit send on everything once the funds are available.\n\nThe biggest risk with this project is the Spotify stretch goal. I could end up blocked by some of the artists' rights holders and this could end up changing how I do my rights for all of my songs going forward. Up until recently, there was no easy way to get streaming service rights. Fortunately, there are finally services out there that will help with this piece the puzzle and, while the documentation is pretty intensive, the process seems fairly straightforward overall.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "'Internet QoQ (Digital Copy)", "descp": "An mp3 copy of the EP & a jpg of the cover art emailed to you.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}], "stat": ["47 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "De' jengva' (CD+Digital Copy)", "descp": "An emailed copy of the mp3's & album artwork jpg plus a physical copy of the CD mailed to you.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["29 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "De' jengva' mIllogh je (CD + Photo)", "descp": "An emailed copy of the mp3's & album artwork jpg plus a physical copy of the CD and a signed 8x10 of the cover art.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["17 backers", "Limited (58 left of 75)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "De' jengva' Degh je (CD + Enamel Pin)", "descp": "An mp3 copy of the EP & jpg of the cover art plus a physical copy of the CD and an enamel pin (no signed cover art).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["25 backers", "Limited (25 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "De' jengva' wep je (CD + T-Shirt)", "descp": "An mp3 copy of the EP & jpg of the cover art plus the Kickstarter backer exclusive t-shirt.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "ghoD vey (Merch Pack)", "descp": "You will get all the merch!

This 10\u201dx15\u201d mat allows each player to organize their game space, all the while adding to the game\u2019s theme. It\u2019s colorful, fun, and useful for beginners and pros alike!\nPlayer Mat - Top View (Artist rendering)\nPlayer Mat - Side view (Artist rendering)\nOptional Color Options\nThe standard Player Mat has red as the main color, but other colors are nice too!  So, we're offering bundles that include 5 different colors. \nFive possible color varieties of Player Mats - Black, Pink, Blue, Red, and Yellow (Artist Rendering)\nEvery reward tier with multiple Player Mats has two versions - a single-color bundle and multiple-color bundle. But hey, good news! There is no price difference for choosing the multi-color reward options \u2014 they are the same price as the all-red mat bundles.\nSo, if you want lots of colors, please choose the multiple color option!\nGreen & White\nI am now offering Green and White mats as part of some reward levels as well as an Add-On!\nGreen & White Mats - (Artist's Rendering)\nIf you do not want to change your current reward level and would like to add Green and White mats to your current reward, simply increase your pledge by $12.  I will send out a survey at the end of the campaign to make sure you get the mats you want.\nDeck out your battles with this 9\u201dx24\u201d mat, themed with sinister dark magic-vibes. There are 8 spots for card placement, plus an area off to the right for keeping spare tokens or cards nearby \u2014 whatever helps your game session!  \nBattle Mat - Top View (Artist Rendering)\nBattle Mat - Side View (Artist's Rendering)\n Thanks to this amazing community of fans, the campaign reached the $3,200 mark!  So, I will be including a new mat in ALL multicolor reward tiers!  No extra money pledged required -- This one is on me!\n Introducing... Player Mat Z \nPlayer Mat Z (Artist's Rendering)\nThis alternate red Player Mat swaps the light grey colors out for green and the Colorful Meter gets turned to 11 and this one just POPS.\nWant More Than One?\nIf you would like extra Player Mat Zs, simply add $6 to your pledge and I will ask you via survey for what extra mats you want.\nFor those backing the Double the Fun or Full Team-Up levels: You will receive only  one of these mats to your reward.  However, if you want an extra, like mentioned above, up your pledge by $6 and we'll get that handled!\nAffordability was always my goal, so I targeted as to have these produced at a lower cost than standard retail for player mats, and I think I have succeeded. \nThe rewards are based on the following prices:\nPlayer Mats - $6 each\nBattle Mats - $10 each\nNote: The Hyper Set reward tier does have a slight discount!\n[Updated 7-22-2019!]\nUS Orders\nRewards with less than 5 GridMats will ship in box at a cost of $8\nRewards of 5 or more GridMats will ship in a box at a cost of $13\nInternational Shipping\nBased on popular request, GridMats are now available to be shipped to Canada, the EU, and Singapore.  \nWant your country added? Message me on Kickstarter or email me at gridmats@gmail.com.\nMost of the tiers are priced between $30-40 for international shipping, with the smaller tiers being cheaper and the very large tiers (8+ mats) being more expensive.\n See our update on International Shipping for all the important info.\nAt the conclusion of the campaign, it will take a week to gather all the orders and send numbers to the manufacturer. The production estimate is around 14 days, with them then being shipped back to me for distribution to backers.  With this timeline, I am not promising reward fulfillment until October, but it could be sooner if everything goes smoothly.\nHi, I\u2019m Alan - a big nerd who happens to have some skills with 3D modeling and rendering. When I decided to make some simple play mats, I \u201caccidentally\u201d let my imagination run wild. Before I knew it, I was building a complex scene in Cinema 4D \u2014 figuring out the best layout, crafting a flow of energy and a narrative to the design, and all that kind of nerdy stuff that I love doing! \nPlayer Mat Design scene in Cinema4D\nThe harder I worked, the prouder I became. And after posting my work in progress to other fans via social media to share my excitement and receiving a ton of excitement for the designs, I decided to find a way to get these made. So here we are!\nI had way too much fun crafting these designs and I really hope it shows. Feel free to ask me questions about the design process \u2014 I would love to answer them!\nThank you for considering backing this project. I really hope to make these mats a reality for all of us!\nIf you have any questions, feel free to comment here on Kickstarter or email me at gridmats@gmail.com.\nDisclaimer\nThis project is neither affiliated with nor endorsed by either Hasbro or Renegade Game Studios. This is a fan-made mat design, created with care to be compatible with a particular game while doing my best to avoid infringing on their intellectual property. I am a fan of both of these groups and would never want my intentions to be misconstrued as anything but admiration and support for their products and hard work.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project faces a few challenges, but I\u2019ve done what I can to minimize them.\n\nTime is the biggest challenge. I am not a game store or even an online retailer \u2014 just a normal guy who has a day job and typical life responsibilities. Therefore, this project will be handled to the best of my ability given those constraints. I have several tactics in place to alleviate the time issues.\n\nFirst off, the designs are done! By launching this campaign after the designs were already completed, I have avoided delays from the time-consuming creative aspect of the project.\n\nAlso, I have already identified a manufacturer, been in contact with them, and even had sample prints sent to me to confirm quality. They are simply waiting for final numbers to start printing. I do not have to start from scratch when it comes to finding someone to produce these mats.\n\nAnd lastly, from my experience interacting on social media, the group of people I expect to back this project are part of a kind and supportive community. I would hope they can understand that I am simply one of their own trying to get something cool made. I will respond to questions as I can and will work as fast as possible to help them out, but in the end, if it takes a day to respond, I believe they will be understanding.\n\nAnother challenge is the design orientation during printing. The manufacturer cannot guarantee that every mat will be printed exactly vertically as there can be some \u201ctilt\u201d during the print. This is an unavoidable aspect of printing on a flexible surface. I am addressing this in two ways:\n\n1. I've eliminated parallel elements near the edges of the designs. They would create a clear signal that the image is slightly tilted. I did my best to do so on both designs, wherever I could.\n\n2. I will increase the production order by 10% to have extra mats. This way, any mats that are obnoxiously tilted can be pulled before the orders sent out to backers.\n\nSo, while I cannot guarantee that every mat will be perfectly orientated, I will do everything I can to minimize the errors.\n\nI've done everything I can think of to make sure this project is as successful as it can be. I want to thank from the bottom of my heart anyone willing to back and support these mats' creation and production. I promise to work through whatever challenges arise to get these in backers' hands as soon as I can!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 6 or more", "title": "One Player Mat", "descp": "Get a 10\"x15\" red Player Mat\nINCLUDES:\nPlayer Mat (Red)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "One Battle Mat", "descp": "Get a single 9\"x24\" Battle Mat\nINCLUDES:\nBattle Mat", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 16 or more", "title": "Player Mat + Battle Mat", "descp": "Get a 10\"x15\" red Player Mat and a 9\"x24\" Battle Mat\nINCLUDES:\nPlayer Mat (Red)\nBattle Mat", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Base Set (Red Mats)", "descp": "Get 5 Player Mats, all in the same color - red!\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Player Mat (Red)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Base Set (Multiple Colors)", "descp": "Get 5 Player Mats, in different colors*!\n*Note: A minimum of 25 people must choose one of the multicolor options for mats to be printed in these colors.

I wanted to make an easy and accessible card game with a nostalgic Kamen Rider-y, Power Rangers-y feel to it. I'd already had a lot of the character designs done from webcomics and other projects so the whole thing very easily fell in to place.\nI wanted to emulate superheroes having fast paced, and kinda silly, power-ups in a card game, which is how the hex-card format came to be.\nEach player starts with a set amount of Hit Points, and the objective of the game is to reduce your opponents HP to zero by summoning Heroes and boosting their power through ATK, DEF and Special cards. Drawing enough GUTS cards to allow you to bring you Hero to the battlefield and start boosting!\nSay for example your opponent has a Hero with 6 defence and you have a Hero with 8 attack, if you attack your opponent loses 2 HP.\n(The rules are still slightly being tampered with at this stage, but those are the basics)\nHERO BOOSTER is light-hearted game, suitable for all ages. Particularly enjoyable if you like Henshin Heroes as I've include a few nods to tropes.\n *artwork possibly not final\nMy background is in self-publishing comics.

Allowing for either 2 decks of 50 per player or the option to use smaller decks with a extra cards to play around with.\n-The d6 gets upgraded to have a custom design\n-Power Up backers recieve and extra pin of Hundredman, the 100% funding mascot.\n-Each backer will also get bonus holographic cards in addition to all the other perks.

Berry", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Thank you so much for making Multiplex 10 a reality! \n\u2014 Gordon\n Multiplex 10 is an eleven-minute animated short about a schlock-loving movie theater usher named Kurt and a snobbish cinephile Jason, who come to realize they have just a little common ground in their mutual \u2014 but very, very different \u2014 love of film, which is a topic we think any film nerd can relate to.\nMultiplex 10 is based on the comic strip Multiplex by Gordon McAlpin that ran from July 2005 through April 2017, which has been described as \u201cClerks in a movie theater\u201d (Newsarama), with a \u201csmart and human take on geek culture [that] is brutal, nuanced, and damn funny\u201d (Gene Ha, Top Ten, Mae).\nThis animated version is part reboot and part prequel. While fans of the comic will love seeing these characters brought to life, we're hoping to reach a new, wider audience, as well. Fans of Community, The Office, and Clerks will all find something to love in the Multiplex 10 Cinemas.\nBecky and Melissa (not final art)\nMultiplex 10 will appeal to movie lovers, anyone who's ever worked a retail job, and anyone who's had an annoying friend who just can't shut up about why the things you like are terrible. While the short will stand on its own, we're hoping it can also serve as a pilot for full series.\nBut we can\u2019t make this first episode without YOU!\nEven long-time Multiplex fans may not know that \u2014 way before the comic strip began in 2005 \u2014 it was originally conceived as an animated short. But at that time, Gordon didn't have the resources to make it happen, so instead it evolved into a comic strip.\nNow, with thanks to crowdfunding and a few years of 2D animation experience (storyboarding, designing, as well as final animation), he's thrilled with the idea of bringing the concept (and the characters) full-circle in Multiplex 10.\nWatch \u201cMultiplex: The Chosen One,\u201d a student film by Gordon, to get a (very) rough feel for the tone of the Multiplex 10 project.\nWe\u2019re also creating all-new Multiplex 10 comic strips leading up to events in the first episode, which will be featured on the Multiplex 10 website and the Kickstarter project updates.\n The team (so far) for the Multiplex 10 pilot includes:\nGordon McAlpin is the Executive Producer, director, lead animator, and co-writer on Multiplex 10. He\u2019ll also be voicing Jason. He wrote and illustrated Multiplex from July 2005 through April 2017 and has produced three Kickstarter-funded Multiplex collections. Beyond comics, he is a freelance writer, designer, illustrator, and animator; you can see some of his earlier video and animation work on his portfolio site. \nDana Luery Shaw is a Producer for Multiplex 10 and co-wrote the script. She has dreamed of making animation since she was a kid, and she has successfully tricked Gordon into making her dream a reality. She is currently the co-executive producer of digital series Personal Space; she also created the indie ARG The Wall Will Fall, and wrote for the webseries Echo Chamber and Classic Alice.\nJoe Dunn is a Co-Producer on Multiplex 10 and will be voicing Curtis from Flickhead Video. He is a graphic artist living and working in the New York City area. He loves watching movies and drawing. He tries to do both non-stop. You may know his work from Joe Loves Crappy Movies or some other terribly-titled webcomic. Check out @joerules on Instagram and @joedunn721 on Twitter to keep up to date with his current nonsense.\nTom Brazelton is a Co-Producer for Multiplex 10 and will lend his voice to Kurt. He is the former artist/writer of the movie-themed comic Theater Hopper. He still enjoys writing and drawing, and he still likes movies (although, these days, it\u2019s a lot more Pixar and a lot less Jim Jarmusch). Eventually, he\u2019s going to get back in the game and publish some journal comics. Until then, follow @tombrazelton on Twitter, where he obnoxiously live-tweets SNL, and @tombrazelton on Instagram, where he uploads pictures of sunsets.\nChris Rager is a professional voice actor, perhaps best known for his roles as Hercule/Mr. Satan on Dragonball Z and Mr. Torgue in Borderlands 2. He\u2019ll be lending his mahogany tones to The Blogger.\nAiyanna Wade will be voicing Becky, the shy science nerd at the Multiplex 10. Her more recent work includes YouTube Channel Awesome's Nostalgia Critic and cohost of the Awesome Comics podcast. She currently works on stage in Chicago and lives with her other half Jake and kitten Gideon.\nJavier Prusky was born and raised in Montevideo, Uruguay. After relocating to Atlanta, he trained at The Company Acting Studio in Atlanta for three years. He graduated from Syracuse University with a BFA in Acting in 2016. He has also attended master clown Philippe Gaulier\u2019s  at school in \u00c9tampes, France; studied Shakespeare at The Globe Theatre in London, UK; and studied On-Camera Technique at The Actor\u2019s Space in Barcelona, Spain. He splits his time between Atlanta, New York City, and LA. Beyond acting, Javier enjoys anything involving nature and family. Whether it be hiking, SCUBA Diving, or rappelling, he feels at home with nature. His family, especially his mom, mean everything to him. In Multiplex 10, Javier Prusky will play Neil, a young manager at the theater.\nTangelene Bolton is a film composer in Los Angeles known for her powerful and distinctive melodies.  Upon moving to Los Angeles, she had the amazing opportunity to work for Remote Control Productions (Hans Zimmer) and now continues to work on projects in the realm of film, TV, and video games. She most recently worked on Rise of the Tomb Raider (Crystal Dynamics), Girlfriend\u2019s Day (Netflix), and Jem and the Holograms (Universal). Tangelene's goal as a composer is to create an experience that lingers in the subconscious of the viewer, impacting and shaping their experience. You can listen to some of her work at Tangelene\u2019s professional website and on SoundCloud.\nIan Vargo\u2019s sound design has been heard on nationally-televised ad campaigns, award-winning short films, and viral web content. Most recently, he has worked with the Los Angeles directing team \u201cCousins,\u201d whose videos have amassed over 30 million views on the internet. He\u2019s also a music producer, mix and mastering engineer, and a multi-intrumentalist musician. Ian also teaches Audio Production at The Art Institute of California. He enjoys binge watching television while sitting on the couch with his wife Erin, Italian Greyhound Luigi, and fluffy cat Babycita. You can see some of his work on Ian\u2019s professional website.\nAdditional cast will be announced in the coming weeks! Depending on the final budget, we\u2019ll be able to hire additional animators, visual development artists, voice actors, and more. We will put out a casting call to fill some of the remaining roles shortly after the project is successfully funded.\nAnimation is an expensive and time consuming process.\nThe $15,000 goal we're asking for, minus approximately $2,750 for payment processing and Kickstarter fees \u2014 amounts to a little over $1,200 per minute for design, animation, voice acting, sound, music and distribution, which is extremely low-budget for animation.\nBut of course we want it to look and sound as good as it can!\nAt $20,000, we\u2019ll be able to do a few extra things:\nSmoother, 4K animation\n5.1 Surround Sound mix\nTheatrical premiere at the Somerville Theatre here in Somerville, MA. (All backers at the Special Thanks level and up will have free admission, though you will need to RSVP\u2026 and, of course, transportation is not provided.)\nA Multiplex 10 comic book collecting the Multiplex 10 story comics (including as-yet-unpublished material) PLUS new material, reformatted into a single, continuous comic book \u2014 free to all $25+ backers.\nAnd we'll have a bigger distribution and promotion budget to submit the film to film festivals and/or digital distribution platforms like Amazon Prime, iTunes, etc.\nThe screenplay is already written (aside from a few movie references we\u2019ll update as close as possible to release, to keep them timely), and most of the characters have already been designed (as you can see in the project video). Pre-production can begin in earnest as soon as the project passes its goal.\nStoryboarding, visual development, and the rest of the design work will take two to three weeks. (The backgrounds seen here and in the pitch video are from the comic strip.) Once the storyboards are complete, we'll make an animatic, editing together the boards (with some rough animation) and adding temp sound and dialogue.\nKurt and Jason get philosophical (not final art)\nOver the course of six to eight weeks (approximately), we'll slowly replace the storyboards with finished artwork, sound, and dialogue, fine-tuning the edit along the way, before doing the final, polished animation in sync with the dialogue. Depending on the final budget, we'll be able to bring in other animators to help make the animation more fluid.\nNext, we'll lock down the edit, let the composer work her magic, and do a final mix. This step will take a few weeks.\nFinally, we'll master the final video files and release the short to the backers here on Kickstarter! With a projected release of September 2017, the four month production schedule should be plenty of time to complete the project.\nWe'll be exploring various distribution channels for the completed short and avenues for funding a full season, so it will NOT be immediately available for free streaming.\nBackers can support the short and get \u2014 of course \u2014 desktop and mobile wallpapers, PDFs of the \"shooting script\" and the storyboards, DRM-free digital files of the rough animatics and the finished short, hand-drawn sketches, appearances as background characters or other non-speaking roles, and even producer credits!\nAt the $100 level, The Art of Multiplex 10 ebooklet will include concept sketches, promotional art, and all of the Multiplex 10 comics leading up to the first episode in a high res, vector-friendly (where possible) PDF format.\nThree vector portraits (your appearance in the short will likely be slightly simplified to fit the design of the animation)\n  Some sketches by Gordon McAlpin\nYou can see the various reward levels along the right side of this page, but here's a handy breakdown of the various rewards:\nBe sure to read our project updates for more information!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGordon has previousy run and fulfilled two successful Kickstarter projects, and I'm in the process of fulfilling a third, for the third Multiplex print collection. That print run is currently in transit from the printer and should be arriving in (approximately) mid-May, so shipping the rewards may overlap with the production of the short (assuming this project is successfully funded).\n\nCreatively speaking, this will be Gordon's longest, animated narrative short \u2014 so that will undoubtedy present some challenges.

The Game!\n\nMillion Dollars, But\u2026 The Game (MDB) is a game that puts your morals and imagination to the test, posing the question, \"What would you do for a million dollars?\" Players create scenarios by combining a Trigger and a Rule card to showcase what they would or wouldn\u2019t do for a big hunk of cash. (For example, A Million Dollars, But\u2026 Every time you see a store having a sale, you poop your pants a little bit.)\nThe best part of the game occurs when everyone debates the scenarios that have been presented to the judge. \u201cDoes it include online store sales or just in-person sales?\u201d \u201cHow much poop are we talking: a rabbit pellet or an uncomfortable amount?\u201d\nMDB is a widespread communal project, spanning across half a dozen different departments within Rooster Teeth. It\u2019s based on Rooster Teeth\u2019s massively popular hit-comedy series, Million Dollars, But\u2026.\nIf you\u2019re ready to see how far your friends, neighbors, family members, coworkers, random people on the airplane, or strangers will go for a million dollars, check out this game. We think you\u2019ll like it as much as all of us here do.\nWe love all of you weird and amazing people. You ready for some #ButStuff?\n<3 Rooster Teeth\nSo you wanna play a few rounds of MDB, huh? Well, gather up a few \u201cfriends,\u201d prep your cringing muscles, and put on your best imagination cap. It\u2019s time to get weird for a million dollars.\nSetup of the Game\nEach player takes 4 black Trigger Cards and 4 gold Rule Cards. Put together, these cards create scenarios. Now, pick a judge from your group of friends. Maybe the person with the biggest feet?\nHow to Play\nEach player will hand a full scenario (remember, that's 1 black Trigger Card and 1 gold Rule Card), face-down, to the judge. See below for an example scenario.\nOne at a time, the judge will read the scenarios out loud to the group. This next part is where we think the fun of MDB lives. All players will attempt to glorify or downplay the scenarios, regardless of whether he/she put down that particular scenario. \nThe judge will then pick the scenario they absolutely WOULD NOT do for a million bucks. The winner of that round is the new judge. \nPlayers then draw back up to 4 of each card type. (Always have 4 black Trigger Cards and 4 gold Rule Cards.)\nHow to Win\nBe the most depraved person on the planet.\nNo, but seriously. To be the overall winner, be the first player to win 5 rounds.\nOther Game Styles\nEvery core game comes with rules for three additional styles of play with their own goals. While we made a game with enough structure to support rigid rules, we also wanted to create a structure that allows players to make their own horrid/perverse/fun rule sets.\nWhy don't you create your own rules? Let us know what you and your deviant friends come up with!\nSTRETCH GOAL #1: Livestream with the cast!

Elation that over 37,000 community members had helped fund a movie, fear over the fact that it was now time to shoot the movie, trepidation over what was still to come for the next 18 months, and even excitement about what would happen next.\nFrom July 2014 to present day (May 2016), it has been a whirlwind of perk fulfillment. BTS episodes. First shipment. Strangerhood Season 2. Signed perks. Game Time episodes. Lots of content and items have made their way into our backers' loving hands. And you know what? Every step of the process was FUN.\nBut that wasn't all. By having Lazer Team open to the public, away from our comfortable home of RoosterTeeth.com, new friends found us. They found a project that interested them and LATER found out everything else about Rooster Teeth.\nThat's why we are crowdfunding this game. Million Dollars, But... The Game is a fun and racy card deck that we want everyone and their weird neighbors to play. What better way to get it out to the public than launch it here on Kickstarter?\nMeet the Team and Hear our Story\nBack Row (Left to Right): Joe Rozsa, Brian Reilly, Burnie Burns, and Michael Hadwin\nFront Row: Patrick Schmidt, Becca Frasier, Andy Messner, Chelsea Atkinson, Barbara Dunkelman, and Tom Lusardi\nCell Phones: Geoff Ramsey and Blaine Gibson\nThe game was developed overnight. No, really it was. Our story started on the last Friday of February when Brian Reilly, Associate Producer for Rooster Teeth Games, was intercepted by Burnie Burns, Rooster Teeth\u2019s Chief Creative Officer, in the kitchen of Stage 5 in Austin, TX. He presented the idea of a Million Dollars, But\u2026 card game to Brian, to which Brian responded, \"Oh yeah, totally. No brainer! I bet we could mix this and that mechanic and mimic the show pretty easily.\"\n\nBrian went back to his desk and started spitballing ideas with Andy Messner, the Senior Producer for Rooster Teeth Games. The next day there was a prototype with about 80 cards. By the end of the week, the games team pitched their prototype to the cast and crew of Million Dollars, But\u2026 And with that, history was made.\nFrom there, we tapped into the sickest corners of Rooster Teeth employees\u2019 minds, sourcing triggers and rules from anyone who was willing to contribute. After a series of cross-company playtests, the games team locked down the game design.\nWe all know games need to look pretty, so Rooster Teeth\u2019s badass graphic design team took over at that point. Patrick Schmidt and Tom Lusardi worked their asses off over the span of two weeks to design all the assets, cards, and packaging necessary for a complete game. As final art came in, Joe Rozsa, Rooster Teeth\u2019s VP of E-Commerce, facilitated a relationship with printers in China, ensuring we\u2019ll be ready to crank out the game as soon as it\u2019s funded.\nAll in all, after a lot of cross-team collaboration and hard work, here we are.

In a bid to stop Zordon at his own game Rita hatches a sinister scheme to combat the Power Rangers with a Ranger of her own: the Evil Green Ranger... Will a mythical new Power and help from an unlikely ally be enough to stop Rita and save their friend?\nTEENAGERS WITH ATTITUDE was filmed in a day as a side project to ZORDON OF ELTAR. The cast met each other for the first time the morning of filming. We want to put as much time and effort into TWA2 that we put into the ZORDON OF ELTAR fan film.\nTWA2 will be a feature length film that is projected to be 100-110 minutes in length. We plan to split this film into 3-4 episodes that will be released online for free for anyone to watch.\n\nPlease note that THIS WEBSERIES WILL BE FILMED ALL AT ONCE using the funds from this campaign. There will not be long breaks between the episodes. Period.\nTWA2 will feature morphed Power Ranger battles, zord battles and much more. All of our work thus far has been leading up to what we believe will be an epic fan film webseries. With your help that dream can become a reality!\nThe original cast from TEENAGERS WITH ATTITUDE will be returning along with two new faces.\nRita Repulsa and her minions are set to return for TWA2 as well.\nDon't count out Alpha 5 in TEENAGERS WITH ATTITUDE 2 either! With Rita's new scheme it will be all hands on deck!!!\nHere are our two recent fan films set in this re-imagined fan-created universe:\nZORDON OF ELTAR (2015) *just released*\nTEENAGERS WITH ATTITUDE (2014)\nThe almighty Dragonzord will triumphantly return in TWA2. The Megazord vs. Dragonzord will be a fight for the ages!\nAfter working on both \"Teenagers With Attitude\" and \"Zordon of Eltar\" fan films\" we learned a thing or two about how to stretch a dollar. But the scale and scope we have in mind for this webseries requires more than we can reasonably afford. The biggest and most important need for our budget would be to ensure timely creation of the costumes, props, modestly compensate and feed our cast and crew, provide transportation for our guests and honor our rewards to our generous backers.\nHere's just one of the MANY concepts we came up with for TEENAGERS WITH ATTITUDE 2. And, yes, love it or hate it, that is a gold visor!\nThe helmet for TWA2's Red Ranger costume is almost ready to go! With your help we can acquire the remaining helmets we need! Boy are they pricey!!!\n The experienced and talented folks at Snakepit Studios have been gracious enough to work with us to provide Power Ranger bodysuits for our fan film! To save on funding we can stick with their pre-made suit designs but with higher funding we could work with them to create our own design! Either way we're in good hands! You might have seen their suit design in their joint project with Bat in the Sun from the hit \"Green Ranger vs. Ryu\" video!\nZORDON OF ELTAR couldn't have been made without your guys' backing. TWA2 will be no different.\n Why do you hum or sing your favorite song? Or dress like your favorite character for Halloween or at a convention? We are doing this fan film because we simply want to enjoy the experience of creating it. That's it. There is no \"end game\" here besides having fun creating entertainment for ourselves that we can also share for free.\nTogether our team represents a merry and diverse collection of creative and talented men and women. Our goal with this project -- our endgame -- can be summed up with these three primary objectives:\n1) Have fun creating a film project together\n2) Create something we would enjoy to watching together as a group\n3) Share this project for others to watch for themselves and hope they enjoy it as much as we did creating it.\nThat's why we're doing a fan film and what makes the experience so grand. Period.\n Aside from DVD copies of our fan films, signed mini-posters and midnight screening access to TWA2 episodes before they release there are some other cool rewards you can receive by donated to our fan film.\nANGEL GROVE PRIDE perk gets you a shirt just like Jason's from TEENAGERS WITH ATTITUDE.\nELTARIAN SCHOLAR perk gets you an Eltarian mask like Zordon's from ZORDON OF ELATR.\nDRAGONZORD SUMMONER perk gets you a limited re-imagined flute prop just like Rita Repulsa and the soon-to-be Green Ranger!.\nWant Zordon's Armor from ZORDON OF ELTAR?

Berry", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "THANK YOU ALL!  We are fully funded the way we need to be to execute Prelude to Axanar and you have given us enough money to start working on the feature film Axanar as well!\nPrelude to Axanar is a short film that will give viewers a historical look at the events leading up to the Battle of Axanar, the central event of the film Axanar, to be filmed later this year.  Shot like a History Channel special, Prelude to Axanar will be Star Trek like you have never seen it before, showing the central characters of Axanar giving both a historical and personal account of the war.  How did Starfleet build its fleet?  How did they hold off a Klingon fleet that had been conquering star systems for centuries?  What role did the various founding planets play in Starfleet? Why were the Constitution class ships so important to Starfleet? How did Garth of Izar come to be regarded as the greatest Starfleet Captain of his time?\n\nThis Kickstarter is for Prelude to Axanar, which we will film at the beginning of May.  The Kickstarter for  Prelude will pay for the actors, the make-up, visual effects and actual filming costs. The resulting film will be about 20 minutes and also produce about half a dozen vignettes of the characters talking about different subjects.\n\nPrelude to Axanar will then allow us to launch into Axanar having proven our ability to deliver professional quality Star Trek.  There will be a subsequent Kickstarter for the feature-length \"Axanar\".\nThe Axanar team is determined to make the first true independent Star Trek film. \nTHE STARS OF PRELUDE TO AXANAR\nPrelude to Axanar features some well known actors portraying both new and familiar characters in the Star Trek universe.\nRichard Hatch as Kharn, the Klingon Supreme Commander\nMichael Hogan As Captain Robert April\nJG Hertzler as Captain Samuel Travis\nGary Graham as Soval, Vulcan Ambassador to the Federation\nTHE VISUAL EFFECTS OF AXANAR\nPrelude to Axanar has the amazing talents of Tobias Richter, one of the top Visual Effects artists in the world.  What you have seen in our videos is all Tobias and his crew.\nPLAY\n\nPERKS\nWe want to give you great perks for your donations.  And so we reviewed what other projects have done and did better. We hope you will enjoy the perks we offer.  And please stay tuned for special offers we will be unveiling during the 30 days of this Kickstarter.\nUSS Ares patch. Part of the $ 25 level.\nYou get a limited edition Soundtrack CD featuring the music of composer Alex Bornstein at the $ 35 level\nPrelude to Axanar DVD / Blu-Ray\nUSS Ares T-Shirt (Back)\nUSS Ares T-Shirt (Front)\nSTRETCH GOALS\nPrelude to Axanar has been hit almost all of our stretch goals!\n$ 15,000  Stretch Goal -  UNLOCKED Everyone who donates at least $ 10 gets an Ares Class Development Project Uniform Patch.\n$ 20,000  Stretch Goal -  UNLOCKED Everyone who donates gets an exclusive Juan Ortiz \"Axanar\" digital movie poster.  Those who donated $ 75 or more will get a printed 11\" x 17\" version to go with their original Juan Ortiz poster perk.\n$ 40,000 Stretch Goal  -  UNLOCKED  Everyone who has donated $ 10 or more will receive the Federation Historical Society Vinyl sticker.\n$ 50,000 Stretch Goal  -  UNLOCKED  Everyone who has donated $ 10 or more will receive the \"First to the Fight\" Starfleet fleet patch.\n(Please note, for those donating at $ 20 or less, there is a small shipping fee since otherwise we are not shipping anything to you as everything is digital.  All other levels we will just put these stretch goal perks in what we are already shipping you!)\nAres Class Development Patch\nPlease note that for all levels below $ 25, there will be a small shipping charge for all stretch goal perks.\nWHERE THE MONEY GOES\nFirst, understand that generally, you get about 70% of the total money raised. 10% goes to Kickstarter and Amazon payment processing fees. Another 10% we have budgeted for Perks (the gifts you earn at different donation levels). And there is generally a 10% drop out rate (which we hope is way less!). So basically we get 70% to spend on Prelude to Axanar.\nThe budget for Prelude to Axanar was about $ 20,000. But thanks to all your donations, we have doubled that to $ 40,000, allowing us to do everything better and more professionally.  We set the Kickstarter bar low at $ 10,000 as we really didn't know what kind of response we would get. We could have gotten Prelude done for $ 10,000, but it would have meant deferring payment to our VFX team and others, who graciously offered to work and take payment after the main Kickstarter if needed. So now we don't have to do that, or cut any corners. So the first $ 40,000 goes to Prelude. So to get that $ 40,000, we need to raise about $ 57,000 (remember we only get 70%), which we have done.\nWhat does that pay for? Well, first we need about $ 10,000 for make up. That is because we need to get all the initial design, sculpting and production of Richard Hatch's Klingon hair and make-up and Gary Graham's hair and make-up done up front. The good news is that money doesn't then need to be spent in Axanar. We have Make Up Effects Lab, the guys who actually worked on Star Trek since the beginning of TNG working with us, so you know we are getting the best.\nWe also need about $ 10,000 to pay the actors and their expenses (Michael Hogan and JG Hertzler do not live in LA). When you get such amazing actors as we have gotten, you have to pay them because this is how they make a living. And we want them very invested in our project and to go above and beyond. For example, Richard Hatch (who is also my acting coach) has opened up his Tuesday acting class to our production to do rehearsals and scene work in class. That is an amazing opportunity. Gary Graham said he was going to come by to work with the other actors in the class. So if you want these professionals to be invested in your production, you need to invest in them.  We have expanded our cast thanks to this Kickstarter.\nThen, there is the Visual Effects. That is $7,500 right now. That leaves $12,500 for the shoot itself. All those numbers are pretty accurate, but you never know what pops up.  So it is nice to have a cushion.\nSo again, to get that $ 40,000, we need to raise about $ 57,000. And thank you all for helping us reach that!\nLimited Edition Starfleet Procurement Patch available ONLY to donors!\nSo what about what we raise above that? Well, first it will be nice to have a cushion in case we experience any cost overruns.  But mostly, anything above the $ 57,000 or so will go into our Axanar infrastructure.  So here is where that money goes:\nInfrastructure   -  We are spending $ 10,000 to fund the infrastructure of Axanar Productions. This means the legal paperwork needed to create our production company and the rather expensive insurance to cover all our productions over the coming year. It allows us to set up production offices (We have gotten the space for free in some amazing offices here in Los Angeles) and start to produce Axanar.\nStarfleet Tunics  -  $ 10,000 allows us to fund the Starfleet costumes for Axanar. We have retained the services of the company that produces the TOS tunic replicas for Anovos, so you know these tunics will be top quality. With a large cast, and needing to custom manufacture top quality costumes in quantity, we need to do it right.  Making the Starfleet tunics will actually take 90 days from beginning to end.\nVFX - $ 10,000 goes to start paying Tobias Richter and his team for the work they are doing on Axanar.  Tobias has already started putting out some amazing work and has spent days and days honing the look of the 3D ship models.\nUSS Ares\nSo there you go!   That is where your money is going.
