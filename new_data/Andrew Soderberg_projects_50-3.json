It enables all types of users, from professionals to those brand new to the world of 3D printing, to quickly and easily change tools with almost no down time. XChange is patent pending, designed and manufactured in the USA by PrinterMods.com.\nConnect new tools in a single motion.\nWe designed XChange to be broadly compatible with most popular 3D printers, printer tools and accessories, while maintaining the smallest, lightest footprint possible.\nDirect drive tool being removed\nMade by us in the USA, XChange features an anodized aluminum frame, aerospace-grade electrical connectors, and is readily compatible with most existing 3D printers.\nTeachingTech Review - 12-18-20\nXChange incorporates an elegant mechanical and electrical connection that enables rapid tool changes using only a single motion. It is comprised of a master mounting assembly featuring a robust magnetic locking mechanism, and one or more interchangeable tool plates for fast swaps between multiple types of tools. \n\nMagnetic lock mechanism actuation\nIt works by pairing a master assembly, which remains affixed to your machine, with multiple interchangeable tool plates, using a strong magnetic coupling mechanism.\nHigh quality electrical connectors connect the master assembly to your 3D printer's mother board, while each tool assembly has its own PCB with convenient wire-to-board connectors to connect your hot end, fans, extruders, and more.\nDrawing of XChange assembly disengaged.\n\nWhether you want to try out new tools or accessories, experiment with multi-material prints, make use of spare parts, or just maximize uptime for your printers, XChange makes it possible. Compatible with virtually any combination of tools and accessories you can imagine, XChange opens up a world of new possibilities, with the printer you already have.\n\nIt's great for:\nDedicated tool types for certain materials\nChanging colors between or during prints\nFast maintenance - swapping a tool into service eliminates down time\nExperimenting with new tools and accessories, like laser engravers, pen plotters, and more.\nTeaching Tech's printed tool assembly cradle, 12-18-20\nXChange was designed to be compatible with the most popular styles of 3D printers. It's natively compatible with any 3D printer using MGN12H linear rail on the X axis, and 2020 extrusion-based systems like Creality 3D printers using an optional V-slot rail adapter plate.\n\nWorks with factory 8-bit and 32-bit motherboards.\nNatively compatible with MGN12H linear rail systems.\nCompatible with V-slot wheels and 2020 extrusion using V-slot add-on.\nPlanned compatibility with Prusa i3 style machines (will require a printed adapter).\nCompatible with popular ABL using up to 5-wire probes (such as BL Touch).\nXChange is currently intended only for 24V 3D printers.\nCapable of printing high temperature filaments in enclosures.\n Marlin 2.0.X Bugfix compatible - more firmware compatibility coming soon.\nOther motion geometries can be supported with printed adapters, which are expected to be designed and released in early Q2 2021 (sooner if the community would like to contribute to this end).\n\nAuto Bed Leveling\nABL probes like BL Touch, and capacitive and IR sensors will be supported natively by XChange, with a few different configuration options possible to suit a multitude of use cases. \nBL Touch probe being used on XChange with new ABL-capable boards\n\nWith XChange V1.0, ABL is supported on most 8-bit boards, and all 32-bit boards. 8-bit boards running Marlin 2.0.X currently support BL Touch, with our suite of tool changing features enabled. However, these boards are quite limited on available memory, and tool changing / BL Touch does fit, but doesn't leave much room for other features. We're working with skilled firmware developers to further reduce our needed footprint, and will be releasing firmware revisions to all backers for various popular machines.\n\nExploded view of master and tool assemblies\n\n\nElectrical:\nRobust, custom PCBs feature extra-thick traces, corrosion and wear resistant plating, and properly rated connectors from genuine parts suppliers like Samtec, TE Connectivity, Amphenol, On Shore, and others.\nAll PrinterMods products are manufactured to be RoHS-compliant.\n\nMechanical:\n50N magnetic coupling mechanism, perfectly aligned to maintain a strong connection during prints, but releases at the push of a lever\nInjection molded locating and alignment pins affix tool mounts reliably and repeatably.\nHigh-grade, machined aluminum frame, designed for the lightest weight and smallest footprint possible.\nOnly 16mm deep when closed.\nWeighs only 110g completely assembled(!)\nUSA-engineered and manufactured.\nWe faced some early challenges in developing firmware that would be fully functional for 3D printers with 8-bit boards and limited memory (such as the Creality Ender-3). We're working with Marlin firmware developers who have performed careful changes to Marlin bugfix-2.0.x with improved ergonomics and features, and will be releasing specific firmware branches for specific popular machines, as well as documentation for customizing the firmware yourself.\n\nCustomizing Tool Heads\nProgramming settings for different tools is as easy as modifying your slicer G-code, or saving those parameters to the machine's SD card or firmware config files. Configuring new tools is done by defining the following parameters:\nExample toolhead configuration options in G-code.\n\nThe firmware is currently in a very functional state, with many of Marlin\u2019s core functions enabled, with more improvements to be rolled out over time. Some of these changes / features have been rolled into the latest official Marlin bugfix-2.0.x, while we\u2019re further refining things like LCD menu selections for tool changes, tool head settings, etc.\n\nWe\u2019ve chosen Marlin because it\u2019s the firmware that runs most of the world\u2019s 3D printers. That said, we\u2019re interested in adding more firmware options to the mix, and if you want to help develop something, let us know as we\u2019d love to support you (as long as we're not spreading ourselves too thinly).\n\n3D Printer Belt Length Chart\nLast updated on December 18th\nRough timeline of XChange development, 2019 - 2020. Predicted Kickstarter fulfillment window 2021.\n\n\n\nProduction\nInitial production on XChange is due to begin on January 2nd, 2021. Manufacturing certain parts in volume will require fancy new high-volume fixturing, which we'll be taking delivery of after the completion of the campaign. We'll keep our backers updated on our progress as we move forward.\n\nIs XChange open source?\nNot at this stage, but we're working on ways to do so, at least with much of the XChange ecosystem. We will be publishing CAD, firmware, and supporting our backers, makers, hackers and developers in creating useful modifications. Wherever we can offer support to talented and inclined individuals, we intend to do so.\n\nShipping and Fulfillment\nCurrently, we ship internationally via USPS, UPS and DHL. Domestic shipping within the USA for most of our current customers is typically around $7.50 - $8.50 USD, while international rates vary (most shipments cost under $20 for the label, not including VAT and duties).\nBetween now and the time of fulfillment, we'll be working with third party fulfillment and logistics partners in an effort to bring even better value international shipping. As is with our current policies, we will not be marking shipping up at all, and will pass along the lowest possible rates to our customers.\nPrinterMods has been a USA-based manufacturer and retailer of 3D printer parts and upgrades since late 2018, and is made up of a team of talented, highly caffeinated makers, industrial designers and manufacturing specialists.\n\nOver the last two years, we\u2019ve proudly grown to serve tens of thousands of customers in more than 50 countries around the world, and have earned a reputation for our valuable, unique products and unwavering commitment to customer service.\n\nWe have our own manufacturing, production, and fulfillment facilities (located in FL and AL). All of our products are designed, engineered, and fulfilled by us in-house.\n\nDuring the course of development of XChange, we\u2019ve closely collaborated with various industry leaders and experts. We're grateful to all of them for supporting our efforts. \n\nSamtec - Manufacturer of very high quality electrical connectors, trusted in critical industries around the globe. We worked with Samtec to spec the ideal connectors for XChange, and validate our designs.\n\nInsanity Automation - Marlin firmware developers and automation experts. We teamed up with their team to do initial firmware development, and are continuing to work with them to offer ongoing updates to our backers.\n\nSlice Engineering - Makers of some of the finest 3D printer hot ends on the planet. We've collaborated with them to ensure XChange is ready to support their catalog of offerings, and will continue to do so in the future.\n\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter as a platform for a soft launch of XChange prior to a full-fledged consumer launch. By using Kickstarter, we can control the exact number of XChange units we\u2019re manufacturing, without over-committing ourselves. It also provides an efficient platform through which we can interact directly with our backer community, and help empower you to do amazing things with XChange.\n\nOur backers should expect communications from us on pertinent manufacturing, production and fulfillment updates along the way. We ask that backers be willing to give us constructive feedback when using XChange, and together help us further refine and improve it for everyone to enjoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve already addressed a number of challenges during the lengthy development of XChange, and we\u2019ve generally spared no expense to ensure we\u2019re making the highest quality, safest, most manufacturable and functional version of XChange that we can.\n\n#1 - Manufacturing\nThis is a BIG one, and proves to be a problem for many starry-eyed Kickstarter creators. We\u2019re confident in our ability to produce XChange\u2026 because we are the manufacturer. We have a fully-equipped facility in which we currently produce all of our other CNC-machined parts for existing catalog of products. We\u2019ve created and tested the machine programs, invested in custom tooling, designed high-volume fixturing (we even have backup fixturing)... all in an effort to ensure that we can produce XChange on-time for our Kickstarter backers.\n\n#2 - Packaging\nWe\u2019ve left this for last in our product development process because in addition to requiring us to know the very final form factor of XChange (and included accessories, etc.), our first priority is providing a high quality product. That said, we are actively working with a partner on developing some cool packaging that is not expected to cause any delays with our fulfillment.\n\n#3 - Fulfillment\nOver the two years we\u2019ve been operating PrinterMods, we\u2019ve learned a ton about efficient packing, production, and fulfillment. We foresee no fulfillment-related delays with our pre-established processes, and are well-equipped to course correct in the event of unforeseeable circumstances (we\u2019re looking at you, global pandemics).\n\n#4 - The current state of world affairs...\nWe're all sick of talking about it at this point, but this really is an unusual time in history. Successfully developing a product is hard enough as it is, and it's made all the more challenging with the looming threat of global pandemics, unstable economies, and lockdowns. Even during the XChange development process, we felt the repercussions of these global changes because, much like everyone else, we're at the mercy of some of these realities. Even something as simple as postal carrier shipping delays can impact many aspects of production at once, causing delays. We promise to never use this as a crutch or excuse for not doing our jobs to the very best of our abilities, but do ask for an extra helping of patience and support from our backer community as we navigate these uncharted waters.\n\n#5 - Shipping (carrier) delays\nWhen it comes to actually fulfilling the product, we're pretty great at our jobs. What we're not able to do is ensure that postal carriers (and governments / Customs divisions of numerous countries) do their jobs as well as we do. As experienced as we are with international fulfillment (a significant portion of our existing sales are overseas), it is simply outside of our control. We will be doing what we can between now and the time of fulfillment to create favorable international shipping options, and to offer our customers flexibility in carrier choice and shipping method as is possible. Please, check with your individual governments and carrier of choice to understand what, if any, delays they may be experiencing, and to fully understand your government's laws pertaining to import, VAT, duties, and the like. We will always do our best to assist with this as we are able, but ultimately it is the responsibility of the backer.\n\n#6 - Stretch goals?\nWe are not beginning this campaign with any particular stretch goals in mind. If we do decide to introduce stretch goals (which is unclear at this point), we will focus only on options that do not directly affect the scope of XChange's production. Changes to our core product that do not constitute incremental improvements to XChange, or that would negatively affect our design for manufacture (DFM) will not be put forth. These goals can be pursued separately from the Kickstarter platform, after we deliver on our core promises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nXChange is designed to last the lifetime of your machine.

Users can paint any 3D model in the app, then convert the model into  a MultiColor 3D model and download that model for MultiColor 3D printing. It works with every Slicer and 3D Printer.  \nThe output from SimplyColor3D 2.0 can be imported into any 3D slicer. It can be used for 3D printing on FDM or sandstone printers, and it can be uploaded to Shapeways or similar 3D printing services.\nSimplyColor3D 2.0 automatically unwraps 3D models. Because of the UV maps, any models painted with SimplyColor3D 2.0 will work with all other graphics applications (i.e. Marmoset, Lightroom, Photoshop, Dimensions, Zbrush, Hexels, Sketchfab, Shapr3D, Keyshot, etc.). The assortment of features in SimplyColor3D 2.0 makes it truly easy to paint any 3d model.\nAbsolute Zero, Painted in SimplyColor3D 2.0, pictured in Marmoset (credit Arcane Wonders)\nMaking MultiColor models is DIFFICULT!\nWith over a MILLION models it's no wonder that most 3D printer users rely on Thingiverse.com for content, but there are less than a thousand MultiColor models on Thingiverse.  As more people are buying MultiColor capable 3D printers the demand for MultiColor models is growing.\nThe normal method to convert a single body 3D model into a MultiColor model is to cut it into different pieces,  using a software program like NetFabb and Meshmixer. Other applications allow the user to paint the model, but they don't work with every slicer and every 3D printer.\nThe only way to solve the problem is to enable easy conversion to MultiColor. That way anyone can make any 3D model a MultiColor model. This requires software for painting and converting existing 3D models.\nSince there are no easy tools that support preparing MultiColor models for 3D printing, we took on this challenge and created SimplyColor3D 2.0  - the world's best integrated solution for painting and converting MultiColor 3D models.  We make MultiColor 3D easier!\n Introducing ...\n\nSimplyColor3D allows anyone, of any skill level, to turn a single-body  3D model into a MultiColor 3D model, for 3D printing in multiple colors easily. All the 3D models that you design, all the models on  thingiverse.com, and all the other online model repositories, can be  colored & split with SimplyColor3D and 3D printed in multiple colors on any 3D  Printer. This enables a level of freedom and customization never before  seen. Every 3D model is now a MultiColor model. Every model can be  colored unlimited times in different colors too. \n\nFor those of you who are familiar with SimplyColor3D 1.0 here is a short list of the upgrades we have included in SimplyColor3D 2.0:\nSplit by color: Output in 3MF or STL\nDirectly download to your computer\nNow supports ALL 3D printers and EVERY slicer.\nFill by region\nGlobal color replace\nIsland color replace\nStamping: Default and custom images\nrevised interface\nFavorite colors palette\nSave work online\nmodel gallery\nPhotoshop style layers\nCustom backgrounds\nTake snapshot\n3D rotation orientation cube\nEasy help requests\nBuilt in tutorial videos\nDo you want to see how to use SimplyColor3D 2.0?  In our Update#6 we show how to use each of the painting tools.\nHere is a little more detail on the user interface:\nWe think it's important that SimplyColor3D adheres the industry  standard way of doing things. That's why we use unwrapped Obj files with  texture map png's. Models that are painted with SimplyColor3D are compatible with leading programs like Blender, Maya, 3DS,  Rhino, and Zbrush.\nSimplyColor3D has a main window where the 3D model is displayed. On the left hand side is the main menu where models can be saved and loaded, and painting features selected.\nMain interface window\nThe Gallery shows rotating snapshots of previously saved painted models. \nGallery\n Custom backgrounds may be loaded, and Screenshots can be exported with a single click of the mouse.\nTake a screenshot\nThe color can be selected by either entering the exact RGB color code or  by picking from a color wheel, or by using a color picker for selecting  a color that is already painted on the model. This way the user can  work with a standard set of colors easily switching between them.  Colors may be saved to the Favorites palette.\nColor selection menu\nThe Fill by region feature divides the model into paintable areas by the edges of the model. Clicking on an area will fill the entire region with the color selected. \nColor pick & Fill by region\nIsland color replace only replaces the color you click on, up to the border of the color which surrounds it. \nIsland color replace\nGlobal color replace, switches one color for another, everywhere it appears in the model. \nGlobal color replace\nStamping, paints an image on the model. Stamp with default images, text, or copy from the model, or you may stamp with any uploaded image.\nStamping\n\nOnce you are happy with the look of your model you can convert it to MultiColor for FDM 3D printing. Simply click the \u201cSPLIT\u201d button and the MultiColor version of the model will download directly to your computer.\nThe model is now ready to be imported into your favorite slicing program, like PrusaSlicer or Simplify3D.\nAlternatively, you can download the OBJ, MTL, and texture PNG file which can be used to print in full color on Sandstone or Material Jetting 3D printers.\nSplit model converts the model to MultiColor for FDM 3D printing\nModels that have been converted for FDM 3D printing now have each color region defined in their file. These regions can be assigned to different color filaments in your slicing program. Below shows the each color section expanded in Windows 10 3D viewer. \nSeparate bodies in 1 file for FDM 3D printing\n\nCovid-19 (thing:4166787): Painted, converted to MultiColor, and 3D printed\nMike Wazowski (Thing:4187763): Painted, converted to MultiColor, and 3D printed\nSimplyColor3D 2.0 is unique among 3D applications. It is the only application that allows automatic conversion to MultiColor. It also has many unique painting tools and other features that make the coloring process fun, simple, and easy. Here are some of the features that set SimplyColor3D 2.0 apart from the competition:\nArcane Wonders is a board game company. They are currently running a Kickstarter campaign for The Freedom Five. Here a few time-lapse videos of their models being painted in SimplyColor3D 2.0, and side-by-side spins of the graphical models beside their material-jetting 3D printed counterparts.

SimplyColor3D makes it go from boring to AMAZING in full color!\nSimplyColor3D is a Cloud application, which means it runs in your  browser and doesn't require any software to be installed on your  computer. It supports all operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux) and a  wide range of hardware. To run SimplyColor3D your computer must have the  following capabilities:\nOperating system: Windows, Mac, Linux\nBrowsers: 100% Tested with Chrome\nCPU:  3ghz dual core i5\nMemory: 16GB\nOpenGL: Must support at least OpenGL V3.3\nGraphics card: GTX1050 or better\nInternet connection: 10mb/s\nProfessional graphics drawing tablet (Optional)\nThere are 4 pledge levels:\nPricing after the Kickstarter:\nSubscription MSRP: $60/year.\nLifetime unlimited access MSRP: $200.\nIf you pledge during the Kickstarter then you can take advantage of significant savings:\nOPTION ONE: 1 Year Unlimited Access:\nStart: $25 (Save 58%)\nIncrease: +$5 for every 100 backers\nOPTION TWO: 2 Year Unlimited Access: \nstart: $45 ( Save   62%)\nIncrease +$5 for every 100 backers\nOPTION THREE: 3 Year Unlimited Access:\nStart: $60 ( Save   66%)\nIncrease: +5 for every 100 backers\nOPTION FOUR: Lifetime unlimited access:\nStart: $100 (50% Savings)\nIncrease: +5 for every 50 backers\n\nSimplyColor3D will be rolled out to Kickstarter backers in the order  they pledged. The length of time it takes for the backer roll-out will  depend on the number of backers. There will be a period of time where we  will onboard everyone and work with them to ensure that the platform is  stable before it is made available to the public. This will probably  take about 3 months before the general public will be allowed to  subscribe to the service and access SimplyColor3D.\nAfter the current Kickstarter backers are on-boarded then SimplyColor3D 1.0 backers will be phased into SimplyColor3D 2.0. If you want to be moved to the front of the line and get access right away then you could always pledge again to further support the project =D\nWe will continue to further improve SimplyColor3D with the Kickstarter funds we received from this campaign: Which is the exact same thing we did with the funds from the SimplyColor3D 1.0 Kickstarter campaign (plus more money from our own pockets...who knew software development was soooo expensive?....).  We implemented many of the features that we mentioned in this section from the V1 campaign (plus a whole bunch more) like:\nAuto convert STL to the OBJ file format\nDirect download\nImproved freestyle paint brush\nCustom stamps\nFill by region\nHere is a sneak peek into our future development schedule:\nSpeed Optimizations\nThingiverse.com integration direct Import -> paint -> remix\nSketchfab bridge integration\nNew export file type (DAE, WRL, and more)\nModel transformations (i.e. scaling, cutting)\nAdvanced drawing tools (i.e. Lasso, improved fill by region, square brush)\nSection views\nMagnifying glass\nKeyboard bindings from standard applications\nMirror painting\nEnhanced gallery with cloud backup\nSimplyColor3D 2.0 Kickstarter - Release and future development timeline\n\nTachyon, Painted in SimplyColor3D 2.0, pictured in Marmoset (credit Arcane Wonders)\nSimplyColor3D enables everyone to be a graphic design artist.

Slicing profiles are provided for selected materials.\nOpen design\nWe chose to make our products extendable, upgradable, and easy to maintain.\nExcept the food-safe core parts of the extruder, most parts are standard spare parts that can be sourced. This campaign is designed to help us fund the injection molds for the core parts.\n3D Printing lovers are part of a strong community and we hope that more and more makers will experiment and promote food printing thanks to Cakewalk 3d. We\u2019re eager to get feedback and don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll be always here to help!\n\nHi, my name is Marine. I\u2019m a 3D printing executive, a graduated pastry chef, and the creator of Cakewalk 3d. I live in Paris, France.\nI love innovating with food and that's why I started Cakewalk 3d, first as a side project during the spring. It all began when we were all quarantined in France, and I wanted to automate my own pastry techniques. With a mechanical engineer, we worked together remotely, each one testing and improving on its own 3D printer.  We gather our result daily, and we iterated over 3 months.\nOnce I started showing other pastry lovers the desserts I was getting, there was so much interest that I knew it was something I had to share with the whole 3D printing community. I worked and designed new recipes during months (mostly tested and approved by my coworkers!) and searched for the best production methods.\nEven if I always want to 3D print everything, I came to the conclusion that the core parts of the extruder need to be injected. So I worked with an engineering team to select the best providers and design the molds. The campaign is aimed to raise enough money to pay these molds.\nThanks to your support, Cakewalk 3d will be soon in production, and I am really excited to share what we\u2019ve built with the Kickstarter community.\nIf you\u2019d like to see some of the designs and recipes I\u2019ve been getting with Cakewalk 3D, you can find me on Instagram @marine_corebaillais\nMay 2020 : The first designs\nMay 2020 : First 3D printed parts\nMay 2020 : First prototype assembled\nJune 2020 : Corentin's trial on Creality Ender\nJuly 2020 : New version on Marine's Anet 3D printer\nJuly 2020 : Testing new recipes\nPLAY\n\n July 2020 : First tests with chocolate\nAugust 2020 : 3D Printing Chocolate on Thibault's Alfawise\nSeptember 2020: Prototype testing on Alfawise and Anycubic\nSeptember 2020 : Final version, ready for production\nOctober 2020: Burger printing in progress...\n Help us spread the word and receive an extra ingredient in your box !\n\nShare this with friends on Facebook.\n  Share on Instagram.\n  Mention and follow us on Twitter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing:\nAs the old saying goes: good tools for good works.

From this intuition the idea of creating a new concept of handles bar that really helps cyclists in a more ergonomics and innovative way. Our mission is to correct your position ensuring the best ergonomics and safety in a way never experienced before. \nJoin the SPIRGRIPS revolution, change the way you bike for good. \nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nSPIRGRIPS\u00ae + are the result of more than ten years of research. These inner bar grips are developed, tested, and scientifically validated in Switzerland in collaboration with professional cyclists. Numerous prototypes have been tested using the latest 3D printing technologies to validate the ergonomics of the new handle and ensuring its perfect integration on the handlebars available on the market. \nNEW SHIPPING RATES\nWorldwide shipping available!  After the campaign, we will send a survey to all our backers in order to collect the diameter chosen and the shipping details. Shipping will be charged only after the campaign.  It is variable for every country and depends on the number of pledges made for each country, that's why we prefer to not make you pay in advance. We will give you the exact shipping rates and charge you just the right amount! We already can provide accurate estimates and we would do our best to not get rates higher than these.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhere we are now\n\nThe current prototypes, printed with 3D technology, are fully working in all the required features. We have spent the last six years engineering SPIRGRIPS\u00ae and testing new prototypes with athletes from all countries.

That's about 4% larger than the normal size of a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.\nWe imported the highest-quality puzzle cardboard in the world (1.9mm Eska \"blue\" stock) from the Netherlands and invented some new printing techniques so the pieces snap together and stay snapped\nThese puzzles have been extensively playtested to make the experience as smooth and engaging as possible from the moment you open the box to the moment you place the last piece of the last segment\nWhen you're done with the puzzle, everything can be reset and all of the secret compartments close back up with velcro so you can share the puzzle with a friend or solve it again later.\nNo puzzle dust!!\nPuzzle Art\nMost puzzles start with stock art of some trees or cats or something. We wanted each of our puzzles to make a fantastic, tiny world. And we wanted the art to tell a story as you solve it. So we worked closely with independent artists like Sarah Becan, Boya Sun, and Felicia Chiao to create beautiful one-of-a-kind puzzle images loaded with tiny details, story quirks, and easter eggs.\n\"The Happy Isles\" by Sarah Becan\n\"The Mystic Maze\" by Boya Sun\n\"The Sunny City\" by Felicia Chiao\nCustom Dielines\nTo make the magical ending work right, we had to customize the shape of every single piece in all three puzzles. While we were at it, we also made sure that the individual puzzle-piece shapes highlighted the cool art details instead of cutting them in half.\nJigsaw puzzles start as one big piece of cardboard, and then a specially designed cutting tool called a die comes down like a stamp and slices it into a thousand pieces.\nThe die for the \"Happy Isles\" puzzle\nUsually, the tolerance for that slice is about 3mm. But to pull off the magical ending in our Series One puzzles, we needed a 0.5mm tolerance. Nobody had done that before, so we had to work closely with our puzzle factory create new quality-control and die-cutting techniques to make it happen. Some of the roughly 3,000 blades that make up our dies actually had to be precise to within 0.1mm \u2014 30 times more precise than a regular puzzle. \nAn excerpt from Simon\u2019s briefing for the puzzle factory\n One of the nice side effects of making a more precise die and using super high-quality puzzle cardboard is the pieces click together in a really satisfying way and stay together even if you need to move the puzzle.  \n Magical Surprise \nIt\u2019s always exciting to pick up a new puzzle with an image you like and then open the box and start putting together the corners and edges. But after a while, you get to the part of the puzzle where you need to assemble 400 pieces of blurry sky. And then when the puzzle's about 75% done, that feeling of \u201cwhat am I doing with my time\u201d creeps in. Eventually the last piece finally goes in and the puzzle is over. We\u2019ve always found that part a little anticlimactic.\nSo we came up with a whole new way for a puzzle to end. When you place the last piece of what you thought was the end of the puzzle, you unlock a whole new part of the experience \u2014 a final act that includes both a magical illusion and a completion to the puzzle's narrative. We playtested these puzzles hundreds of times with people all over the world to figure out how to make this special ending as clear and engaging as possible, and we hope you're going to love it.\n\"The Happy Isles\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Mystic Maze\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Sunny City\" 1000-piece puzzle", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're working with our long-time manufacturing partner Ad Magic to deliver these puzzles to you on time.

Currently, solutions for affordable resin printing require either experience or research to get started. Our goal was to make using a resin 3D Printer easy and affordable.\nThe Prism\nThe Prism is the result of thousands of hours of use and development. The Prism removes a number of barriers through a combination of hardware and unique software features, making it approachable for non-super users.\n\nHardware\nWith an easy to remove magnetic bed and a print volume of 120mm x 70mm x 150mm, the Prism is a resin printer with a 2K LCD screen that allows for high resolution prints that look like finished products. Built with an all metal chassis for durability and a dual linear rail motion system for stability, prints can be as fine as 25 micron. The 57 watt parallel LED array drives uniform light distribution across the entire build plate, edge to edge. \nHardware Features\nAuto Leveling\nAuto leveling in its purest form. The leveling system actions at the beginning of every print and when homing the machine. Instead of chasing your tail around leveling and running test prints to make sure the level is right, let the machine take care of that process.\nPLAY\n\nDual Linear Rails - Reliable and repeatable Z movement is essential for high quality printing.\n2K LCD Screen - The 2K LCD screen allows for high quality printing.\nAll Metal - The all metal frame provides a rigid structure for daily operation. Fully enclosed with convenient flip lid.\nParallel LED Array - The 57 Watt Parallel LED Array allows for even light distribution throughout the build area.\nThe 57 Watt Parallel UV Light Array allows for even light distribution throughout the build area\nSoftware\nRegardless of the material, the resin calibration gives a strong start on cure times without guessing. The auto leveling system allows for beginners and experts to just print. On the fly cure time adjustment prevents the need to alter your workflow. Finally, we provide support for all major slicers.\nSoftware Features\nResin Calibration Print\nNot sure what cure time to set for new resin? No problem. Avoid guess and check by using the built-in resin calibration print. This print provides a reasonable ballpark on what cure time to set for the resin being used -- getting you from guessing to printing faster. Just choose the column that shows the best results!\nPLAY\n\nOn-the-fly Cure Time Adjustment\nAvoid nuisance around cure time while you are printing. Being able to adjust the cure time on the fly can save a number of pains like needing to reslice the file just to adjust cure time, or fine tune your cure time for a resin. Don't reslice, just print and adjust.\nPLAY\n\nWiFi Support \nThe Prism has a WebUI that functions as a convenient WiFi based delivery device for sliced files. In addition to delivering files, you are able to: start, stop, pause, edit profiles, and adjust printer settings. \nCurrent WebUI interface. Naturally, feel free to transfer files via Micro SD card if preferred!\nFull Control of Machine Settings \nAnti Aliasing levels (0,2,4,8x), Movement speed, UV Power Intensity\n  Allowing full control over machine settings is useful to power users and casual users alike. Want to cure a layer faster? Increase the power. Want to use a thicker resin? Adjust the Z speed and distance. Want to smooth out that lower resolution model? Enable anti-aliasing. Take advantage of more settings that many printers lock out. \nKeep the advanced settings from ChiTuBox intact, including Anti-Aliasing and Power Management\nSoftware Compatibility\nThe Prism supports all major slicers, and will continue to be updated as the software for SLA printing evolves. We hope that this lets you choose the software YOU like instead of forcing a buggy difficult-to-use slicer with limited features. Currently, it supports files from ChiTuBox, Slic3r, Print Studio, and Creation Workshop.\n\nPrint Gallery\n\n Here is the Prism in action:\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n\nResin:\nIn addition to the Prism, we also offer a line of 3D printer resins. They are made in America and formulated for LCD based resin printers.\nStretch Goals:\n\n\nTimeline and milestones:\nMay 22nd - Beam3d launches Kickstarter campaign\nJune 22nd - Beam3d Kickstarter campaign ends\nJune 28th - Production of units start\nJuly 20th - units are ready to ship and start shipping\n\nThe Beam Team\nThe Beam3D Team is composed of professionals who have been involved in consumer electronics for the majority of our careers. At our core, we are 3D printing guys, each with our own stable of 3D printers. In fact, a number of those printers are pieces that we have either developed or used in professional ventures throughout our careers from homebrew kits, entry level consumer models, and even up to industrial grade machines.\nWe see the need for high quality, low cost resin printers in the community, and we would like to be the ones to deliver on and support that dream.\n  The Iterations\nThe Prism has gone through a number of iterations. Below are some of the different phases that the Prism has gone through.\nOne of our earliest prototypes.\nWe updated to include an LCD screen so that we could provide more control. Before we've updated the Z axis\nTesting the new Z rails:\nPLAY\n\nOne of our old plate designs\n First short run of production:\nPLAY\n\nNew hood design!\nFinished design:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis Kickstarter is really a pre-order.

The assembly has been simplified by replacing the traditional screws and hinges with long-lasting snap-fit, increasing the overall reliability of the umbrella.\nThe handle and the shaft have been designed to take full advantage of the high flexibility of the whole umbrella when it is subjected to wind stress.\nThe canvas, made with a high density micro fiber Pongee 210T fabric, ensures a high degree of water repellency that allows water droplets to quickly slip away and performs an important protective function by shielding 95% of UVA and UVB rays.\nWe compared Pluvi, in terms of Durability and Flexibility, with traditional umbrellas of the same Price Range.\nPLAY\n\nFew components to minimize the chances of failure and all produced by the same injection moulding technology. Our unique technical polymer, used for every single element of the umbrella, has been specifically developed to be easily recovered and reused for the manufacturing of new products.\nPerfectly suitable for a complete cradle-to-cradle system or an alternate version made from zero-impact biodegradable polymers.\nPluvi is an umbrella with a modern look and attractive colors, combining sustainability with Italian style.\nFor those who are looking for something practical and stylish or simply as a useful original gift.\nTraditional Umbrellas are made of many rigid metal parts not suitable to withstand the stress of the wind.  Once broken it\u2019s almost impossible to repair and the recycling of the materials turns out to be difficult and very expensive.\nThe data collected by the International Trade Center states that over 2.5 Million umbrellas per day are imported by the major countries in the world; since the global market is stable, this means that:\nIf we consider that in a traditional umbrella (average weight of 350 grams) there are approximately 280 grams of metal and almost 1 square meter of fabric, this means that:\nLet\u2019s put these numbers in perspective:\nWe have been developing Pluvi over the past 3 years; at present Pluvi is in the pre-series production phase utilizing temporary moulds. This is a truly passionate project for our team and we are here to ask for your support in making it a success.\nWith your help we can shine a light on a fresh design and a new solution and introduce an umbrella that is fully recyclable and can actually improve the environment.\nStretch Goal #1\nStretch Goal #2\nTo see the result of the vote click HERE.\n If you like to support our idea, please leave a feedback on our social pages and spread the word between your friends.\n          ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of us have backed various projects on Kickstarter and we are very aware of the values that backers bring to the project. \n\nWe have spend countless hours in the preparation of this campaign and we have chosen our suppliers and partners carefully to guarantee an integral, reliable and ethical product.\n\n\nHowever, sometimes forecasts don\u2019t work as initially planned.

He became obsessed with resolving first layer adhesion as this is one of the issues that affects every 3d printer, and then needed to find a way to get prints off the bed easier.   When he made his first prototype and shared on social media nearly everyone wanted one,  and BAM - \nWham Bam was born.\nWham Bam will be making many other products, and always following the same mission:  Making 3D printing Easy, Productive and Fun!\nWham Bam has been through a year of product development, testing, refinement, material engineering, further testing and design. \nFor the last month we have been going through a Beta Test Round with select testers on various machines.  Each beta tester prints for different reasons and with a range of materials.  \nWe have taken their comments and suggestions and improved our product,  we have established production and supply and already created our test samples and prototypes with the same factories who will execute our production orders.\nWe are ready to go! In order to be able to offer competitive pricing on these top of the line materials we need to purchase in mass, we also need to create some simple tooling to cut materials to size and shape and to create our new robust packaging. With the Kickstarter funding we can get this into production in as little as 3 weeks from the goal met date!\nsee what our Beta testers are saying about our system!\nRob R.  \"I honestly stopped using my printer for a while because my prints stuck so well that I'd ruin them or break the glass trying to get them off.

Capable of using a wide range of materials that other companies cannot claim without damaging their magnetic sheet permanently.\"\nCarlos P \"I\u2019m liking how the prints look. Super smooth on the bottom. And I love that it just pops off. No more spatula. My installation experience went pretty smooth\"\nBryan V. \"Man, thats amazing, you saw that was super super easy to remove. And check out that super smooth finish on that first layer, so nice. The prints still stick when they're supposed to and they are super easy to pop off when done. \"\nJohn R.  \"Beta Test for Wham Bam. Great product! Want more plates in the future, and much more reasonably priced than you-know-who. \"\nPatrick L.  \"Wanted to share my experience so far.

Do you feel depressed when your 3D printer stops at where the print is almost finished, you have to spend whole day to print it again? Are you worried if your 3D printer will print a huge objective, which will last more than 24 hours?\nIf your answer is yes, Resumer 3D will release your worries. Resumer 3D, an affordable and magical tiny module, is designed to resume interrupted 3D prints from any printed layer automatically. Resumer 3D is super easy to use; you simply connect it to your 3D printer via USB cable, leave your 3D printer alone and go out for a date. Resumer 3D will monitor and accurately record 3D printing data, as a result, it can resume interrupted prints due to power interruptions, tangled filament, nozzle jam and even intentional interrupts. Resumer 3D will change the way you 3D print and design.  \nHow does it work? \nResumer 3D simulate the way of how 3D printer software works, sending out and receive G-code by USB port. By this way, when your printer is working, Resumer 3D will monitor the status of the 3D printer, record the printing data in real-time. Furthermore, there is a super capacitor built in Resumer 3D, even if the power shuts off unexpectedly, the super capacitor will keep Resumer 3D alive and store your printing information solidly. When you turn on 3D printer, as Resumer 3D has stored all the printed data, it can resume the prints from any printed layer automatically. Resumer 3D makes everything easier.\n At beginning, we posted Resuemer 3D project on hackaday.io, many people are doubt that why Resumer 3D is so compatible as it can work with different 3D printers. Thanks to my team, we have tried our best to insert different USB drivers of different 3D printers; furthermore, as how Repetier-Host and Cura control 3D printer, Resumer 3D use the same way to communicate with 3D printer and control it by G-code command. Following picture is the first version:\n What we can do with Resumer 3D? \n1. Resuming directly from interrupted prints.\nNozzle stops at the middle of the prints \nWhen the printer is working, unexpected things may happen randomly. We will be lucky if the nozzle stops at the middle of prints, when the printer stops unintentionally due to power outrage. At this situation, Resumer 3D will resume the prints flawlessly, the same as it`s printed without stops. \n Nozzle stops at the edge of the prints. \nWhen the printer is working happily, it will be still no worry if the printer is interrupted due to power outrage, however, the nozzle stops at the edge of the prints. Resumer 3D is eligible for resuming the prints as well. \nPLAY\n\nHere is the print, as you can see, the resuming result is pretty good:  \n 2. Resuming interrupted prints from any printed layer. \n As you may already know, sometimes the filament runs out or the filament is broken during the printing, we are absent as well. When we come back, finding that printer is working without filament, big gap between the print and nozzle. What should we do? Print it again? No, with Resumer 3D, we can turn off 3D printer, then turn on it, adjust the Z-axis height of the nozzle, resume the print from specified layer. \nPLAY\n\nWhen you resume prints from any printed layer, adjusting the height to proper position is very key factor if you can get perfect result.  \n 3. Print Multi-color object with Resumer 3D by single extruder. \nHave you ever thought about printing a colorful object with your single extruder 3D printer? However, it is almost impossible or too complicated unless you choose colorful filament or editing G-code. Good news is that you can print multi-color easily with Resumer 3D. You can turn off the printer to change the filament, when it is ready, turn on the printer again, Resumer 3D will resume the interrupted prints, amazing and easy, isn`t it?  \nPLAY\n\n Printing a colorful haummer for Sol is such an easy thing.  \n4. Printing with inserts, Resumer 3D will change the way of 3D designing. \n As more and more engineers are using 3D printer, the field 3D printer applied to expends. It is common for engineer to design parts with inserts, will 3D printer be still eligible for this task? With Resumer 3D, the answer absolutely is \u201cyes\u201d, you can insert any metal parts you want during the printing. What you need to do is turning off the 3D printer, putting inserts into printings.\nPLAY\n\n The following airfoil, we designed for Drone, the carbon wing has inserted printing successfully.  \nFeatures:  \nCompared to other solutions in the market, such as Rasberry +Power monitoring module, high-level main board, Resumer 3D has the following features: \n 1. Affordable and worthy: Just 21 dollars, you do not have to spend hundred dollars to buy a Rasberry Pi and Power monitoring module, you do not have to buy the extra Mainboard either. With 21 dollars, you can save hundreds of filaments.\n2. Easy to use: You simply connect Resumer 3D to your 3D printer via USB cable, leave it alone. No headache of editing G-code, no afraid of technical problems when you choose Rasperry Pi.  \n3. High Compatibility: Currently Resumer 3D is compatible with most of marlin firmware based 3D printer. We have integrated all the USB drivers for 3D printer that we can find in the market to MCU (Miro Controller Unit). The most challenge thing is that different mainboards have different USB drivers, what`s more, part of the mainboards do not have USB drivers, then we have to develop for them. Fortunately, we overcome this obstacle, we are happy to share our product on Kicktstarter.  \n4. Powerful: Resumer 3D can resume your interrupted prints from any printed layer instead of resuming only from where the nozzle stops like other solutions. There are many different reasons blamed for interrupted 3D prints, for example, Tangled filament, Nozzle jam, Power outage, you will find that only resuming from where the printer stops is not good enough. If there is a big gap between the nozzle and the prints, it doesn`t work, you have to spend many hours to print it again. With Resumer 3D, you can adjust the Z axis height to the perfect height, the printer will resume to print as if it never stops.  \nProduct testing   \nThe height resolution of Resumer 3D is 0.2mm.You can resume your interrupted printings successfully with the following two requirements: \n1. The minimal printed height should be 0.2mm\uff1b \n2. The minimal printed time should be 2 minutes. \nResuming printings: \n When are testing Resumer 3D, please wait for at least 10 seconds before you turn on 3D printer after turning it off. Otherwise, you may find that there is NO SD card when you try to resume the printings. \n Suggestion: \nWhen you test Resumer 3D with power outrage module, turn on the printer after turning off it for at least 10 seconds, otherwise the printer may not detect the SD card, as a result, Resumer 3D could not resume the prints. Please do not touch printings and X-axis, Y-axis, Z-axis (Except for moving the extruder.), when you resume the printer, in case of failure printing due to the movement of printings.  \nTechnical Details:\nLength: 69.4mm, Width: 29.5mm, Height: 17mm \nWeight: 28g  \nResolution: 0.2mm   \nResuming Height \u2264 2m  \n   Production TimeLine  \nSpecial thanks: \nResumer 3D Team is an international team, our team members are from United States, China, United Kingdom and Italy. We would like to give the best wishes to Mark Cole from United States from Australia. During this project, his famliy on hard times, Mark Cole`s family got bad flu. However they still do his best to make this project online successfully. They are strong and I believe that they will recover soon. Thank you for everyone, thank you for 3D printer!

Do you enjoy building things yourself? Do you have a project that needs lithium-ion batteries for energy storage?\nWe created a solution just for you! Our 18650 battery connectors make it easy to build your own DIY lithium-ion batteries of any size, voltage, capacity and power level that you need to fit your project! \n18650 cells are one of the most prevalent types of lithium-ion battery cells. They are available from dozens of companies in hundreds of varieties. This makes them an ideal cell for custom battery builders.\n[Journalist? Check out our Media Kit]\nHowever, the most commonly used method of joining them - spot welding - requires expensive tools that most hobbyists don't have. That's why we created the Vruzend caps - to help you build the perfect battery for you!\nUnlike spot welding or soldering, Vruzend caps allow you to assemble and disassemble a battery pack easily. This is helpful for modular applications where your battery size or capacity may change over time, or to allow you to swap out batteries over time as they inevitably weaken. You're no longer stuck with tossing an entire battery because a single cell went bad.\nThe new V2.0 terminal caps\nOur system uses an interlocking dovetail design to securely join the caps together like children's toy blocks. Once the caps are connected, you simply insert your battery cells. Now each cell has a threaded post terminal allowing for easy and customizable connections.\nEasily assemble 18650 cells into any battery pack size and configuration\nWe have been testing our current version (V1.5) of the Vruzend DIY battery building kit all over the world and with great responses. However, the power ability of the kit was somewhat lower in the initial version. We have been working hard on a new version of the kit to allow higher power capabilities and are excited to announce that it is finally here! The Vruzend V2.0 kit works just like the V1.5 kit that has been tried and tested, but uses pure copper bus bars and copper alloy spring contacts to allow much higher power levels, as high as 20 A continuous per cell! \nImprovements made in our most recent kits include:\nSuperior polymer for more resilient plastic caps\nElongated terminal posts to allow more busbars\nSpring contact includes stopper for more even insertion\nImproved mold tolerances makes assembly even easier\nThe copper based components in the new V2.0 kits are nickel coated, taking advantage of the high conductivity of pure copper and the corrosion resistance of pure nickel.\nThe Vruzend team has been working for months to bring our V2.0 kit to the market, and we fully expect to begin shipping V2.0 kits in May for our early bird rewards and June for our secondary rewards (once the early bird rewards are sold out). The first group of V2.0 kits will only be available here on Kickstarter, and then will be available on www.Vruzend.com afterwards. Make sure to take advantage of the special kickstarter pricing now though, as we won't be able to offer the kits for this price for long!\nWe are offering both kits, our existing Vruzend V1.5 kit and the new Vruzend V2.0 kit as rewards for backing our Kickstarter campaign. You can find details for each reward level and the option to pledge for that reward on the right-hand side of this screen.\nThe contents of each kit include:\nV1.5 kit (includes enough for 52 cells):\n104 caps with SS spring contacts\n104 SS nuts\n130 SS bus bars\n6 brass wire clamps\n6 zip ties\nNote: The V1.5 kit is rated at 3.5A continuous and 7A peak per cell\nEverything included in the V1.5 kit\nV2.0 kit (enough for 30 cells):\n60 caps with nickel-plated copper alloy spring contacts \n60 nickel-plated copper alloy nuts \n90 nickel-plated pure copper bus bars \n4 nickel-plated copper alloy clamps \n4 zip ties\nNote: the V2.0 kit is rated at 20A continuous and 25A peak per cell\nEverything included in the V2.0 kit\nVruzend is also the proud sponsor of multiple electric and solar-electric race car teams, including Team Sunergy from Appalachian State University! Pictured below with their award-winning solar race car, Team Sunergy is using the Vruzend 2.0 kit in the battery of their next-generation solar race car. Pictured below is the DTU Okami racing team developing an electric racing motorcycle, and last but not least, the students on the WWHS EV Team are the current defending champions of the Google Gravity Games and are also using Vruzend battery packs!\nSo far we've shipped our existing version of the Vruzend kits to over 100 countries around the world. Below are just a few of the countless user-submitted photos we've received back from successful DIY battery projects around the globe.\nUser-submitted DIY Vruzend battery packs\n If you aren't already experienced with battery building, we highly recommend doing some research and preparing for your first DIY battery. The best resource to teach you how to build custom DIY lithium-ion batteries is Micah Toll's #1 bestseller, DIY Lithium Batteries, available on Amazon in both paperback and Kindle e-book formats.\nTo see an example of a battery being assembled with the V2.0 battery building kit, check out this video: https://youtu.be/d2FCvW6S6Wk\nAnd to discuss Vruzend DIY battery building kits more, join the facebook group here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Vruzend/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any manufacturing project, there is a chance that the manufacturing process will take longer than expected and delay our schedule. However, we have taken every effort to ensure that we will remain on schedule.\n\nWe waited to begin our Kickstarter campaign until we were 90% prepared for production, instead of starting much earlier like many other campaigns have. This meant we couldn't start taking pre-orders as quickly as we'd like, but that we have only a small amount of final work to finish before we can begin final production of your battery-building kits!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "V1.5 DIY battery building kit (1 kit)", "descp": "1 complete V1.5 kit.

They won't cause irritation or fall out like foam earplugs either. \nReusable and Easy to Clean\n EarJellies can be reused many times. Cheap foam earplugs can get expensive when a new pair is used every time. EarJellies will last several months or even years with proper care. \nExcellent for Side-Sleepers\nEarJellies will not extend out of the ear canal too far, making them a great choice for side-sleepers. Once inserted properly, EarJellies will not work their way out of your ear canal half way through the night. They will stay in place all night for improved sleep. \n Silence the Snorer in Your Life!\nGreat for Water Sports\nEarJellies provide a reliable water-tight seal for swimming, surfing, kayaking, snorkeling and other water sports. The seal will not leak after extended use to help prevent ear infections and exostosis or \"swimmer's ear\". \nEarJellies will also properly fit smaller ear canals in children to prevent infections.\n Multiple Sizes for a Custom-like Fit\nWhen it comes to earplugs, a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach doesn't work for everyone. Ear canals come in many different shapes and sizes. EarJellies come in multiple sizes to find your own custom-like fit, especially for those with extra small or extra large ear canals. \nLow-Profile and Discreet\nEarJellies sit flush against the outer ear for a discreet look - great for concerts and clubs.  \nPerfect for Concerts and Clubs\nGreat for Long Motorcycle Rides\nProtect your hearing at the race track\nStadium noise can reach dangerous levels\nWhat makes EarJellies so different from all other earplugs out there?\nEarJellies are the only earplug made of MemorySil\u2122 - a patented, unique viscoelastic silicone rubber with shape memory. Whenever it is stressed or deformed, MemorySil gradually adapts to its new situation and slowly relaxes to almost perfect softness. MemorySil is a dual network elastomer: a network liquid piggybacking on a network solid. The network solid has permanent crosslinks that give the material a stable shape, but with a very small modulus. The network liquid has temporary crosslinks that allow it to adapt gradually to new shapes and with a much larger modulus. Those two networks act together to give MemorySil unparalleled viscoelastic properties. For example, MemorySil is remarkably aware of time, appearing firm and elastic on short timescales, but soft and accommodating on long timescales. Even its mathematical modeling is unusual; whereas the stress-strain behaviors of elastic solids and Newtonian liquids are described by integer-order differential equations, MemorySil's stress-strain behaviors are described by fractional-order differential equations. Essentially, MemorySil gives EarJellies a custom-like fit for a more comfortable, reliable seal to block more noise.\n10x Time-Lapse\nPLAY\n\n ANSI S3.19-1974 - NRR Rated 25 decibels\nEasy to Insert Correctly\nProper insertion is essential to achieve the given noise reduction rating (NRR) of any earplug. EarJellies will slide into the ear canal easier than foam for a proper fit. Here's an excellent study on laboratory results vs real world noise reduction of several different earplugs. The differences are huge! Proper insertion can mean 100x or more noise reduction. \n Soft and Comfortable for Everyday Use\nEarJellies will gradual conform to the shape of your unique ear canal shape and size. The \"feel and seal\" is simply better than foam or rubber earplugs.\nEarJellies in the news!\nThis Physics Professor Has Invented a Better Earplug\nUVA professor invents new earplugs\nTechnology-Medical/Hearing Loss\n  EarJellies Podcast\nEarJellies Podcast\nThank you for your support!\ninfo@earjellies.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're currently gearing up for large scale manufacturing.

We've had to re-engineer traditionally used production and tooling methods because they were not suitable for EarJellies.

See how you can even pop our patent-pending frame into your own hat for a completely custom ActionHat. \nSure, it looks like just some hat with a GoPro on it, but it's a little bit more than that - we promise! You see, we hated the elastic head strap so much, that we invented the ActionHat. \nPLAY\n\nThe problem with the elastic head strap is that you can't put it on one-handed when you're in the middle of the action. And, as you can tell by our video, we are fishermen - so when we're fighting fish with both hands on the rod and reel, we can't fumble around with a head strap. Or worse yet, accidentally drop it in the water while trying to put it on.\nPLAY\n\nBeing able to pop it on one-handed when you want to capture that BIG moment, is a BIG deal. We discovered this through a simple DIY - by screwing in a GoPro to the bill of the hat. Unfortunately, that DIY hat along with our $400 camera sank to the bottom of the ocean. So with the ActionHat, we made it FLOAT! If you spend anytime near or on the water, consider the ActionHat an insurance policy for your expensive camera.  \nIt FLOATS with one action camera (or up to 6 oz mounted)\nThe real magic is in the patent-pending, multi-mounting location, floating frame. The frame makes the ActionHat modular and customizable. With multiple mounting locations, you can wear it forwards or backwards to get the exact shot you want. You can mount an action camera or a smartphone (kit sold separately). Since the camera weight is not on the bill (and front heavy), the ActionHat sits comfortably and balanced on your head. \nActionHat has multiple mounting locations\nBecause the ActionHat is used outdoors and on the water, we've had many requests for a mesh back ActionHat. While the request seemed simple enough, the see-through mesh required us to redesign and rethink the support frame completely. We wanted to keep all the great things about the original ActionHat but make it lighter and more comfortable. \nCheck out the prototype pictures in the gallery\n  After over a year of developing and testing dozens of different prototypes, we are finally ready to launch our new mesh back hats with our patent-pending flexible frame! \nAll the components have been designed and tested, now we just need your help to get the molds made and the production started!\nBy meeting our goal we can new three styles of ActionHats in black. By exceeding our goal, we can add more color option for you to pick from! When that happens, we'll request your color selection in the Backer Survey. \nActionHat Mesh and ActionHat Visor\nThe new flexible frame allows you mount two accessories at one time. To use the hat backwards, simply disconnect the mount, slide the frame to the back mounting location and reattach the mount. And just like the original ActionHat, if it falls in the water - it will float!\nTake a look through our image gallery for close-ups\n                We also created the ActionHat Visor: a simple, lightweight design with one mounting location. Just like all ActionHats, it was designed to pop on quickly and easily with one hand, and it floats!\nCheck out the overview video below:\nThanks for checking us out!

A more comprehensive list of compatible printers can be found here.\nOther than the obvious simplicity of AstroPrint, you\u2019ll be connecting your printer to one of the most powerful platforms dedicated to 3D Printing.\nWhich means, you\u2019ll be able to:\nRemotely manage your 3D Printer (No pesky cables or SD Cards!) \nMonitor your 3D Printer with live video streaming (compatible camera required) \nGet email and push notifications of your print status \nAutomatic security & slicer updates on the cloud, so you have no software (or maintenance) to deal with\nAn app store that can extend the capabilities of your 3D Printer (much like the apps on your smartphone)\nAccess your print history and trends (i.e: analytics)\nNo need for a laptop/computer to be connected to your printer \nResponsive, mobile friendly and works on any web enabled device \nSimple, clean, intuitive interface \nIntelligent slicing that learns your printing habits and improves your prints over time\nNot to mention, you\u2019ll have IMMEDIATE access to all of the 3D Printing apps on our app marketplace.  \nThis lets you tap into the creativity of developers who have developed 3D Printing apps just for you.\nYou'll be able to extend the capabilities of your 3D Printer by installing apps on your Touch as easily as you install apps on your smartphone.\nWhich means, the capabilities of the Touch are infinitely extendable. \nLet's get to how the AstroBox Touch benefits Developers. \nAre you a developer?\nIf so, you\u2019ll get first dibs into our API when it is released with the AstroBox Touch.\nJust like the early days of Google Play and the Apple App Store - early developers on those platforms got a massive, DISPROPORTIONATE advantage as they were able to capitalize on the inevitable growth and network effects.\nWe are confident that a similar story will transpire with consumer 3D Printing.\nSince AstroPrint is the fastest growing cloud platform for consumer 3D Printing, it is certainly the best place to develop your 3D Printing apps and reach 3D Printer owners. \nThe AstroBox Touch software is brand new, built on an open source framework (called Ionic) and runs on the Raspberry Pi as a native app.\nSince we will be using this open source framework for the AstroBox Touch -- it is very developer friendly.\nHere\u2019s why that\u2019s important: You will be able to make 3D Printing related apps using just Javascript, CSS, HTML, and deploy it on our platform.\nYou'll literally be able to make your app available to ALL of our users who own 3D Printers. \nThat's power. \nYour app will be IMMEDIATELY accessible on every AstroBox Touch.\nAlso, if you develop an app for the AstroPrint.com web portal, it will get in front of our 23K+ 3D Printer owners that use this portal for managing their printers.\nAt a glance, these are some of the capabilities of our API:\nCreating web socket connections into any 3D Printer \nRunning slicing jobs though our cloud slicing engine\nManaging print queues\nCreating payment flows\nImporting/Exporting models/STLs\nAccessing cameras (with permission of course!)\nand more.\nPotential ideas for apps: Apps that let people browse and 3D Print models, improve on 3DP workflow (i.e: file repair, auto positioning etc.), improve maintenance tasks (e.g. plate leveling, filament loading), or add 3DP functionality to your existing web application.\nIf you release your app on our platform, it will be available to all of our users across all devices (Desktop & Mobile).\nThe AstroPrint API has limitless potential as our platform is the fastest growing cloud platform for consumer 3D Printing. \nWe believe our platform is much like the early days of Google Play or the Apple App Store. (Request API Access)\nAre you a 3D Printer Manufacturer?\nIf you are a 3D Printer Manufacturer, let us focus on the software (after all, that\u2019s OUR expertise).\nWe can make your 3D Printer cloud connected and wireless and save you a lot of hassle and money.\nBy integrating AstroPrint with your printer(s) - both YOU and YOUR customers will benefit massively.\nFor example, with AstroPrint:\nThere\u2019s no need for your customers to deal with pesky cables or SD cards \nThere\u2019s no need to develop and maintain a complex cloud infrastructure (we already built it!) \nCustomers will be able to wirelessly manage their printer from anywhere with any device \nYour customers will be connected to one of the most powerful cloud platforms for 3D Printing which includes a suite of mobile apps, desktop apps and an ever expanding library of 3D Printing apps developed via our public API.\nIn short, you focus on what you are best at (hardware) and let us worry about what we are best at (software) -- and together, we can partner up and make 3D Printing even simpler for the end user.\nWe also have the capability to build you a custom, fully branded (with your company name and logo) build of the AstroBox Touch software. You can get a special introductory rate during this Kickstarter (via the associated Reward Tier), or contact us to get more information.\nWhat\u2019s so great about the AstroPrint Platform?\nWe believe that your 3D printer should be super simple to use.\nWe are not quite at that point yet, but we are getting closer everyday.\nAstroPrint is a suite of software products all designed to make 3D printing incredibly simple. \nIt is our mission to standardize the software for the 3D printing industry in the same way that Android standardized the software for much of the smartphone industry. \nThis allows more people to adopt and take advantage of 3D printing technologies by bringing their creativity to life. \nSome obvious key benefits of AstroPrint:\nWireless management & monitoring of your 3D Printer (No pesky cables or SD Cards!) \nCompatible with Marlin, Repetier, and Sailfish firmware based printers \nAbility to save and create custom slicer settings \nFile Manager and folders for organizing your file(s) \nAn app store that can extend the capabilities of your 3D Printer even more\nPrint history, trends, and stats of your prints \nPrint notification(s) by email and/or push notifications of print status\nAutomatic slicer updates in the cloud, so you do not have to deal with software (or maintenance) upgrades\nNo need for a laptop/computer to be connected to your printer \nResponsive, mobile friendly, and works on any web enabled device \nSimple, clean, intuitive interface \nIntelligent slicing that learns your printing habits and improves your prints over time\nReal time video remote monitoring of your prints from any device (you'll need a compatible camera - which is not included with this Kickstarter)\nThose are the main benefits\u2026\nThere's a few more \"not so obvious\" features:\nCustom Manufacturer Presets: The AstroPrint slicer routes slicing jobs through the best slicing engine and settings for your specific 3D Printer.  This is PRE-PROGRAMMED into the system directly by your printer manufacturer. (Of course, you still have the option to tinker and tweak with advanced settings.)\nPlug & Play Slicing Engines: The slicing engine is modular.  This means with a click of a button you can use Cura, Slic3r, or a proprietary slicing engine (if applicable). As new slicing engines become available, they can be added easily like lego blocks.\nThe app store: Using our API, anyone can submit apps to the AstroPrint app store. The app store is accessible by any user who is on the platform. Several apps have already been submitted (like Leopoly, 3D Slash, Materialise etc.) and more are in development by third parties.\nThe Team\nMeet the team!  \nWe're 10 strong and are on a mission to make 3D printing simple and accessible to EVERYONE. \nSeriously, when we aren't eating tapas or paella - our entire life is dedicated to making 3D Printing simple. \nAstroPrint developers (in Malaga, Spain) working hard to help you 3D Print stuff with more ease\nReward(s) Summary\n  Technical Specifications\nDelivery Timeline\n  Your pledge will help us finish the AstroBox Touch, Mobile Apps & Astroprint Desktop\nThanks For Your Support!\nWe sincerely appreciate your support in bringing the AstroBox Touch to the world \u2764\ufe0f\nWe have one last favor to ask you...\nPlease consider sharing this campaign with your friends and followers and help us spread the word!\nYou can do that very easily by clicking one of the following links: \nShare this on Twitter to help spread the word about this campaign!\n  Share this on Facebook to help spread the word about this campaign!\n  ....you can also download this short clip and post it on your Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook:\nThe AstroBox Touch Kickstarter Trailer (0:54 seconds, 9 MB)\nThanks again!\nWe Love You!  \u2764\ufe0f\n-The AstroPrint Team\nThank you with the bottom of our hearts for your support!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSupply chain and logistics: We have already verified bulk pricing of each physical component through multiple distributors. \n\nThis includes tooling and injection molding for product cases (where applicable). \n\nHowever, unforeseen complications from manufacturers and distributors may cause delayed delivery.\n\nThe list of printers that we can support is dependent on how open the format is for each printer. \n\nIf your printer is open source, AstroPrint should already work with it.

Every time we do laundry, our clothes shed tiny microfibers (including plastic), which go down the drains of our washing machines, through wastewater treatment facilities and into our waterways.\nEveryone who wears and washes clothes is part of this pollution. Everyone who eats or breathes could suffer the consequences. Learn more about the problem of microfiber pollution here. \nThis is a 120x magnified image of clothing microfibers filtered from washing machine effluent. One study found that a single fleece jacket could shed as many as 250,000 individual fibers per wash.\nOur team learned about the microfiber problem while working on marine debris along the US East Coast. It became clear very quickly that this could be the biggest pollution problem facing our ocean. We knew we needed a solution, and the ocean itself helped us come up with one.\nDesign Inspired by Nature\nMost washing machines do not have filters. The ones that do are only good to keep keys and coins from clogging your pipes. A standard filter cannot do what needs to be done: catch fibers too small for the human eye to see AND allow water flow.\nSo, we turned to nature. Coral does exactly what we need; it catches tiny things from flowing water.\nYou just drop, or throw it into your washing machine (any washing machine - front or top loaders, with and without center spindles) and do your wash as usual. It is easy to use and easy to clean.\nCora swooshes around in the laundry and just like coral, allows water to flow, while picking up those little pieces of microfiber and catching them in her stalks.\nWhen you take it out of the washer or dryer, have a look. When you see clumps of fuzz, just pull them out and put them in the trash bin along with your dryer lint. \nThis is the fuzz recovered from one load of doggie towels and blankets.\nThe Cora Ball was designed as an equal opportunity fiber catcher, helping you protect our public waterways from a host of potentially harmful materials and chemicals. In the US, our clothes are 60% plastic. The rest may be made from natural materials, but they are often covered in dyes, heavy metals and other chemicals. So, it makes sense to catch all of this manmade material before it ends up throughout the marine ecosystem, in the bellies of fish, and ultimately, on our plates.\nWe are working hard to find opportunities to upcycle or recycle the fuzz from your Cora Ball, the primary obstacle being the mixed-material nature of laundry lint (polyesters, nylons, polypropylene, cotton, wool, etc.). For now the trash is much better than the nearest river, lake or bay.\nThe Cora Ball will be made from 100% recycled plastic, both post-consumer and from manufacturing (would have gone to landfill). It is 100% recyclable and made in the USA (Vermont). Since we are using 100% recycled material, we have to go with whatever is out there. Most of it will be black, but every now and then, we will find a source for a color. So, the color of your Cora Ball will be a surprise of mostly black with either a clump of color or stripes.\nOur design is getting the attention of industry experts, featured at innovation events and in a variety of media:\nProtecting the Ocean with Each Laundry Load\nThis is about small collective actions having the power to achieve big results. If 10% of US households use a Cora Ball, we can keep the plastic equivalent of over 30 million water bottles from washing into our public waterways every year. That is enough water bottles to reach from New York City to London.\nYour use of a Cora Ball protects both air and water. The Cora ball's design collects microfibers until you remove them and put them in the trash. That means they will not re-attach to clothing and fly off into the air - only to become run-off and end up in our public waterways anyway.\n Cora Ball Backer Rewards\nAs a backer, you will be first to receive your Cora Ball(s) making you an early adopter of this solution to microfiber pollution. And, you\u2019ll get to share with friends, family and neighbors! \nBeyond the Cora, we have some additional rewards exclusive to the Kickstarter Community:\nInvitation to join our Innovation Team: we want this to be the best microfiber catching device it can be, innovation team members will receive insider communications and opportunities to do specific tests and provide feedback to help us strengthen and improve our design. \nJoin us on American Promise: Our work on Rozalia Project's oceanographic research vessel, American Promise, played a vital role in learning about the problem of microfiber pollution and developing a solution. She is a very special boat; a world-record holder and the greenest sailing research vessel in the world. Our top reward levels offer opportunities for a personalized tour, lunch or dinner with the captain, crew and at least one member of the Cora Ball inventor team and, at the $5,000 level, a full weekend as part of the crew working to protect the ocean on the Gulf of Maine. Read more about this extraordinary boat here and watch videos from various expeditions here.\nThe team behind the Cora Ball is all about ocean protection. We\u2019ve been on the case for 7 years and it was during this work that the Cora Ball was born. \nBrooke Winslow, our Technical Designer, at work.\nNot only have we developed a consumer solution to microfiber pollution, but we are working hard to better understand the problem as well. We conducted the first mountains to the sea microfiber study, sampling the entire Hudson River from the Adirondack Mountains to New York Harbor where the river meets the sea (video below) because we know that the better we understand a problem, the stronger our solution.\nPLAY\n\nThis is a true social enterprise: the success of the Cora Ball first and foremost means a cleaner ocean; secondly, proceeds support Rozalia Project\u2019s work cleaning and protecting the ocean and developing and implementing more solutions to the problem of marine debris. Learn more about Rozalia Project.\n The Technology Behind the Cora Ball\nMaterial: Made from 100% recycled and 100% recyclable plastic in the USA.\nRange of use: Useable in your washer and dryer. We've researched the high and low temperature settings in washers and dryers and selected a material that maintains its integrity within these ranges.\nEffectiveness: Catches up to 35% of the microfibers per load, per Cora Ball. The effectiveness depends on several factors including what items are in the load, wash settings and wash frequency. For maximum effectiveness, we recommend using 2-3 Cora Balls. We are constantly testing to learn how it works best and will always share our results.\nLimitations: The Cora Ball was designed to maximize both effectiveness and ease of use. Also, we wanted it to catch fibers from all of your clothes and textiles without having to separate. That said, we recommend that you do separate delicate items especially those with lace, tassels, crocheted sections or frayed threads, and do not wash them with your Cora Ball, as there is a chance they get caught in Cora's stalks.\nMagnified (125x) image of mixed fibers on a Cora Ball after a test load. Without the Cora Ball, these would have washed out the drain, through septic systems or wastewater treatment facilities and into our public waterways.\nYou will make this happen: This Kickstarter Campaign is the last piece of the puzzle, rather than the first. The molds are ordered, the patents filed.\nThis campaign is about production: As a backer, you will support the production of Cora Balls and help us get them to market faster. Getting them to market faster means we start protecting the ocean, its creatures and ultimately all of us, faster. \nWhat surpassing our initial goal means to this project\nThanks to a community of amazing backers and people who will make a small effort for big collective impact, we have far surpassed our initial funding goal. We want to share what that means for the Cora Ball, the ocean and Rozalia Project, and how hitting this campaign way out of the park makes a difference.\n1. It means a bigger impact protecting our ocean, lakes and rivers; the more people who have a Cora Ball, the sooner we start keeping microfiber out of our public waterways. And Kickstarter backers will get their Cora Balls first.\n2. A large community of backers demonstrates support that will allow us to develop stronger relationships with distribution partners who will get the Cora Ball to a broad market.\n3. Our initial $10,000 goal was the minimum it would take to go into production - this was the barest of minimums to make Cora Ball a reality - we would have been assembling them at the kitchen table. Exceeding that goal means a bigger first production run and correspondingly, a more efficient manufacturing and assembly process.\nWe are not going to mess around with stretch goals. We will keep spreading the word about this campaign and encourage participation. We will continue to work on streamlining our packaging and shipping plans. And we will keep in touch with you with updates as we bring the Cora Ball into the world and, together, make a difference.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we foresee has to do with the timing of getting Cora Balls out the door, rather than with making them in the first place.

Our experienced team has already developed a few working prototypes, which have been tested and perform well, providing us with feasibility of the product. This gives us confidence in SELFLY and its development.\nMini drones have become quite popular in recent years, and SELFLY is a very simple one, so the technological challenge isn\u2019t high. Since it uses existing technology in order to enable a new kind of mini drone use, compacting it into a phone case is possible to implement - we've done it!\nOur products prime purpose is providing the user with a convenient and available option of taking photos from a new different angle. The 1st pilot view video stream is recordable, but its primary purpose is to control the camera in order to choose the perfect angle for a selfie picture. Our drone is VERY stable, however, a 99$ product obviously does not include a stabilizing gimbal. If you are looking for a drone to capture professional stabilized video you will have to spend 600$ and more, this is beyond the scope of this product. \n\nWe do not aim to replace, nor compete with large and complex drones. However, if you are looking for a great affordable replacement for a selfie stick to take an exciting new angle for your photos, this is the product for you. \n\nSELFLY\u2019s main clip shows the target of the final product. With your support we will get there. Although we have several working prototypes, the current prototype is yet to include the full and final functionality and components to be included in the product, and in order to reach the manufacturing stage further development should be carried out. However, full functionality as described is fully feasible.\nOur subcontractors are well-known companies, and are quite experienced in the mini drone tech field, making our work plans and budget expectations well-planned in order to accurately estimate the development process through to shipping.\nWe are sure that our product will meet your expectations.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Be a SELFLY fan!", "descp": "Thank you for supporting us\nJoin us for updates, and news.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2017"}], "stat": ["58 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 99 or more", "title": "1 SELFLY Camera Kit", "descp": "Receive one SELfly Camera kit\nfor 99$ - Only on Kickstarter (Expected retail $139)\nAvailable for: iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy 7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Nexus 6.\nUniversal connector for all 4-6 inch mobile phones\n* You can choose your preferred phone model and color in a backer survey upon completion of the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,383 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "1 SELFLY Camera with two phone cases", "descp": "Receive one SELFLY Camera with 2 phone cases (any two models) for 109$ - Only on Kickstarter (Expected retail $149)\nAvailable for: iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy 7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Nexus 6.\nUniversal phone case for all 4-6 inch mobile phones\n* You can choose your preferred phone model and color in a backer survey upon completion of the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["355 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 119 or more", "title": "SELFLY Camera Kit + 1 SELFLY power bank", "descp": "One SELFLY Camera + one phone case (any model) + one SELFLY power bank\n(Expected retail $169)\nAvailable for: iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy 7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Nexus 6.\nUniversal connector for all 4-6 inch mobile phones\n* You can choose your preferred phone model and color in a backer survey upon completion of the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,539 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 185 or more", "title": "Double Pack - 2 SELFLY Camera Kits", "descp": "SELfly Double Pack - Receive two SELfly Camera kits.

The King Arthur Legend always made the list.  I have been inspired by this legend since I was a child and now I am excited to share this deck with you.   \nThe Arthur Legend is full of rich characters and a wide range of lore.  All this history makes it an ideal foundation for a playing card deck. Kings, Knights, Queens, Love, Betrayal, and Brotherhood are just a few of the themes that play out in this beloved story.  \nWhen I decided to capture the story of the Arthur Legend, I then picked an art style that has been attractive to me for years.  The art for this deck is a reflection of the Book of Kells.  The Book of Kells is a beautiful hand drawn and written illuminated manuscript that tells the story of the four Gospels of the Bible. This book was written around the same time as the origins of the King Arthur story.  This legend and art style are a perfect compliment to each other. \nFollow my Kickstarter for the next 30 days to watch this deck come to life.

That means ALL OF THE TUCKS WILL BE FOILED AND EMBOSSED! As some of you may now from my previous decks, the foiling and embossing is superb and a very nice touch to the decks.\n\nOur first stretch goal has been unlocked! That means ALL OF THE CARDS will be printed with color with metallic ink accents! The HANA Luxury Playing Cards Gold edition will have gold metallic ink and the Silver Edition will have silver metallic ink!\n      The Hana luxury playing cards is an original set of decks designed by Steve Minty. These decks are inspired by the unique elegance of traditional Japanese culture. Elements from aspects of textile, art, and social structures are incorporated into this deck along with my design sensibilities to make these different from what I have done before.\nAs always, I work on projects that I have a connection to on a personal level. I knew since I first started designing playing cards that I wanted to work on a deck that revolved around Japanese culture. To do so, I traveled to Japan to research as well as gain some insight and inspiration. It was an unforgettable experience but I merely scratched the surface. In the span of 3 years, I spent countless hours on research, scoured through books ranging from Japanese society to samurai armor and even attended a few museum exhibits for the sake of this project.\nInitially, I wanted to do something bold and very eye catching but I was not pleased with the looks I came up with as it was too garish. I took a step back and rethought my process on how to approach this project and through many drafts, I came up with what you see now.\nThis deck is more art centric than the decks I have done previously. It draws upon the history of playing cards in Japan as well as the art that makes them special. Aspects of Feudal Japan, Hana Fuda, Kimonos, Ikebana, Ukiyo-e among others are incorporated into the decks. I hope they have been not been lost in translate but most importantly, I hope you guys enjoy them as much as I enjoyed making them.\nBelow are examples of how the decks will look as well as court cards. Throughout the campaign, additional court cards will be revealed and explained on why they were chosen.  \n         Close up on the details for the art\n                Example of coins from the Muertos Campaign\nThis Gold 1\u00be\u201d Engraved Commemorative Coin can be used as a dealer button, card guard, display piece, or decision maker. The front side features the Geisha and the back features the Hana insignia!\nAdd a Gold Coin to any Reward for just $12! \nMeasures approx 22\" by 26 1/2\" Shipped seperately in a 25\"x3\" tube\nAdd an Uncut Sheet to any reward for $40.

Although there were some technical difficulties with the one of the printers and other issues, I've taken what I've learned from that experience and will apply a more efficient and effective process to allow for another successful campaign. As always, I have done a lot of research and followed up on a lot of companies to ensure that this project goes as smoothly as possible. \nThere may be the risks of the unforeseen but I have prepared myself enough with knowledge and research to minimize it if necessary. I listed the delivery date conservatively in order to not rush the production of the product.

It fits your switch without removing or swapping anything. No tools required.\n\u2022 Fits all switches: Switch Bot works with just about any rocker switch all over the world thanks to our innovative mechanisms.\n\u2022 Work with others: Switch Bot can be controlled by other smart devices like Amazon Echo, SmartThings, WeMo sensors and hundreds more. And APIs will be released.\n\u2022 Affordable: Add IoT (Internet of Things) to any device for $19.\n\u2022 Long battery life: Powered by a replaceable lithium battery with about 600 days of use.\n Meet Switch Bot\nSwitch Bot is a smart IoT robot to mechanically control all your switches and buttons.\nWe are constantly running from place to place, working to accomplish everything on our never-ending \u201cto-do\u201d list. If you\u2019re a person who is always on the go, convenience can be the biggest lifesaver and an added luxury or reprieve from daily stress. \nSwitch Bot is a small, automated device (controlled via app on your Android or iPhone) that turns devices in your home and office on and off.

You\u2019ll never have to worry about running home to turn the washing machine or dryer off, open the door for your children after school, or make your coffee in the morning. What\u2019s better than having one less thing to do, being able to hit that snooze button on your alarm to get a few extra winks of sleep?\n    You can turn on and off your light switch with one Switch Bot. Please find the demo video at the bottom of this page.\n They Love Us\n  How it works\n1. Download the free app (from Apple App Store or Google Play).  \n  2.

They should be affordable, last long, be easy to maintain, and specifically address YOUR foot problems, not global foot problems!\nOur 3-step ordering process uses an App which will take you less than a minute of your time to complete your order:  \n1.Take two pictures of your foot (Top and Side View)  \nAttach Third Picture (Bottom View: for Blisters/Sores/Ulcers)\nAttach Fourth Picture (Foot Stress Map: Wet your foot and step on a white paper) \n2.Select your foot Size/Add Extra Details \n3.Order Confirmation and Processing (Less than a day)\nWe DON'T create complex 3D foot models with 20+ pictures, as its a waste of your and our time!

The synthetic skin material (US Patent Pending 15/204,353) which can be range from ultra soft to hard, can be dispensed via nozzle attachments at specific sections of our insoles, using our proprietary manufacturing process.

Did you know that it was on the original ship that the Mayflower Compact was signed, our first \u201ccivil body politic\u201d?\nRenowned Naval architect William Avery Baker of M.I.T. (i.e. \u2018wicked smaht\u2019 guy), researched and designed the ship which was constructed at Upham Shipyard in Brixham, England between 1955 and 1957 using carefully researched methods and materials. Mayflower II is the same size as the original Mayflower and true to the look and spirit of the original. No other ship today can make this claim! \nSailed across the Atlantic in 1957 by a crew of 33 and accompanied by a LIFE magazine writer and photographer, she arrived to great fanfare and celebration by thousands of spectators, including Vice President Richard Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy. Completing this restoration means she will be able to sail again!  \nNearly 25 million people have stepped aboard since 1957. Mayflower II plays an essential role on the historic Plymouth waterfront, serving as a \u201cfloating classroom\u201d where thousands of schoolchildren and visitors every year are educated, inspired and entertained. What a wonderful way to learn about history!  \nThe story of the Mayflower remains a powerful, tangible piece of American history to all who encounter her through books, films, and most often, through a visit to Plimoth Plantation and Mayflower II.     \nSchoolchildren learn how the Mayflower sailed across the Atlantic and what daily life was like on board.\n  In 2013, routine work revealed deeper challenges to the ship\u2019s frame that could not be deferred to a later stage in the ship\u2019s already existing restoration plan. Work (and fundraising!) began immediately. The restoration plan includes three phases\u2014stabilization, major restoration and ongoing support and repairs. Some work has already been completed over the last two winters; the remaining work requires the ship to be in dry dock over a period of at least 30 months at Mystic Seaport\u2019s Henry B. duPont Preservation Shipyard. It is this remaining work that we are fundraising for today.   \nIn total, the project requires $12 million, which includes a reserve fund for future maintenance needs. $7.5 million is needed before the end of the 2016 in order to proceed with the final phase of restoration. A significant amount has already been raised. Plimoth Plantation will continue to solicit support from individuals, foundations and government agencies to ensure the goal will be met. \nFor the stories she tells, for the hope she inspires, for the freedoms she represents, and for the education she provides, Mayflower II is worth saving.

And thank you for looking at our project! We are Peter Dunham and Linnea Gits, the designers and artists behind the Chicago design studio, Uusi and we are incredibly excited to introduce our project to you: an entirely hand-painted deck of tarot and poker cards called \"BRuT.\"\nBRuT: A modern tarot. At Uusi we are deep lovers of everyday objects that are useful and practical. If they can also be beautiful \u2013 all the better! But if an object can somehow be just a little bit magical to boot, oh my gosh, what an incredible delight!! Thus our fascination with playing cards and tarots and our desire to reinterpret them for a modern world.\nUusi and the tarot.  About three years ago when our design studio took on the challenge to design six entirely unique, Limited Edition playing card decks all featuring original, hand-drawn artwork we began collecting decks from around the world to study and draw inspiration from. In our journey through this multitudinous genre some of the most beautiful, artistic and imaginative decks that we came across were tarot decks. We knew as soon as we saw these decks we would someday want to make one ourselves.\nAlong with their fantastical imagery, the tarot's charm was also it's unusual size. Standard tarot decks are typically created using an oversize format and though sizes vary, the one we chose for BRuT \u2013 60mm x 110mm \u2013  is about an inch longer and almost the same width as a standard poker-sized deck. This extra length works elegantly to enhance the look and feel of the artwork allowing it to come alive in your hand like no other deck can and creates the perfect mini canvas, so-to-speak, for art. Add to this our tarot deck will be printed on premium, Master Finish card stock with a linen finish and you have one beautiful and highly playable deck. \nIn many ways we feel the tarot is the perfect deck. Not only does its size make it a beautiful object to look at, but one in which you can play a multitude of games. Aside from the original game of Tarot, (a trick-taking game that is a lot like Bridge), if you remove the Cavaliers and Trump cards you can play just about any game that you would normally play with a standard deck of cards.\nBRuT Inspiration. The artwork for our BRuT tarot was inspired by Early 20th Century Modernism, Art Brut (or Outsider Art) and the forceful, geometric look of Brut Architecture. The symbolic imagery in our trump cards are loosely based on the early Marseilles Tarot from the 1700's.  All imagery in this deck was hand-painted using gouache \u2013 a type of watercolor medium that is similar to watercolor but more highly pigmented.\nThe Future Enters Us. Finally, as a divination medium the tarot can be a powerful, meditative tool that allows the future to step inside you. Though few of us are gifted with telepathic powers, learning about and understanding these universal symbols and their meaning can be a powerful, reflective experience that teaches you to know yourself better, which in turn will naturally reveal the truth inside and ahead.  A tarot is the perfect deck to find the secret passageways to the eternal future and as the old, masonic saying goes, \"If you follow the secret way, you will find the shortest road.\"  Let's follow this road together and make BRuT happen!!!\nWhere are the cups, coins, wands and swords for the courts? This was a tough decision for us, but ultimately we chose to use the modern, French suits for our courts instead of the older Latin suits as we wanted this deck to be as multifunctional as possible.  A well used deck has a power all it's own \u2013 we all have our favorite \u2013 and this change helped to expand the function of the deck and move the tarot into our every day lives. \nThe French suits also hold meaning beyond their graphic design service on the cards and can just as easily contain content as powerful as the older, Latin symbols. We will expand on the French suit symbols and meaning later in the project.\n                 **All court cards will be revealed during the project.\nThe imagery for the twenty-one BRuT trump cards is based on the early, Marseilles tarot from the 1700's.  At Uusi we wanted to give a fresh take to this tarot classic by adding bold graphics that playfully reference the divination symbols of the Marseilles Tarot.\nIn games as in divination tarots The Fool is a complex, powerful card. On the one hand this \"wild\" card reminds us of how little we actually control in the world and that the wisest response to this chaos is to relax into it and try not to manage that which we have no power over.  On the other hand, it warns of blindly giving in to the fates for as the old saying goes: \"The wise man rules his stars, the fool obeys them.\" \nOur fool is a classic jester \u2013 a dreamer \u2013 paying little attention to that which surrounds him. If not for his animal companion, a cat who is there to warn and brutally awaken him with an urgent,\"reality bite,\" he could easily get lost in the world. And nothing, not even angels, protects those who lose themselves.\nAt Uusi we were the first designers to create and introduce the diptych ad cards to custom playing card decks. With the BRuT tarot we are switching it up a bit and taking advantage of the elegant size this longer card stock offers and are making it a triptych!   \nThe scene on the card depicts Hercules wrestling with a lion.  In our version of this classic scene Hercules has his hand thrust down the lions mouth.  He is literally reaching into the jaws of fate and controlling his own destiny against staggering odds.  This is our eternal struggle in the world and if we participate in it fearlessly and fully we are destined for a new birth.\nA complex, mystical yet thoroughly modern design weaves it way across the back of our cards creating an almost hypnotic pattern.\nOur BRuT tuck boxes will be created with an extra heavy paper stock to safely hold and beautifully display the tarot deck inside.  Designed to have a modernist meets mystical flare it is the perfect packaging to enter into the Future with ;)\nBRuT LIMITED EDITION POKER DECK! We have created a bonus Uusi playing card deck for this project.  It is a companion, Limited Edition BRuT poker deck with all the same courts as the Tarot minus the beautiful Trump cards and Cavaliers, but just as much fun to play with! PLUS \u2013 if you get both decks \u2013 all that powerful juju of it's Mother tarot deck will rub off on it making you an unstoppable, gaming force!\n**Brut poker cards will share the same back design as the tarot cards.\n*All images of the deck and tuck boxes you see in these photos are prototypes made at Uusi's studio. The finished product may vary slightly from what you see here \u2013 backers will be kept up-to-date of any minor changes that may occur. The overall design and theme will remain UNCHANGED throughout the funding and printing process.\n Seventy-eight tarot cards, one fool card all with original, eye-catching artwork.\nOne illustrated, Uusi Ad Card.\nCard dimension: 60mm x 110mm\nPrinted by The Expert Playing Card Company (EPCC).\nPrinted on premium, Master Finish playing card stock with a linen finish.\nHeavy, premium paper for the tucks with an embossed linen finish.\nFifty-two playing cards and two jokers all with original, eye-catching artwork that makes them ideal for magic and card games, yet at the same time very familiar and immediately recognizable by players and spectators alike.\nPrinted by The Expert Playing Card Company (EPCC)\nLimited Edition of 5000.\nPrinted on Master Finish card stock with a linen finish.\nPremium paper for the tuck box.\nAt Uusi we have been designing and producing Limited Edition decks for over three years now and with each deck we create we strive to maintain a high level of artistry and craftsmanship.

Each deck is hand-gilded with pure copper or gold leaf \u2013 this is NOT a sprayed on foil or simulated metal \u2013 by Peter Dunham using a 400+ year-old traditional gilding process. An exceptionally high level of craftsmanship is applied to this Fine Art process to ensure that each gilded deck is not only beautiful to look at but also to play with.\n*View more images of our gilded decks here.\nBRuT Gilded Poker Deck and Two Deck Box. This handsome and highly coveted case was originally introduced in our \"Uusi Classic\" deck project and we have brought it back one last time for BRuT!

Boards from these towers were originally milled from trees that were 300+ years-old making the graining and color of each case incredibly beautiful and unique. Each case will have either a gilded copper leaf or 24KT gold leaf bottom to reflect the either 24KT gold leaf or copper leaf, gilded poker deck inside.\n*Please note: Though the picture above shows two copper gilded decks this box comes with one gilded poker deck and one deck without gilding.\nBRuT TAROT Gilded Deck and Box.

This delay was caused by our addition of the 9 panoramic cards in the deck.  A special die had to be created for the tuck to accommodate the added cards in the deck and the cards themselves had to be designed and painted.  This was a special addition that we really wanted to offer to everyone for your awesome support of our project and we are sorry it caused a delay, but we know the added cards truly made the deck unique for you."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "\"Burt\"?

We love 3D printing and all the doors it opens, but we don\u2019t like our printers. It seems like every day something jams, breaks, shifts, or fails. Even when our printers do work, they need fine-tuning to print well. All in all, we probably spend more time working on our printers than on our inventions.\nSure, there are some high-end machines out there that consistently work well\u2014but why do they have to be so expensive?\nGo into a store with $179 and see what you can get. A microwave, a mini-fridge, a vacuum, etc. All of these products are pretty complicated, and no one expects them to require fixing every week. We believe a 3D printer shouldn't be any different.\nThat\u2019s why we designed Tiko.\nTiko is a 3D printer unlike any before it. We meticulously designed every piece of it to make it high quality and easy to use, while keeping costs down in order to achieve a great price. So, what makes Tiko different?\nMost 3D printers have a multipart frame. These are bulky, difficult to assemble, and easily damaged. This is where Tiko is fundamentally different. Tiko is unibody. That means the whole frame is one piece, introducing an amazing array of benefits. Easy to manufacture. Virtually impossible to misalign. That's how you get a quality 3D printer for $179.\nTiko is a delta 3D printer with three sets of arms moving in unison to control the movement of the print head (more on this later). The essence of Tiko\u2019s innovation is our discovery that delta is the ideal configuration to unlock the many benefits of unibody.\nFrom the very beginning, we were determined to make an accurate printer. Tiko\u2019s unibody construction and delta mechanism have been carefully designed to deliver exceptionally high mechanical repeatability without the need for high-precision components. That\u2019s right, you heard us. Even without high-precision components, Tiko is still able to print incredibly consistent layers. \nTiko printed the vase pictured above at a 200 micron-resolution, but it can print as fine as 50 microns.\nThanks to unibody, Tiko is also enclosed. Whereas most 3D printers have problems with warping prints, Tiko\u2019s enclosed print chamber means that prints are isolated from the outside environment, resulting in strong and consistent print results, even when the wind blows.\nTiko\u2019s slender unibody frame, delta mechanism, and ultra-compact liquefier/end-effector enable it to print objects far larger than any similarly sized 3D printer.\nLike most delta printers, we started with a circular print volume. But we wanted more than that, so we expanded Tiko\u2019s print volume into the corners for those extra-long prints, maximizing space efficiency.\nNot only can you print large objects, you can actually remove them easily, too. Tiko\u2019s print bed is flexible, so once your print is done, you simply lift the printer off the bed, then twist to pop off your print. \nAnd with the specially-formulated coating on Tiko's print bed, prints adhere consistently. No more scraping, no blue painter\u2019s tape, and no glue stick shenanigans either.\nYou know what else is flexible? Your choice of filament. Tiko uses non-proprietary 1.75mm filament on a standard 1kg 165mm (6.5 in.) diameter spool, so you can experiment with different materials. Tiko also detects when you\u2019re out of filament and pauses the print so you can reload and resume. \nWires are so 1996. Connect Tiko to the cloud, and you can print from almost anywhere, even from your smartphone. No Wi-Fi? Tiko makes its own wireless access point so you can print directly, too.  \nTiko\u2019s browser-based software is super user-friendly. We\u2019ve already optimized Tiko\u2019s performance, leaving only a few straightforward settings so you can spend more time on your ideas and leave the printing to Tiko.\nTiko\u2019s enclosed build chamber also means children and pets can\u2019t interfere with the liquefier, a small but dangerously hot component that is typically left exposed in other 3D printers. Taking things a step further, Tiko has an onboard accelerometer that automatically shuts the printer down if it\u2019s disturbed.\nThis same accelerometer is used for auto calibration, plus something even cooler. Tiko can measure its own performance, so with your permission, we can use performance data from your printer to help make every Tiko better. This will help us improve our firmware and slicing engine AND keep your Tiko running at peak performance. Everybody wins!\nTiko\u2019s unibody construction also makes it incredibly strong. The stiffness of the frame improves print quality while making Tiko durable and easy to ship.\nBut even with all that strength, unibody makes Tiko surprisingly lightweight.\nBy now you might be wondering: How can a 3D printer this good, with all these features, cost so little? Well, it wasn\u2019t easy. But if you\u2019re not afraid to geek out, neither are we...\nYou emailed us, you asked us technical questions, and we\u2019re happy to deliver. Right off the bat, there are a few things you should know:\n1) Tiko has almost no parts in common with any other 3D printer in the world. Period. With a few exceptions, every component inside Tiko is a bespoke part designed for rapid and inexpensive manufacture.\n2) Every component you see below is a generation or two behind where we actually are. We are in a highly competitive field with rampant product-cloning, so we hold our intellectual property very close to the vest, and a number of these technologies are patent-pending. These older parts worked well, and they\u2019re similar to what\u2019s in the final Tiko, but the latest generation is even better. And secret!\nNow let's get technical...\nONCE AGAIN, UNIBODY\nIt all started with unibody. In most 3D printers, the most expensive (by far) item is the frame. That\u2019s because most 3D printers have a frame built from multiple beams that are fastened together. In delta printers, this frame is often made from three vertical extruded-aluminum beams. We had a simple thought\u2026 what if we extruded all three rails together?\nJust like that, we had it. A unibody chassis. Strong, lightweight, virtually impossible to misalign, but also one we could extrude by the mile at a very low cost. Being made of one piece means no assembly is needed\u2014no fasteners, no alignments, none of that.\nIt\u2019s a simple concept, but an enormous leap forward. And it's only the beginning.\nDELTA\nDeltas really do it better. We don\u2019t want to lecture you on robot kinematics, but it\u2019s no secret that parallel manipulators are inherently more accurate than their gantry/serial counterparts. We\u2019ve said it twice, and we\u2019re proud to say it again. Tiko does not use high-precision mechanical components. Why not?\nBecause we don\u2019t need to! Tiko\u2019s low-part-count parallel-arm mechanism has consistently demonstrated exceptional mechanical repeatability without the use of high-precision rails and linear bearings. That means we can manufacture Tiko using consumer-grade tolerances and relatively simple parts, rather than the crazy-expensive CNC-machine components found in other 3D printers.\nDIRECT-DRIVE SYSTEM\nHaving developed an inexpensive chassis and rails, we didn't want to mess it up with a complicated drive system. Most 3D printers use an eye-popping arrangement of belts, pulleys, and tensioners. Instead, we developed a proprietary direct-drive system in which the motors are mounted onto carriages that drive themselves directly along the rails.\n\nSimple, reliable, and super-inexpensive to make. How we integrated the gear racks into the rails during production, however, is our secret. \nNOTE: Don't worry, we abandoned the above pictured NEMA-14\u2019s ages ago. They were expensive, heavy, and noisy. Tiko now uses a completely different type of motor that has proven far more suitable, and you wouldn\u2019t believe how little it costs. This alone had a major impact on our pricing.\nCUSTOM ELECTRONICS\nOnce we had perfected Tiko\u2019s mechanics, the electronics became the most expensive part of the printer. Most 3D printers use hobbyist electronics, which are great for tinkering but overpriced and underpowered for a consumer-grade product. So, we developed our own.\nTiko\u2019s electronics employ carefully chosen surface-mount components that are optimized for mass manufacture. These make Tiko faster and smarter, while costing less.\nFurthermore, Tiko\u2019s high-efficiency liquefier and motors use only a fraction of the energy required by most 3D printers. This allowed us to use smaller and less expensive electronic components and a standard \u201cbrick\u201d power adapter instead of a bulky PSU, which further reduced costs.\nPASSIVE-COOLED LIQUEFIER\nLastly, there is Tiko\u2019s liquefier assembly. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the only liquefier in the world that can extrude PLA without active cooling\u2014and in an enclosed space at that.\n\nWe spent close to a year getting it right. Why did we bother? Because cooling fans are expensive. Aside from the fan itself, you need a finned heatsink, the wiring to the PCB, the PWM output to drive it, and the added assembly steps to install and wire it in. There\u2019s also the noise, the size (which would compromise print volume) and the problem of dust collecting in the fan/heatsink.\n\nTiko\u2019s one-of-a-kind passive cooled liquefier solves all of these problems, and it's compact, energy efficient, and inexpensive to manufacture.\nAt its core are the carefully designed convection-optimizing heat vents. These vents maximize the upward flow of hot air while shielding the heatsink. The exact specifications are secret, but Tiko's liquefier maintains a remarkably low inlet temperature without any forced airflow\u2014even inside a warm print chamber.\n\nBy incorporating the heat shield into an injection-moldable end effector with integrated ball joints and making a geometrically simple heatsink without any fins, we dropped costs even further.\nTITANIUM NOZZLE\nAchieving our demanding thermal performance criteria also required the use of a one-of-a-kind aerospace-grade Titanium alloy nozzle. The nozzle minimizes conduction to the heatsink without the need for an insulating barrel. The reduced heat flux results in a nozzle that requires very little energy to maintain its temperature, making it exceptionally energy efficient.\nNotice how quickly the temperature drops off. We freakin' LOVE Titanium!\nThis unique nozzle makes for an extremely compact and efficient liquefier, which gives Tiko excellent extrusion control while enabling trouble-free nozzle changing, as no molten filament ever comes into contact with the threads. It also improves print quality by minimizing the effects of radial disturbances in the carriage. \nBut isn't Titanium expensive? Sure it is, but by making the components so small, it actually reduced our costs.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nTiko\u2019s cutting-edge technologies and bespoke parts give it a completely different cost structure than any other 3D printer. It wasn't easy, but we did it, and now we're really excited to take the next step and bring Tiko to you.\nNow for $179, you can have a Tiko. What you create with it is up to you.\nAnd first movers can get a Tiko at our limited Earliest Bird ($99) and Early Bird ($139) prices.\nIf you want multiple Tikos\u2014for your whole family or a school or to simply print more things at the same time\u2014multiply $179 by the number you want and set that as your pledge amount (Example: 3 x $179 = $537 for three Tikos). \nNOTE: Multi-Tiko pledges will only be counted in multiples of $179. Earliest/Early Bird prices are limited to one-per-backer.\nOne of the questions we get asked most is, \u201cCan you use your 3D printer to print another 3D printer?\" Well, kind of! For an $18 pledge, you can get a 1/10th scale Baby Tiko Unibody\u2026 that was printed by a Tiko!\nAnd for any pledge amount, you'll be helping make 3D printing accessible and dependable for a new population of inventors who haven't had easy access before now. We'll keep you informed of our progress through consistent campaign updates, and over time we'll share creations from around the world that came to life thanks to your support. \nFULFILLMENT\nWe\u2019ve been working on Tiko for over a year. During that time, we\u2019ve gone through many iterations, developed some remarkable technologies, and created a strong network of manufacturers to form a solid supply chain. With your help, we can initiate the following steps to bring Tiko to you\u2026\nSHIPPING\nIn order to make sure that all backer information is up-to-date so we can ensure fair rates, we will collect shipping fees when we send backer surveys this Fall. Exact shipping rates will vary depending on destination, but will not exceed $65 USD per Tiko.\nTiko rewards will be shipped according to Kickstarter pledge order, starting this November. If you want your Tiko soon, you should move fast!\nWhat is it about us that makes us so different? How were we able to build Tiko, and why are we the ones to deliver? Let\u2019s get better acquainted.\nMatt Gajkowski (Center)\nMatt was born and raised to be an entrepeneur. He believes in simplicity and relentless progress, and he isn't afraid to challenge established ideas. He is the mind behind Tiko's groundbreaking technologies and the muscle that has brought them to market. Matt worked as a freelance product designer before starting Tiko. He now has a vision for the future of 3D printing and the know-how to realize it.\nSharon Charitar (Left)\nSharon gets things done. She handles Tiko's market research, community management, PR, bookkeeping, etc. You name it, she's done it, expertly. An analyst at heart, Sharon finds data that we use to improve our business and our product. She is the glue that holds all of Tiko's operations together and keeps us running smoothly and efficiently.\nMichael Zhang (Right)\nMichael was born in China and moved to Canada at age 12. He is fluent in Mandarin and has many connections back home. Michael leverages this, along with his sharp technical skill set, to work with experienced manufacturers without language or technical barriers. This enabled us to find new ways to manufacture Tiko's bespoke parts and push the envelope on Tiko's performance while reducing manufacturing costs.\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to bring Tiko to this stage, but we couldn\u2019t have done it alone. It was through the patience, support, and enthusiasm of some amazing partners that we\u2019ve made it this far.\nSpark Centre is a non-profit support organization that helps entrepreneurs bring innovative technologies to market. A passionate team, they have supported us since day one. They are the minds behind the $25,000 Ignite competition and the Thrive accelerator program. Before we met Spark, our prototype was held together with tape and popsicle sticks. If you have an idea, talk to them!\nFallon StarterKit takes the same top creative talent that works on Fallon\u2019s high-profile ad campaigns and lets them create crowdfunding campaigns for select projects. Boy are we glad they selected us! This campaign is the result of our extraordinary partnership with Fallon.\nThere are numerous other amazing companies we\u2019ve worked with for manufacturing, legal, accounting, etc. Building a printer is one thing, building a company is another, and it\u2019s because of their hard work that Tiko is ready for you.\nTiko has the potential to make innovation accessible, and we still have many more technologies we look forward to developing. But we can\u2019t do it alone. In the age of Kickstarter, YOU have the power to decide which technologies become realized. With Tiko, we want to return the favor by giving you the power to create. \n\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Tiko is only as good as its parts, and up until now, all of those parts have been prototyped using 3D printing and machining. In production, our parts will be made using injection molding and other processes, which means they'll have different tolerances and mechanical properties than those we\u2019ve prototyped. If any of these changes compromises performance, we will have to go back and tool them again. This is not a fast process.\n\nFurthermore, we will not release a printer that doesn't meet our high standards, so we'll run endurance tests on every single aspect of Tiko until it's ready. This too, takes time. If something doesn\u2019t pass, it has to be analyzed, fixed, re-tooled, and re-tested.\n\nYou get the idea\u2014perfecting groundbreaking technologies isn't a quick or easy process. As a result, our biggest challenge is getting it right quickly. We don\u2019t want to rush or it will show in the final product, but we also don\u2019t want you to wait a day more than necessary. We feel confident about our timeline, and we have expert manufacturing partners who are eager to speed up the process, but our biggest challenge is staying on schedule.\n\nOther than that, you can sit back and relax\u2014with Tiko, you\u2019re going to get everything you hoped for and then some!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Section 4 Compliance", "update_content": "Hello everyone,  \nIt has been quite some time since we last spoke, and it\u2019s time to bring you up to speed.

It's easy, REALLY fun, and you don\u2019t need an art degree (or a culinary one) to do it! \nDesigned to inspire, entertain, and bring out the creativity in both young and old at home, the PancakeBot is also a product with commercial durability to help your brand make a lasting impression and draw in more customers.\nFrom the whimsical dream of Miguel Valenzuela to make a pancake machine out of LEGO for his two daughters, the PancakeBot has evolved into a complete patent pending product capable of creating pancakes like never before.\nOur included user-friendly software allows you to design your own pancake by tracing any image right on your computer.  From your favorite piece of art or character, a child's drawing, a product image or your company or team logo, the software creates the file and the PancakeBot does the rest. As the artist, you control what lines are drawn first, which in turn lets you determine the shading of the pancake. \nIncluded Tracing Software\nOnce you have traced the image, the files can be stored on an SD card allowing you to print the designs you have created at anytime without having to ever re-trace the image.\nThe PancakeBot uses a patent pending batter dispensing system to \"print\" the batter onto the included griddle. By using a combination of compressed air and a vacuum, the PancakeBot controls where the batter is dispensed. Onboard controls let you fine tune the dispensing of the batter as it glides over the griddle.\nPrototype in action\nYou can even incorporate color into your PancakeBot creations by simply adding food coloring to the batter.\nPLAY\n\nFor family and friends \nPancakeBot aims to inspire both young and old to create and have fun with their food as well as develop interests in engineering, art, programming and food manufacturing through the use of technology. \nSo go ahead and impress your family and friends by printing out their favorite character, animal, team logo or design. Let your imagination run wild and create pancakes almost too good to eat! \nFor your customers \nThe PancakeBot is perfect for trade shows, cafes, restaurants, breakfast buffets, parties and anywhere else you want your customers to remember you. Let the PancakeBot make a lasting impression for your business by creating pancakes that make your customers feel special. Be unique and differentiate your brand with the PancakeBot.\nDIGITAL TRENDS: \"..be warned \u2014 it\u2019ll make your freehand pancake art pale in comparison.\"\nWIRED: \u201cIt is exactly as cool as it sounds.

One day, while reading Make magazine, Lily, Miguel\u2019s oldest daughter asked him what he was reading. He replied, \u201cI am reading about a guy that made a pancake stamping machine out of LEGO.\u201d Instantly Lily turned to her little sister Maia and said, \u201cPapa\u2019s going to build a Pancake Machine out of LEGO!\u201d and thus PancakeBot was born.\nMiguel worked on developing and improving various LEGO designs and printed his first successful pancakes after 6 months of development. The PancakeBot was first reveled to the public at the World Maker Faire in New York. The response and interest from the public was so great that Miguel decided to build a more advanced version.\nFastforward to 2014, when Miguel developed a more advanced acrylic version that was shown at the San Mateo Maker Faire and also the White House Maker Faire. The new more advanced version of the PancakeBot received even more publicity and interest. \nIn order to bring PancakeBot to kitchens around the world, Miguel partnered with StoreBound, a company with the skills and expertise necessary to bring a refined version of the product to market by mid 2015.\nMiguel Valenzuela is a husband, father, inventor and artist who daylights as a civil engineer. Currently living in Norway, he spends his time teaching kids about the maker movement, designing and building robots, and working with his daughters on new ideas.\nShipping within United States is included in your pledge. For international backers, please refer to the table below for fees and how to add it to your pledge. \nWe are now offering our lovely Kickstarter backers a pack which includes a holder and 4 extra dispenser bottles for only $19 (msrp $29).\nWhile a prototype has been developed for proof of concept, the funds raised will help us to:\nTweak the mechanics for better accuracy\nImprove software interface\nStylize the final design\nManufacture tooling and production\nComplete Certifications - UL, FDA, \nInspiring\nSince its inception, PancakeBot has been getting both kids and adults to smile, laugh, and enjoy both playing with and eating their food. Seen at Maker Faire's around the world, PancakeBot gets the young and old at heart to think, talk about technology, explore design, and connect with food all at the same time.\nPancakes and robots\nIf you like Pancakes and Robots, you\u2019ll love PancakeBot. PancakeBot is not just about making pancakes, it\u2019s about inspiring people to play with their food and explore how technology and robotics can be used in our everyday lives. PancakeBot seeks to pave way for future products and advancements that encourage us to be creative.  \nLastly, we would like to thank you for taking the time to view the PancakeBot\u2122.

Everything ranging from clumpy pancakes to gluten free. The main difference is typically batter viscosity. In order to address this, we have provided adjustments that allow you to change the air pressure in the dispenser to fine tune the dispensing of the batter.\n\nWe also provide a pancake recipe that has been used from the get-go which is a variation of Martha Stewarts Basic Pancake Recipe.\n\nWarranty \n\nWe provide a warranty on all of our products shipped and sold into the USA.

Three years ago you supported our vision to make the world\u2019s first real smartwatch. The Kickstarter community and our early adopters believed in us before anyone else even knew we existed. You blew us away with your support and kicked off a worldwide movement!\nWith your help, we set the bar very high:\nYour overwhelming support and feedback has shaped what Pebble is today. We\u2019re back on Kickstarter to give you - the community who cares the most - an opportunity to support our vision for wearables and get exclusive access to our newest product. \nGet more info at a glance...in color!\nAt its heart, Pebble Time is an awesome watch. The new color e-paper display is easy to read and always-on, perfect for displaying incoming notifications and your favorite watchface. Compared with display technology like LCD or OLED, power consumption is minimized, enabling Pebble Time to achieve an industry-leading battery life of up to 7 days.\nSend a quick reply by dictation\nPebble Time's new microphone lets you send voice replies to incoming notifications* or take short voice notes. We used the latest technology to maintain water resistance so you can swim or surf with Pebble Time (we do not, however, recommend talking underwater).\n*Sending voice replies works with most major Android apps including SMS, Hangouts, Gmail, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp and hundreds more. For iOS users, voice replies are currently limited to Gmail notifications. We\u2019re working to enable voice replies for more apps.\nPebble Time is 20% thinner than the original Pebble at just 9.5mm. Its ergonomic, curved design fits comfortably on either wrist and slides easily under dress shirts. \nPebble Time and Pebble Time Steel is stylish and durable. The lens is crafted from scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass with a bezel made of stainless steel. Like our previous watches, it's water resistant - perfect for a run in the rain, water-balloon battle or a swim.\nPeople love to personalize their Pebble watches. We've included a soft silicone band with each Pebble Time and a fine leather band for Pebble Time Steel, but any standard 22mm watch band will fit. All new Pebble watch bands include a quick-release pin, letting you swap bands in under 10 seconds. Now it's super easy to find the perfect style for you!\nFor DIYers, accessory makers and advanced customizers, we'll be publishing the 3D data you'll need to create amazing straps, covers and docks. \nPebble Time comes in three colors: \nBlack watch case and silicone band with black PVD stainless steel bezel\nWhite watch case and silicone band with silver PVD stainless steel bezel\nRed watch case and silicone band with black PVD stainless steel bezel\nPebble Time Steel is available in three stainless steel finishes:\n\nSilver with a stone leather band\nGunmetal black with a black leather band\nGold with red leather band\nAll Time Steels come with both a leather and matching metal band.\nSpecial Engraving for Kickstarter Backers\nAll reward watches are engraved with \u2018Kickstarter Edition\u2019. For those who are backing Pebble on Kickstarter for the second time - thank you! Your Pebble Time watch will be engraved with something extra special.\nWe've been making smartwatches for almost 7 years now. Our ultimate goal is to make Pebble an indispensable tool in your daily life by helping you accomplish more each and every day. \nWhile developing software for the original Pebble, we uncovered an important problem: apps are an inefficient way to interact with a smartwatch. As we increased functionality by adding more apps, our Pebbles clogged up. It became harder to quickly find the app we wanted. No one wants to manage another homescreen!\nTo make Pebble infinitely more useful, we needed an expandable system for organizing information and interactions. Luckily, the answer was right up our sleeves.\nIt turns out the best interface for any watch...is time!\nPLAY\n\nYou already plan your day around time, so it makes sense for your Pebble to be organized around the same principle. Now your notifications, news, reminders and events are laid out chronologically instead of being trapped inside separate apps.\nWith one click, see what\u2019s coming up next. Your timeline connects to calendars, alarms, and apps, organizing all kinds of relevant information along with quick actions. Similarly, recall the past. Scroll back in time to see that email you missed, your step count for the day or the score from the game last night. \nYour timeline takes an incredible amount of information and makes it super easy to access. \nThis is the new app menu, featuring new app faces with glanceable content. With timeline we've also created a system that dynamically loads and caches apps as needed, letting you access as many apps as you need.\nAs with all Pebble software, we\u2019ve built an open platform. You can allow apps and developers to add \u2018pins\u2019 to your timeline, so you can keep track of things like upcoming events, sports, weather, traffic, travel plans, pizza specials and more.\nThe Pebble operating system has been re-imagined with a new visual style. While all existing Pebble apps will still work great, we\u2019re inviting developers to upgrade their apps to support color. More details coming soon!\nSimplicity and focus, without compromise\nWe\u2019ve added all these new features - color screen, microphone, slimmer design and timeline - without compromising what you love most about Pebble:\nAlways-on, daylight readable screen with a great backlight\nUp to 7 day battery life (Time Steel battery life is up to 10 days)\nUse any standard 22mm watch band\nWater resistant and durable \nTactile buttons for easy eyes-free clicking \nSilent vibrating alarms\nStep tracking with Misfit and Jawbone\nLanguage and international character support (Chinese coming soon!)\nTimeline will work on Pebble and Pebble Steel (exact date TBD)\nWorks with iOS 8 on iPhone 4s and above\nWorks with all Android 4.0+ phones including Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG, Google, Motorola, Xiaomi and more\nIf you\u2019re already part of our community of backers, developers and, early adopters, that\u2019s fantastic! If not, we invite you to join those who have supported and guided our journey so far. It's pretty straightforward, just back this project!\nWe pledge to do the absolute best we can at creating amazing products and supporting them for as long as possible. We\u2019ve gone out of our way to develop new features, release software updates and provide technical support for all Pebble owners. Check out our Amazon reviews or our Twitter's @Pebble and @PebbleHelp to get a taste.\nDeveloper community\nSince the first Kickstarter campaign, developers have been an integral part of the Pebble community. We are very proud of the 26,000+ developers who have created over 6,500 apps and watchfaces for Pebble.\nPebble Time greatly expands possibilities for wearable apps, building on top of the existing Pebble SDK and tools:\nRich C SDK for apps and watchfaces running natively on the watch, even when the phone is disconnected\nBest in class online development environment: www.cloudpebble.net\nNew emulator that can be used on CloudPebble or locally\nRich set of APIs: accelerometer, compass, bluetooth messaging, background tasks, GPS and HTTP request, etc\n(NEW) Color APIs to support the 64 colors of the new Pebble Time screen\n(NEW) Support for PNG and APNG\n(NEW) Timeline APIs to push information from the web into the user\u2019s timeline (no watch or phone apps required)\n(NEW) UI framework to create beautiful applications that take advantage of color and animations\n(Later in 2015) Voice to text APIs: add voice recognition to your apps\n(Later in 2015) Smart accessory port for hardware hackers.\n(Later in 2015) Bluetooth Low Energy API. Use Pebble to control BLE-enabled objects. \nAll existing Pebble apps are compatible with Pebble Time and apps built with the new SDK are compatible with both platforms. We will reveal more information about the new APIs during the campaign. Stay tuned!\nTime for one last plug: we're hiring!\nOver the years, we've hired a bunch of folks from our community and are looking to hire more! If you (or a friend!) are passionate about bringing wearables to the masses, want to push Pebble to the next level, and love working with an awesome team at an innovative company, check out our Jobs page!\nWhy are we back on Kickstarter?\nPebble was brought to life by 68,929 backers who supported our vision three years ago.

When inserted in the Rouncer base device\u2019s semi-circular groove and the handle is pressed down, the food cuttings clears the blades and collects in the small container thanks to the clearing tool and its spikes.\n3) Disc blade hand guard. When using the disc blades for its mandolin functions in slicing, wavy cutting and even for grating, the hand guard allows you to latch on to the top of the vegetable or block of cheese as you get closer to the blades in order to avoid any finger cuts. \nHow to use the Rouncer:\nTake a look at our video for an easy guide on what our patented Rouncer will do for you!\nSimply cut an onion into half with a knife and chop of the two ends with shoot and stem, and then place it in the semi-circular groove of the Rouncer base unit, attach the round onion blade on the top blade slot of the unit (pick one out of the 14 depending on your requirement).\nUse the top base unit handle to hand press the blade through the onion in the bottom base unit. This will force the onion through the blades.\nThe onion will not completely go through and collect in the top compartment, about 2mm of the onion skin will stay below the blade which ensures that the scaly leaf does not get cut and go through the blades.\nRemove the scaly leaf before adding the next onion to cut up. \nLift up the top handle of the device, simply peel off the scaly skin on top of the blade.\nPut the lid down and turn the device upside down to shake and allow any vegetables stuck between blades to fall through. Use the platform filler tool which also acts as a dicing/slicing clearing tool to clean blades of cuttings which are stuck in between.\nTo use any of the flat cutting blades, insert the blade, but place the semi-circular plastic space filler in the bottom base unit groove to cover the onion slot and make the surface flat. You can then use the device in the same way as above.\nTo use the disc blades, insert part to the blade slot and then turn the device upside down with the lid open and away from the base, rotating to the opposite direction. To use the disc blades, you simply slide to mandoline cut, grate, wavy slice and more on the underside of the top lid handle cover rather which is now exposed to the top. Please refer to images for more guidance.\n  The Rouncer Family\nRouncer comes designed in 2 cool colours! The \"Autumn Lemon\" and \"The Old Grey\".\nWe sprayed the prototypes with acrylic resin and took professional studio images to show and develop our concept, The final production results will resemble the two variations types above.\nRouncer \u2013 Form, Function and High Quality\nWe have designed the Rouncer with quality in mind, a uniquely designed product like nothing else available in the market, a real problem solver and one we believe that will make the world a better place!\nIt will be constructed of the finest materials and created with precision quality. There will also be a money-back guarantee against defects or cancellation.\nHome and kitchen products have become very popular with consumers looking for new cool and useful products to add to their kitchen gadget list. The Rouncer will become a must have tool for every kitchen just as a knife would be, the ability to save you time and stop tears has been very well accepted by reviewers.  \nGet perfectly sized and square cut diced onions every time! Slices are of the same thickness every time you chop onions! No more health and safety concerns whilst cutting onions, this is a common knife cut in the kitchen that you can do without, and now with the Rouncer, you can chop away safely.\nWe have secured retail distribution in the USA and the UK if we successfully manage to mass produce this product. A starting order of 5000 pieces would be placed if we get tooled up. Your funding will help us achieve this.\nIn the News:\nOur initial prototype V1 made the news because of what it represented, the idea that could become part of everyone's life through their kitchen!\nhttp://www.cateringinsight.com/16150-onion-slicer-maker-looking-for-investors/\nWhat can you do with the Rouncer:\nComes with 14 Multifunctional blades included in the Rouncer including:  The Spiral Julienne strips cutter, Apple coring, Peeler, Grater, Mandoline slicer, Herb chopper, square cutter, pie cutter, rectangular cutter, wavy slicer.\nHere are some meals we prepared, with the vegetables and fruits only cut using Rouncer.\nWhat We Need, and Why\nNewtonstein \u2013 that\u2019s the name of our start-up company \u2013 has already spent over \u00a312,000 of our own funds in the development of this project, which has enabled us to create a variety of prototypes, apply for our patent, pay for legal fees, set up of logistics and choose a packing operation in Switzerland just like all our invention approaches. We are geared up to be able to ship 8000 orders a day if required.\nWe require \u00a31,000 to for contribution towards production of a starting order. We have secured funding for 80% of the production order now. This is where you come in and get to grab the opportunity of becoming one of the first backers to put your hands on one! We are not setting any limits, because the more we get funded, the more we can spend on new variations and trade shows to establish this product in global markets whilst putting a team in place to drive its growth through retail distribution in other countries like India because they cook with onions everyday!\nAll quotations for tooling and manufacturing ready, we got our final prototypes made by the same factory to ensure they are familiar with the product long term.\nFunding from our friends at Kickstarter is essential to launch the Rouncer properly. Help us bring this amazing invention to life and revolutionise onion cutting in the kitchen!\nThe entire process of crowd funding will inevitably help us learn a great deal more about our market, our product and our direction for the future because your critical appraisal and feedback will help us perfect our invention, after all, it is you that will make use of it the most!\nRetail Distribution:\nWe have signed agreements with Davison Product Group in the US, we have a verbal agreement with YCE catering distribution company in the UK, and we are in discussions various other marketing groups in the Gulf and Europe to bring Rouncer to stores this Summer.\nThe Journey\nWe came up with sketches Prototype 1 of the Rouncer, and started looking at perfecting the design last month, reducing costs as three different blades would require three different housing blade drums and moulds. By creating a clever grooved blade housing, we managed to build this product with only one tool that allows us to interchange its assembly. Our aim was to enter the market long term in the $20 - $30 price range.\n Our revisions produced Prototype 2 which was cool, sleek and trendy. 3D printed using our very own Form Labs 1+ Printer. Once we got this in our hands we collectively agreed that it would need to be sleek and stackable.\nFinally we came up with Prototype 3 as shown on all our images which put forward our vision for this product perfectly. We modified the blade housing to require a single moulding tool, the product evolved to a multi functional blade tool giving customers more value for their money!\nRewards & Goals\nThe Newtonstein Team\nPriyesh is the founder of Newtonstein, and is one of the two inventors for this small business.

For that reason, funding from our friends at Kickstarter is essential to launch the Rouncer properly and keep its retail price low as the blades cost a lot of money to make due to material wastage.\n\nWe believe in Rouncer and are willing to see it through with heart and dedication to the long road of consumerism ahead.\n\nWe will be able to get the products shipped out to you by July 2015 if the campaign is successfully funded!\nThere are things we can not do much about that may cause delays like:\n - Severe weather,\n - Strike action,\n - Terrorism,\n\nBut we would like to!\n\nOur product has gone through various stages of testing, use and critical analysis, we believe it is ready!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "ROUNCER Breaking NEWS!!!", "update_content": "Dear esteemed backers,\nWe at long last present you with some GREAT NEWS!!

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

When I was twenty-eight, National Geographic Magazine sent me on the assignment of a lifetime: to document the 1,700 mile journey of a mysterious twenty-seven-year-old woman named Robyn Davidson, who was trekking across the Australian outback alone with four camels and her dog, Diggity.  During Robyn\u2019s nine-month journey I tracked her down five times, spending about three months traveling with her and shooting tens of thousands of photographs.\n\"Australia harbors more things that can kill you in extremely nasty ways than anywhere else\"        - Bill Bryson,  In a Sunburned Country\nI was fascinated by Robyn's courage and her intense desire to learn from Aboriginals about their culture.  I had never witnessed a love affair like the one she had with her Kelpie pup, Digitty (who she had rescued as a puppy from an animal testing lab two years before her trip began).  And I was constantly amazed by her perspective on life, on friendship and her brutal honesty with her own short comings. Most of all I was fascinated to spend time with someone who, instead of running away from her fears, faced them head on, constantly challenging herself. \nEven though Robyn had spent two years preparing, the outback had many ways of testing even the most capable traveler; she was attacked by wild camels, took paths that led to dead ends, got lost, arrived at wells that were dry and almost died of dehydration. Every time I left her out there, I worried that I might never see her again. \nWhen Robyn\u2019s story appeared in a 32-page cover story in National Geographic it caught the world\u2019s imagination, reaching over 50 million readers.\nTRACKS (the book): Robyn went on to write a book called TRACKS which her publisher expected to sell modestly, with an initial print run of only a few thousand copies. TRACKS went on to become a global phenomenon, selling more than a million copies in 18 languages. It won the \"Thomas Cook Travel Writing Award\" and the ignominious honor of being the year's \u201cMost Stolen Book\u201d!\nThis description from TRACKS is a wonderful overview of why her story has captivated readers around the globe:\n\"Robyn Davidson went to the dead heart of Australia in pursuit of a dream: to cross the desert alone.  Her journey took her across an ancient, secret land and the outback worked its magic on her life in strange and subtle ways. From an Aboriginal tribal elder Robyn learned desert sense, and from an Afghan camel herder she learnt to master, ride, outwit and care for the camels that became her pack animals and adored companions.\nHer voyage led to the discovery of self as well as to the profound beauty and nobility of a threatened land and its indigenous people.\"\nTRACKS (the movie): Given the power of Robyn's writing, I shouldn't have been surprised when the Oscar-winning producers of The Kings Speech reached out and told me they were going to turn Robyn\u2019s legendary adventure into a feature film.  They cast Mia Wasikowska, a wonderful twenty-four-year-old chameleon-like actress (Alice in Wonderland) as Robyn, and Adam Driver (Lena Dunham's heartthrob boyfriend in HBO\u2019s GIRLS ) as yours truly, the photojournalist.  \nHere is the trailer for the movie, TRACKS, which begins reaching theaters this fall.\nThe movie is being distributed by the legendary Weinstein Company and has been generating rave reviews around the globe.\nWhich brings me to my Kickstarter Campaign for a brand new book I'm producing called INSIDE TRACKS:\nINSIDE TRACKS:  When I found out that Robyn\u2019s story was being transformed into a feature film I called Robyn and we brainstormed the idea of my self-publishing a large 224-page landscape coffee-table book (30-inches wide when open) which would enable readers to feel as if they are joining Robyn on her journey.  \nShe loved the idea and we came up with a book that would weave together three experience of her journey: memorable quotes from her book TRACKS, the best of my photos plus striking images and screenplay from the TRACKS movie.  \nINSIDE TRACKS is three books in one:\n1) The first half of the book is a visual story using my images, many of which have never been seen before, and inspiring quotes from Robyn\u2019s best-selling memoir, TRACKS. \nINSIDE TRACKS featuring images from Robyn's original journey\nINSIDE TRACKS featuring images from Robyn's original journey\n2) The second half of the book features fascinating images from the movie TRACKS, screenplay excerpts, behind the scenes / making-of images, as well as short essays reflecting on the journey written by Robyn, John Curran the director of the movie, and by me (Rick Smolan).\nINSIDE TRACKS featuring scenes from the movie\nINSIDE TRACKS featuring scenes from the movie\nThe images in this section were shot by Matt Nettheim, a fantastically talented set photographer, and Mandy Walker the film\u2019s Director of Photography. Because many of the film's scenes were based on my original photos, it\u2019s almost impossible to tell which images are from the movie and which are from the original trek.\n3) The most delightful component of INSIDE TRACKS is the integration of  HP\u2019s Aurasma technology. Readers will be invited to download a free smartphone app (available on iTunes & Google Play). You simply point your phone or tablet at specially marked photos and immediately (and I mean immediately) you\u2019ll see a clip from the movie showing how that photograph was brought to life in the TRACKS movie. \nUse of Funds\nINSIDE TRACKS is a labor of love.\nMy son Jesse proudly displaying an early sample of INSIDE TRACKS\nI envisioned INSIDE TRACKS being printed on heavy matte paper in six colors (most books are printed in only four) plus a spot varnish on every photograph to make the color pop off the page. \nI pitched the concept of INSIDE TRACKS to many publishers but, while many shared my enthusiasm for the book, I couldn\u2019t find any publisher that would commit to the quality of production that I felt this book deserved. \nSo, I am turning to the Kickstarter community to help fund the considerable expenses involved in self-publishing and publicizing INSIDE TRACKS.\nSpecial Heavy Duty Kickstarter Edition Mailing Carton\nINSIDE TRACKS is not like most of the illustrated books you find in stores these days. Most publishers are very conservative  - they play it safe, keep costs down, and think that \"average\" quality is good enough. INSIDE TRACKS is not going to be average, it\u2019s going to be spectacular. The book will integrate a level of printing and production quality that you rarely see in bookstores anymore.\nTo achieve this goal I had all of the original Kodachrome slides drum scanned at extremely high resolution and tasked Michael Marquand, a color correction wizard to optimize each image. Diane Murray, a wonderfully talented art director and designer, spent months seamlessly weaving together the original trek photographs, the images from the movie, and the new Aurasma App technology that brings the original images to life. Brad Zucroff, a printing expert, is supervising the print run.\nFinally, I've engaged Holly Jacobus, a brilliant marketer, to focus on raising awareness of INSIDE TRACKS in the publishing, photography, film, technology, and smart device communities.\nIf funds are raised in excess of my goal (fingers crossed!) the money will be used to expand the awareness of INSIDE TRACKS through additional marketing and publicity plans throughout the upcoming holiday season.\nMy greatest hope is that INSIDE TRACKS will help expand the audience for Robyn\u2019s inspiring story and the underlying message of her journey, that \u201can ordinary person is capable of anything\u201d.\nSOME UNIQUE REWARDS TO SAY THANKS\nTo thank backers of my Kickstarter campaign I\u2019ve put together some rewards that will only be available to the Kickstarter community \n***Note*** When a reward says SIGNED it means signed by Rick Smolan. All backers of any reward level will be thanked on the project website as a supporter.\nThe INSIDE TRACKS Team would like to thank the following organizations and individuals for their support in helping make this Kickstarter Project possible. \nVideo editing provided by Max Worrin, footage courtesy Radical Media, Media Storm, Touchcast, Sean Hardaway, and See-Saw Films.\nAll prints made for this Kickstarter campaign will be printed by Digital Silver Imaging on paper provided by Hahnem\u00fchle USA.

It's a real challenge for any one book to stand out - let alone an expensive coffee table book like INSIDE TRACKS.\n\nThe only way for a book to be successful is through publicity and word of mouth.

The only risk is my own, because I am self-publishing the book and taking all the financial risks if the book doesn't sell.\n\nI am personally involved with every aspect of this book including the scanning and fine tuning of the original Kodachrome slides, the selection of images extracted from the TRACKS movie, editing the screenplay excerpts, and approving of the color separations. \n\nThere is minimal risk for any backer to be associated with this project.

What else could drone photography uncover?\nFactory Farms Want to Keep You in the Dark\nA wave of undercover investigations by groups like the Humane Society have exposed shocking cruelty on factory farms: cows being kicked in the face, turkeys beaten with pipes, and chickens packed in filthy cages so small they cannot even flap a wing. This whistleblowing has prompted the largest meat recall in U.S. history and multiple criminal prosecutions. Rather than address these abuses, though, the agriculture industry is trying to hide them from consumers. \nNew \"ag-gag\" laws make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on factory farms; in some cases, exposing cruelty can lead to more jail time than committing it. These bills have already become law in Utah, Iowa, Missouri, and Idaho. Right now, more states are considering them, and they are spreading globally. The agriculture industry in Australia is modeling its \"ag-gag\" laws after those in the states. \nThe latest trend is that the agriculture industry is even trying to ban photographs of farms taken from the air. It is unlikely that aerial photography can document animal abuse, but these industries are clearly concerned. So what are factory farms trying to hide? Will a drone allow us to see the scope of pollution caused by these industrial operations? I'm going to find out... \nLet's Shine a Light\nAs a journalist, I think the best way to confront these attempts at secrecy is to shine a light on the abuses.\nWith your support, I will:\nLawfully document factory farms in multiple states using aerial drone photography.\nCreate a short documentary about factory farms and the \"ag-gag\" controversy using aerial drone footage, and interviews with whistleblowers.\nPublish an e-book that combines these photographs with in-depth investigative reporting on factory farms and \"ag-gag\" legislation.  \nUse the investigation to contribute to public debate about \"ag-gag\" laws internationally.\nBrief media and policymakers about the findings of my investigation \nShare what I have learned about using drones for reporting with other journalists and professional journalism associations.\nPlus offer some fun, unique perks to say THANK YOU for supporting investigative journalism!\n\"Ag-gag\" laws are an attempt to silence whistleblowers who have exposed cruelty, like this injured and neglected piglet on a farm in Iowa.\nWhy Me? \nI've reported extensively on these attempts to silence investigators and whistleblowers, both in my award-winning book and news articles. My work on \"ag-gag\" has been featured by Salon, MSN, Democracy Now, VICE, Al Jazeera, and many other outlets.\nMy reporting overturned the first \"ag-gag\" prosecution.\nI have lectured internationally about these laws, including Spain and Australia. And I spoke about my reporting as a TED Fellow. \nI am a plaintiff in the first lawsuits challenging an \"ag-gag\" law as unconstitutional.

But I can make an awesome writing instrument!\n I'm also a pen addict. For years, I denied it. It started out innocently enough when I got my first nice pen. I only used it occasionally. I told myself I could quit anytime, but then I would see it - another beautiful, unique pen for my collection. Before I knew it I was using them all the time.\n As time went by, I found it more difficult to maintain my habit. Finding quality writing instruments became increasingly difficult. All I could find were those boxes of cheap, disposable pens at the big-box stores. Out of desperation, I tried some of their expensive pens but it just wasn't the same. They looked good at first but it didn't last. I became possessive of the few good pens I had left. Friends started to talk.\n Then I saw the light; I didn't have to live this way any longer. Being a creative type and an experienced carpenter, I decided to make my own pens. Then I made some as gifts for family and friends. That's when I realized I wasn't alone in my addiction. It seems everyone I know is a pen addict, too. I posted pictures online of the pens I made and people started buying them. I feel like Walter White of the pen world. Anyway, pen making is the best opportunity I have for a much-needed second income.\n While this is great news, there is a downside. I don't have the tools needed to make this a viable business. I am lacking a drill press and band saw suitable for making the pen blanks. The tools I currently have sometimes do more damage than good during the process and I have to start over with new material, which leads to waste (both money and time). I have also begun using reclaimed wood, but it needs to be stabilized first. This requires a vacuum pump and pressure tank.\n With your support, I know I can produce some of the finest writing instruments around and make this dream of mine a reality. And help support the habits of pen addicts everywhere. Thanks for stopping by!\n The first 2 pens pictured below are both made with Spalted Maple Burl, yet look very different. That's the unique beauty of natural wood.\n Top: 30 Cal Bolt Action                 Bottom: Graduate\nFrom Tree to Pen\n The picture below shows the process: For this pen, I began with a piece of Black Locust from a fallen tree. I cut out the smaller pieces shown in front of the chunk of wood. Then it was turned on the lathe to the desired shape. While still on the lathe, I used a gloss friction polish to produce a beautiful shine that brought out the woods natural character.\n The completed pen is below.\nBolt Action Tec-Pen in Chrome with Black Locust\n The most popular pen continues to be the 30 Cal Bolt Action pens pictured below.

The first that comes to mind is the possibility that some of the supplies needed to complete the rewards could be back-ordered, like one of the pen styles or finishes.

The only other risk would be to have so many rewards to fulfill that it takes longer than expected to complete them all. In both of these cases, it would mean a delay at most. I will certainly keep everyone informed as to the progress. My first priority will be to craft each pen with the highest quality and second, to fulfill all of the rewards.

We want to create a game that is just as unique as it is entertaining; something that will always keep you coming back for more. The Universim aims to unleash you upon the universe with the powers of a god to begin forging your galactic empire in the stars. The ability to play as a god gives you unparalleled power, but unlike other god-games, you cannot interact directly with your population in the game. However, you can influence their decisions and change the way in which your civilization evolves. It is up to you to decide which technology path they follow and what kind of research they undertake-you have the power to shape their future. Instead of taking control of a static game world that awaits your every command, life will go on as you would expect. You are effectively taking control of a living simulation. Like a ball of clay on a potter's wheel, the world will keep spinning, but you will be there to mould it to your liking. Although, the ball of clay may or may not slap your hand away at times. \nCan't back through Kickstarter? We Support PayPal! \nPledged Via PayPal: $12,123 \n(updates once every 24 hours)\nYour civilization will begin in the Stone Age and steadily progress, advancing beyond the modern era, then moving into the age of intergalactic exploration and colonization. The game will feature a similar evolutionary path to the human race, but players will have the tools to shape their civilization\u2019s progress. You will need to think carefully when making decisions about things such as their research path. Some things may be far more important than others, depending on the situation and era. Even though you may think that fancy new gadget is worth dying for, you will also need to consider how it could be used while your people are slowly turning into fossils.\nBuildings and society will evolve as you progress from era to era; certain special buildings will become available once you research a particular technology. Buildings will begin to spring up around what we call The Epicenter, the central heart of every city in the game. You can place an Epicenter in any feasible region on the planet that supports cities, and buildings will begin developing around it as your population grows. The buildings are constructed by the AI and thus are built dynamically around the Epicenter, meaning you cannot select where they are built. However, you can still place special buildings wherever you want to! Buildings will grow dynamically based on the conditions around your Epicenter. In certain environments, your population and buildings will grow faster, but in cold environments, deserts, and other rather inhospitable areas, food may be scarce and therefore will hinder development. \nIn The Universim, resources play a major role in the game; they govern the integrity and growth of your civilization. Resources can be used in various ways: to create new technologies, to expand your empire, to research exciting or life-saving inventions, and to help your civilization\u2019s advancement through the ages. This is what makes intergalactic exploration so much more important in the space-age! \nThe space era will be the culmination of all your hard work. All of the choices and decisions you have made will truly begin to bear fruit, and reveal their consequences, if any exist. This is when you will begin to discover all of the beauty and mercilessness of alien planets. Whenever you discover a mysterious new planet, it will be an exciting experience... \nEvery planet you encounter in the game will be as unique and vibrant as the last. You will come across planets with varying temperatures and environmental conditions as well as a wide range of characteristics that make them incredibly special. Planets will also undergo the changing of seasons which can affect the many environmental biomes on the planet. It can cause rapid changes in temperature and conditions. This can have a major effect on the gathering of food and resources as well as the development of buildings. The game will keep track of the time and date, and will change the seasons according to the in-game timeline. Summer offers the best food yield and growth period due to its favourable weather, while winter can bring many negative effects. Some winters may go by quickly, while others will drag on. Fortunately our in-game News System will inform you about upcoming winters. So you better prepare for long winters by storing food in advance. Failure to do so may starve your civilization to death over the course of the season.\nColonizing a planet requires a little preparation beforehand. The Go button is not the miracle button, unfortunately. There may be a few issues that will need to be resolved first. If adequate research about the planet is not done, it may result in the untimely demise of your colonization team.  It can be rather difficult to walk on molten lava while fending off giant space mosquitoes with nothing but a can of sunblock! Particularly while wearing the previous mission's sub-zero equipment. \nIn order to keep track of all of this information and help you to explore the universe more easily, we came up with a simple way to manage your galactic endeavours; by clicking on any star in the sky, you can utilise our intuitive GUI to quickly navigate the various planets represented by the stars and reveal extensive details about them, like how far away they are and what kind of conditions you can expect to find. This will allow you to discover new planets and colonize them if you have the right technology. There will also be a number of unlockable and upgradeable options available here. For example, you can research an all-terrain Rover that can be sent to recon a new planet. The Rover will be able to provide more details about the planet\u2019s conditions, environment, and the various resources it possesses. This can be incredibly helpful when deciding whether or not you want to colonize a planet or move on to the next. \nThe Universim is driven by dynamic events. Natural disasters, alien visitors, diseases, war, famine, riots, and so much more can be thrown at your civilization at any time. All of these factors and how you play the game, contribute to population growth and development. When something like the plague strikes, it is up to you to quickly strategize on how you will help your civilization overcome this disaster. The way you are able to fight certain disasters changes from era to era. Cavemen do not exactly have P.H.D's in science and the knowledge to create cures, for instance. However, you can trigger disasters if you are displeased with your civilization\u2019s choices. With every action they perform that goes against your wishes, you generate wrath, which can then be unleashed upon them at any time.\n\nWe are planning to have up to 12 different viruses in the game that each have unique qualities and effects. It is probably a good idea to prepare new variants of antibiotics in advance to counter future viral outbreaks. Certain viruses will spread slowly through your population, but will be difficult to cure. Others may be easier to cure, but will spread faster and possibly cause more damage if not caught in time. You may even encounter types that fly completely under the radar and spread throughout your cities and colonies by sneaking aboard planes and interplanetary shuttles. Pay attention to the in-game News System for early signs of a breakout!\nEvery now and then, something mysterious may fall upon one of your planets. You can then prepare an expedition to investigate these rare occurrences, if you so wish. Expeditions can be organized at any time, assuming you have the resources. The further an Expedition needs to travel, the riskier it becomes and the more resources it will require. Fallen material can be incredibly valuable to your civilization. It may be a new technology that will boost the well-being of your civilization dramatically, or it could be a meteor containing some kind of valuable resource that will open up more research options. Then again, it could also be an unprecedented disaster waiting to happen; such as an explosive compound that upon disturbing, wipes out part of the planet, or a deadly virus lying in wait. It can be seen as a high-risk, high-reward kind of system. \nOne more feature that we are really excited to implement is the Dynamic News System. It will not only inform you about important game events, but it will also have a few incredibly humorous stories to tell. We hope to eventually give players the ability to write their own stories and events for any particular time period and share them with the community. Of course, this will be moderated. We can\u2019t have the world invaded by inappropriately named extraterrestrials after all! These stories will be displayed in-game for everyone to enjoy. You can even construct an actual mission-based storyline for players to follow. You can also select the exact age and type of event that will trigger your news headline, or the new story campaign. With this system, every time you play the game, there will always be a seemingly infinite supply of entertaining stories in the News System. You can choose whether you want to follow someone\u2019s storyline or simply enjoy the stream of news in Sandbox Mode. This community system is called The Universim Live News System.\n\n The beauty of this kind of game is the huge amount of freedom that we have to experiment and continue to add amazing new content before and after its launch. That is what makes all of the hard work worth it! We have only scraped the surface of what we can accomplish with the information and features listed here. With the community by our side, we can undoubtedly transform this game into the best planet management game ever created. We are always willing to listen to what you have to say. We take your feedback seriously and want to ensure that we are spending the budget responsibly and on the features YOU want to see in the final game. \nIn-Game Object Editor.

It plays a huge role in creating the perfect atmosphere and we are investing a lot of time and effort into communicating the mood of the game with the player not only through visual design, but with a dynamic music system that will adjust to your play-style and in-game events. Planets will breathe with the essence of sound, from ambient city sounds to ear-popping disasters and explosions. Almost every object on the planet will produce its own audio. Music in The Universim will also be a great addition to our messaging system. You will know something has gone wrong when intense music erupts from the wake of a disaster. Otherwise, you will enjoy soothing, motivational tones when everything is going smoothly. With the help of an incredibly talented composer, The Universim will not only look outstanding, but it will sound amazing as well.\nThe Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Magic\n The Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Light Universe\n The Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Fantasy Dream\n The Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Mystery Space\n The Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Dense Atmosphere\n The Universim KS Exclusive Soundtrack - Legacy Of The Future\nWe have high hopes of getting the game out onto as many platforms as possible. At the moment though, we are focusing primarily on PC, Mac, and Linux for the initial release of the game. Like many developers, we are also excited about the possibility of developing for the new generation of consoles. We are also immensely interested in seeing how something like the Oculus Rift and other VR devices can add a whole new dimension to gameplay. If the game is successful, we see no reason why we wouldn't try to shoot for the stars and get the game out on as many platforms as possible for players to enjoy. Do not fear, though! We will ensure that we deliver the best possible experience on every platform we develop for and try our best to make use of the strengths of each one to the fullest. \nWe want to deliver a challenging and innovative gaming experience in an independent capacity and therefore Kickstarter is the best way to make that dream a reality. Because a game built by gamers with a budget supplied by gamers just seems to be a formula for success! \nWe want to forge an amazing community and give them the freedom to be creative, interact and meet new friends, and help us to develop the best game we possibly can. We have been receiving a few offers from some amazing publishers that love the concept and design of The Universim, but we are declining all of them as we wish to remain creative and open-minded. We want the community to be the driving force of this game, and the best way to do that is to remain independent. That is why we need your help!\nWe wish we could share even more details about the game with you, but even Kickstarter has its limits. Character limits that is! Please feel free to ask questions, leave comments, and interact with the dev team and community on our forums. This is our first project and we want to be as transparent as possible (without ruining some surprises of course!).\nCrytivo Games is a small team of enthusiastic dreamers from around the world. We are a diverse, multicultural team of talented individuals working together to create something truly beautiful, driven by a singular goal. Our team consists of some incredible designers, 3D artists, developers and sound engineers. Now, without further ado, meet the crew!\n What's the funding used for?\nWe will be pouring every last cent we receive directly into the development of The Universim. Most of the money will ensure that the team can create the best experience possible for the player. Every additional bit of funding we receive will be used to improve the game in various ways. From gameplay right down to the smallest of details. With the right amount of funding, it could be possible to add entirely new features to the game, such as the Multiplayer component.\nBut we mustn't forget about the various taxes and costs that will take quite a large chunk out of our funding. We also need to make provision for the costs of all physical goods and shipping for certain reward tiers. There really are a lot of things we need to burn through before we can safely begin using the budget for the game itself. But fear not backers, everything has been taken into account. Whatever support you can offer will help us enormously in the long run, no matter how small!\nSocial Links:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA game of this scale is not going to be easy to develop. We will need to hire many more talented developers in order to get it to the quality that the community expects. We also need to work very carefully with the budget. Complications always spring up during development, we have made provision for this, but it can still spiral out of control. We will do everything in our power to avoid this. It can also go very smoothly if fortune favours us.\n\nAnother problem is the matter of the final game's release date. We would love to have it out by the end of 2015, but that may be delayed with the inclusion of new features such as Multiplayer, or other community-suggested features. That is why we are releasing the game in stages, beginning with the Alpha phase, moving into Early Beta, and eventually hitting final Beta where the last touches will be made before release. From then on, we will begin working on additional free content and any patches if they are needed.\n\nBeing independent has its ups and downs. We are effectively on our own as far as things like publishing, marketing, and legal stuff are concerned. We hope to release the game on Steam and other digital distribution services as well as our own, which will be linked to our site (and will be completely DRM free). One more thing that might hinder development is the inability to acquire a trademark for our game. It is unlikely that King.com trademarked the word \u2018The,\u2019 but we cannot rule out any possibilities!\n\nThere are many other risks and challenges that may crawl out of the woodwork, but we believe that we will be ready for most of them.

Entirely curated by the community, Upcoming surfaced weird and wonderful events that usually fell under the radar of traditional event listings from newspapers and local weeklies.\nMost importantly, it surfaced what your friends were interested in attending. Upcoming was among the first generation of web apps to use the social network for anything beyond Friendster-like connections, helping to define Web 2.0.  \nUpcoming in 2007\nAfter the first year, my friends Gordon Luk and Leonard Lin joined me as co-founders to help expand it. As Upcoming took off, we decided to sell it to Yahoo in 2005, hoping they could provide the resources to help it thrive.\nUnfortunately, things didn't go according to plan and it quickly fell into disrepair after we left in 2007. Last year, Yahoo shut it down with little notice and no way to back up events. Fortunately, through a herculean volunteer effort organized by Archive Team, the complete site was saved to the Internet Archive.\nFor the last year, the domain didn't even resolve. I thought that was the end of the story.\nThe Return\nLast month, I got an unexpected email from Yahoo out of the blue, offering to sell me back the original domain. I jumped at the chance, and am thrilled to announce I own Upcoming.org once again.\nSo, what now? \nLike many of the people that used it, I miss Upcoming. Nothing's come to replace it in the years since, and I have the same problems that motivated me to build it a decade ago\u2014I'm missing interesting events in my city and struggling to discover interesting events when I travel. I don't know what my friends are going to, and I lose track of the events I hear about on a regular basis.\nI want to bring back Upcoming, rebuilding it for the modern era using tools and platforms that weren't available at the time I started it. I started Upcoming long before Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, or OAuth.\nAnd I'd love to restore the original Upcoming events collected by Archive Team to a permanent archive, hosted at their original URLs. There's over 3.5TB of raw HTML, Javascript, and images in their data dump, which I plan to parse and release as structured data.\nThe Rewards\nLike my other Kickstarter projects, most of the rewards are exclusive access to what I'm making\u2014in this case, early access to the Upcoming.org beta as I develop it, giving you first dibs at registering your username and helping guide the direction of the site. \nI'll keep a development blog exclusively for backers, keeping you up-to-date on my progress, and every backer gets a special badge on their profile, showing the world that you helped get Upcoming off the ground. \nYahoo graciously gave me permission to use the original logo for an exclusive print run of t-shirts, printed only for this Kickstarter project. Some samples are below, and I'll announce the final design before the Kickstarter project ends.\nMinimalist or retro reproduction? I can't decide.\nFor higher levels of patronage, adopt a city on Upcoming for you or your project, or a mega-classy site-wide dedication for the first full year after launch.\nIf we hit the goal, awesome. I'll use those funds to bring Upcoming back from the dead, covering the costs of the domain, infrastructure, and development time to build it independently again. \nAnd if not, that's okay too! I'd rather know now there wasn't enough interest than devote a big chunk of my life to working on it. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nTwo reasons:\nIndependence. With any other form of funding, I'd sacrifice creative or financial control over Upcoming. Taking investment would set it on a path towards an exit, which I don't have any intention of doing.\nAll-or-nothing. I don't want to begin building Upcoming unless there's interest in it, and this is a perfect way to gauge whether this is something you want to exist. If not, we all walk away.\nUndoubtedly, there will be cynics asking why they should invest in something without taking any equity. My answer to that is simple\u2014this isn't an investment. You're paying me to build something you want to exist; that's your return. If you don't want it to exist, don't back it! Yay!\nThe Promise\nMy goal is to build Upcoming into a self-sustaining, independent project that keeps to the ethics that made it great. An open API, an embrace of open standards, and a belief that your data belongs to you. And I won't sell it again.\nTen years ago, the community made Upcoming great. With your help, we can make it great again.\nThanks\nHuge thank you to Paul Searle for shooting the pitch video. It was filmed in Panic's lovely offices in downtown Portland, Oregon. The background music is Chris J. Hampton's \"So What\" from Kind of Bloop. (If you made it this far, backers can message me on Kickstarter for a free copy.)\nThanks to Chris Messina for capturing huge chunks of Upcoming's UI in his remarkable Flickr gallery of Design Patterns, where both homepage screenshots were borrowed from.\nThe photos in the video were, in order, from Scott Beale (Laughing Squid), Daniel Bogan, Ben Ward, Scott Beale (Laughing Squid), and Richard Eriksson. Photo of TBL by Rory Cellan. Thanks, everybody.\nThank you to Yahoo for taking the unprecedented founder-friendly move of offering Upcoming back to me. \nAnd a massive debt of gratitude to Leonard and Gordon. I love you guys.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have a long history building and releasing web apps on my own, including Upcoming.org, Playfic, and Supercut.org. But inevitably, things can go wrong and timelines can go awry. I try to minimize this risk by reducing dependencies and costs\u2014I have projects that I've run for over a decade with little support and zero budget. \n\nOne dependency I plan to use to make the site better are the APIs provided by Twitter and Foursquare for authentication, network graph, and placename database. Any of those services may choose to change their Terms of Service or disappear entirely, which could impact development time.\n\nThe biggest risk, to me, is that the success of a site like Upcoming hinges on network effects which may never materialize. Even if the project succeeds and the site launches according to plan, it's entirely plausible that enough people won't use it in your city to make it useful. I've thought deeply about that problem and how to solve it, but it's definitely a fundamental challenge and risk.\n\nAnd, of course, software always takes longer than you'd expect.

Most people have never tasted the exquisite flavor of an In-shell Scrambled Egg. \n'Golden Eggs' can be enjoyed hard or soft boiled, deviled or in egg salad, fried, pickled, atop noodles, or as a surprise on Easter Sunday. There are many preparations yet to be discovered, perhaps you will be the first to invent a new recipe?\nGolden eggs are known to be a delicacy, but you'll have trouble finding a restaurant serving them and there are no utensils designed to create Golden Eggs... until now!  \nIntroducing the Golden Goose\nThe Golden 'Goose' is a low-tech, hand-powered kitchen gadget. It has been meticulously designed and tested to smoothly scramble the contents of a shell egg. The device uses \u2018centrifugal force\u2019 to scramble an egg without breaking the shell.\nIt works by alternating the rotation of an egg back and forth. This mixes the white and yolk inside the egg-shell without introducing outside air. It is easily used at any angle. The flavor profile is fresh and delicious, and there is no 'whipping' or bowl needed if you enjoy scrambled eggs on the stove.\nThe Goose was developed with the home cook in mind, but can just as easily be used by anyone. In fact, some users have suggested it's a good way to store scrambled eggs in a restaurant kitchen.\nCreating with the Goose\nWe've made some delicious treats and shared them to the amazement of our friends.\nI had never eaten soft boiled eggs until now.\nIf you're feeling creative, you can substitute golden eggs anywhere regular hard boiled eggs used to be.\nI think we might actually be the first folks to eat a fried golden egg!\nGolden eggs go nicely with salads too...\nBut let's switch gears and talk about how we arrived at the final Goose design.\nDetails of the Goose:\nThe Goose features lightweight & recyclable materials, comfortable handles, and the highest quality 1/8\u201d\u201d abrasion resistant cordage system. The Goose main shell is hinged during manufacturing, as part of the Polypropylene shell, to provide ease of use and keep the halves together. The ring turns 12 degrees to securely lock the shell together with an audible 'click'. The Goose features an elastic food-safe & dishwasher-safe 'egg cradle' designed to fit the variable sizes and shapes of eggs. It features specially designed fins to balance the egg and adjust the center of gravity providing smooth and efficient motion.\nWe never intended to develop a Goose. In fact, when we first heard that it was possible to scramble an egg in its shell, we were so curious that we stayed up until 4-am breaking every egg in sight. \nThe following day I was reminded of an old Victorian Era toy that rotates back and forth, so I stole the shoelaces from my tennis shoes and combined them with a plastic jar to create the first rough prototype.\nWe knew there had to be a better way for us to make Golden Eggs without struggling, and that\u2019s when Y Line Product Design hatched a plan to create The Golden Goose!\nThe design process took months of careful exploration and testing. We did loads of sketches and built functional and aesthetic models by hand and on the computer.\nSome of the prototypes worked better than others, so we incorporated the use of computer aided modeling and 3D printing to refine our performance criteria and eliminate unnecessary features. We eventually dialed-in the performance, feel, and look of the Goose.\nThe Goose is designed to be effective, and easy to use:\n It only takes a minute to learn, and even kids like doing it.\nNest an egg in the cradle\nClose and turn the ring until you hear a click\nSwing, then pull the handles to spin it until you hear the egg scramble\nPurpose:\nThe Goose is for Fun. It\u2019s not going to change the world. The Goose is a kitchen utensil that empowers the user to create new recipes, and hopefully creates unique and enjoyable experiences. \nIt would be cheaper to manufacture with other materials, but we chose Polypropylene, Nylon, and TPE because they meet our criteria, and are recyclable.\nThe Goose is easily assembled & disassembled. This means that we save cost and energy in the making of a Goose. We did extra work to ensure it can be easily taken apart so folks could wash or replace parts easily. We hope that users will be empowered to recycle the Goose many years from now when it reaches the end of its life cycle.\nThe Rewards:\nHonkers: Pledge $10 or more\nDon\u2019t need any more kitchen gadgets, but still curious?

This little gadget is the perfect accessory to the Goose. \nThe Birdshot is a 'Rapid Infuser'...using the same forces required to scramble an egg, the Birdshot infuses 1.5 ounces of liquid with the essence of the user's chosen ingredient. \nUse it for flavoring vinegar and anything else you can imagine! \nSpecial thanks to everyone for honoring us with so much attention!\nWho is responsible for this Goose?!\nGoose is created by designer Geraint Krumpe. He is an innovator with more than 15 years of experience in the Design field. In his professional career he contributed to more than 60 Design and Utility Patents. His work is awarded, and featured in the press, blogs, magazines, for sale, and in homes.\n-\"It has been hard work and long hours, but anybody who is curious at heart is going to have fun!\"\nI've recently \u2018hung a shingle\u2019 in Chicago with the introduction of a small design studio, Y Line Product Design. In my 'free time' I'm a 3D printing enthusiast, so I want to share the Goose with other enthusiasts. That's why we are offering, as a reward, the option to download and print your own Goose!\nMore on the egg itself:\nWhat does it taste like?\nThe short answer is \u2018scrambled\u2019, but that\u2019s not entirely accurate. The flavor is rich and subtle. If you are a fan of eggs, and a fan of scrambled eggs, then there is no better way to enjoy them. The science behind it is based on how proteins and fats react to each other inside of the egg without the intrusion of outside air.\n\nThe texture is silky, and depending on how long you boil, or at what temperature, you can create a range of flavors and characteristics. In addition, it is a great way to scramble eggs without dirtying a whisk and bowl, and golden eggs poured directly into the frying pan taste better than any scrambled eggs you've ever had...\nHow else can I prepare a Golden Egg?\nKnown methods include hard-boiled, soft boiled, deviled, scrambled, egg salads, Scotched, served with Ramen Noodles... and so on...but there are dishes yet to be discovered by the intrepid explorer!\nOK, so how do we produce it?\nThe Golden Goose is not a product, so we have to make it a reality by investing in manufacturing tools & materials. We need to fund both the manufacturing and assembly of each Goose. The design is finalized, and we have quotes from manufacturers domestically and in Asia. The plan is to mold the Goose parts in Asia and assemble them in the US.\nHere is a breakdown of our target time-line:\nJune: Pilot production samples and proofs\nMid-June: Shipping schedule and assembly procedure\nJuly: Travel to factory for pre-production confirmation\nMid-July: Final samples approved\nAugust: Pilot Production run\nMid-August: Shipping to US\nSeptember: Product received & Assembled - Bumps receive rewards!\nMid-September: First production run rewards shipped\nEarly October or Late September: Second production run rewards shipped\nThese are general targets for production and shipping, but we will get the rewards to you sooner if possible. All non-manufactured rewards will ship ASAP. \nEither way you slice it, your donation will help us achieve a concrete goal, and you will be rewarded with gold!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKickstarter is the world\u2019s most successful funding platform, but that doesn't mean there aren't inherent risks involved in a project. \n\nNothing is for certain, but I can guarantee that there are experienced and smart people working to make the Goose project a success. \n\nInjection molding is far from an exotic manufacturing technique, and our design has been carefully crafted to be produced efficiently and assembled quickly and easily.\n\nAs we encounter challenges or setbacks we will address them methodically and creatively. When we reach our funding goal, we are going to do everything humanly possible to ensure the Goose takes flight!\n\n8 Iterative rounds of prototyping and design refinement have culminated into the production ready model. We have secured competitive bids from two of the largest and most reliable manufacturers in Asia, and we have been promised lead times of 40 days or less.\n\nThe parts produced will be made from high quality materials.\n\nWe will confirm our pilot models prior to committing to production, and I will personally inspect the production samples for quality before committing to manufacturing the rewards.\n\nWe'll package your Goose with care, and maximize the density of Geese for shipping to further reduce fuel use and our environmental footprint.\n\nY Line Product Design has invested a great deal of time and energy into the development of the Goose.

Last year was a huge year for precision temperature cooking, as it was the first year that precision temperature cooking devices became very affordable for home chefs. The Anova Precision Cooker represents the next evolution of precision temperature cooking technology, making it easy and affordable for anyone to reap the benefits of this type of cooking.\nDid you know that precision cooking (sous vide) is used in the majority of high-end restaurants?\nMost people don't know how pervasive precision cooking is, but it's now used by a majority of high-end restaurants. It's also used at chain establishments, such as Chipotle.\nWhile high-end restaurants have been using precision cooking for years, the technique has only become popular with home chefs in the past four to five years with the advent of reality cooking shows. \nDespite the publicity from these cooking shows, until last year, most sous vide devices were still too expensive for home chefs, as models cost between $500 and $1,000. Anova was the first company to begin selling an affordable device for the home chef, with a price of only $199. Now, precision cookers / sous vide devices are the fastest growing kitchen appliance category.\nWhat does sous vide mean?\nFor years people have called this type of cooking \u201csous vide,\u201d which is French for \"under vacuum.\" This refers to the process of vacuum sealing food and putting it in a water-bath. However, that's a bit of a misnomer. You don't need to vacuum seal your food to cook sous vide. \nInstead, this technique is really about bringing food to a very precise temperature and holding it there for a period of time. A better name for this technique, then, is \"precision temperature cooking\" or \"precision cooking\" for short. That's why we've named our system the Anova Precision Cooker.\nHow it Works\nPrecision cooking is extremely easy. It usually involves these three simple steps:\n1. Attach the Precision Cooker to a pot and set time and temp. Use the simple interface to set the time and temperature. Or, you can use the app to find what you're cooking and just hit \"start.\"\n2. Put food in a ziplock bag and then you clip it to the side of the pot. Simply put your food in a sealable bag. The circulator moves water around the pot, ensuring a consistent temperature throughout\n3. Finish by sear, grilling or broiling. Some people like to finish their cook by searing their food, throwing it on the grill, or by broiling it. This gives the food a nice look.\nThe Advantages of Precision Temperature Cooking\nPrecision cooking produces results that are impossible through any other technique. Precision cooking gives important advantages over traditional methods, including the following benefits:\nConsistency. Because you cook your food to a precise temperature for a precise amount of time, you can expect very consistent results. \nTaste. Food cooks in its juices. This ensures that the food is moist, juicy and tender.\nWaste reduction. Traditionally prepared food dries out and results in waste. For example, on average, traditionally cooked steak loses up to 40% of its volume due to drying out. Steak cooked via precision cooking, loses none of its volume.\nDon't worry about overcooking. Traditional cooking can require your constant attention. Precision cooking brings food to an exact temperature and holds it. There is no worry about overcooking.\nPrecision cooked steak vs. traditional steak\nSteak cooked via precision cooking is done perfectly edge to edge. In the image below, you can see that the steak on the right appears smaller. That steak was pan-cooked. In comparison, the steak on the left was cooked by the Anova Precision Cooker and it is consistent from edge-to-edge.\nPrecision cooked eggs vs. eggs cooked traditionally\nPrecision cooking eggs allows you to control how eggs turn out. Traditionally cooked eggs are a bit of a crap shoot. It's very difficult to time them perfectly to get the desired result.\nSalmon cooked traditionally vs. precision cooked salmon\nMuch like steak, fish cooked by the Anova Precision Cooker is done perfectly, edge-to-edge. When pan cooked, the surface temperature of the pan is higher than the ideal cooking temperature, resulting in the edges being overcooked.\nEverything Tastes Better When Cooked Perfectly\nIt's not just steak, fish, and eggs that come out better when cooked with the Anova Precision Cooker. Chicken comes out moist and tender. Vegetables are bright and flavorful. Pork is tender and juicy. The Anova Precision Cooker can be used on a wide variety of foods and the results are delicious and healthy.\nOur Story\nJeff Wu has been using immersion circulation technology since the age of 13. While still in college, Jeff became an engineer for a scientific equipment manufacturer and started working with classmate, Natalie Vaughn on designing and selling scientific equipment.  \nJeff has always been obsessed with two things: (1) designing and building laboratory equipment and (2) cooking. He had no idea that two could go together until on a visit to Harvard in 2007, he saw two grad students using laboratory-grade circulators to cook. Not long after that visit, Jeff tried to build his own device to cook sous vide-style meals. He also began using lab equipment to cook sous vide. \nJeff became determined to build a sous vide device for the home chef. In 2010, he did just that and created an early proof-of-concept of an affordable home sous vide.\nThe Proof-of-Concept\nAnova I\nIn 2013, Jeff teamed up with Natalie to launch Anova Culinary, LLC. The first product, was the Anova 1. At $199, the Anova 1 became the first affordable immersion circulator for the home chef.\nThe reception for the first commercial unit was overwhelming. . . .\n\"So is it amazing? Yes. I\u2019m kind of hooked.\" - TechCrunch\n\"If you're looking to get into sous vide, the way to go is the Anova sous vide circulator.\" The Sweethome\n\"[Anova] is the one to beat\" - WIRED\n\"The Anova Sous Vide Immersion Circulator is an easy to use device that both beginners and pros will enjoy.\" - CNET\nWe Can Do Better\nDespite the popularity of the Anova 1, we wanted to do better. We felt we could improve upon the following three major areas:\n(1) The price. We think this type of technology should be affordable to everyone. We want to work to produce a unit that is extremely affordable.\n(2) The unit must be more flexible. One of the limitations to current systems is that they require tall pots, which limits the type of equipment you can use with the device and makes its use somewhat cumbersome.\n(3) The Precision Cooker should be a connected device. The interface should move to the iPhone, making the device even easier to use. People shouldn't have to search for hours for time and temperature settings. They should be able to hit a button and start cooking. \nThe Redesign\nIn addition to our three chief goals (low-price, flexibility, and connectivity), we also wanted to incorporate many suggestions from our users. The result is a redesigned system, specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of the home chef. It\u2019s simple, yet powerful, flexible and accurate. It\u2019s incredibly light, weighing only 2.5 lbs. Its small, and easy to store. It truly represents a breakthrough in precision temperature cooking devices.\nThe Clip\nWe\u2019ve redesigned the clip, so that it\u2019s detachable from the system. It\u2019s secure, but flexible. You can use the device with virtually any pot or container.\nVectoring / 360 Degree Pump\nThe clip allows the unit to turn, which means you can point the pump flow to any direction This gets water to flow around the pot, ensuring a consistent temperature throughout\nInterface\nThe interface is completely new and incredibly easy to use. You slide the wheel up and down to change the temperature. Then you press start.\nBluetooth Connected\nThe unit is Bluetooth enabled, which for the first time ever allows you to cook perfect meals with your smartphone.\nRemovable Skirt\nAnova has a removable skirt, which allows you to take off the bottom and clean it in the dishwasher.\nMaterials\nThe unit is made of polycarbonate and stainless steel. Stainless steel parts prevent rust and corrosion and last for ages.\nConnectivity and Apps\nThe iPhone App makes it incredibly easy to cook with Anova. You simply find the food you\u2019re cooking, adjust the settings if you\u2019d like, and hit start. There\u2019s no need to search for time and temperature settings. It will all be programmed into your phone.\nWe\u2019re going to release an SDK, so that people can develop their own apps to work with Anova. We anticipate people will make nutritional apps, apps that make it easy to share what you\u2019re cooking with others, recipe apps, and time and temperature apps.\nWe want you to be able to input what you\u2019ve got in the fridge and simply touch a button to begin cooking the perfect meal.\nWatch Kenji Lopez from Serious Eats interview Jeff about the Anova Precision Cooker:\nWhat Others Kindly Say\nPricing, Availability, and Specifications \nPricing & Availability:\nProduct Price: $169 \nEstimated Availability: October 2014\nFinish: \nBlack (Brushed / Machined) \nWhite (Brushed / Machined) \nPerformance:\nTemperature Range: 77\u00b0F to 210\u00b0F \u00b1 0.01\u00b0F / 25\u00b0C to 99\u00b0C \u00b1 0.01\u00b0C \nPump Speed: 1 - 1.2 GPM 7-8 LPM (still optimizing) \nDirectional Pump: 360 degree directional pump \nTank Capacity: 4-5 Gallon 15-19 Liters \nTimer: 99 hours Max \nSafety: Bi-Metal Fuse \nPower Input: 110-120VAC (220-240V EU) \nHeating Power: 800W \nBluetooth wireless \nEstimated Weight and Dimensions:\nLength: 2.75 in / 6.98 cm \nWidth: 2.75 in / 6.98 cm \nHeight: 14.75 in / 36.8 cm \nImmersion Depth: 7.25 in / 18.415 cm \nMax Clamp Opening: 1.25 in /  3.175 cm \nMinimum Immersion Depth: 2.5 Inches / 6.35 cm \nWeight: 2.5 lbs / 1.1 kg \nSensors:\nWet Sensor\nAuto-shut off\nTemp sensor \nDisplay and Controls:\nLED Display \nTemperature Display C & F readout \nTimer HH:MM \nScroll wheel Increment/Decrement \n24/7 display\nMaterials:\nBody: Polycarbonate \nSkirt: Polycarbonate/Stainless in Late Q4 \nTransparent bottom piece: Polycarbonate \nCleaning:\nRemovable skirt\nDishwasher safe skirt\nEasy twist disassemble \nIn the Box:\nPrecision Cooker\nCord\nManual\nOur Mission\nEverything we do is to make this type of technology and this cooking technique accessible.

Since that time, we've gone through several product iterations to get to the design that we feel is ideal for the home chef. We've completed the design and engineering and created a prototype, using our own 3D printing machines. \nWhat's left\nTo complete this project we need to finish our injection molding and begin final production of the units. We need to finish development of the connected device which will allow for the machine to communicate with smartphones via Bluetooth.\nWe need a Community to Realize Our Goals\nWe're extremely thankful for the support we've received from customers. But we need even more support to make sure that we can continue to provide a product that is an amazing value. \nThanks so much!\nOur Extended Team (With Our Thanks and Gratitude)\nGet Fresh (Full-Service Agency)\nStephen Svajian, CEO, Get Fresh, and Kickstarter Producer\nColin Day, Video, Get Fresh\nAaron Sananes, Design, Get Fresh\nNicole Van Zanten, Social Media, Get Fresh\nStephen Thorpe, Audio Engineer\nFernando Camarena, Camera\nAlbert Lopez, Video Editor\nChef Nicole Poireer, Chef\nKara Tsuboi, On-Camera Talent\nCredit\nUse of restaurant video footage was provided under a Creative Commons license by the following: \nCanlis Restaurant\nRistorante Caff\u00e8 Vittorio Emanuele\nSepia Restaurant and Wine Bar\nStretch Goals\n                                   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAnova has a team with extensive manufacturing experience. Specifically, our project benefits from the following key facts:\n- We have a history of designing and manufacturing quality products in-house\n- The Anova Precision Cooker is the result of detailed and careful planning\n- We have previously designed and manufactured a precision cooker\n\nDespite our expertise and careful planning, there are risks to the project. We've identified and outlined the following key risks to our project below:\n\n1. RISK DUE TO PROBLEMS WITH THE INJECTION MOLD:\n\nInjection molding is a process that can often set hardware products back. We're fortunate to have experience in injection molding, but in the event that there is a problem with the injection mold, our project could be set back several weeks.\n\n2. RISK DUE TO EXCESS DEMAND:\n\nWe're fortunate to do our own manufacturing. Should we receive support in excess of our anticipated demand, there could be delays in backers receiving their products.\n\nIf demand is extraordinary, we could be forced to open a new manufacturing facility, which would further delay our project. \n\n3. RISK DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE AND THE CONNECTED DEVICE: \n\nOur team has experience building and developing connected devices. Specifically, we've built devices that connect to software via Bluetooth. However, development of our connected device is currently in progress and is largely conceptual. Despite the proficiency of the team, it is possible that the development schedule could slip and we will not be ready to release source code to developers in time for them to build apps for backers.\n\nFurther, our schedule could slip to the point that there is no app for the initial batch of units to use, as we believe it is important to ship units as they become available, which could pre-date final delivery of apps.\n\n4. RISK DUE TO SUPPLIERS:\n\nWe have long-standing relationships with our suppliers. In addition, we have a very robust supply chain for components. However, it is not impossible that our project gets delayed due to problems with a supplier.

We'll be opening the doors to our Kickstarter backers on June 21st. We'll contact our backers through email with installation instructions on or slightly before that day.\nContinue to follow us at Webhook.com\nWhat is Webhook and who is it for? \nWebhook takes the pain out of building content sites that need more functionality than blog software can provide. It allows you to build custom forms (not just posts) for your CMS without having to code or configure any code-like files. Anyone who knows basic HTML and CSS can build and deploy a site on Webhook. Once complete, anyone with an Internet connection can use the CMS to edit the website using a desktop, mobile or tablet device.\nThe entire CMS works in mobile so you can edit your site on the go.\nSee it in action\nWebhook's documentation is already online. We've also created a few videos where we walk through some sample site builds.\n[VIDEO] - Build a simple blog with a podcast.\n[VIDEO] - Build a one-page band site.\n[VIDEO] - Build a large media portal with multiple authors, reviews, interviews and relational data.\n[VIDEO] - Make a theme from an existing Webhook site.\nWebhook features\nWebhook uses a hybrid static approach to building your site. Your data is stored with Firebase in a JSON format that you can access in real-time and through the CMS. The site itself is deployed statically so that it loads as fast as possible without needing to hit a database or front-end server.\nInstalls in one line through NPM. The only requirement is Node. There is no database to setup or other software to install. It just works.\nWorks on plain ol' Windows (without Apache or anything else) as well as Mac and Linux computers.\nDeploy your site in one line. There is no infrastructure to build or manage.  We host the site, you point over your custom domain.\nFile uploads and image resizing built in. We take care of it. Seamlessly resize your images at the template layer to whatever sizes you need.\nSearch is built in. All your content is available through search as soon as you create it. Again, it just works.\nDjango-like templating We use Swig JS for our templates. That means you get the power of template extension. Want to call something from the CMS? Use a simple template tag on any page.\nComes with dozens of form widgets to build out your forms. Image galleries, markdown fields, wysiwyg fields, audio uploaders... we handle just about any content needs you require.\nScaffolds clean HTML. We generate scaffolding HTML for any form you create. No need to look up names or read documentation just to output your content. Simply add your design.\nWorks well with teams. Webhook works great with versioning systems like Github and can be worked on by a team of developers. Editors can edit the CMS at the same time and enjoy real-time updates.\nThemes are just git repos. Themes in Webhook not only define the look of your site but also the forms contained in the actual CMS. This allows you to do heavy customization without anything more than static files hosted on Github.\nWhy do you need it?\nThe content management system you're likely using right now is terrible. If by chance you're the Developer building things with it, well... it's doubly terrible.\nWhat do you get?\nAll Rewards above the $5 level come with the following.\nEarly Access\nKickstarter backers will get access to Webhook at least one-month before it's available to the general public. Your kickstarter email address will be white-listed so you can try it out. We'll send these invites sometime in the month of June, 2014.\nHosting at a reduced price.\nHosting is built into Webhook. Depending upon the reward you choose you'll receive at least one-month of hosting for your site. Continuing to use Webhook past this period is completely voluntary and will incur a monthly subscription fee of $20 a month. This price will only be available to Kickstarter backers and last for as long as you host your site with Webhook.\nThere are no other fees or add-on prices with Webhook. We provide a simple way to use a custom domain with your site. You can not use Webhook to build sites specifically for the use of file-sharing or other bandwidth-intense operations.\nThe reduced price will be good for any sites you create (in case you plan to build multiple sites).\nWhy should you trust us?\nWe've done similar stuff before. Dave Snider designed and founded Giant Bomb, Comic Vine, Tested.com and TV.com. We've designed and built CMS software from scratch to support large teams of editors at Whiskey Media, CNET and CBS. These sites currently receive millions of unique visitors a month and are in use by dozens of editors. We know the pain points in the field and know what it takes to build quality software. Dave is also a bit of a nut for documentation and recently redesigned the theme for Read the Docs, which is used by thousands of Open Source developers.\nIan Kelly, Dave Snider and Mike Horn.\nHow does it work... really?\nWebhook's local environment is a Grunt task that compiles Swig JS templates (similar to Django) into static HTML. The CMS itself is an Ember app (a single cms.html page that can load anywhere) and the data layer is real-time JSON powered by Firebase. Search is powered by Elastic Search.\nWhen you deploy your site we package up your templates and static files, pushing them up to our servers. When any user make changes to the live CMS we run a fresh build and regenerate the site for you. If you decide to later change your templates, redeploy the site and we'll build it again.\n1. Create a site on your local Windows, Mac or Linux machine.\n2. Serve the site locally, use our form-builder to create forms.\n3. We scaffold templates from your form. You add design.\n4. Deploy your site with \"wh deploy\". Invite friends into the live CMS to add or edit content. Don't worry, you can use your own custom domain.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe'd like to stay independent. Taking money from venture capital would pressure us into building growth instead of building a better product. At our listed goal we believe we can continue working on Webhook without outside investment. If that keeps us small, so be it. We're builders at heart.\nPut another way, our dream is no more than to provide a solid, well-respected product at a fair price. Kickstarter seemed like a better fit under those aspirations. It validates the need for this kind of product and lets us plan a few months into the future.\nWhat will you do with the funds?\nWe'll put it on the screen against the following:\nFree themes\nAs it stands right now Webhook has a limited number of preset themes to choose from. We'd like to hire a few well-respected designers to build some great starter sites (a blog site, an indie-game site, an artist's portfolio, a multi-editor news portal...etc) while we build out the CMS. Webhook is extremely powerful in the hands of a good designer, but most people aren't going to have the time to design from scratch. We'd like to give them a starting point.\nInfrastructure\nIt's our duty to make sure Webhook is reliable and available at all times. To do that we need some initial capital to build the hosting infrastructure needed for those magic one-line deploys. We'd really like to over-provide in this area and unfortunately it can be expensive.\nPeople\nAny extra funds we receive past our goal will go into hiring engineers and designers to make Webhook better.\nI want to see the code!\nWebhook's CMS, CSS, JS libraries, local run-server and command line tools will be available on Github when we release in June. We're looking into ways to release the production server as well so you can self-host, but that will likely come later in the year.\nYou can look at the actual template logic in our documentation which has plenty of examples.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith a software project of this size the biggest risk is that will we will slip past our launch window. Although Webhook as a product is nearly complete, the hosting component becomes more difficult the more users we have using it. This could lead to a situation where an extremely successful Kickstarter might force us to slowly drip users into the system over the course of weeks instead of days. Since Webhook deploys static websites there is very low risk your site will not be available to visitors. A more likely scenario is that your CMS could potentially be unavailable to make edits for a short period of time.\n\nThe Webhook team is comprised of industry professionals who previously managed sites of significant size.

Perfect for beginners and experts alike, just plug in the printer, download or create models, hit print, and watch your custom creations form right before your eyes.\nThe Micro is Designed For Everyone\nBring your ideas to life, turn them into businesses, educate, learn, personalize products, make toys, make jewelry, start a curriculum, run a modern workshop, and unleash your creativity.  The power of creation is yours!\nA Fantastic 3D Printing Experience\nWe've built The Micro with reliability, consistency, and accessibility in mind.  Micro Motion Technology is a sensor and feedback system built into the print head, providing auto-leveling and auto-calibration.  This means that every time you run the printer it works, even after thousands of hours of use! The Micro is not only a useful tool, it makes 3D printing an enjoyable experience for the every-day person.\nMaterial & Filament options\nYou can use PLA or ABS, as well as our Micro filament spools or standard 1.75 mm filament spools available on the market.  \nWhat's the difference?  We made Micro filament spools so that people can print with more materials and colors, by adding $12 to their pledge amount per spool.  These spools fit inside The Micro, allowing it to be portable and seamless.  They weigh nearly 1/2 lb (225 g) of.That is enough material to make 45 of the vases from the time-lapse in our video!\nThe Micro filament spools are fed from inside the printer.  Alternatively, you can use an external filament access port located on top of the extruder.  \nSoftware Options\n3D printer software should be as fun and futuristic as the printer itself.  That's why we've designed the M3D software to be as interactive and enjoyable as a game, making sure it\u2019s fully touchscreen-capable with a minimalist and simple-to-use interface. It allows you to search and browse countless objects online, organizing 3D models you've downloaded into an easy to view library.  Just pick a model, drag it into the printer, adjust the model if needed, and hit <print>. Software shouldn't be a barrier to 3D printing, and it\u2019s our goal to make The Micro accessible to everyday users.\nAdvanced users can use the expert settings as well as other software such as open-source slicers.  \nTechnical Specifications\nPrinter Dimensions: It's a cube, 7.3 in (185 mm) per side.\nIt is lightweight, roughly 2.2 lb (1 kg).\nIt can also be used with any Windows, Mac, or Linux based system.\nUSB-Compatible connection.\nSupports many different materials: ABS, PLA, Nylon, and more.\nFilament: standard 1.75mm. Nearly 1/2 lb (225 g) rolls.\nStandard filament rolls also supported.\nRemovable Print Bed.\n50-350 micron layer resolution.\n15 micron X and Y positioning accuracy.\nDimensions: Print height: 116mm (4.6\"). Base Print Area: 109mm x 113mm.  Print Area Above 74mm: 91mm x 84mm.\nM3D software for an effortless, plug-and-play experience.  \nSupports and uses open source software (for advanced users).\nHow Did You Create The Micro?\nStarting with a seamless design, the Micro evolved from two years of productive debates between engineers, artists and production experts.  Since everyone was involved from the beginning, their vision of the product was fully integrated into the final result.  This led to 15 innovations in the field of 3D printing and we are very honored to share the result of all that hard work with you.\nBut the work doesn't stop there. We want your feedback on The Micro, and help us build a community that can be a part of this exciting project.\n15 Innovations\nM3D has introduced many innovations in the field of filament-based 3D printing with the introduction of The Micro:\n1. Most space-efficient 3D printer ever made.  \n2. Light-weight, portable design fits nicely on your desk.\n3. Micro motion chip provides completely automatic leveling and calibration.\n4. Most quiet 3D printer ever made.\n5. Lowest power consumption 3D printer ever made.\n6. Carbon fiber rods: light, sturdy, self-lubricating and long-lasting\n7. Ceramic heater for rapid heat-up, power efficiency, reliability and safety.\n8. Bold colors. Choose from Silver, Black, Blue, RedOrange, and Green.\n9. New filament materials like Chameleon PLA.\n10. Inspirational Micro filament spools.\n11. Modernized touch-capable software.\n12. Replaceable print beds for alternative materials.\n13. Replaceable nozzles for experimenters.\n14. Designed for fast assembly in the US for quality control.\n15. An ABS-based print bed allows you to print larger ABS parts.\nDesigned & Assembled in The USA\nThe Micro was designed for assembly and production in the USA.  We will use a combination of imported and domestic components to assemble all of the printers near our Bethesda, MD location.  \nYour Backing = Earlier Delivery\nWe're ready for production and really need your support to ramp up assembly to get printers to you as early as possible.  We've been preparing for this stage for over a year by buying and testing parts from over 100 manufacturers and talking with hundreds more.  \nBy pre-ordering now you\u2019ll help us reach our last crucial milestone: purchasing the injection molds that will provide us with high-quality, high-volume 3D printer parts we need to assemble the most affordable consumer 3D printer ever.  In return, you'll get one of the first Micro 3D Printers and be an early adopter of this exciting project.  For that we cannot thank you enough.\nWhat's Included with My Reward?\nBesides our eternal gratitude, we\u2019ll assemble a Micro 3D Printer with great care in the US and send it to you along with M3D software, instructions manual, USB cable, country-specific power adapter, and one Micro filament spool.  You can unbox it, install the software, and print right away - it\u2019s as quick and as simple as that.  \nWhy We Need You\nAs far as we've come, we've only just scratched the surface of what's possible using this technology. We need your help to take it further, and make The Micro a reality.\nProduction Timeline:\nThe Incredible M3D Team  \nEveryone at M3D has a single-minded focus to deliver an amazingly fun and fulfilling 3D printing experience for everyone. To get here has been very rewarding, and we've formed an amazing team of gems. We would like to give a special thanks to so many supporters, motivators, backers, team members, and advisors that helped us get to where we are so quickly:\nThanks For Your Support!   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any innovative project, we face several key risks and challenges. The primary risks include:\n\nINJECTION MOLDING \nWe consider this is our only significant risk. Injection molding has very large capital expenses and thus we can only secure one manufacturer. In addition, when making the specification for the seamless frame of The Micro, we demanded only the best quality surface finish. Injection molding is one part science and one part artistic optimization. Thus the mold may take up to 4 months to produce and perfect. For this reason we have put a great deal of careful planning and strategy into the sourcing of our injection molded parts such as working with suppliers in North America to ensure that the long lead time parts are closest to us.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS \nBefore starting we noticed that some projects can encounter unexpected hurdles when going from prototype to production. That\u2019s why we have done so much work to test The Micro with over 100 manufacturers to ensure that our designs are production ready and designed for both manufacturing and assembly. The last pieces to be ordered are the very expensive injection molds for plastic parts. To verify these designs we\u2019ve had them CNC\u2019d and 3D printed so that the injection molds are as close to our prototypes as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Thank you all", "update_content": "Dear Backers,  \n           The entire team here at M3D would like to take a moment to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your continued support.

It can go with you anywhere, and you\u2019ll hardly notice it in your pocket or bag.  Whenever you need your tablet placed at the perfect angle for working or viewing, Plinth is ready to provide rock-steady support at the touch of a button.\nPlinth is the size of an iPhone, and weighs only 50g\nThank you, everyone, for your marvellous support, help, encouragement, and company.\nSee the Plinth review on GeekBeatTV\nThe GeekBeat.tv special - an exclusive prize and available here\nThe EXECUTIVE pledge includes a luxury leather slip case and stylus, and is also available in black, and without the stylus.\nPlinth has 5 essential user angles\nPerfect in meetings - with a Galaxy Note 10.1\nPlinth prototypes with an iPad mini\nThe story so far\nSince I bought my first iPad in 2010, tablet computers have become increasingly important in my life \u2013 both at work and at home. From reading books, surfing and emailing, to watching movies and playing games. I now do a substantial amount of my design work on my iPad, and carry it with me everywhere.\nOver the years, I have tried smart covers, folio cases, minimalist cases and big rubber waterproof jobs, and for me I favour something minimal. I like to pick up my iPad, switch it on, and go. I also find it really important to prop the tablet at the right angle for what I\u2019m doing \u2013 whether typing on the screen, sketching, or watching a movie.\nBecause I carry my iPad with me wherever I go, I wanted a stand that would come with me too. That meant it had to be as small and discreet as possible, and had to set up as near to instantly as possible.\nI've spent the last year prototyping various ideas, initially focusing on adjustment and stability. Then I turned my attention to speed of setting up the stand, and once people started saying 'Wow!' when I pressed the button, I knew I was on to a winner.\nWho am I?\nMy name is John Bull, and I'm a product designer, based in Somerset in the UK. I've run my own product design business for 20 years, designing all sorts of stuff. I'm married, with 3 kids, a boxer, and a passion for trying to live with a little more kindness towards our world.\nJohn Bull with Helen, Bodhi and Darshana\nQuality first\nThis product works incredibly well, and I'd like every aspect of the Plinth to reflect that quality and attention to detail. I therefore propose moulding the Plinth in high specification engineering plastics, co-moulded with soft rubber pads to hold your tablet still and prevent scratches. \nYou can see CAD renderings of how the plinth will look on my website - myplinth.co.uk\nIt even works with books!\nYou don't even need a table\nFlip-out wings place rubber feet underneath each corner of your tablet\nTimescales and work still to be done\nNovember 2012 - First model 3D printed.\nOctober 2013 - Patent applied for. Prove-out prototype built by CALM, Exeter.\nDecember 2013 - 1st Kickstarter project launched.\nFebruary 2014 -   Project relaunched with revised goal.  CAD work to be completed. Obtain final costings for bought-in components. Liaise with company to complete design and production of packaging.\nMarch 2014 - Commission design and production of injection mould tools (6 weeks). Seek orders from retail distributors.\nLate April 2014 - First tool trials. Product testing and possible slight modification of moulds to optimise function, strength and performance.\nEarly May 2014 - Fulfil rewards to Kickstarters. Ongoing production.\nFinancing Plinth\nI have put a lot of time into developing a product which ticks all the boxes for those who use tablet computers in their everyday lives - both at work and at home.\nEveryone who has used one of the prototypes has loved it, and the feedback from our first Kickstarter project has been overwhelmingly positive. However funding the whole tooling investment from one project proved too steep a hill to climb, so we have now have the backing of private investors who will enable the tools to be made if this campaign is successful.  As a result, this relaunched project has a much lower goal of \u00a321,000, although the ideal would be to raise enough money so that loans will not be necessary.\nThe costs are not insignificant:\nInjection mould tools - \u00a323,000\nPackaging design and production - \u00a35,000\nPatent protection - \u00a33,500\nCost of fulfilling pledge rewards, including shipping - \u00a310,100\nCampaign costs - \u00a32,000\nInitial Marketing costs - \u00a31,000\nPartners to make Plinth happen\nIn my career in product design, I have for many years worked closely with a first class tooling and moulding company called Hayden Products (http://www.haydenproducts.co.uk), based in Maidenhead, and they are my preferred partner to manufacture and assemble Plinth. We have been liaising for some months as the design of Plinth progressed towards completion.\nI have also had a lot of support from CALM (Centre for Additive Layer Manufacturing) at Exeter University, who have built the prototypes used in the video, and are available to send to magazines/technical review websites (please contact me if you'd like to review one).\nAlso in support is SWMAS - the South West Manufacturing Advisory Service, who have been invaluable in support and helping me put together a feasible production plan.\nFinally, there are a number of companies and private individuals, some whom I have known for years, and some only met during the first Kickstarter campaign, who have offered advice, support and backing to help fund the balance in addition to the Kickstarter goal, needed to enter production successfully. We've got a pretty good team now.\nThe future\nWe have already had interest expressed by a major UK distributor, and we have relationships with companies marketing through Amazon.\nWe also see Plinth has a massive appeal as a promotional corporate gift, as shown in the following visual.\nA simulation of a promotional Plinth for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society\nI'm also keen to pursue some more fun opportunities - Plinth would look cool in black with funky coloured rubber pads, or maybe white with soft colour.\nThere have been several enquiries for an aluminium Plinth, and this is being currently investigated. In fact, there are lots of doors which could be opened once the basic product is in production and selling well.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a product designer with 20 years experience, I am comfortable with both the design and the process of arranging manufacture.

I'm Vicki Murley, and I'm creating an ebook that teaches web programming \u2014 specifically, one that shows you how to create simple transition animations and more complex keyframe animations using CSS. The goal of my book is to combine beautiful imagery with hands-on interactivity to create something that is less like a conventional ebook, and more like an immersive, responsive learning tool. \nIn general, I like to create books on technical topics that are beautiful, fun, and engaging, which you can sit down with in a single afternoon and learn something useful.\nI gained some experience creating ebooks like the one just described with CSS Transforms: An Interactive Guide, an ebook that I created and published for iBooks on iPad and OS X in October 2013. I'm looking forward to tackling all of the challenges that come with writing about CSS transitions and animations, while utilizing the lessons learned from making my first book, which is pictured below.\nIn addition to writing this book, I'll be publishing quick, short, useful web development tips to the Sprightly Books mailing list. Join the list and receive a tip every other week or so until CSS Animation: An Interactive Guide is released.\nNote that this book will be available in 51 countries through iTunes, just like the book on CSS Transforms. If your country is not listed here, delivery will be delayed until the book is available in a wider range of formats through a wider range of distribution channels.\nThat's the short version of my story! If you'd like to know more, there are additional details provided in Q&A format below regarding the motiviation for this book, my background and qualifications, rewards, and planned uses for the funding. \nWhy CSS Animation? \nWell, that is a great question! The first reason is that web technologies are my primary area of expertise. As you can also read in my bio (linked on the right), I spent more than 10 years at Apple working on the Safari web browser and as the Safari Technologies Evangelist. I'm very lucky in that many web technologies such as HTML5 video, CSS transforms, and CSS transitions and animations were invented and implemented during my time at Apple. You might say that I had a front row seat to the evolution of these technologies, and as a result I came to know them quite well.\nI also like teaching people about web technologies because to me, it feels like they're accessible to everyone and a great entry point into programming in general. This becomes more and more important as new groups of people (such as women and young adults, and even young children) get into programming. Consider this: all you need to make a box appear on screen is a text editor, a web browser, and a few lines of HTML and CSS. There's no compiler and no other tools to download and learn. With web programming languages, you can expend a little bit of effort and see a significant payoff, and that can motivate you to keep going even if you're a complete novice. On the flip side, web technologies can also be very powerful \u2014 the more you learn, the more you can accomplish. As JavaScript is introduced into the mix, you're motivated to learn best practices and more advanced programming paradigms, in order to keep your sanity :). Furthermore, concepts that you learn while using JavaScript and the DOM can be applicable to other languages and platforms. But, it all starts with drawing that simple box.\nWhy an ebook? \nAnother great question! I like creating ebooks (as opposed to say, publishing information as a sequence of blog entries) for a few reasons. One reason is that a book has a beginning, middle, and end. Even though the reader can skip around if they want to, the author gets to give their recommended plan of action to learn the topic at hand. Personally, my primary mode of finding information on the web consists of searching, then clicking links. While this can be incredibly useful, it sometimes feels like I'm randomly accessing bits and pieces of information, and then trying to piece them all together. An ebook lets me tell the whole story, in one neat package. For example, if you wanted to learn about 2D transforms, you could check out CSS Transforms: An Interactive Guide. Then if you wanted to learn about 3D transforms\u2026 hmmm, where to look\u2026 surprise! The information is right there in the next chapter of the book you already have, presented in a format that you're already familiar with.\nI also like ebooks because it seems like they're ripe for innovation. So many ebooks I see are basically a digital copy of the paper version. Or, they use interactivity simply as eye candy, without being useful to teaching the lesson at hand. One of the best compliments I got on my first book was from a friend who has never created a web page. She paged through the book, tried out all the interactive widgets, and then said \"I'm not a web programmer, but I think I get it.\" \nI like the idea that people who use my books will be able to quickly gain a cursory understanding through using interactive elements, then dig into the text for more details.\nCan you tell me more about the posters? \nI'm actually pretty excited about these, as I'm both a \"self-proclaimed web standards nerd\" AND an \"infographics aficionado\". I'll be offering at least two posters to choose from, one of which is previewed in the photo below. If the interest at this reward level is high enough to cover the additional design and printing costs, and I'd love to increase the number of poster choices offered to at least four.\nI see this poster hanging in your office!\nHow will the funds be used? \nOne of the primary strengths of the books I make is great design for the overall layout, graphics, and interactive elements. While making my first book on CSS transforms, I learned that great design takes iteration and time. I'm very lucky to have worked with an excellent designer on my first book, and we're working together again on the CSS Animation book. Even though the Animation book is just getting started, we're already paying attention to the details. A great example is the process we went through for choosing the book's color scheme, including the color of the cover. After eliminating green, teal, purple, and indigo, we decided that \"orange\" would be a good choice for the lively subject matter of CSS animation, and that it would look interesting on a virtual bookshelf next to the blue cover of the CSS Transforms book. The next step was to choose \"the right orange\", which resulted in this mockup of various color choices (using the title graphics from the Transforms book, for placement only):\nAs you can see, we're carefully considering each detail, and this is just one example.

If you look closely at the queen of spades you will see \"queen\" not only written in several languages, but you will find a queen chess piece and even a Queen Elizabeth signature.\nI have been developing this deck for nearly 8 years.  I worked with several artists until about a year ago when I found Nike, an artist from Florida, who could finally bring what I have seen in my mind all these years to life.  For the last ten months we have worked closely together deciding what would go into each and every card.\nEvery dot, every swirl, every language, and every hidden item was placed where it was placed with thought and purpose.\n\nThe more you look at a card and the more you look for hidden elements, the more you will find - things like ambigrams and words sharing letters, like the \"T\" in one word making an \"X\" in another.\nThere are over 100 different languages and numeric systems represented in this deck, plus there is symbolism and imagery in each card as well (an ant on a queen, or a toy jack on a jack, or an 8 ball on an 8, and so on).  There are some really fun things in subjects ranging from science and math, to history and mythology.\nA Bit About Me\nI am a magician and the founder of www.TeachByMagic.com where we show educators how to use simple magic in the classroom to engage students and make learning more fun and more memorable.\n\nI have worked as a creative consultant for several companies and I love the creative process.  I even do workshops on creativity.\n\nI have been married for almost 12 years to my best friend in the world and although we have been trying for almost nine years, we have not yet had kids. \n\nSo with that extra time and money we have traveled the world.\n\nWe have been to Egypt, Italy, France, Denmark, England, Turkey, China, Brazil, Greece, Honduras, Scotland, Alaska, and Ireland. We have touched the pyramids, kissed the Blarney Stone, stood on the Great Wall, seen Stonehenge, and climbed Mayan ruins.\n\nI am fascinated with the mystique behind these landmarks and I have have been working on this Different Deck during it all - learning about cards and numbers in these different cultures. For example, while in China I noticed the elevators did not have 4th floors.  Sure enough, the number 4 is unlucky in Chinese so we never put Chinese characters on any of the 4s.  \nEnough About Me, Let's Talk About the Cards!\n\nThis project will create three decks of cards.  Two are Kickstarter exclusive Bicycle branded versions of the Different Deck (white and black) and they are both Kickstarter limited editions, only available to backers of this project Never to be reprinted.  I will not sell this version ever again or anywhere else but here, during THIS project.\nThe faces of the white cards will be exactly like the unlimited edition decks except they will be on white cards rather than the antique parchment style.  The back of the Bicycle Limited Edition Deck is a custom design done by the same artist, again chock-full of symbolism and hidden imagery.  (If you look closely you can see that the word \"bicycle\" is hidden in the deck several times - how many can you find?)\nThe faces of the black cards again are exactly like the unlimited edition decks except they will be charcoal colored rather than the antique parchment style.  The back is the same as the white Deck only black instead of red. \nThe unlimited edition of the Different Deck will have the classic old paper style to it and this is the deck I hope to get into a corner store.  This has always been a bucket list item for my life.  I have developed several products (and even have a patent on one!) that have been in magic shops and that has been fun to walk into a shop and see my product.  But I want to walk into a normal store and see something I made.  \n\nSo with your help, hopefully 2014 will be the year that dream comes true.  And I will keep you posted in the backer updates about my progress as I pitch the deck to all the different stores.  You will know when I make the trek to Bentonville to talk to the Wal-Mart buyers.  And the more backers this project has, the more likely I will have success on that journey.\n\nAlso, because this is the Different Deck there will be a few surprises along the way.  The biggest surprise will be the back design of the unlimited version.  That will be revealed when you crack open your reward for the first time. \n\nI have a non-Bicycle back design that I plan to use but, fully embracing the fact that this is the Different Deck and this is a community effort to bring it to life, I am opening up the back design to you.  If you have a design you would like to submit, please message me for details on that.\n\nIf we use your back design you will get a case (144) of decks so you can give one to all your friends after you take them to Walgreen's to show them you designed something they can buy at a store.\n\nHow cool is that?\n\nI will post updates here every few days but if you want to see a new card every day make sure to like my Something Facebook page:\nI promise this will make more sense when you see my next Kickstarter project!\nThe rewards are simple.  You can get the decks or, if you like, we also have a H.O.P.E. sticker, or decal.\nThe numbers on this die-cut sticker correspond to the letters on a telephone key pad for hope - 4673.  The size will be approximately 3\" x 8\".\n\nUncut Sheets are available and they are set up... well Differently. \n\nThe cards all are mixed, but not in a random order. They are laid out like a crossword puzzle with words spelled out in number form like H.O.P.E. (4673) or L.O.V.E. (5683) but with lots of hidden inspirational words, like \"dream\", \"believe\", \"imagine\"...you get the idea.\n\nOriginal inkings\nThere are also 50 original artwork spots. These are the actual hand drawings that were scanned in to make these cards. They are approximately 7\" by 10\" and are on torn edged Stonehenge paper \u2013 and they will look AMAZING framed.\nThese come unframed so you can do whatever you like with them - but here is what it might look like if you framed it with 4 cards.\n\nOne Lucky Backer will get the 4 original H.O.P.E. inkings framed in a leather stitched frame with double matting, an inner fillet around each card, and museum  quality glass.\n It is 24\" high and 55\" wide and it looks AMAZING.\n\nHere are all the rewards:\nIf you would like to add even more to your reward level - GREAT - just increase your pledge by the appropriate amount after selecting your reward level. \n\nHere are the items you can add.

We intend to make free printing and shipping available internationally as fast as possible.\nFlag prints your photos using museum quality (Gicl\u00e9e) printers, on German 220 gram photo paper from sustainable sources, laminated for long-life and durability. We intend to make them the best prints you\u2019ve seen.\nThe back of a Flag print\nAn ad on the back of each photo allows us to deliver prints for free. Don\u2019t like ads? Blank prints can be ordered for a small fee. Ads will always be tasteful and we will encourage advertisers to make them inspiring.\nWe know that managing your personal information is a huge responsibility and, we take your privacy very seriously indeed.\nWe want Flag to feel like a part of your phone or tablet. Simple, beautiful and reliable. Something you use often but don\u2019t have to think about. Fast, so you can spend more time taking photos and living life.\nFlag's current development UI\nTo save you the taps needed to englare and reduce an image, you can peek at photos, of any size or shape by tilting your device.  We don\u2019t have to waste precious screen-space on empty borders, and it makes Flag a little bit faster and more fun for you.\nHow 'peek able' thumbnails work\nApps make it easy to filter, treat and effect photos. Printers don\u2019t. Flag uses laser-cutters to make your real prints as versatile and varied as virtual ones.\nMost printers charge extra for square prints. With Flag they will be free. Better yet you can mix and match shapes and sizes in every print pack you order.\n We can cut rounded corners and scallops for a vintage feel...\n...and 2 micron precision means trimming capabilities are essentially limitless. Even when making a regular borderless print, precision changes what's possible in terms of quality.\nPoster-size prints needn\u2019t be a luxury. Jigsaw enlargements rely on the precision of Flag\u2019s laser cutters to divide one big print into sections small enough to mail for free. Complete the jigsaw on delivery to return your photo to its full-size glory.\nTurn any photo into a postcard. Pic an image, type a note\u2013or hand write on your touch-screen\u2013and tell us where to send it. Use any of Flag\u2019s customization features compatible with postal regulations and we\u2019ll print your custom postcard and mail it from within the US at local rates. We can mail internationally if you need us to, or send blank postcards to your home or hotel too.\nThere\u2019s a reason everyone outside an ad agency calls it junk mail. \nUgly, unwanted and intrusive, junk mail relies on people\u2019s inability to stop it from arriving and the dark science of making annoying strangers profitable.\nFlag turns that model on its head. You, your company or cause, are not sending junk, you\u2019re sponsering gifts. Your ads, and the photos they fund, are looked forward to, shared and cherished. You can join the ranks of people who aren't doing horrible stuff.\nJunk mail is sent slowly in bulk, gets glanced at if you\u2019re lucky, and is then quickly thrown away. \nFlag will deliver your ad by first-class mail, in a sealed envelope, matched to a photo we can guarantee the recipient has asked for, or been sent as a gift. \nYour ads don\u2019t need to plead for attention because the photo, caption and metadata is something the recipient wants. That means you don\u2019t need a designer and can use one of our templates without compromising your ads effectiveness. Hooray for the little 'guy'.\nBelow we\u2019ve tried to compare like-with-like so you can see how your ad spend will compare with Flag and junk. \nWe\u2019ve assumed junk mail is sent at normal postcard rates as adding the cost of Flag's first-class postage, and including the delivery tracking Flag will offer, would increase the cost of sending junk mail to a point where it would be a source of incredulity.

Today, it's easy to look back and see the many ways this \u201cinsanely great\u201d little machine has transformed our world.\nIn honor of its 30th year, we're going to harness the creative excitement that surrounded the 1984 birth of the Macintosh to help young people pursue careers in technology. First up was the birthday celebration called Mac@30 (www.mac30th.com) which reunited members of the original development team to share memories with a live audience.\nFor those who didn't live through it, it's hard to imagine the excitement and the sense of possibility the Mac generated. An industry sprang up to support the platform, taking it to new levels with software and accessories that allowed even more creative innovation. The Mac30th celebration will bring together many of these folks.\nMac aficionados from around the world joined us to enjoy panel discussions by many of the key players behind the Macintosh. They heard anecdotes about the seminal days of WYSIWYG technology and audio and video presentations that relive important moments in the history of the Macintosh.\nAs some folks at Apple recently said: \"Don't worry! If you missed the live event!\" We have a plan for that though. We've designed a very cool mosaic poster to commemorate the Macintosh 2014 Anniversary year, and you can still be part of the excitement.

I love my Pebble, it has become an essential device in my everyday life. It is an extension of my phone and has become a more convenient way to view my notifications quickly. I wanted to extend this functionality of the Pebble beyond my wrist and felt a dock would be the solution for all my needs. So I set out to design a dock that met the demands of a \"smartwatch\".\nPLEASE NOTE FOR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nThe Sidekick will only be shipping to countries that offer E-Delivery Confirmation through USPS. The following countries are:\nAustralia, Belgium, Brazil, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Israel, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland\nThe Sidekick is a whole new docking experience for a totally new device, a solution to protect and have easy access to your Pebble when it's off your wrist. The ultimate goal was to design a dock that allowed you to use one hand to dock and undock your Pebble in the easiest way possible. \n1 Dock on the fly, literally. Finding the path to least resistance was the key to achieve this goal, and after many test and design iterations I determined simple side access to be the option I was looking for. The connection between the Pebble and magnetic charger is made in midair with no obstacles in between or the need to thread the watch band through a slot. It's the absolute fastest and easiest way to dock the Pebble to the magnetic charger. You won't have any hesitations or fear of the charging cable accidentally dropping to the floor just to check the time or notifications.\n2 Unlike other smartwatches on the market a full charge on the Pebbles' battery can last 5-7 days. The Sidekick takes advantage of this and allows you to dock your watch off the charger without drawing power and avoids an unnecessary charge. Now the Pebble's display is viewable off your wrist so there's no need to pick up the watch. It's conveniently angled to easily see the time or notifications when you're lying in bed or at the desk.\nStays firmly in place. The key feature for the Sidekick is its ability to stay in place during docking and undocking. This is achieved by powerful micro suction technology which is adhered to the bottom of the base. The micro suction sticks to nonporous surfaces, leaves no residue and only needs a to be wiped with water if it loses suction due to debris.\nWatch bands. The Sidekick has a 1\" x 1/4\" slot (see below) to allow various band thicknesses and accommodates the standard 22 mm wide bands. The style or size should not matter when the Pebble is connected to the charger since the only thing touching are the charging elements. The strength of the magnetic charger has been tested by placing a 5.35 oz metal watch band on top of a Pebble while it was connected to the charger and it successfully held the weight. Cover protectors and wide bands have not been tested.\nCharging cable.The Sidekick is finely crafted with precision cuts to hold the original Pebble magnetic charging cable with just the right amount of force to secure it in place. The cable part of the charger is left loose so it easily removes without pulling. Having a permanent anchor for the cable prevents wire wear that can occur with too much handling. The Sidekick does not ship with a charging cable and has not been tested with aftermarket charging cables.\nOne more thing. The Sidekick is small and durable enough to take with you when you're on the go. When the Pebble is not on the dock the slot can be used as a cable anchor thanks to the power of micro suction.\nThe Sidekick is handcrafted and designed to complement the Pebble's aesthetic value with the use of material, color and form which is suited for any space. The final design has been represented on this project page with the colors that will be available for rewards. Each Sidekick is carefully finished by hand giving each final product character with a sculpted like appearance. The approach is minimalistic with just the essential elements applied. It's small and compact perfect for the nightstand and office desk. The Sidekick is a premium crafted product made with North American Hard White Maple for its durability and beautiful grain. Matte Black and Matte White finishes are available which are applied 3 coats of paint and cured for several days. The Maple Sidekick is finished with a bees wax to retain as much of its natural color giving off a beautiful subtle sheen. Due to their handcrafted nature, slight variations will be present.\nAlso available is a Kickstarter Exclusive Walnut Laser Engraved Edition Reward for people making pledges $25 and over. You have 2 lines and 17 letters per line for your inscription. The North American Hard Walnut is from Kentucky and is finished with bees wax for a beautiful subtle sheen.\nForm+Function\nThe method I used  to form the shape of the Sidekick is a subtractive  process. This project was a design exercise in which the final goal was to have an object rely solely on its form for its function. The Sidekick makes the Pebble useful when it's off your wrist.\nI designed the Sidekick because I had a simple need, but as the project progressed, a whole different narrative shifted my thinking. I no longer just wanted a dock to rest a watch on, I wanted a dock for a \"smartwatch\". This simple pivot re-focused my design goal and provided the final direction.\nThe questions I asked on this project helped formulate the building blocks for the Sidekick. Questions like \"what is a smartwatch and how do you use it?\" Every part of the Sidekick is an answer to a question and executed with honesty and passion for the process. There were no choices to be made, just an instinctive action to document my experience with the Pebble. Defining the function along with taking notes on how I was interacting with the Pebble led me to identify similarities with existing devices that we already use, specifically the phone and clock. The Sidekick was conceived and is an extension of these two devices.\nPLAY\n\n (no audio)\nDocumont Workshop\nThe Sidekick was conceived, designed and will be made in my workshop. The lumber is supplied by a local, family owned mill, hand picked for the finest grain. I own all the necessary equipment to produce the Sidekick and have outside sources for extra help and consulting. I've simulated production runs and have successfully produced accurate and quality results in quantities. The Sidekick is a beautiful and individually crafted product. This craftsmanship takes time and care to deliver a final product that has value and character. If the pledges exceeds our goal I will create new pledges for a second production run. The production schedule and logistics have been worked out and I am now confident to start sharing the Sidekick with you.  \nSidekick Goal\nKickstarters, I look to this community for support because without you the Pebble would not have been as successful as it is. It is my goal to offer a choice to Pebble owners looking for ways to protect their investment. Backing this project will help cover the initial cost of materials, tools, consumables and logistics. A portion of the funds will cover some of the expenses incurred on developing the Sidekick. A successful project will not only launch the Sidekick but will also give Documont the kickstart it needs. Let's together contribute to the Pebble's thriving ecosystem and deliver a dock thoughtfully designed for a smartwatch. Thanks for your support.\nShipping\nShipping out of Canada can be very expensive. I decided to source out an alternative service that will reduce the shipping cost and will allow me to ship out of the U.S by way of U.S Postal Service. I've tested the service and shipped out the Sidekick to Texas, Vancouver and The Netherlands and the package was delivered in good condition and within the estimated delivery times. The Sidekick will only be shipped internationally to countries that offer E-Delivery Confirmation, please see the list below. International delivery dates may vary country to country due to customs, distance and duties. You will be responsible for any duty fees and taxes applied by customs. Estimated delivery of shipments is as follows:\nUSPS\nU.S - 5 to 7 Business Days - First Class with tracking.\nCanada - 7 to 10 Business Days - First Class with tracking.\nInternational - 10 to 20 Business Days - First Class no tracking, E-Delivery Confirmation (UK is the fastest and Australia will take the longest)\nI will be shipping only to countries that offer E-Delivery Confirmation through USPS. The following countries are:\nAustralia, Belgium, Brazil, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Israel, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland\nProduction Schedule\nProvided this campaign reaches its target, rewards aim to be delivered in April. If pledges exceed our funding goal new rewards will be created for a second run for delivery in May.\n  Me + Documont\nMy name is Rodney Timbol and I run my own multidisciplined design company with my brother Ted in Toronto, Canada. We have developed a diverse client base from local to international partners. I started Documont outside client work 3 years ago as a personal creative exercise to examine the objects and products around me. Everything I do is done with conviction and passion, including a dock for a smartwatch. Documont has allowed me to self-indulge in the thing I love to do most, create.\nPlease support this project by sharing it with your friends by clicking the sharing buttons below the video, anything to help spread the word would be a great help to reach our goals to share the Sidekick.

Our Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can still order yours on our website www.decibullz.com. \nI have been frustrated for years with uncomfortable earphones that wouldn't stay in my ears. So I set out to find an earphone that stayed put, felt good, and sounded great. After extensive research, I concluded that the only way to fit earphones precisely is to mold them to the exact shape of the user\u2019s ear. Unfortunately the current custom molding process is very expensive and very time consuming. So I invented Decibullz, an easy and affordable custom molded earphone. \nThe Decibullz earphone mold is composed of a nontoxic and biodegradable thermoplastic that makes the molding process remarkably simple: the mold is heated in water, either by microwave or on the kitchen stove, and allowed to cool to slightly above room temperature. The user then presses the mold to his ear, molding it to an exact fit in about four minutes. Once the material has cured, the user has an amazingly comfortable earphone that will never fall out.\nIf the fit isn't perfect the first time, Decibullz can be remolded until you get the fit you want. It is the only custom earphone system in the world that is re-moldable.\nDuring the last two years I have been working to create an easy and affordable custom molded earphone. Last year I was extremely excited to release the first version of Decibullz. Over the last 12 months Decibullz has created a following of amazing customers. They have given their feedback and ideas to help develop and improve the next generation of Decibullz. I have combined that feedback with everything I have learned in the past two years to create an even better custom molded earphone system. \nThe new earphone has been painstakingly redesigned to fully utilize the Decibullz custom molds. This allows for custom tuning of the earphones to achieve optimal audio performance. \nThis new design also makes it much easier for users to create a perfect fitting and great sounding earphone. I have accomplished this by combining our unique molding material with a specially selected silicone tip. The soft tip aligns the earphone in the ear canal and creates a comfortable sound-isolating seal. The tip works in conjunction with the molding material that conforms to the concha (bowl part of the ear) to keep the earphone secure and comfortable. The molding material also creates a second seal for better sound and greater noise isolation. The new earphones have a very low profile so they can be easily used with hats and helmets. \nThe production model will be an improved version of the fully functional prototype. \nThe Decibullz system makes molding your custom earphones extremely easy. Simply heat the thermoplastic molds in a cup of water in the microwave, snap on your earphones, and shape the molds to the unique shape of your ears. \nThe molding material stays pliable at slightly above room temperature for several minutes. This allows it to be placed into the ear and molded safely.  \nAs a designer I jumped at the opportunity to put my skills to use creating a product that I was passionate about. For my early prototypes I tried using silicone, epoxy, wax, and various other materials to create the custom molds. After hundreds of failed attempts I finally developed a material that was safe, comfortable and re-moldable.  \nThe unique properties of the molding material made it extremely difficult to manufacture. In fact, I couldn't find one factory willing to even try it in their expensive machines. As luck would have it one of my neighbors happened to own a manufacturing facility and was willing to help me out. We spent the next several months learning how to manufacture our custom molds. \nI released the first version of Decibullz Earphones at CES 2013. Since then Decibullz has received some great media attention and was even selected as one of the Five Best Exercise Headphones by lifehacker.com. \nShortly after the launch of the first generation of Decibullz I began working on improvements for the next version. After several months of designing and testing I have been able to create an even better custom molded earphone system. The new system is easier to mold, sounds better, and has greater noise-isolation than the previous generation. \nCustom molded earphones are vastly superior to conventional earphone designs. Because of their custom fit they can be worn for long periods of time and won't become uncomfortable. They also do not become dislodged while participating in vigorous activities and will block out noise better than conventional earphones.  \nHeadphones Type: Headset - Binaural\nHeadphones Form Factor: Custom Molded In-ear\nConnectivity Technology: Wired\nSound Output Mode: Stereo\nFrequency Response: 20 - 20000 Hz\nSensitivity: 92 dB\nImpedance: 16 Ohm\nDiaphragm: 0.2 in.\nMagnet Material: Neodymium\nCord Length: 44 in.\nAdditional Features: Noise isolating, Flat anti-tangle cord\nConnector Type: Headset (Stereo 3.5 mm jack)\nRemote: In-line Single Button Remote and Microphone\nIncluded Accessories: 1 set of custom molds, 3 sets of silicone ear tips S, M, L\nI have set a funding goal of $40,000. That will be enough money to bring this new version of Decibullz to market.\nGeneral use of funds will be used to create the specialized tools needed to manufacture the new earphone and electronics as well as the new mold design. \nI have been working with local manufacturers to develop the methods and machinery needed to manufacture our unique molds. We have perfected our methods and are ready to start manufacturing as soon as we have the tools needed for the new design.

We are Peter Dunham and Linnea Gits, the designers and artists behind the Chicago design studio, Uusi and we are excited to introduce our project to you; an entirely hand painted deck of Limited Edition playing cards called \"Pagan.\"\nPagan is the fourth Limited Edition deck in our six deck series that began over a year ago. With every deck we create we try to use a new medium so each one has its own distinctive look. The artwork for our first, sold-out deck, \"Blue Blood\", was created entirely with color pencil. For our second deck, \"Bohemia\" we chose the velvety look of gouache to give the artwork a lush, expressive quality. \"Royal Optik\" was all about the line, so with pen & ink we decided to create a woodcut style with the intense geometric patterns of Op Art. For \"Pagan\" we have returned to one of the oldest mediums in art: oil paint.\nOur inspiration for \"Pagan\" came from our love of the great forests and lakes of Northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The smell of the woods, their silence and the enormous beauty of the forests and lakes in that region of the US has always inspired us.  When you are deep in the forest the feeling of wilderness is intense and it was that feeling that became the creative starting point for our new deck. \nTaking that primal experience and expressing it visually led us to the Pagan era.  This was a time in history when religious belief went hand in hand with people's everyday interaction with nature. The expression of this belief played out in different festivals, customs and myths in countries around the world. We chose the pagan regions and customs that covered the fjords and forests of Scandinavia, to the mountainous lands of Central Europe and the misty shores of the British isles to finally, the vast, endless forests and tundras of Russia for inspiration. Those lands bear a resemblance to the forests of the US whose trees, plants and woodland animals and their intense, earthy colors made their way into the costumes, pips and patterns we created for the original artwork in the \"Pagan\" deck.  \n The Ace of Spades is an important card in the deck as it sets the tone and look of the deck and is the place where your company signature appears. For Pagan, we chose a young woodland tree that has been felled for use, but continues to live on and epitomizes the phrase: Bowed but unbroken. \n The Pagan Jokers are true \"wild\" cards! We love creating an original joker for each deck we make as they embody the deck's personality in the most playful way and add a little levity to the games of risk & chance played with them. \n Our Diptych Ad Cards are unique to Uusi. We were the first designers to develop a diptych for playing cards and used it for the first time on our \"Royal Optik\" deck. The diptych was originally inspired by transformation decks whose cards, when pieced together form a larger image. We feel they add an original, artistic flair to what otherwise would have become a throw-away set of cards in the deck and bring the perfect last touch to the uncut sheets. For \"Pagan\" our diptych image is based on the mythological pagan horse called, \"Sleipnir\" (\"Slippy\"). As Norse legend has it, Sleipnir is an eight legged horse who is the favorite steed of the Norse god, Odin.\nWe're going borderless! That's right \u2013 we're getting heathen on you. No civilized, \"white fences\" for this deck! Instead we're returning to one of the original playing card design elements \u2013 the borderless back. We have wanted to use this type of back ever since we first began designing our decks, but it wasn't until now that we felt the theme and look perfectly allowed for it.  We have a special update for this project that will go further into the history and uses of the borderless back \u2013 can't wait to share it with you!\nMinimalistic and yet, rich with detail and texture, the Pagan tuck box was designed to reward the senses with it's intricate embossing and elegant gold pattern work. The shimmering gold look of the Pagan tuck box and card backs was achieved by carefully replicating the look of gold leaf with oil paint.  \nHeavy weight, premium uncoated paper stock.\nEmbossing on intricate pattern design and lettering on box.\nPagan Tuckbox Front\nPagan Tuck Box Back\n *All images of the deck and tuck boxes you see in these photos are prototypes made at Uusi's studio.

It will be wonderful to reach $15,000 and we may be able to do it with your help. The $9 pledge is sold out but you can pledge $18 or more to help us reach the goal.\nTo celebrate the final day of the Kickstarter campaign, I'm running a \"name the cat\" contest. The fluffy white cat on the cover of the book has no name. Please suggest a name for the cat. If your name is selected, you'll be acknowledged in the book as the person who named the cat.\nName the Cat\nRails developers are often playful and light-hearted. The book (and the cat) reflects that spirit, not just to make Rails less intimidating for beginners, but to give newcomers a feel for the community.\nThanks for your support!\nSTRETCH GOAL - Accomplished!\nWoot! We've surpassed the initial goal. It's clear there is tremendous enthusiasm for this project. I want to take it further than originally planned with a STRETCH GOAL of $14,000. There's not much time remaining, but with your help, we can make the new goal, and I'll be able to add a vital EXTRA CHAPTER to the book, introducing Test-Driven Development. It's the most requested addition to the book, and I've got some great ideas about how to introduce just enough TDD to get a beginner started on the path to success. That's what the project is all about -- please contribute! The deadline is coming soon.\nThe Initial Campaign:\nThe need for a book for beginners has never been stronger.\nI've written the book that beginners need the most. It\u2019s titled Learn Ruby on Rails and you, with the help of our Rails community, can get it published and distributed.\n\"Learn Ruby on Rails is a great book for anyone starting to learn web development, giving you the context and explanations at the right time in an encouraging way.\" -- Linda Liukas, co-founder of Rails Girls, 1 Oct 2013\nLearn Ruby on Rails is a book\u2026\nFor newcomers to Rails who have no prior experience as web developers.\nFor people who aren't programmers and want to be.\nTo cover the gaps left unfilled by more advanced Rails books.\nWith your help, I will complete the final two chapters of the book, launch it, and see to it that thousands of Rails beginners, for the first time, will have a user-friendly book that provides a solid, easy-to-understand foundation needed to succeed with Rails.\nMy hope is that you will become involved in this Kickstarter project so that together, as a developer community, we will, for the first time, have a book we can recommend to new hordes of enthusiasts eager to learn Rails. From what I've seen in my experience as a teacher, the Rails tutorials we have now are too complicated and over their heads. Perhaps I should explain.\nHow did you learn Rails?\nMy name is Daniel Kehoe. If you're a Rails developer like me, you probably learned the hard way, piecing together your Rails knowledge by reading hundreds of blog posts, Googling a thousand times, and getting coaching from a friend or colleague like me.\nAnd if you're like me, you were already a skilled programmer involved in web development before you learned Rails.\nBut not everyone has this background. I'd like to see a better and easier way for newcomers to learn Rails.\n\"I *love* what you're doing with this book. Specifically, that you're explaining and putting in context the whole ecosystem around Rails. Much needed for people just entering the field.\" -- Avdi Grimm, 1 Oct 2013\nIt's not so easy now.\nAs you know, Rails is getting more complicated. At the same time, it\u2019s becoming really, really popular.\nTwo years ago, for most people, learning web development entailed reading a book on PHP and studying some JavaScript. Not anymore. Now, anyone eager to become a web developer wants to learn Ruby on Rails. Even if they don't know what it is. Rails has a solid and escalating word-of-mouth buzz.\nIn the classes I teach and the meetups I attend, I've met hundreds of students from all walks of life who have heard about Rails and want to learn more. Graphic designers. Social media folks. Hobbyists. Webmasters. Nonprofit volunteers. Moms and dads. Young and old.\nThey\u2019ve heard Rails is powerful\u2013\u2013the most popular framework for web development. They are enthusiastic to learn it.\nBut, there\u2019s a problem. A problem you can help solve.\nWhy I wrote this book.\nAs experienced developers, we already have a library of exceptional books on Rails to recommend. Books written by Michael Hartl, Obie Fernandez, Ryan Bigg, Sam Ruby, and others, to name a few.\nLike you, I recommend these fine primers because they helped me to learn Rails. But I know you agree, those books are very demanding and certainly not easy for beginners to comprehend.\nAt best, they are intermediate level books, best suited for experienced programmers and web developers. Have you seen beginners start one of those books? Only to quickly stop reading and toss their hands up in frustration? We know why. It\u2019s because the only books we have to recommend for learning Rails are geared toward those who, in fact, are not beginners.\nIt is time for a new book for the newcomer.\nMy book, Learn Ruby on Rails, is the first book written precisely for beginners. It is THE book for those with no prior experience as web developers or programmers.\nLet me introduce myself\u2026\nPerhaps you know me by reputation. I run the open source RailsApps project. I've been doing web application development since 1991, as one of the first few dozen developers on the www-talk mailing list with Tim Berners-Lee.\nI started using Rails in 2006, with a leg-up boost from starter apps developed by Courtenay Gasking and the Caboose gang. After years of slogging along with Perl, Java, and PHP, discovering Rails brought joy to my programming life.\nLater, I launched the RailsApps project to provide open source example applications. And I started writing tutorials to accompany the starter apps. You see, in the early days of the web, I was a writer and editor for PC World and NeXTWorld magazines, among others. I wrote one of the only books about the NeXT computer and edited Internet Basics (Random House, 1993). Because of my background as a skilled writer, my tutorials became very popular with Rails developers.\nThough I now focus on open source projects and startups, I still love to find ways to make writing about technology fun to read. Software development, as you know, is a craft full of joy and satisfaction. We need user friendly writing that simplifies, satisfies, and motivates readers. Honestly, I believe that reading about web development should be fun! Especially for beginners. And that is why, and how, I wrote Learn Ruby on Rails.\nWe\u2019ve got to get newcomers up to speed on Rails.\nLearn Ruby on Rails is my first book in many years. Observing so many newcomers struggling to learn Rails, many giving up, I decided it was time, and a necessity, to write a user-friendly book that is simple to understand, easy to read, and that celebrates the beauty and efficacy of Rails.\nSome hardcore developers will say newbies should try harder and that only the gifted will survive. That line of reasoning does not serve our community. As developers, we all know Rails has become more and more complex over the years. We also know, for the sake of the Rails community, and for our Internet economy to move forward, we've got to get more people up to speed with Rails.\nIn San Francisco, I see firsthand how startups are held back due to a lack of qualified developers. And it\u2019s not just here. It's the same in Austin, Seattle, NYC, London, Berlin, Singapore, Barcelona.\nImmersive code camps, like General Assembly and Dev Bootcamp, are springing up. But they\u2019re not enough. The startup world needs more senior engineers, which means we need junior developers, which means we need beginners, and we need to help the beginners transition from simple HTML and CSS to application development.\nWe can all agree we need more videos and boot camps. But we also need Learn Ruby on Rails, the first and only introductory Rails primer that provides a solid foundation for beginners.\nWhat's in Learn Ruby on Rails?\nLearn Ruby on Rails is short. Purposely so. A student can complete the book with a single dedicated weekend of reading and coding. My goal in writing the book is to make available a beginner\u2019s book that rapidly communicates Rails\u2019 most important concepts while giving a student the satisfaction of building a real application.\nI\u2019ve found it\u2019s much more difficult writing a book for beginners than writing for experienced developers. After all, given so many divergent backgrounds and learning styles, how do you introduce complex abstractions without losing the student?\nI've coached for Rails Girls and taught for RailsBridge, two outstanding organizations that are leading the way in cultivating engineering skills among women and other under-represented newcomers to the Rails community.\nI've taught my own courses as well and, for more than a year, fine-tuned the curriculum on which this book is based. I've tested and retested in my classes and got outstanding feedback from my students.\nAt just over 200 pages, Learn Ruby on Rails introduces every key concept. From this book, a beginner can build a real-world Rails application. The only background required? A little knowledge of HTML and CSS.\nLearn Ruby on Rails is not merely a classroom exercise or a \"taste of coding\" walk-through. The book introduces professional development practices, so newcomers to Rails will be well-prepared when they work on real-world, open-source projects, in startups, or in the enterprise workplace.\nIn writing the book, I made some controversial choices. I didn\u2019t use the \"scaffolding\" shortcuts that are often taught in beginner tutorials. To prepare students for real-world development, the book covers version management with RVM and similar utilities, as well as showing how to use Git for source control. Test-driven development is introduced conceptually and shown in a final chapter.\nThough the book is short, it has a greater depth than most introductory web development tutorials.\nLearn Rails in a Weekend? I Don\u2019t Think So.\nIt takes many months, possibly years, to develop the skills of a senior developer. The habits established in the early stages are critical. What you will like about Learn Ruby on Rails is that in one dedicated weekend of reading and coding, a beginner can learn enough to confidently and competently continue with more challenging material, because the book provides concepts and strategies that make it easy for beginners to succeed with more advanced Rails tutorials.\nWhy the Kickstarter campaign?\nI\u2019ve put together this Kickstarter campaign in hopes that you and other members of the community will see the benefit of helping me complete and launch Learn Ruby on Rails.\nYou'll be happy to hear, I've already written the book (all but two final chapters). I've had years of experience as a professional writer. I know how difficult it is to deliver a full-length book on time. I decided instead to first finish the book and then ask you to support the final stages. For the book to be truly valuable for beginners, I want it to be of the highest quality.\nWhat\u2019s needed is funding for final production costs\u2013\u2013technical editing, adding illustrations and images, formatting, and creating a cover. It will be self-published and initially released as an eBook. I've produced a PDF version of the pre-release edition of the book and I also intend to release it in ePub and Kindle formats so that it will reach a greater number of beginners.\nGetting the book out there.\nI\u2019m hoping to exceed the funding goal because any and all additional funds will support an advertising campaign.\nAlthough I'm counting on you to help me get the word out by promoting the book in your blogs, and telling your Twitter and Facebook followers, frankly, newcomers to web development are not yet my followers or yours.\nI've analyzed the marketing efforts of well-known commercial teaching products, and deduced that the best way to get the book in the hands of the largest number of newcomers is by executing a Google AdWords campaign in tandem with strategically selected display advertising. With a large enough base of support, I can provide future revisions as Rails changes, attract the interest of hard-copy publishers, and collaborate on foreign-language translations.\nBenefits for the community.\nWhat\u2019s in it for you, and the Rails community?\nWell, first of all, together we can welcome others into the Rails community. You can help newcomers feel the sense of pride and joy you felt when you deployed your first Rails application. Together, we can make it easier for the next generation of developers to get introduced to Rails\u2019 professional practices. Together, we will pave the way to widen the talent pool.\nI\u2019m sure you agree with me, that it's up to our community to make sure all those who want to learn Rails have a solid start in learning best practices and core concepts. More and more are learning Rails. Let's make certain they produce quality code. I've done my part by writing the book. Now it's up to you to help get the word out.\nBenefits befitting you!\nNot only will you have the satisfaction of helping newcomers learn Rails, you\u2019ll also be rewarded for your generosity. Here\u2019s how\u2026\nPledge $9\nPledge $9 bucks and I\u2019m going to send you a copy of Learn Ruby on Rails when it\u2019s released in January. You'll get an eBook in your choice of formats\u2013\u2013PDF, Kindle or ePub\u2013\u2013at a 50% discount off the anticipated published price of $18.\nPledge $18\nDo you want to see Learn Ruby on Rails right now? Would you like the ebook on your screen immediately? Pledge $18, and you will get a pre-release edition, and the chance to help me finish the book. I'd love to have your feedback and suggestions before the final book is completed.\nYou probably know someone who is eager and ready to learn Rails, or who is learning it now. The eBook is yours to share with a friend as soon as your pledge is recorded. Help them make their way, the right way.\nPledge $25\nEarlier I mentioned Rails Girls and RailsBridge. These nonprofits help expand the Rails community to include people who are under-represented in the technology field. Every weekend, somewhere in the world, there are students learning Rails at free workshops organized by these wonderful organizations and others.\nI intend to give Learn Ruby on Rails to students enrolled in free Rails workshops, free of charge. Your support for the book makes it possible, so your name will appear as a sponsor when a student downloads their free book (you can remain anonymous if you like).\nPledge $35\nPledge $35 and get stickers for the book. It's a great way to show your support and help friends learn about Learn Ruby on Rails. Everybody loves stickers: put a sticker on your laptop, skateboard, refrigerator, and show you care about helping newcomers.\nAs soon as you pledge $35 and I receive your mailing address, I will hand address and mail you a package with your stickers and a personal thank you note. You'll get a book sticker plus a bonus sticker with the Rails trucker hat logo you\u2019ve seen on my GitHub pages and Twitter account.\nPledge $100\nHave you seen the Rails trucker hat that appears as the logo for the RailsApps open source project? Did you know there actually is a Rails trucker hat? For years, there was only one Rails trucker hat in existence. It was handmade for me by a supporter in North Carolina.\nI gave that genuine rarity away at a Rails user group meeting in Guangzhou, China. But, don\u2019t despair, I've purchased A DOZEN new Rails trucker hats and I'm waiting to send one to you. Wear it when you\u2019re driving your rig. Use it as a thinking cap when you are coding. Or just display it as a collectible on a bookshelf in your office or workspace. It's truly unique!\nPledge $350\nLearn Ruby on Rails is a study guide to help beginners prepare for more advanced learning materials, such as the online tutorials from the RailsApps project. The RailsApps tutorials are intermediate and advanced guides for experienced developers. They\u2019re available by subscription only, at $19 per month, per person.\nStep forward and show your support with a $350 pledge and you will receive 10 ONE YEAR SUBSCRIPTIONS you can share with your development team, members of your local user group or meetup, or anyone you choose to invite.\nNot only will you support Rails beginners by launching Learn Ruby on Rails, but with my famous guides to well-tested starter applications you will help the developers on your team get more productive.\nDo I have to pledge?\nI'm offering a wide range of benefits because I\u2019d like everyone in the Rails community, regardless of their circumstances, to support this project. If you can\u2019t afford to support the project with a financial pledge, you can support it adding a \"LIKE\" on Facebook, a post to Twitter or a blog, or you can tell a few friends about it.\nOur mission, if you choose to help, is to get the word out to newcomers that Learn Ruby on Rails is available. By doing so, the entire Rails community benefits. But please, if you can, pledge what you can, so we can reach as many newcomers as possible.\nYours in Community, \nDaniel Kehoe\nP.S. I invite you to email me with your thoughts and suggestions for the book. Tell me your story. How did you learn Rails? What were the biggest challenges you faced? What advice do you have that I can share with beginners?

There are still plenty of incentives left and all extra funds will go toward promotion...much love and gratitude, Lena\nHi, I'm Lena Prima. I have been working as a professional singer for most of my life, a great portion of which I've spent doing a loving tribute to my father, music legend Louis Prima. After years of living and ultimately dying in Las Vegas, I decided to let go of everything I had, move back to my childhood home of New Orleans and start over. I arrived there in December of 2011 to not only uncover my family history, but to also uncover, finally, who I am. After I arrived, I began performing immediately at the beautiful Hotel Monteleone in the French Quarter, with a great six piece band. Everything was going wonderfully until I became very ill. Life threateningly ill. After an agonizing year, I finally found a drug that would allow me to lead a fairly normal existence. I came to the conclusion that life is short and if I wanted to make my own mark on the world, to create a legacy of my own or even try to make the world a little bit better, the time was NOW! \nThe result of this epiphany is my new album...\"Starting Something\", which is also the title of the artwork I am using for the cover by the inspiring New Orleans artist and life coach, Jax Frey. I am recording right now with some of the finest musicians and singers in the world. My very talented friend, renowned New Orleans singer and songwriter Ingrid Lucia, as well as my wonderful and talented husband Tim Fahey agreed to collaborate with me in writing and producing twelve original songs about my journey, finding courage, miracles, grace, love, and having a positive outlook on life. I am also including two cover songs I adore, one by John Fogerty and one by Sass Jordan. This album is dedicated to the idea that it's never too late to accomplish your heart's desire and create your own legacy. I am so blessed to be able to be making this record, it's something I believe in with my whole heart. I know a lot of you will be able to identify with these songs. I'm hoping to touch a nerve within you, too. \nBut.......I need your help to complete this project. To make this album in the professional manner that it deserves, is expensive. Back in the day, record companies paid all the expenses, including promotion and tour support. That scenario is very rare these days. That's what is so great about Kickstarter. It's a beautiful way for artists like me to be able to achieve our goals in the fields that we were born to be in. And you get to be part of growing a wonderful new creation. \nI worked hard to make the incentives appealing, valuable and fun. The goal amount I have set will pay for the album to be professionally mixed and mastered. It will also pay for the production costs and musicians. More money will be needed, however, for marketing and tour support. I'm hoping to raise enough to accomplish everything that is needed to properly see this through. (Important to note, if I don't reach the goal amount, I won't get any of the funds) \nA lot of you out there have appreciated that I have been honoring my father, but you have always let me know that you would love to hear MY music. So...thank you for inspiring me to do this, it's the best thing I've ever done and I know you will be proud of me. \nI thank you in advance and, if I have not already, I hope to meet you and thank you in person. \nLena", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFirst of all, my team and I have confidence in the quality of this project. We also do not anticipate any delays occurring in the production. \nThere are however, still a couple of challenges.\n\nFirst, once the record is finished, we will need to promote it both in the states and abroad. It costs approximately $2500 per month to properly promote a record. Second, a tour to support the album will need to to happen. The costs vary according to the venue. I intend to use any funds above the goal to accomplish these things.\n\nThank you again!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 15, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/961101957/lena-primas-new-album-starting-something", "project_name": "Lena Prima's new album \"Starting Something\""}}, {"backer": "Andrew Soderberg", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "WE FUNDED!!!  BUT...\nIf you missed the Kickstarter campaign, you can still help get to the next stretch goal (and get Obduction and more) at obductiongame.com! \n Ob`duc\u00b4tion, n.1. The act of drawing or laying over, as a covering. \nObduction is an all-new, real-time, first-person adventure that harkens back to the spirit of Cyan\u2019s earlier games Myst and Riven. Obduction resurrects that incredible feeling of suddenly finding yourself in the middle of a new world to explore, discover, solve, and become part of.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of Myst, one of the best-selling computer games in history. Myst was an exploration through a landscape of dramatically realistic images (rendered in Strata - check out the new Strata reward tier!) tied together to create an experience that was described as \u201cbecoming your world.\u201d The Myst name is widely recognized as uniquely defining a new kind of gaming - amazingly immersive worlds where the point is to understand your environment rather than test your reflexes. The Obduction project will take what Cyan knows about creating deeply immersive worlds and apply it to an entirely new game with fantastic scenery, incredible architecture, compelling story, and exceptional challenges.\nObduction will be built with the same framework that made Cyan's earlier games such a wonderful experience: stunning landscapes, deep storyline, engaging characters, dramatic soundscapes, and challenging yet intuitive puzzles. Obduction is an entirely new property, delivered using one of the most powerful game development technologies available today. Obduction is an adventure game for the new millennium that stays true to the concepts that made the genre great.\nAt the base funding level, Obduction will be developed for both Windows and MacOS, with a targeted release of mid-to-late 2015.\nThe game is being designed with a flexible scope in mind, so that as the budget grows, the game grows. More places; more puzzles; more mystery; more complexity; more adventure!\nWith the generalities out of the way, it's time to dig a bit deeper into specifics. If you know anything about Cyan's worlds, you know that you don't want to know too much ahead of time. We'll try our best to whet your appetite, without giving away too many spoilers.\nStory\nObduction's experience supplies what every good storyteller does: a very personal window into a much larger world. Obduction begins with... well\u2026 an abduction - your abduction. On a crystal clear, moon-lit night, a curious, organic artifact drops from the sky and inexplicably whisks you away across the universes to who-knows-where (or when, or why).\nAnd, as anyone who ever played Myst or Riven knows, exploring everything around you allows you to read between the lines and to begin to answer your questions. Why is there an old, abandoned farmhouse - complete with white picket fence - in the middle of an alien landscape? You'll find out. From this point on the story becomes your story. \nGame Design\nObduction has a few game design elements in common with Myst and Riven, and it skews into new areas as well. Cyan's basic design philosophy is simple:\nBuild every element of the experience to make you, the player, feel like this virtual world has become your world.\nThe interface should be intuitive and transparent.\nThe story should be revealed through exploration and not necessarily shoveled out in cinematic form.\nThe puzzles should range from easy to difficult, but even the toughest puzzles should be designed so that you know that all the pieces to solve it are there in front of you.\nThe sound and music should be balanced; they should add emotion but not become distracting or annoying.\nEnvironmental Immersion\nCyan has a proven history of delivering visually stunning environments that immerse players in our games. We plan to continue that tradition, leveraging Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4. Today's modern realtime engines have plenty of horse-power to produce zillions of bullets per second, but they can also be used to make remarkable landscapes and architecture that approach and even surpass the pre-rendered days of Riven. Unreal 4 is an amazing resource that enables us to build a world that you can lose yourself in.\nClick here for more info regarding the Unreal Engine 4...\nWe\u2019ve got add-ons. Three to be precise - add on a digital game, a boxed game, or a t-shirt. Here\u2019s how it works: Increase your pledge by the cost of the desired add-on(s) without changing your selected reward tier. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you\u2019ll receive a survey where you can confirm which add-on(s) you wanted. (Note that shipping is included in the amount of the add-on.)\nWe'll be excited to reach our target goal and make an amazing experience. But we're also anticipating what it means to move beyond that goal. Kickstarter funding over the base level would be used to make Obduction bigger and better - adding such stretch goals as new places to explore, additional platforms, localization, technological bells and whistles, and more.\nVery simple: It's what we love!\nWe love the wonder of having an entirely new world at our fingertips. We love the twisted unraveling of an unexpected storyline. We love the satisfying \"Aha! moment\" of solving a particularly perplexing puzzle. We love the rush of revelation when we find out what's around the next corner. We love the twinge of emotion entering a dimly lit room because we feel like this place has become our world.\nAnd we hear from more and more people who love all of those things, too. We'd love to make it for you!\nCyan has done it all. We started with self-publishing, hand-stuffing 3.5-inch floppies into boxes. We've done full-blown publisher models, where they get 88%. And we've even done all kinds of hybrid publishing models between the two. \nCurrently, we are independent, and it feels right. It's not the Myst heyday - money has come and gone, but we've managed to stay alive as a small, independent studio through times when indie studios were falling by the wayside. And now it seems that times have changed, and indie studios are making a comeback thanks to some interesting new publishing platforms and models - including Kickstarter.\n\nSimply put, Kickstarter is a way for us to deliver a stunning experience that doesn't empty your pocketbook, while keeping us independent enough to make choices that a publisher might not understand. (Like we did with Myst 20 years ago.)\n\nInstead of a detached, corporate marketing department guaranteeing to upper management how many units they will sell to justify a budget, we'll be relying on excited fans, family, friends, and even strangers who love what we're doing and want to be part of it. The funding and the budget become part of the development process instead of being coldly handed down from an accounting officer who doesn't even know the name of the product - let alone the names of any of the real people who will be making it.\nIn addition to regular Kickstarter updates, we will be making our development process transparent and accessible to our supporters in the form of exclusive backer forums. You'll be able to interact directly with the creators, read behind-the-scenes blog posts about the ins and outs of the game's development, and stay current with our overall progress. Don't worry, we'll do our best to keep the information spoiler-free, so that you still have a rich and surprising game to explore, even if you are an avid process junkie!\nThe funding will be spent solely on Obduction. It's very straightforward: we'll spend the funds that you invest on making Obduction the best possible experience.\nWe already have a team here - a few who've been here since the Myst days, and some who are more recent. We'll be adding to the team after we get funding, so we can flesh out our design and then get started on all the new art, modeling, texturing, sounds, music, lighting, characters, interface, technology, and more.\nWe don't want that team to be too large. One thing we've learned over the years is that it can be much more efficient and satisfying to have a smaller team that works closely together. We want everyone on the team to have ownership as we design and build this experience together. And we'll make sure you know who is on the team and how things are going. \nWe've done quite a few updates since we started.

Learn more!\nCyan was started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. They released a new kind of children\u2019s software they called The Manhole. It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. It was well received by children of all ages. The brothers followed up with Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx - two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. \n\nIn 1991, Cyan began work on Myst, a project that would take everything they had learned about making worlds and use it to create a truly unique experience for an older, more sophisticated audience. Myst was about finding yourself lost in a world and simply exploring, understanding and becoming part of the story - and the public response was nothing short of phenomenal. Sales for Myst and its sequel Riven have exceeded 12 million units worldwide - which made them the best-selling computer games of the 20th century. \nAfter five products in the Myst series, Cyan turned its attention to making an ambitious, new kind of Myst game, a never-ending world that would allow players to explore together. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst (Myst Online). It spawned a thriving, dedicated community and is still available to explore for free.\nCyan continues to draw on our past as we dream into the future. We are looking forward to creating more exciting worlds that move yet again away from the standard fare - to something unexpected.\n\nCyan is located on the northern outskirts of Spokane, Washington, about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet.\n ...And a team of other amazing and talented individuals.\n                                     *Special thanks to Strata for their generous support of the Obduction Kickstarter campaign. \n*Special thanks to Robyn Miller for use of the Myst Soundtrack music used in our video.

While modern compact fluorescent and LED lighting is certainly more efficient than incandescent bulbs, it has lost much of the beauty of those original electric lights.  Alva was created to show that modern LED technology can be cozy and inviting.\nSome Alvas from the Original Alva Project\n==============================================================\nA few original backer comments...\n\"I LOVE my Alva lamp, It makes me smile every time I see it\u2026I'm trying to convince my wife that we need a couple more...\" - S.C.\n\"\u2026very stunning and beautiful piece of craftsmanship...I've backed plenty [of projects] and only a handful have been received that felt finished, The Alva lamp being one of them! Thank you again. Those who have not received yet, it will be worth the wait once it arrives!\" - A.T.\n\"My sister said it is by far the best gift she's ever received!\" - R.M.A. \n\"Lamp just arrived. Much larger than I expected. Absolutely beautiful!!! Great work. You can feel and see the craftsmanship. well worth the wait for such a fine piece. Thank You.\" - I.M.\n\"My Alva... is the first thing people comment on when they come to visit. I'm very pleased with the Alva. Thanks Luke!\" - D.P.\n==============================================================\nSince the first Alva project, we have been working to improve our process while expanding the range of options for bringing Alva into your home.\nALVA IN 2013\nWe got our start on Kickstarter and have come back to show people what we have been up to while allowing them to pre-order Alva and support our latest design endeavor.\nTHE ARTISTS THAT MAKE ALVA:\nScott, James, and Luke\nScott, James, and I are all working artists.  James was educated at one of the top schools for ceramics in the country, Alfred University in New York state.  Scott studied glass blowing at the well respected Tyler School of Art at Temple University. I graduated from the art program at Millersville University with a focus in Sculpture.  The wooden parts that we use on Alva are made by a few craftsmen here in Lancaster county.\nSo many objects we interact with are cheaply made and lack any evidence of human touch. As you can see in the video, our hands are intimately involved in every step from glass blowing to hand glazing in order to create each Alva with its own unique personality and character.  Alva is made by professional artists, and we only ship things we are proud to put our names on.\n==============================================================\nTHE NEW ALVA COLLECTION\nThese are the Alvas that we are hoping to bring to production.  We are making all 5 designs available for you to pre-order.  Each of them is a different combination of filament, glass, and base color.  Some light up with a soft orange glow while those with clear filaments are a little bit brighter and offer whiter light.  The Gloaming model looks like a large frosted bulb that not only puts off more light than the original Alva, but also glows softly in the dark for several hours after it has been turned off!  Each has a different character but they are all Alva.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nThe Classic is the most like the original Alva.  If you want a large Edison style light bulb lamp, this is the one for you.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nThe DiveMaster reminds us of something from a Jules Verne Novel.  It has a wonderful look that wouldn't be out of place on Captain Nemo's Nautilus.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nThe LunaBlu...simply stunning!\n_____________________________________________________________________________\nWe called this one The Manhattan because it invokes for us the style and sophistication that has always made New York City the place to be. \n_____________________________________________________________________________\nFor The Gloaming we have paired a glaze that reminds us of the carpeted rambling of the forest floor with a frosted bulb that is like the surrounding light of the moon.  The glass also glows a soft green in the dark when the lamp is turned off!  A truly alluring thing.\n==============================================================\n==============================================================\nAll Alvas come wired for the North American market (120V).  If you live elsewhere in the world you will need to secure an additional adaptor/transformer for your country.\n==============================================================\nHere are some images of the lamps in the dark on my desk.  These pictures are good for comparing the differing amounts of light that the different lamps put off.  However, the actual beauty of the lamps is very hard to capture with a picture in the dark, so the lamps themselves look much better in person than these pictures can convey.\n                                                                            ~ Luke\nThe Classic\nThe DiveMaster\nThe LunaBlu\nThe Manhattan\nThe Gloaming\nAlva - More Lightbulb Lamps!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe successfully completed our last Kickstarter campaign and now know the time and energy required to take an idea from prototype to production.\n\nLast year, the response of the Kickstarter community took us by surprise, and we struggled to meet our deadlines.

The kit is all you need to make your own nICE mugs - a drinking glass made entirely out of ice.  After much research and experimentation, I have designed a patent pending mold that is shaped how nature freezes water in a container: thicker at the bottom and thinner along the sides.  The material is food grade reusable plastic.  The nICE hold feels good in your hand, insulating your hand from the ice.  There's a sponge at the bottom of the nICE hold to absorb the melting ice.  I love how the product is all 100% reusable.  Yea, it takes energy to freeze nICE mugs, but it's nice to know that there's no waste:  your nICE mug melts and you can use what's left to rub on your sore shoulder.\nnICE mug drink ideas:\nnICE tea with fresh mint frozen in the nICE mug.\na pretty nICE cocktail: vodka, cranberry pomegranate, splash of OJ, freshly grated ginger, wedge of lime, wedge of lemon, sparkling water.\nnICE water on a boat before sunset.\na nICE cold beer.\nOur Story:\nOne cold Minnesota winter night, as I trudged out to my backyard sauna, I realized that one of the water containers we use to dump water over our heads was left outside, full of water from a sauna a couple days previous. It looked frozen solid.\n\nSitting on the sauna bench, I dumped out the chunk of ice and noticed that the center was unfrozen. I poured out the liquid center and what remained was a perfectly formed drinking glass. Never to miss an opportunity for a cold beer in a hot sauna, my friend and I poured a beer into the ice and took turns sipping ice cold beer in my 180 degree sauna. We finished one beer, then started on another. The nICE mug melted down a bit, but it never leaked.\n\nThe beer tasted fantastic and nICE mug was born.\nAfter that night, I started leaving more water containers outside to freeze, but realized I couldn't quite catch the perfect freeze point: either the nICE mug was too thin, or it came out frozen solid like a hockey puck. So, a mold became the answer. Not just any mold, but a mold that perfectly replicates nature's natural method of freezing a container of water - from the outside in.\n\nWe are excited to share nICE mug with you. Just fill the mold with water, freeze overnight, and pop out your authentic nICE mug drinking glass. Thanks for bringing the icy spirit of a cold Minnesota winter chill to wherever you find a thirst for an ice cold one.\n\nnICE mug: if it works in a sauna....\nManufacturing Process and Plan\nThe Patent Pending nICE mug mold has been tested and refined over the course of many years, and many cold Minnesota winter nights.  Nature freezes water in a container in a very unique way:\nThicker at the bottom.\nCurved on the inside.\nThinner towards the top.\nSounds simple enough, but it's not easy to copy nature.  We had to figure out how to create a mold that contours the natural shape of the freeze, which makes for a stronger, longer lasting nICE mug.\nWe did it.\nThe tool and die is tested, confirmed, and ready to start stamping out nICE mug molds.  There are large fixed costs for manufacturing the tool and die, but with a successful Kickstarter campaign, we can produce enough volume of nICE mug molds so that it will be affordable for DIY nICE mug enthusiasts.  To manufacturer the molds, we enlisted the services of a family-owned plastic injection molding company in Wisconsin.  We have tested their production process at scale and are confident in the quality and fulfillment capacity of their operation.  We are excited to have them as our supplier.\nWe plan to pack and ship nICE mug kits from my garage.  Yea, I know, it may sound shoestring, but we ARE shoestring!  We aren't a company that outsources everything to other countries. My wife is Shipping Coordinator, and our youngest son is being baited with new sneakers to help with the packing and shipping.  We have close friends who run a business and ship from their garage.  They will be supervising this family affair to ensure maximum efficiency and minimum drama.

With the goal to create my own unique Egg designs, I decided on different styles for each of the four suits found in a Deck of Playing Cards.\nThe DIAMOND Eggs all have a Nature/Fantasy/Elfish vibe. The CLUBS are inspired by Greek mosaics, colors and geometric shapes. The Russian Double-Headed Eagle is the focal point for the HEARTS and RED Back Eggs. They also draw inspiration from Ancient Rome. And lastly, the SPADES and BLACK Back Eggs all have a Baroque/Gothic look and feel.\nTo differentiate the hierarchy of Cards, the JACKS are the \"Warrior\" Eggs within each suit. The QUEENS are simple, elegant and use light colors. The KINGS are the most decorative and ornate of the Court Eggs. Also, each of the KING Eggs contains a \"Crown\" at the top.\nAll of the Eggs, Ace Heroes, PIPS and Border elements are 3d Models I built in Lightwave 3d on a Mac. Each of the 3d elements were Rendered out at Hi Res and went through varying levels of compositing in Photoshop and integrated into the Card designs.\n(CLICK ON ANY PROJECT IMAGE FOR A HIGHER RES VERSION)\nMY DESIGN BACKGROUND:\nI have been in the design field since 1995 and work during the day as the Senior Designer with Motive Marketing. My previous Playing Card designs include the ORNATES, the Blue Crown Luxury Deck and the United Cardists Deck.\nThe Midnight Cards Facebook page contains up-to-date info on my Card designs.\nThe Imperial's Custom PIPS are made to resemble buttons made of Enamel and bordered with Gold. Each of the Aces contain a Gold \"Surprise\" element, similar to what a real Imperial Egg would have included within. The \"Surprise\" elements represent important Buildings (Spade, Club) and Symbols (Heart, Diamond) from Imperial Russia.\nRED IMPERIAL DECK:\nThe RED version of the Imperial Deck is the main version and is how I envisioned the Back Card and Tuck Box in the very early brainstorming stages. The background graphics have an appearance of engraved Red Enamel and the Tuck Box will feature a GOLD FOIL Interior.\nBLACK IMPERIAL DECK:\nThe BLACK Bicycle version of the Imperial Deck has been created solely for this Kickstarter campaign and will not be available after the project is over. The BLACK version will also feature a GOLD FOIL Interior within the Tuck Box.\nRED IMPERIAL 6-PACK BOX:\nThe RED custom 6-Pack Box comes with SIX (6) RED versions of the Imperial Deck and is printed on 24 pt. Stock (thicker than USPCC brick boxes). Each Box will be hand-signed on the Top Flap. The Top Panel is Scored and Diecut to allow the Top to fold into a Display Header.\nBLACK IMPERIAL 6-PACK BOX:\nThe BLACK custom 6-Pack Box is a Kickstarter Exclusive item and comes with SIX (6) BLACK Bicycle versions of the Imperial Deck. Each Box will be hand-signed on the Top Flap and printed on 24 pt. Stock. The Top Panel is Scored and Diecut to allow the Top to fold into a Display Header.\nCOLLECTORS ART BOOK:\nThe 20-Page Collectors Art Book is the perfect companion piece for the Imperial Deck. The Cover Spread will be printed on 14 pt. Gloss Cover Stock and the Inside Spreads will be printed on 100 lb. Gloss Book with Aqueous Coating. The Book is sized at 8.5\"w x 5.5\"h to let the small details of each Egg really shine through!\nA Lo Res PDF version of the Collectors Art Book can be found HERE.\nLike the BLACK Bicycle Deck, the Collectors Art Book is a Kickstarter Exclusive item that will not be available after the project is over. Each Book will be hand-signed and dated under the Artist's Note section on the Inside Cover.\nIMPERIAL 2\" COIN:\nThe IMPERIAL 2\" Coin will have an Antique Gold Finish and the design will have a Three-Dimensional curve to the shapes, not the usual straight-edged Bevel. Here's a conceptual Mockup of the IMPERIAL Coin. The photos below are some examples of finished Coins from the manufacturer we will use.\n3D PRINTED EGGS:\n3D Printing is a fascinating technology that has really advanced in recent years. Using a company called Shapeways, we are offering two unique 3D Printed pieces using 3D Models from the IMPERIAL Deck. The first is the King of Spades Egg on an Egg Stand. It will measure 1.7\"w x 2.7\"h x 1.7\"d and can be printed in a number of great materials. The second is a 2-Headed Eagle Necklace Pendant Egg that will measure .9\"w x 1.5\"h x .9\"d. The House of Faberg\u00e9 produced numerous small Pendant Eggs alongside the creation of the Imperial Eggs. Our 3D Eggs will make the perfect gift for the Holidays! They will ship out separately, and sooner, than the rest of the rewards, as they are on-demand printing. If you are interested in a 3D Egg Add-On, please send us a PM with the details on which Egg and material you would like. To learn more about 3D Printing, check out these Videos from the manufacturer. A look at the available Materials can be found HERE.\nCLICK ON THE EGG INFO CARD FOR A LARGER VIEW:\nUNCUT SHEETS:\nThe RED and BLACK Uncut Sheets are USPCC standard 22\"w x 26\"h and are Uncut versions of their respective Decks. The differences between the Uncuts will be the Back Designs and the Gaff Cards. The RED Gaff Card is a homage to the very first Imperial Egg, The Hen Egg. The BLACK Gaff Card will be VOTED on by Backers sometime during the project's duration.\nADD-ON CHART:\nThe Uncut Sheets are only available as items added to your Pledge Reward base level. Extra Decks, the Art Book, Coin and/or extra 6-Pack Boxes are also available as Add-On items. To add any extra items to you Pledge, just click on the Blue \"MANAGE YOUR PLEDGE\" Button and change your dollar amount to account for the added item(s).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe key risks in this project are timely printing and delivery by the makers - The U.S. Playing Card Company.

The next couple months are going to be a whirlwind of activity, but we\u2019ll be posting regular updates on Sansaire.com. We can\u2019t wait to deliver the Sansaire to our wonderful Kickstarter backers. We think you\u2019re going to love it!\nWhat is it?\nThe Sansaire immersion circulator is the only tool you need to cook sous vide, and it only costs $199. Just place the Sansaire in a pot or basin, add water, and set your cooking temperature. The Sansaire maintains the water temperature, ensuring that your foods will cook perfectly every time. In the last few years, a few companies have marketed devices for sous vide cooking. Unfortunately, those devices are still too expensive for home use, in our opinion. We believe the Sansaire can change that.\nWhat is \u201csous vide\u201d cooking?\nSous vide is a cooking method that uses precise temperature control to achieve perfect results, every time.\nOn a stovetop, in an oven, or on a grill, you\u2019re cooking with temperatures that are much higher than you ever want your food to reach. As a result, if you turn your back for a moment too long, your steak can overshoot perfection and end up as a tough, gray mess. And, even if you do achieve a medium-rare interior, the high heat environment of traditional cooking creates bands of overcooked areas around the outside of your food.\nBy contrast, sous vide uses relatively low temperatures to achieve perfect, repeatable results that you just can\u2019t replicate through any other method. Foods are cooked evenly from edge to edge, to exactly the doneness you want. And, because foods won\u2019t overcook while they hang out in the water bath, dinner is ready when you are.\nThese identical steaks were both cooked to an internal temperature of 52\u00b0C / 125.6\u00b0F. The steak on the left was cooked sous vide, as evidenced by its edge-to-edge even doneness. The steak on the right was cooked on a cast-iron skillet.\nHow does it work?\nThe Sansaire is an immersion circulator: it houses the heating coils, thermometer, microcontroller and water-circulating motor that work together to maintain a precise temperature in your water bath. Unlike some other sous vide machines, which have a fixed-size water bath, or require you to use your own rice cooker or crock pot, the Sansaire circulator works with any container. Just making a few eggs for breakfast? Attach the Sansaire to a small saucepan, and you\u2019re ready to cook! Cooking racks of ribs for a crowd? No problem \u2013 the Sansaire will heat and circulate up to 6 gallons of water in a large basin!\nClip the unit to the side of any basin, such as a stock pot or food storage container, like a Cambro.  The clamp on the back of the unit is adjustable to fit most containers.\nPlug in the Sansaire using the included power cord.  Stretch Goal: if we hit $250,000 in funding, we will also produce a 220V version of the Sansaire for users outside of North America!\nTo change the cooking temperature, just turn the silver temperature ring.  After a moment, the display switches back to showing you the current temperature of the water bath. You can set any cooking temperature between 0C (32F) and 100C (212F) in increments of 0.1 degrees.\nYou can switch the Sansaire between Celsius and Fahrenheit at any time by pressing the temperature mode button on the top of the unit.\nOur Progress\nIt has been our mission to create a low-cost, reliable sous vide machine for nearly three years. Beginning with the $75 DIY Sous Vide Machine that Scott developed, we\u2019ve known that a great sous vide machine doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. But, graduating from off-the-shelf parts to a commercially-viable design is not a quick process. We\u2019ve been working closely with a factory in China to produce the prototypes that we have today. We\u2019ve visited the factory, and have been meticulously testing and critiquing every element of the device. We\u2019re very proud of the Sansaire prototypes that we have today, but we need Kickstarter\u2019s help to proceed with final tooling, certification, and initial order fulfillment.\nStretch Goals:\n250K (unlocked)- A version of the Sansaire with 240V 50Hz compatibility for all our international backers. This covers all of Europe and most all other countries. The pledge category and the deliver date are the same as the US/Canada versions.\n350k (unlocked)- We're including a reference towel with every Sansaire. Do you need to remember what temperature the Sansaire should be set to to make super juicy chicken breasts? Not when you can sneak a peak at your cheat-sheet towel.\n600k (unlocked)- Choice between blue display and Kickstarter-green display.\nWhat\u2019s Next\nOur next step is to finalize the tooling for our molds, and lock in all of the exact components that we\u2019ll use for the production machines. These components include everything from the circulating motor and LED display, to the type of rotary encoder we use for the temperature ring. Once we\u2019re happy with a final prototype, we\u2019ll start our first production run and begin shipping Sansaire circulators to our backers!\nJuly: Testing pre-production prototypes. We\u2019re confident that the units function well, and hold up to the abuse they might encounter in the most chaotic kitchens. We\u2019ve sent these units out for user testing to gather valuable feedback from folks we trust, and we're incorporating their feedback into the final design iteration.\nAugust: Next-round prototypes. We\u2019ll keep making tweaks until we get everything just right. Meanwhile, we\u2019ll be spreading the word about the Sansaire Kickstarter, so you\u2019ll have the chance to be one of the first owners!\nSeptember: Final tooling, packaging and certification. Once our tooling is complete, we\u2019ll send off a few units for certification. This process will uncover any fault-prone components, and help us sleep better at night, knowing the Sansaire circulators won\u2019t achieve consciousness and turn against their human overlords.\nOctober: Production. Our manufacturer has extensive experience in high-volume production, and we feel confident that we can meet the demand for our initial production run.\nOctober/November: Shipping! Each Sansaire circulator will be boxed up for the greatest journey of its lifetime: across the Pacific Ocean and headed toward your doorstep!\n\nOur Team\nScott Heimendinger has been a sous vide devotee since his first bite of a 65\u00b0C egg back in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Scott reverse-engineered his own immersion circulator and posted the instructions for a $75 DIY Sous Vide Machine on his blog, Seattle Food Geek. The article was later republished in MAKE magazine, and has inspired over 1,000 do-it-yourselfers to build their own device. In 2012, Scott left his career in the software industry (Microsoft, IBM) to become the Director of Applied Research for Modernist Cuisine. Through his work there, Scott has earned a Webby award for his video series with CHOW.com, and was named one of Forbes Magazine\u2019s 30 Under 30.\n\nLukas Svec is the Technical Genius for Sansaire. He became fascinated by sous vide when he listened to Nathan Myhrvold speak of his Modernist Cuisine cookbook in 2009. After building Scott's DIY sous vide machine, he realized sous vide can revolutionize the home kitchen if evangelism is paired with a killer circulator. He has worked with synchrotron radiation, cloud computing, and various mathematical models and is now getting his PhD in Physics for quantum computing. In his spare time, you can find him in his lab programming micro controllers to do his fuzzy logic bidding or in the kitchen baking delicious pies and searing juicy duck breasts.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project, there\u2019s the possibility that something could go wrong and introduce an unforeseen delay. We\u2019ve got a lot of experience bringing other kinds of projects \u2013 software applications, business deals, PhD theses \u2013 to fruition, but manufacturing a complex electronic product in China is a new adventure for us. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve partnered with a manufacturer headquartered in Seattle that has extensive experience with crowd-funded projects. They have boots on the ground in China making factory visits and streamlining product development. Furthermore, the main Chinese manufacturing company we are working with has extensive experience manufacturing and certifying products in this category. The personal site visit we made in November confirmed their professionalism and dedication to quality.\n\nCertification. Shipping a safe, reliable, quality product is our top priority. That\u2019s why we\u2019re submitting the Sansaire to a certifying authority. They\u2019ll smash it, burn it, force it to overheat, crack it open, and see what mayhem it could cause under the very worst circumstances. These extreme conditions may reveal the need to tweak our design, and that could mean a small production delay. However, since the very beginning, we\u2019ve designed the Sansaire with an eye towards certification compliance and general safety. \n\nShipping Date. We\u2019ve already received several prototypes from our factory in China, so we have a good sense for how long it takes to implement design changes and send out updated units. All of our components have already been sourced and tested. However, there\u2019s always the possibility that something unforeseen could introduce additional delays. We\u2019ve built padding into our schedule, and we really want to make sure you all have the opportunity to cook your turkeys sous vide this year!\n\nWhatever happens, we will keep you updated, and to do everything we can to ensure a high-quality, on-time delivery of the Sansaire!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Sansaires in the Wild!", "update_content": "The long wait is nearly over, as the first Sansaires have landed in backers\u2019 hands, and the rest are following shortly behind.

Without the Queen of Blades to stop the hybrid\u2019s assault, the protoss are overwhelmed and defeated. In this reality, what would the survivors of these shattered worlds do? StarCraft Universe tells this story.\nStarCraft Universe (SCU) is a game mod (Note: it is not a standalone game) for StarCraft II. Originally named World of StarCraft, SCU focuses on telling an epic story and intense combat action, as well as highly replay-able multi-player experiences. StarCraft Universe will be released as a series of custom games published through Battle.net.\nThe objective of this game is to experience the universe of StarCraft from a third person view and master a wide variety challenges, missions, and raiding experiences. The focus of the game is to have a team of players/friends, creating/customizing their own hero character which they use to battle together through enemy forces and powerful bosses in a rich and living environment.\nPlease note that this is just a quick listing of the most important features within the game. You can get more information and details by taking a look at our user guide right here.\n- A unique story line by Ryan Winzen which plays out in an alternate StarCraft Universe.\nYou can read an introduction to the lore on our homepage.\n- Custom model assets:\nKiefer 'Ghostnova' Traub, arguably the best kit basher in the world, rips apart, dissects, then re-imagines Blizzard assets in his own vision by combining and altering models and textures from World of WarCraft and StarCraft II. His art form allows for the creation of fully pre-animated model assets much faster than building them from scratch, and often has an equally as impressive result.\nThe Hybrid Harvester is a twisted genetic merging of the Zerg Hydralisk and seasoned Protoss Zealot.

The vehicles are powered by fuel and have a unique ability set which differs from your class abilities.\nFighting against the Hybrid in a vehicle.\n- Item crafting system\nMany items will be obtained by crafting them, meaning the player has to collect various components which then can be used to build a new item using a blueprint.\nA blueprint which can be used to create a new item.\nA vendor selling blueprints.\n- Unique allocation ability system allowing the possibility of hundreds of unique builds per class.\nStarCraft Universe features a unique ability system that gives players a wide range of freedom when customizing their character.\nAbilities can be unlocked by paying with Minerals (this is the main resource in SCU). \nOnce an ability is unlocked, it can be learned at any time from a Class Mentor, adding it to the character's ability bar. An ability can also be unlearned in order to make room for different ones.\nThe capacity of the ability bar is limited, so it only allows the player to learn a certain amount of abilities at one time. Stronger abilities will require more points (combat weight) to add to the ability bar. This simple principle allows for heavy character customization for combat while giving the developers enough regulation to prevent flavor of the month (FoTM) builds..\nA class mentor can teach new abilities to the player.\nThe character stat boost allows each player to customize his character by using Outfitting Points to boost its stats.\n- Original Soundtrack!\nStarcraft Universe features a unique, original soundtrack composed by David Orr, an award winning composer for games, animations, television and film.\n\n- Fully voice acted cut-scenes!\nVoice acting is performed by experienced professionals such as Michael Gough (StarCraft, Diablo, Dragon Age), Danielle McRae (World of Warcraft, League of Legends), and Eric Dieter (Heroes of Newerth, The Leviathan Chronicles).\n- Many options to customize your game experience\nStarCraft Universe allows customization of nearly every aspect of the game including arranging the various graphical interface elements to suit one's tastes or changing of hotkey preferences.

A Battle.net Account is the gaming membership required to play StarCraft II. You can sign-up at Battle.Net by clicking on \"Create An Account\". Sign-up is FREE and requires a valid e-mail address.\n- If you don't own StarCraft II, you will need to download a FREE copy of the StarCraft II: Starter Edition here. Since the file size is very big, downloading may be paused and resumed at your own discretion.\n- Downloading the project through the Arcade and start playing!\nWe must emphasize that all acts and expansions of SCU will be completely FREE to play through the StarCraft II: Starter Edition. You don't need to buy StarCraft II to play!\nYes and no! Here's a good article which clears up the confusion from 2011:\nWhile Blizzard is not directly affiliated with this project's production, we do communicate with them to submit bug reports and make technical requests. They have given their blessing/permission for us to launch this Kickstarter, and they are supporting our efforts by featuring SCU as an Arcade Highlight.\nUpheaval Arts is a small company formed in June, 2012 by the lead developer Ryan 'Kreation' Winzen. Made up of a small group of modding hobbyists, members of Upheaval Arts have been modding Blizzard RTS engines for over a decade in the creation of prototypes and custom games and are considered elite developers by Blizzard Entertainment.\nUpheaval Arts contracts talented industry professionals and entertainers, aiming toward AAA content creation. \nUpheaval is a company created by the fans, for the fans, developing one highly-demanded title - StarCraft Universe.\nUpheaval has been developing StarCraft Universe for over two years with no funding whatsoever, donating their time and effort to its development with no monetary reward. All developers on the project have had to return to work their normal day jobs, dramatically hindering the progression of the project due to its time intensive requirements.\nAfter releasing the StarCraft Universe Beta Prologue: Chronicles of Fate to the public, we're hoping to receive backing from the awesome StarCraft community to push our project forward and expand the team with sufficient funds to expedite the development process. With your help, we'll have the time, motivation, and resources we need to put that fresh looking AAA polish on SCU and get it out to you faster, better, and sexier.\nDeveloping SCU is just as complex and time consuming as developing a stand-alone. Remember we've had to build a brand new engine on top of the StarCraft II engine for this to work.  \n\nPrimarily, the money will be spent on the lead developers so we can produce the mod full-time just like a job. Split among us, we are taking a VERY small amount of money for basic living expenses over the next year of production. Remember that 80,000 quickly becomes 72,000 after Kickstarter and Amazon take their share, and then there's a 26% income tax on top of that. We also have to pay our voice actors, pay for software, hardware, our musical composer, and the list goes on. \nModding isn't anything like it used to be. People's standards are VERY high now, and to produce something of quality takes significant time, energy, and sacrifice. \nCan I play a demo of the game before I decide to back it?\nYep! One of the great things about this project is that we already have so much done, you can test out a single-player beta version of the Prologue! Please note SCU is still in the Alpha stages of some elements of its development, but it's fully playable and still enjoyable!\nTo begin playing, just log into your StarCraft II client, click on the Arcade button, and search for Universe in the reach box! We should pop right up!\n\nIf you don't have the time to play through online, or haven't downloaded the StarCraft II: Starter Edition, you can check out this game-play video, or search \"StarCraft Universe\" on youtube to view some of the many player-uploaded videos and see their reactions.\nOK. That was pretty cool. So, if this funding is successful, how will Upheaval Arts release StarCraft Universe, and how will it sustain itself to provide additional content in the future?\nWe will release StarCraft Universe as a series of downloadable games over Battle.net that are FREE to play with the StarCraft II: Starter Edition.\nBecause of our limited Staff, the first chapter we plan on releasing will be a multi-player open beta to test the core system functionality, combat balance, and progression rates of SCU through a gauntlet of challenges. Kickstarter pending, we will release this open BETA in late 2013/Early 2014.\nOnce we feel that all of the game elements are stable, we'll begin developing additional campaign missions as episodic content, released as completed.\nUpheaval Arts believes that the Arcade which Blizzard is currently developing to support mod game sales will sustain our ability to provide content for players throughout StarCraft II's lifetime, but we need your help to continue until that point.\nWe have the talent, we have the drive, and we have the passion - Now all we need is your help.\nEn taro Adun!\nThis grid reflects the current bonuses and add-ons to the original offers. Things have only been added to each tier. Nothing has been removed.\nAll in-game rewards will be awarded once the first map of the initial stretch goal is finished. In order to receive the rewards, backers will be notified via their Kickstarter provided e-mail with additional instructions.\nRelic aspect overview\nA relic aspect is a special piece of gear which changes the way your character looks and what stats it focuses on building.

The first player who enters the vehicle is the driver and has access to its abilities, such as \"Engine Overdrive\" which makes the Troop Transport move faster but consume more fuel. \nTanker Truck: The tanker truck is a slow but durable mountable single-slot vehicle able to both tow and re-fuel other vehicles. Warning! If a tanker truck is destroyed it will instantly kill the driver and deal massive damage to both friendly and enemy units in a large radius. Can be used as a bomb in this manner if executed properly.\nArmored Personnel Carrier: This huge vehicle has multiple player slots.

Players create and maintain a military force to defeat their opponents. Here is an example of StarCraft II gameplay.\nWhat's the difference between a standalone game and a mod? \nMost mods are like mini-games, but like StarCraft Universe, some are complete re-workings of the StarCraft II engine which make the game play completely differently than it was originally designed. These custom games are created using the map editing program included with StarCraft II and are published online through Battle.net.\nWill I need to own StarCraft II or its expansions to play this?\nNOPE! The StarCraft II: Starter Edition, which is FREE, is all you will need to play StarCraft Universe!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause we've already completed most of the core systems and functionality behind SCU, and we're permitted to use the endless assets provided by Blizzard Entertainment's StarCraft II Editor, the risk factor is very low in our development.\n\nSome risks do include converting the RTS engine to run properly within a third-person RPG engine. Some players have experienced synchronization issues with the current camera systems and slight delay with input commands. This is an issue both Blizzard and Upheaval are aware of and working to remedy.\n\nThe biggest challenge we face is the time required to implement custom assets and script in content for players to explore, but with your monetary assistance we'll be able to eliminate many of the challenges of our lives, and focus on our work.\n\nIf delays in production do arise, backers will be notified of the issues via provided e-mail.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "StarCraft Universe AMA 8/20/2016", "update_content": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/4yqg8j/starcraft_universe_launches_in_a_week_ama_with/\n\nHey everyone!

I believe risks and challenges are what make me a better business person. Some of the risks and challenges that could possibly arise are delays in permitting or city approval.

The weather is always a challenge with food trucks but luckily we live in a County that seems to be the perfect temperature year round. \nWith our ketchup it seems we may come across less risks and challenges. We already have a ketchup that people have loved, we have approval from the State, we have a label ready to be printed as soon as we add the UPC symbol and nutritional info, we also have a good amount of local stores that would like to carry the product. The only challenge I see is getting people to go through enough ketchup to keep the product moving.

Please note:\nThis is the First part of what turned out to be a two-part project. It has to do with the Venetian elegance and Joy of life. It will be followed by a second campaign, with a Dark Venexiana deck, dealing with the obscure side of the city.\n\"Venexiana\"\nThis is how the word \"Veneziana\" is written in the area of Veneto, in northern Italy. It's familiar but at the same time strange, exactly as Venice itself. The most visited and loved city in the world, still keeps her secrets hidden behind the closed doors of the sinking palazzi. Venice is not just a beautiful city. It's an impossible invention of time.\nHere is a wonderful post published by Collector in his blog, referring to the deck but also giving some very interesting information on Venice.\nhttp://playingcardcollector.wordpress.com/2013/07/17/bicycle-venexiana-deck-half-moon-playing-cards/\n\nMy view\nVenice throughout the centuries has been a source of inspiration for numerous artists. From Canaletto\u2019s paintings , to Hugo Pratt\u2019s \u201cCorto Maltese\u201d, and from the Byzantine refugees after the fall of Constantinople in 1452 to the stunned tourists of today, this seducing city has generated and hosted endless dreams.\nEvery person has found something here. Mystery, beauty, elegance, forbidden love, game, crime. All these are elements of the city, incorporated in its\u2019 traditions. Commedia dell\u2019 Arte, the old Italian form of improvised theater, holding hands with the Carnival.\nEndless wealth and power, bearing death and destruction, but also giving birth to immortal monuments of Art and Music.\nIn this deck I tried to depict my vision of the city. It\u2019s inspired by the 18th century period, which had been highly controversial. It was the time when Venice reached a peak in artistic power and elegance but at the same time it was the last century of the \u201cSerenissima\u201d. The Republic of Venice, had already lost the leading role in the sea trade and Napoleon finally conquered the city in 1797, three years before the end of the century.\nHaving all these elements in mind, along with memories of my winter walks in the empty narrow streets, between the sparkling sinking palaces, I have designed this deck.\nI didn\u2019t want to focus only on the Carnival, though it\u2019s a very characteristic aspect of the city. So, for the courts I\u2019m using people in carnival costumes, along with prominent citizens of Venice such as Ludovico Manin, the last Doge, Carlo Goldoni, the great playwriter, Casanova, the notorious womanizer and Antonio Vivaldi, the composer of the \u201cestro armonico\u201d , the \u201cHarmonic Inspiration\u201d .\n\u201cVenexiana\u201d is a dedication, an expression of love and a perpetual promise of return.\nThe deck (UPDATED)\n\"Venexiana\" is a completely custom playing cards deck and every element, from pips to courts, is entirely  designed by me. It will be available in two different tuck cases:The white and the black editions\nVenexiana White Edition\nVenexiana Black edition\n\nStock and finish\nI'm using Bicycle standard stock with magic finish.\n\"Venexiana\" will be a limited edition. It will be printed only once. The number of the decks printed will be determined by the  backers' demands. Of course there may be some decks left which can be sold later but there is not going to be another print.\nThe back\nAce of Spades\nAce of Clubs\nAce of Diamonds\nAce of Hearts\nQueen of Diamonds\nKing of Spades\nJack of Hearts\nQueen of Clubs - Casanova\nJack of Diamonds - Antonio Vivaldi\nJack of Clubs\nKing of Hearts.

That project was to print a similar deck of cards on plastic stock. The project ultimately failed to get funding, but provided me with a good amount of feedback about the design. I am happy to say that this time around I will be offering my new design on paper stock for all of the cardists, magicians, enthusiasts and my intended market on the first go - the poker players. I originally designed this deck to be a promotional item to be sold in the pro shop of my future pool hall where poker players were my main market. I tried to make this design work for everyone this time, so I ditched the plastic by popular demand. I will be having these decks printed by the USPCC with the embossed finish to better suit all of my markets for this deck\nAbout this Deck\nSmall. I know. I will post a better picture soon.\nYour Court Cards:\n\nI tried to keep this playing card design clean with crisp lines and simple graphics. There is a hint of a pool table border on each card to tie them all together around that theme. The corner pips are laid out in sort of an abstract crop of a striped pool ball (you will see this better in the images below). On this revised design, as in the previous one all of the court/face cards which were holding swords are holding darts or have a dart inspired background. All of the court/face cards which were holding staffs or rod-like weapons are holding pool cues or have a pool rack inspired background. I have a short, fictional back-story for each of the court card designs which helped inspire me to create them. I will post a comment with these back-stories for backers of this project to read.\nThe following are digital mock-ups of the Court Cards (numbered cards and the tuck box images are coming). I tried to keep these as true to regular playing cards as possible in terms of typical slang and poker usage. Such as, all one eyed cards (3) are in profile, while all others are facing the viewer; Man with the Axe is now the Man with the Racks; Suicide King is mocking a gun to his head and is standing in front of the dartboard, Chick with a Stick is holding a pool cue, etc. I even went as far as making sure the correct Kings and Jacks have mustaches because I played a game once where the dealer dealt a game called No-Mo Wild, which meant all men without mustaches are wild (I think Aussies and Brits call mustaches Mo's). These cards should be able to play in most any game, using any slang you are used to.\nThe Jokers & Reveal\nI am not a magician, cardist or playing card collector/enthusiast. I designed the jokers basically because I had to (I have a back story for her too) and I added a reveal card because I stil had two spaces left on my sheet. I mention the above because I am not quite sure what a reveal card is used for. I am assuming it is a clever way to reveal a specific card that a person has chosen without it actually being that card. If I am incorrect please excuse my ignorance in this regard. I just play cards and pretend the jokers don't exist. But because I had to come up with one or two, or 4 I decided to add the reveal card and I put my own spin on it. If this card is not going to work for the magicians and cardists, then I have decided to print the back stories of the court cards  on the two cards I have left. If it does work for you guys, then I need to know what I can do with the one remaining card I have not yet designed for. In any case here are what your Jokers look like. The reveal card is 3H. If you have any input on having 3 jokers as opposed to two please send a message or a comment. I have heard from both camps so far and it is fairly divided at this point.\nThe Pips\nThere was concern on my last design that the pips may not be easily distinguishable at a distance. I've created a new set of pips which I've tested at the extremity of my own and others' eyesight to ensure that each pip is recognizable and will not likely be confused for another. Even when printed in the same color or when knocking out of the same color, each of the pips was easily recognizable.\nCorner Pips and Interior Pips\nOther design tweaks here and there have brought me to the design I am offering you guys today. I hope you like the new design and I hope you will back this project to get my first deck of playing cards to print. Not only that, but hopefully to get Phil Pockets going as an online business while I wait out the opportunity to open some doors on a physical space to put that name on.\nThe Tuck Box\nI have redesigned my tuck box which had not posted at launch. I originally intended to put the tuck inside the two-piece box, but have since decided to drop the slide-top box due to lack of interest and cost. It is a simple tuck design. On the back of the box I have decided to thank you all for your support. This is where I redesigned. I have decided to thank three of you by name on the back of the card and the rest of you in number. I will offer 3 rewards, each to have your name printed on this box. I wanted to keep this fair and not throw it out there only for the higher tier backers. To do this I will post all of the three new reward tiers on or around 10 PM EST, Thursday, August 1st, 2013. There will be a $50, $100 and $150 reward to have your name added to the back of the box. I wanted to give everyone a fair chance at getting in on this and this was the only way I figured I could do so. It will also be a 2 deck reward. So if you want to get your name on the tuck box save the date 10 PM EST, Thursday, August 1st, 2013 and act fast. It will be first come - first served. Good luck.\nThe Rewards\nThe rewards I am offering are basic, just as the design of these cards are. I don't have a lot of time or money at this point to build from scratch or to work with vendors or manufacturers to offer you the kinds of things I want to for this project. If things go well with this project then you will see future projects from me and these other rewards will come to be in due time. For now I will offer what I know I can produce at a quality I would be proud to own myself. I am a hands-on kind of person, so if do not have first hand knowledge of the quality of a product I will not offer it. This being said, although my rewards may be less glamorous than other similar projects, you can be sure the quality is there and I will stand behind those products. They are representing myself and my future business and I will not settle for sub-par. I am also in no way saying that other similar projects are offering sub-par rewards. I am just saying I do not have any first hand experience with these products so I will not risk my future business' name on it.\nStretch Goals and Add-ons\nI would like to print this deck in black first and if we reach our first stretch goal of $20,000 I would like to print a gold deck with it. Any multi-deck rewards will be split (half black and half gold decks) if the first stretch goal is reached. If we are not able to print the gold decks all multi-deck rewards will be multiple black decks. So, if you want two colors, get the word out to anyone you think can help us reach the goal.\nThe Thank You Chips - at $23,000\nThis is the Thank You Set of casino quality poker chips I would like to offer as the $23,000 stretch goal after the Gold Deck. If we reach our goal for the Thank You Chips I will include one (1) set of each of the five (5) chips you see here. One member of each family and the Joker have been selected to offer their thanks and mine for making this project happen. These will be produced in the exact quantity required to honor this goal and only for the backers of this project if we hit the goal amount.\nDigital Mock-up of the Poker Chips for the Player Reward and Add-ons\nThese casino quality poker chips will be available as an Add-on for $10 for each sample set (6 chips - one of each denomination). There will also be a couple of chances to own full 500 piece poker sets of these chips in the Poker Player Rewards. I also have other rewards such as the Collector Rewards which offer 150 piece sets (25 of each denomination) with 2 decks of cards.\nThese ceramic poker chips are truly Casino Quality Chips. I have them produced by a manufacturer who produces the same quality chips for casinos all over the world. They use the same material and processes to make my chips as they do to make the casino chips so these are not cheap plastic chips with poor printing or cheap stickers. These graphics will not come off even after years of regular play (this I know from experience). The graphics are a part of the chip and these chips are quality. You will realize this when you have them in your hand. \nI haven't decided on any other stretch goals yet because I do not want to be presumptuous. I will deal with new stretch goals as the current one approaches its goal. I am open to suggestions as well. I have a not-so-unique idea for another add-on. It's a t-shirt set. I have it designed, but they may not work for all and may only be suitable for the poker-friendly with the right (or wrong) sense of humor. If you would like to see them I may be able to post them in the comments section later.\nBeyond fulfilling the pledge awards here, any additional money raised from this campaign will go toward creating a brand and business of Phil Pockets' Billiards and Games which will offer new card designs and more. Ultimately I would like to bring you furniture, custom cases for all types of uses and custom accessories for billiards, poker, darts and game rooms in general. You guys are the key to making this happen and I appreciate any help you can offer.\nAbout Phil Pockets' Theatre of Misspent Youth\nBack in the day you could walk into any pool hall and get a money game going easily. It could be any game from darts to poker and obviously pool or billiards. You didn't enter into those games lightly or green. If you did you learned your lesson quickly. Instead you would play on your own. You'd practice. You'd enter tournaments. You'd learn offense and defense. You'd gamble with your friends only. You'd build relationships and learn from the people better than you. You'd lose. You'd learn to play the person as well as the game. In time you would evolve into that player who can comfortably and confidently walk into any pool hall and get a money game going. You just had to bring some cash and your game. And from behind the counter, the owners sit and watch these people grow from naive kids into the player's players. It's almost like watching a home movie to most of them. This is their balcony seat in the Theatre of Misspent Youth.\nPhil Pockets' is to be the name of my future pool hall and gaming center. I envisioned it as a personal game room that was to be right down the road, instead of in your own home where you would have to clean up after yourself and your inconsiderate friends. It was to have pool tables, dart alleys and all kinds of gear and tech you would love to have in your own personal game room. The old logo (above) incorporates a shark mascot. His name, as you can guess is Phil Pockets.\nIn the past decade or so it seems pool halls have been dying off and closing their doors due to the lack of popularity that these establishments once carried. It is sad to me. I love pool halls. I started playing pool at an early age and fell in love with it. I am a fan of physics (not school book physics, but practical physics). Pool, 3-cusion billiards, snooker and all other billiard games are all about physics and you get to see it in action with immediate feedback, which is a thrill to me. Ever since the age of 16 or when I started playing in tournaments and in leagues I dreamed of opening a pool hall.\nBecause pool halls (in the States) are closing their doors at a rapid pace these days I have had to put my dream on hold. The pool hall I envision is unprofitable at the moment. For that reason I have decided to open Phil Pockets' in the digital realm and offer custom billiards, darts, poker and other game room accessories and furniture. All are elements which I designed for my pool hall. I have many of these products actually produced (one-offs right now), but without the proper equipment and workspace I cannot produce any of them to meet even a small consumer demand. I am hoping to use this Kickstarter project to help me launch other Kickstarter projects which may bring all of my Phil Pockets' products to life. Maybe by doing this Phil Pockets' Theatre of Misspent Youth can become a reality. If not in the original, intended pool hall sense then maybe by living in individual homes instead.\nThank you, Kickstarters.\nChuck\nI will post updates and comments as regularly as I can.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs this is potentially my first project to reach its goal I am sure I will run into issues that I have not planned for or foreseen.

Thank you.\nWhy changing the concept of a cap?\nThe regular baseball caps were design around the 1900's with the purpose of covering the players eyes from the sun.  Today people use them for style mostly.  The engineering of the baseball cap has many flaws since it doesn't completely covers the sensitive skin area around the eyes. also the material and shape of the whole hat does not provide proper sun deflection and protection. It rather does the opposite.\nRegular baseball cap\nAs you can see above the brim of the hat is about 6 inches wide, and 3 inches long. leaving the sides of your eyes exposed to the sun.  The part that covers your head, which is called the crown, has a \"pot\" shape which leaves space between your head and the crown.  Air concentrates in that space turning into moisture.  And water usually magnifies the effects of temperature both hot or cold.  These hats are usually made out of acrylic, and this material does not help you keeping cool, or warm.\nIs ArmorHat only for hot temperatures?\nArmorHat will come in 2 different models:\nDeflect : For hot conditions, helps you keep cool\nAbsorb: For cold conditions.  Helps you stay dry and warm\nWhat are the materials used in ArmorHat?\nArmorHat is 100% soft polyester which is permeable, allowing moisture build by the heat or cold to evaporate out of your head, plus blocking moisture to come back in.  The material used for the \"Absorb\" model will be a thicker polyester.\nWhat are the deflectors?\nThe deflectors are fabrics that are located in a specific way inside, and around the hat that helps deflect the sun rays to other directions.  The more sun light is being deflected from your head, the less warmer you will feel.\nThe deflectors on top of the head will always be white.  Why white?  Because white color is the only color that does not absorb the sunlight, it bounces everything away.  That is the reason why we feel cooler when we wear white color t- shirts rather than wearing a black color t-shirt, because black color absorbs all of the sun spectrum.  Nothing bounces back, that is why we see the color black.\nFor the \"Absorb\" model, you will notice that it wont have white deflectors on top.  Instead it will have black strips (absorbers) to absorb the sun rays to help keep you warm, but also dry, and not allowing the radiation in.  The radiation is what basically burns our skin. \nWhy is the bottom part of the brim in black color?\nIs black because not only the sun rays that come from above burns us.  We are also being hit by the sun rays that are being deflected from the objects around us, specially when it snows, all the sun rays that are being deflected from the white snow, bounces back to our face.  Since black absorbs the sunlight, it will help absorb most of the deflected sun rays that are being bounce towards you from other objects.\nWhat is the \"Dua layr?\nThe \"Dua layr\" are 2 extra layers made of polyester that that are positioned in a way that also helps you deflect or absorb the sun light depending of the model.  The most important function of these layers is to keep your head dry.  Remember that moist raises the intensity of cold or heat.\nWhat is the field of view?\nThe field of view is the extent of what we see at any given moment.  We have an almost 180-degree forward-facing horizontal field of view.  Regular brims block our field of view by 20%\nfield of view with regular brim\nArmor hat only blocks our field of view by less than 10%\nfield of view with ArmorHat\nImportant:  ArmorHat will be available with both types of brim.  The V-shape brim tech, and the classic baseball cap brim.  You choose.\nHow much ArmorHat weight?\nArmorHat is ultralight.  It weights merely 61 grams.  A regular cap weights around 118 grams.\nWhat are the available colors and sizes?\nRemember that the color of the deflectors or absorbers will not change in color.  The available colors will be \nBlack\nWhite\nBlue (as shown on prototypes)\nRed\nGreen\nPink\nThe available sizes are standard for adults and children over 10 years old.  It will come with an adjustable band.  For children under 10.  I will be needing the age of the child for the proper size.\nWhy Only $3,000 dollars?\nCompared to other kickstart projects that ask for far more money, I only ask for this amount because I already spent most of my money in patents, design, prototypes, and locating a manufacturer.

Deco designed as a matched pair and is a limited production. Only 2,500 sets will be printed. We encourage you to pledge today!\nBackground:\nEncarded's first two decks, Tendril and Aurum, explored a variety of new ideas in playing card design. Shadow borders, face patterns that are more than just texture, organic symmetry, purposeful imperfections, custom die cuts, laser cutting. Some of those features still don't exist on any other custom deck. Since each deck we design is nothing like the one before, we once again will take a 180 degree turn and the next deck from Encarded is simpler at first glance, but to those people that appreciate the finer things it's a Bicycle deck like you've never seen before.\nDeco aims to tap into the mystique of casino-style decks of the past, with their boldly simple design, but bring the exceptional modern handling and finishes to the forefront. Deco also wanted to be visually simple from a distance but packed with subtle detail up close. All of this is packaged into a fully custom deck that is still familiar and perfectly playable, like all Bicycle decks.\nDeco Proof Sheets\nDeco Silver\nDeco Bronze\nDeco Silver and Bronze\nCard Details:\nDeco will be a limited 5,000 deck production by the US Playing Card Company. They will be sold in a pair, 2,500 sets total. It will not be reprinted or released again. Most major deck releases are printed in the tens of thousands, so Deco will be a guaranteed rarity from the start.\nThe cards will be on the highest-end Bee Casino stock with the excellent Magic finish. They will handle at the supreme top-end of the playing card scale. When you bring these out at your next poker game all your friends will notice how great they shuffle.\nDeco Silver will be the light deck, with metallic silver, rich blue and white tones. Deco Bronze will be the dark deck, with warm near-black colors, metallic red and metallic bronze.\nDeco has unique 90-degree four corner pips, carefully designed to assist with identifying cards when playing card games as well as adding visual detail during card flourishing or magic.\nDeco will feature many elegant, hand-crafted details. Metallic inks add shimmer and depth and the deck is housed in a beautiful foil and embossed tuck box. \nAfter this Kickstarter, Deco will be released in the Encarded store. You will get your decks first and at a better price by pledging today!\n\n\nDeco \"Personal Edition\" Collector Deck\nKICKSTARTER SPECIAL. This will be your first chance to get a completely unique playing card collectible. \nUntil now, a personalized deck has meant the designer scribbled your name on it with a pen. Encarded takes it to the next level by precision-cutting your initials directly into the special tuck box, infusing your identity into the box like never before. Peeking through these cut outs will reveal design features not visible in the standard sealed deck.\nView Larger\nWe will create a custom, precision-cut USPCC tuck box in a beautiful black linen paper which is overprinted with a subtle deco pattern. The front of the box has a carefully designed cut-out that frames the main back design, and the back of the box will feature YOUR INITIALS (up to 3 characters) precision cut from the box. As you can see in the prototype above, Paul has cut out \"PDC\" for himself.\nThe elegant black linen box can have either Deco color in it. For maximum contrast, select the silver deck. For a subtle and stealthy look, select a Bronze deck. You will be able to choose your color in the survey.\nThe deck will be signed on the bottom, cellophaned and sealed with the Encarded holographic seal (and Paul will write your initials on the seal). Note that since these are a hand-crafted personalized item, they will take a little extra time to produce after the Kickstarter is complete.\nAdd-On's\nWe have a couple add-on items: an Encarded decal sticker (2\" diameter), and a limited-edition matching collectors coin. \nThe coin will be done in antique silver, with a very detailed design unique to each side and a ridged edge like US currency. The coin will be 1.5\" in diameter so it will be the size and weight of a normal US Silver Dollar. The coin will add a custom touch as a poker dealer button or in coin magic. The image here is a digital render, so the final product will vary. We will only be making a few hundred of these, so get yours now. They may not be available in the Encarded store after this Kickstarter. \nCoin - Add $10 each to your pledge\nSticker - Get two stickers for $1\nDesign Influences:\nWhen looking at design styles, themes and art movements to use as inspiration for this deck, the Art Deco movement of the early part of the 20th century was our first choice. We've always loved the style; simple and bold yet mixed with lovely intricacy in certain places. We started looking around and found a variety of inspiration that started to form the basis for our ideas for the deck.\nWe knew that the back design would be much simpler than our previous decks. We wanted to create a strong shape, and since we live in Florida we turned to the art deco style found in Miami. The primary shape of the back design is evocative of a palm tree, which is another of our favorite features in the area we live.\nWhile we wanted this deck to be purposefully simpler, the design will also work in texture and detail that you can appreciate upon closer inspection. From a distance the cards appear simple and bold, but we felt there was no reason that up close, in the hand, you couldn't also have richness and elegance.\nIf you'd like to read some more detail on the design process and thinking behind Deco, please check out the preview blog on our site.\nThe solid appearance at a distance turns into intricate detail up close\nRewards:\nWe are keeping things very simple on Kickstarter this time around. If you want to make sure you get some of these cards and get free or reduced shipping costs then now is the time to pledge.\nDeco is designed and sold as a matched pair, 1 Silver and 1 Bronze deck and only 2,500 pairs will be printed. To preserve the final production number, the campaign rewards are all limited in number.  US Shipping is built into the reward costs and international shipping is as reasonable as we can make it. We've shipped over 2,200 orders all over the world and have our process quite streamlined.\nTo keep the entire process efficient and get your decks to you as soon as possible after production is complete, we won't do any \"one-off\" customizations of the reward packages. However, if you want to pledge for multiple rewards, please add the values together and we will provide the opportunity to tell us which packages you claimed during the survey. Please note that the Early bird reward package is intended for those people that only want a single pair and get one in time. Just message us if you have questions.\nExample: You want a very limited Personal Edition reward and a $40 two pair reward. Select the most limited reward as your selection (Personal edition - $95) but make your total pledge amount $135. \nAnd of course, if you need something else to make your collection complete, Deco will be available at Encarded.com and select resellers after this campaign.\nThanks again for checking out our latest project!\nPaul Carpenter, Encarded", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few risks in funding this project.

Now with SoberDough, combine your favorite craft beer with the SoberDough bread mix for amazing Artisan bread. Nom Nom!\"-The Crowdfund Mafia\nBread + Beer: A Delicious History\nPeople have been brewing and baking for thousands of years. The shared ingredients and storied history tie beer and bread together. It's only natural (and utterly delicious!) for the two to join together to make a bread worthy of kings and queens...\nWhen we discovered the perfect blend of ingredients, it was evident we had created something special. Hands down, this is the best bread we have ever made. No baking skills are needed; with 5 minutes of work and less than an hour in the oven, out will come one of the most delicious loaves of bread you will ever eat. Ever. It\u2019s Magical.\nAnd for those that don't prefer beer or can't drink... it doesn\u2019t have a heavy beer taste and all the alcohol evaporates out while baking. Plus, you can always substitute with a carbonated water like club soda. Try it and don\u2019t blame us when you eat the whole loaf before you share! \n\nHandcrafted Flavors\n100% All Natural Goodness\nNo shortcuts here. We are believers in using 100% all-natural ingredients. We do not use any preservatives, artificial flavors, or poor quality ingredients. Every ingredient we use, from the flour to the herbs and seasonings, are carefully picked for a healthy, wholesome taste. If we wouldn't eat it, we wouldn't want you too either!\nMom + Son: A Great Team\nLong before the perfect loaf came out of the oven, it came out of the imagination of a mom and son during a casual conversation about life.\nJordan: \"I was sharing my enthusiasm about the burgeoning craft beer industry here in Nashville and explained to my mom that beer and bread, to me, would be like wine and cheese was for her. Our conversation sparked an idea and she asked me, 'What if we could take your love for artisan beer and my love for baking and make something of it? Maybe a bread mix that is so easy and delicious, anyone would be able to make and enjoy homemade bread.\" I was so excited when she said this. I missed homemade meals and the war in the kitchen wasn't getting any easier. My mom, whom I admire for her creative ingenuity, started creating and perfecting the recipes as I poured in my knowledge of beer. Together, we mixed our two loves in a bowl and put it in an oven. Forty-five minutes later came delicious bread which we would later call SoberDough.\"\n\"The bread was good... real good. Friends would try it and rant about how amazing it was. Astounded by the process in which to make it, I would get texts from them asking for their own bag of mix. It was evident that this mix we made had potential to be more than our own secret recipe. I had a desire to start a business, so I went to my mom and discussed the possibility of teaming up to sell the bread mixes and here we are now.\"\nVeronica: \"I thought it was a perfect opportunity to teach my sons about business so I was game with the idea. Everyone now plays a role. Even my youngest, at 11, wanted his own job.\nI've been baking for many years. I love experimenting and mixing flavors to find something that is totally unique and delicious. It's fun to share the ability to make brag worthy bread to others whether they can or can't bake. We handcraft each of our artisan brew bread mixes in small batches. Always made with all natural ingredients and lots of love.\"\nOur goal for this project\nWe love what we are doing, and can't wait to share this fabulous bread with everyone!

Fairy tales make for a great entertaining medium, and growing up I was fascinated by them. I want to take that same love and passion we all reminisce about and put them into a deck of playing cards - the cards that come from my vision of Wonderland. Inspired by Lewis Carroll's (Charles Dodgson) original Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I wanted to take this classic story further, by continuing Alice's Adventures as a young lady who earns the title - \"Alice of Wonderland\". My deck of playing cards, as well as my main story, has a Steampunk Wonderland theme. I am keeping the traditional de la Rue design style by only illustrating the face cards and keeping the numbered cards basic, but with a hint of Wonderland.\nWhy Steampunk in Wonderland? The original Wonderland story was written and set in the late 1800's Victorian era. The genre of Steampunk derives from that same era so it ties in nicely with the Wonderland theme. However, my deck of Wonderland playing cards is part of a larger picture, one that tells the story of the continuing adventures of Alice. In this more mature setting, Alice is now a young lady and the world she remembers from Wonderland has changed, everything is now Steampunk - but still Wonderland. The 4 main kingdoms of Hearts, Clubs, Spades, and Diamonds, rule Wonderland.

We bake our CakeCrisps from scratch with recipes we learned from our mom.\nFeatured On:\nhttp://www.hlntv.com/article/2013/07/15/kickstarter-projects-treefort-five-cake-chips\nhttp://blog.cookingchanneltv.com/2013/07/17/anti-theft-pint-glass-and-cakechips/\nOur passion for cake began at a young age when we would help our mother bake cakes for everything from birthdays to holidays to family dinners. We learned to bake homemade cakes from our mom and to this day, we bake only from scratch.\nCakeCrisps is a dessert we created when we were craving cake but didn't want to go through the hassle of making a whole cake which we would then have to fill, frost, cut, and serve. We wanted something simpler; something we could snack on without the need for all the extras an actual cake requires. CakeCrisps are shaped like chips for an easy snacking experience but they pack the full flavor of a bite of cake!\nWe have also created a range of dips to go along with your CakeCrisps. Currently, we offer homemade dulce de leche, guava, and pineapple dips.\nWith your help we would like to move into a commercial kitchen to expand our business and eventually build a larger kitchen here in the United States to produce CakeCrisps and allow us to share our creation with even more people!\nWe hope that you will donate to our project and help us make CakeCrisps the world's next big snack item!\nWhat we need the funding for: \nRenting a commercial kitchen space in our area\nCertifications\nIngredients (all of our products are made from scratch!)\nSupplies (Containers, kitchen utensils)\nCreating a website\n\nWe're ready to put in the work to make CakeCrisps a successful endeavor but we need your help to make it happen!\nThank you!\nServing size: 15 Crisps\nCalories per serving: 50 \nGrams of Fat per serving: 1.5\nSmall Bag: 1-2 servings\nLarge Bag: 8-10 servings", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe believe that starting small and staying within our means will allow us to solidly grow while avoiding many of the risks that opening a storefront or rushing into expansion would bring. We believe that our passion for our product is what will allow us to overcome obstacles and keep moving forward.\n\nThe one risk we felt we had with the project was our ability to ship in the summer which is why we will be shipping out rewards in November instead!

It was such an amazing experience to be able to create a business and have all of you be so supportive and helpful throughout the entire process.\nUnfortunately, we have decided to stop pursuing CakeCrisps further due to the fact that we no longer have the time or resources to continue to do so. When we first began this venture, we asked for the amount of money we thought was necessary based on different quotes we had researched for each service. Shipping, supplies, and ingredients ended up costing much more than we originally budgeted for and we ended up having to take money we had saved up ourselves in order to fulfill some orders. Our biggest obstacles were shipping, which was our biggest expense and what we had the biggest issue with since we had to send some orders out twice because they got lost in the mail. We were also unable to get ingredients in large enough quantities to get a significant discount, so we spent a lot of money on that as well.

We are sorry to disappoint everyone. We really wanted to start at the beginning of February but ultimately decided that we would be too distracted between school and CakeCrisps and our on campus organizations.

Missed the Kickstarter? You can still order a Range.\nEveryone loves an artisan who can brew an excellent ale, smoke the perfect side of ribs, or make some amazing chocolate truffles. These culinary masters are what makes local restaurants great. But you don't have to devote your life to the craft in order to make better food. With Range, you can take the guesswork out of cooking and perfect your kitchen craft.\nClip it on or stick it in and set an alert for the desired temperature with the Range app for iOS (we include presets for common uses). While you run to the store or sip a well-deserved glass of wine, Range graphs the temperature over time so you can learn and improve from each experiment. Once the roast has reached temperature and achieved perfection, Range tells you. \nYou already know how to use an iPhone \u2014 Range can help make kitchen craft just as easy. Soon, your homebrew will be the talk of the neighborhood. Better throw some meat in the smoker to feed all your newfound friends. Welcome to the internet of poultry. And candy, and chocolate, and beer...\nEnter the quantified kitchen.\nCorrect temperature and time are critical to making so much good food (and drink). With recipe graphs, you'll be able to watch temperature over time, share and compare with past batches. Combined with temperature band templates for common kitchen activities like candymaking and meatmaking, you'll be able to see where your recipe went wrong or so very, very right.\nThe story\nAfter talking to many of our Twine backers who cared about monitoring temperature, we realized that many of them made food and drink as both professionals and enthusiasts, and wanted to do it better. This struck a chord with those of us who love experimenting in the kitchen, or tinkering with old family recipes. We realized that we could make a useful kitchen tool for food makers who care about perfection.\nThere's nothing out there that feels as good as our other kitchen tools. We've seen a lot of creaky plastic gadgets and unimaginative apps. We wanted to design something that belongs in the jar with your other kitchen utensils. No batteries or wireless troubleshooting, and a durable silicone clip-on handle. Range is a tool, and tools disappear into the task.\nFeatures\nWe've worked hard to miniaturize the electronic guts so that what you see looks deceptively simple. You\u2019ll use Range to craft the perfect meal; we crafted Range to let you do just that. Range is simple to use, but rich in information when you want it; we designed the app and thermometers with your needs in mind.\nHardware\nAqua Range has a 6-inch rounded tip (when the handle is clipped onto something, that's a total of 8 inches). Designed for many tasks including candy making, beer brewing, and cheese making. (Planned retail price: $59) \nEmber Range has a 3-inch pointed tip. Ideal for cooking meat. (Planned retail price: $59)\nCoal Range has a 3-inch pointed tip. Made with higher-temperature materials that make it ideal for heavy grill use.\nRange (including the cable) is made of food-safe, eco-friendly, good-feeling, free-range silicone that can be handwashed and withstand temperatures up to 450\u00baF.\nThermometer reads from -40\u00baF to 450\u00baF (-40\u00baC to 230\u00baC), with 0.5\u00baF accuracy at 135\u00baF (about the temperature of a medium rare steak).\nDesigned to allow you to clip it onto the side of a pot or on a rack. Use your hands for cooking, not fussing with technology.\nPlugs into the headphone jack of your iOS device for maximum reliability. A long cable keeps your device safely on the counter where you're using it for recipes.\nStretch goal achieved: All Ranges now have a 4.5-foot cable. Aqua and Ember have a thin silicone cable good to 450\u00baF, and Coal has a thicker extreme-temperature cable that can withstand bursts of direct flame.\nStretch goal achieved: Magnetically pin the cable onto any metal surface to keep it neat and out of the way. (Aqua and Ember only.)\nHave an old iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch sitting in a drawer? Connect it to Range to send notifications to any iOS device with the Range app.\nSoftware\nUse with any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch on iOS 5.1 and newer (iPhone 3GS and newer, iPod touch 3rd generation and newer, any iPad). \nSend push notifications to any iOS device with the Range app.\nSet alerts at multiple temperatures with a flick of your thumb. Get notified when temperatures rise or fall past your mark.\nUse presets that have custom notification sounds. \nSwitch to gourmet temperature recommendations for juicier results.\nUse recipe graphs to see how the temperature changes over time.\nUse Range-Finder templates to view temperature bands to target for meat, candy, and other classes of edible items.\nStretch goal achieved: Create your own Range-Finder templates for your favorite, finicky beer or chocolate recipe.\nSave and share visual results as a counterpart to your recipes, and use them as a guide to get repeatable results the next time you recreate that beer recipe.\nCan display temperatures in Fahrenheit or Celsius.\n\nPledge Levels\nWhat we've done\nAs with any good recipe, our process gets better with every repetition. Range is the latest result of our recipe for making great products.\nWe've prepared for several production scenarios, and have picked and vetted most of our suppliers. As much of the work as possible is done locally in Texas and the US \u2014 not only because it's important to support our neighbors, but because it produces more reliable results, especially when demand grows but the schedule doesn't.\nThe video and images here show some of the work we've done so far. We have a solid design after many iterations of sketches as well as carved, printed, and cast prototypes. We've built and tested several prototypes of the electronics, making them smaller each time. And we've been building an iOS app that already looks at home in iOS 7 (we're just ahead of the curve like that).\nWhat we do next\nThis Kickstarter will fund the remainder of our development, allow us to meet the minimum order quantities for parts, and help us secure equipment needed for production. Your Kickstarter pledges help us fund electronic components, the tooling and materials for injection molding the silicone parts, assembly, certifications, packaging, and shipping. The more funds we raise, the quicker we'll be able to make Range better.\nHere's our timeline: \nWe are finalizing the electronic and industrial design in August. \nIn September, we'll be able to buy components in quantity as soon as we receive the funds, and we'll start beta testing and tooling for the parts. \nBy October, we'll have hardware we can commit to production. \nBy the end of November, we should have the first Ranges to assemble and test, and we'll start packaging and shipping this first batch in time for the holidays. \nAfter a breather to make perfect turkey and caramel for our families, we'll then be able to ramp up full production and fulfillment in the first months of 2014.\nMaking things doesn't always unfold so neatly, but we've built in some padding in case something happens (it always does).\nIf you like what we do and want to be part of it, contribute to our project with your dollars, word of mouth, and creative ideas. Let's get cooking!\nAbout us\nSupermechanical is making a new generation of everyday objects that connect people. You may remember us from Twine, a little square that's the easiest way to get your objects and environments talking on the Internet. Our work, started at the MIT Media Lab, has been featured on The Verge, Wired, Engadget, the Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, and Cool Hunting. We want to give soul to electronics, and make connections between us.\nMusic written and performed by Russ Bonsall, a brewer and a patriot.\nWe've done this before.\nThis is not just a pre-order! Kickstarter is not a store. Yes, you'll be among the first to get an original new product; but on Kickstarter, you're helping us finish the product as well. As both project creators and backers, we embrace the process with all its ups and downs. Big companies have the same challenges, but they don't open their doors to you until they're ready to sell \u2014 this is part of the fun with Kickstarter. Read this \u2014 we believe it. \nThat said, we learned a lot about the challenges of building and shipping hardware from Twine, and we\u2019ve put that knowledge to use with Range in everything from the design and development, to how we interact with you, our backers. This Kickstarter will feature even more communication, less naivet\u00e9, and an equal amount of passion.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery hardware product has a supply chain. Different companies may provide components, make custom parts, and assemble electronics. Each link in the chain can be a failure point \u2014 a part has to be redone because it's not up to our specifications, an overseas shipment gets delayed, etc.\n\nWe've already vetted and picked suppliers, many of whom we've worked with before. Most of them are in the US, which makes things faster and more reliable (and because we like to support our neighbors and keep a smaller carbon footprint). We\u2019ve separated rewards into anticipated delivery dates based on production runs so that we\u2019ll be able to get everyone their rewards when promised, even if we need to make more than expected.\n\nIn addition to the risks involved in making hardware, we'll be at the mercy of Apple for approval in the App Store.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Give your chef a thermometer that lets them unplug.", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #59", "update_userinfo": "Upgrade your Range thermometer to Bluetooth", "update_content": "Hi, backers!

It is by far the most technical shoe in the EVA footwear category. \"CROSS\" is the short term for \"crossover\" and \"KIX\" is for \"kicks\" which is slang for shoes (a term typically used by young adults).\nCHOOSE FROM 6 STOCK COLORS:\n_________________________________________\nSTRETCH GOAL COLORWAYS BELOW.\nSTRETCH GOAL COLORWAYS.\nThe above STRETCH GOAL colorways will be available for VOTING at end of campaign. \nEvery backer will receive an email requesting their VOTE for their favorite colorway.\nEach STRETCH GOAL reached will allow for ONE colorway that will be ADDED to the STOCK colorway options. \nFor example: if we reach at least $70,000 (Stretch Goal #2), the TOP 2 vote getters will be added to the STOCK colorways.\nAn email survey requesting your color(s) and size(s) will be sent at end of campaign for order processing.\n________________________________________________________________\nOur Story.\nLet's face it....there is really ONLY one brand out there that dominates the EVA (soft foam composite) footwear category (as you have seen in the video). We all know who that is. But if you're like MANY other folks, you've probably have said to yourself...\"they're comfortable, but I wouldn't be caught with them on!\"\nSo, our goal was to design a shoe that EVERYONE can PROUDLY wear for multiple uses and of course...look GOOD while doing it. We believe there's definitely a void in this category for a more sportier, stylish, and functional shoe. So, we've spent over 4 years designing, redesigning, testing, retesting, producing sample after sample and have finally come up with a shoe that all men, women, and kids just can't wait to get their feet into. Our focus groups have unanimously voted on what you see.\nWe're committed to producing top quality footwear for the demanding consumer that cares about price, style, and functionality. We let YOU decide what you want in a multi-purpose athletic shoe. \nWhat makes CROSSKIX different from the competition?\nBelow is a chart showing the advantages of CROSSKIX as compared to the one brand that dominates this category. We wanted to fill the void in this category for a more Sportier shoe that can be used in so many more ways than just a slip-on. Please review below.\nSpecial Air/Water Drain holes.\nCrosskix have strategically placed Air & Water Drain holes that allow air to circulate through the rear of the shoe for added ventilation. It also acts as a drain hole when used in water conditions i.e. washing your car or walking on the beach or pool.\n_______________________________________\nWhy CROSSKIX?\nmultiple uses - leisure, recreation, casual, and work\nstylish AIR VENTS throughout to keep your feet cool & dry\nsoft and contour footbed for a comfortable fit\nstrategically located water vents for use IN and OUT of the water\nPRE and POST foot recovery features (after playing sports)\nEASY cleaning\n100% RECYCLABLE - for playgrounds, track & field, basketball courts, etc.\nfashion forward styling\n\n\nUnlike other foam composite shoes, CROSSKIX are made with separate components allowing for greater flexibility and a \"real\" shoe feel.\n\n________________________________________________________________\nMINI-CINCH BAG - 14\" x 18\" tall w/ 9\" zipper pocket on back side (for wallet, keys, cell phone, mp3 player, etc.)\n________________________________________________________________\nAccessorize your Crosskix with magnetic CROSSBITS. We're working on our first run of icons and hope to have them before the end of this campaign. \nThese are a few styles of CROSSBITS that we will be offering. CROSSBITS are optional for each pair. Each new pair of Crosskix will come with a standard Crosskix logo (as shown in above images). Please stay tuned for more info as the campaign continues.\n_______________________________________________________________\nOur 5 YEAR GUARANTEE!\nWe are very confident about our quality that if any part of your CROSSKIX becomes defective under normal use (i.e. instep strap breaks off, separation between upper, outsole, and sidestrap), we will gladly replace it with a NEW pair! Simply follow our return policy procedure by sending us a clear image of the defective area and we will send you an authorization code. Normal wear and tear does not qualify.\nWhat do we do with returned shoes?\nEVA material type shoes typically will last forever (under normal worn conditions). Anything that is defective on CROSSKIX can easily be repaired and/or replaced. So, we will actually take all returned shoes (that are still in good condition) repair them and donate them to needy kids and families around the world. We are VERY passionate about giving back and are very excited when we have collected enough shoes to make our first donation!\n_______________________________________________________________\n100% RECYCLABLE (RecyKIX Program)\nDon't throw away your used or unwanted CROSSKIX! \nCROSSKIX are 100% recyclable!\n\nReturn 'em to us and we'll use for our RECY-KIX program. In return, we'll offer a 15% DISCOUNT on your next pair of CROSSKIX!\n_______________________________________________________________\nDo we know what we're doing?\nExperience.\nAbsolutely! We have been in the athletic apparel industry over 10 years and in footwear for over 4. Collectively, our team has over 30 years in footwear design and manufacturing. During the 4 years, we've actually developed 3 other designs and samples. All of which did not make the cut for design but more importantly - functionality. \nQuality.\nOur commitment is our promise to deliver a high quality functional product. We've studied the competition, improved the flaws, designed based on demand, and all the while maintaining an attractive style.\nAbout the shoe.\nCrosskix are made with the highest EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate) material. It is basically a soft foam composite that is commonly used as midsoles in running and basketball shoes. Most people can identify the material simply by the brand crocs (we prefer not to be mentioned in the same breath simply because CROSSKIX are much more superior in the way it is constructed, function and quality).\nThey are VERY lightweight (only 7.5oz for size 11). The outsole and uppers are SEPARATE molds (not like the competition that is made with just ONE mold). This allows the shoe greater flexibility and to wear like a fabric made shoe.\nWhat will the funding be used for?\nSize Molds. In order to produce the shoes, we need to pay for the molds (sizes 3-13) so that we can begin production for our opening order. We have everything in place with our manufacturer and now just need the funding to produce molds. If we exceed $100,000, we will be able to offer childrens sizes as well. \nWhat sizes do we offer?\nSizes 3-13 (including WOMENS). (click here to view size chart)\nAll colorways are in FULL sizes (no half sizes needed).\nWhat if I order the wrong size?\nNO PROBLEM! We understand this may be a huge concern for you. You (our backers & customers) are our MOST VALUABLE asset in our business! Without you, we wouldn't have a business. So, we want to make sure that you have the most pleasurable experience when you shop for CROSSKIX. \nWe will take back any pair of UNWORN Crosskix and gladly replace them with the size/color of your choice. Return postage is on us. We will have DC's (distribution centers) in US and Canada and you can return your Crosskix to either DC. All other countries, will need to pay for return shipping (sorry, this can be VERY expensive for us).\nclick here to view SIZE CHART\nIf you have ordered the wrong size, no worries! We have an EASY NO HASSLE exchange program. We want to make sure you get the RIGHT size as fast as possible!\nUpon funding, we will post a \"HOW TO ORDER THE RIGHT SIZE\" page on our website so you can order the right size the first time.\n_______________________________________\nCustom COLOR PALLETTE.\nSelect from above color palette to create your own CUSTOM Crosskix!\n________________________________________________________________\nHow do I make a pledge or purchase?\nSimply select from one (or two, or as many as you like) of the REWARDS to the right of this page.

Head over to http://tryghost.org for more information.\nWhat People Are Saying About Ghost\nForbes - \"If Mr. O\u2019Nolan and Ghost deliver on their big idea that is now a funded project, content innovation may return to the forefront of disruptive conversation.\" \nWired - \"Ghost aims to reboot blogging ... a combination of user-focused design, open-source code & non-profit company\"\nTechCrunch - \"Ghost will take your boring blog to the next astral plane ... it looks so darn beautiful.\"\nMashable - \"Is This Kickstarter Project the Future of Blogging?\" \nProBlogger - \"a simply, elegantly designed and useful interface ... I\u2019m really excited to see this developed\"\nIgnite100, Europe's \u00a31 million startup accelerator programme - \"Awesome work.\"\nAGBeat - \"first exciting thing to happen to blogging in years\"\nWhat do You Have to Say About The World?\nGhost is a platform dedicated to one thing: Publishing. It's beautifully designed, completely customiseable and completely Open Source. Ghost allows you to write and publish your own blog, giving you the tools to make it easy and even (gasp) fun to do. It's simple, elegant, and designed so that you can spend less time messing with making your blog work - and more time blogging.\nWriting for The Web. Done Right.\nGhost has a smart writing screen. Markdown on the left, and a live preview on the right. Write down your ideas and format them on the fly, never pausing to click on endless formatting buttons, never having to write long/painful HTML to express your ideas. You can even theme the preview pane to match your blog's formatting exactly.\nA Dashboard That Makes Sense\nGhost grabs all the important data about your blog and pulls it into one place, so you can see it all together. No more clicking through tens of browser tabs to view your traffic, social media subscriptions, content performance or news feeds. Drag and drop the widgets most important to you into your own custom dashboard, and stay on top of your blog's performance.\nSimple Content Management\nGhost does something ridiculously simple when it comes to your content. It lets you browse and preview you all your stuff within a single view, just like you're already used to with your email. Save time, save energy, browse and manage your content without over-click syndrome.\nReady for Sharing and Search\nGhost comes ready to connect to your social media services right out of the box. No endless plugins required to do stuff that everyone with a blog wants to do. Connect your blog to publish to your Twitter and Facebook accounts, rank properly in search engines, and much more.\nCustomise it Completely\nGhost is Open Source, and it's all yours. You can write themes for it so your blog can have its own design. You can write plugins for it to add your own functionality. You can host it on your laptop, or you can host it on a public server. The code is open, and so is the MIT license. No restrictions.\nWe're incredibly proud to announce that WooThemes have backed us at the partner level and will be creating themes for Ghost.\n\"WooThemes wanted to support Ghost and see it become a reality, because we want our users to experience the same awesomeness. As such, we'll be working closely with the Ghost team to get some of our themes Ghost-ready\" - Adii Pienaar\nNot Just for Solo Bloggers\nThe first version of Ghost is focused on small blogs, but Ghost was born out of many frustrations. One of those was managing online newsrooms. Want to build the next Mashable? We're building Ghost to scale with features that allow news sites and magazines to manage editors and authors and content in a way that makes sense.\nMobile Friendly\nInspiration can strike anywhere, not just when you're sitting behind a computer. So, Ghost works where you work. Ghost is a fully responsive web application that works on all devices. Not just moderating comments or token functionality. The whole thing.\nMade for Love, not for Profit\nGhost is a non-profit project. If successfully funded, Ghost will be legally registered as a not-for-profit organisation. Why should you care? It means that no one owns shares of monetary value in the project. We're building Ghost because we want online publishing to be better. We want to make decisions focused on that goal, not on building a startup that we can sell to Facebook for $1billion. \nBeing a non-profit means that any money Ghost makes can only ever be used to re-invest in making Ghost better. Not making shareholders rich.\nUse Ghost in The Cloud + Help us Grow\nThis Kickstarter project is all about building Ghost v1.0 and delivering it to our backers - but we don't just want to stop there. The majority of the problems which exist with self-hosted blogs, exist due to complications with hosting. That's something we want to solve.\nWe're setting up world-class hosted platform that allows you to set up a new Ghost blog in just a couple of clicks \nYou'll need hosting for your blog no matter what, but our service will be the most powerful way of running Ghost - and the easiest to get started with. You'll have the full Ghost software with all bells, whistles, themes, plugins, and some extras that are only available with us (like automatic updates and backups).\nWhat's more by choosing to run your blog through our hosted platform, you'll be investing in the future of the software. \nEvery penny we make from our hosted customers will be re-invested to make Ghost better and grow the platform. \nThe sad thing about Open Source software projects funded on Kickstarter is that they usually have an initial flurry of activity when they launch, and then they slowly but surely die off when the money runs out because they have no business model to keep going. We want to build Ghost to be a self-sustaining open source project. \nUsers hosting with us = revenue = development = better software = more users = more revenue = more development = well... you get the idea.\nHow Does it Work?\nWe're incredibly excited about creating the first fully-featured blogging platform in the world that's built entirely with JavaScript.\nGhost is a Node.js application powered by the Express framework. Ghost ships with SQLite, which means it can run pretty much anywhere - however everything is connected through JugglingDB ORM, adding future support for many other database formats.\nGhost will be available via NPM, making it extremely simple (and fast!) to install on all major environments.\nGhost theming is done with Handlebars, which keeps our business and view logic separated. Mmmm semantic + sexy. If you know how to write WordPress themes, you'll be writing Ghost themes in under 5 minutes. Here's an example.\nOf course there's also support for customising and extending your blog with additional functionality via plugins with helpers and data filters built right into Ghost. We'll also be supporting full international translations from the word go using Node Polyglot.js.\nFinally, Ghost is being released under the MIT License. It's pretty much the most free Open Source license out there. It means you can do whatever you want with Ghost, and you can choose whatever license you want when you build something with Ghost. Want to release a GPL Ghost theme? That's fine. Want to release an MIT theme? That's fine too.\nWhere We Are Now\nWe've been slowly working on Ghost since I posted up the idea in November. As you can see from the video, we have a real working prototype - but there's still a lot to do.\nWith your support we can work hard to finish the first complete release of Ghost and get it out into the world. Your backing will help fund:\nDevelopment time. We want to work on Ghost and nothing but Ghost in 2013. We want to ship the first public version of Ghost by the end of the summer.\nLegal stuff. We need to do a couple of important things like register trademarks, and register properly as a non-profit organisation.\nInfrastructure. We've got tons of work to do to complete the Ghost community website and platform to allow us to properly support users, provide hosting, and be the home of Ghost. We want to complete this by the end of the year.\n\nThe People Behind Ghost\nMy name is John O'Nolan. I've been building websites (but mainly blogs) with WordPress since 2005, a year after it was launched. From 2009-2011 I worked as the Deputy Head of the WordPress UI Group, where I helped to design and develop the WordPress user interface - and spoke at conferences all over the world about designing WordPress. I've designed, built, and worked on blogs for companies including Microsoft, Ubisoft, Nokia, Virgin Atlantic Airways, easyJet, MTV, Travelllll.com, Tourism Australia, Tourism Spain, WooThemes, W3 Edge and many others.\nMy main partner in crime, Hannah Wolfe, is a Senior Developer at Moo.com where she is currently working with a small team focused on a little site called Flavors.me. Hannah has been developing WordPress sites for over 7 years and prior to MOO - worked as a developer for a web agency, building websites (and blogs) for large household names in the UK.\nEqually, this first prototype of Ghost would not have been possible without the generous contributions of many other people:\nCode - Rob Hawkes\nCode - Scott Riley\nPhotography - Rick Nunn\nWireframes/UX - Simple as Milk\nCode - Matt Hojo\nCode - Gilbert Pellegrom", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith a software development project like this, the biggest risk and challenge is inevitably shipping on time.

For $10 per month, you get a full Terabyte (1000 Gigabytes) of storage you can use anywhere, any time. Space Monkey does the work behind the scenes to make your data safe and secure, using the entire network of Space Monkey devices around the world to store encrypted pieces of data in a way that makes data loss a thing of the past. Space Monkey is up to 60x faster than any other cloud service you've used (or heard of). \nSpace Monkey is like nothing you've seen before. We're so close to putting this service in your hands. Your support here on Kickstarter will change how the world stores data forever.\nWe\u2019ve all heard that The Cloud is the future.\nThe industry doesn\u2019t pass up on any opportunity to tell us about how much better our lives will be when we put everything into this place they call The Cloud. And they are right in a lot of ways; when you move your data to the Cloud, you get access to it from anywhere, the ability to share it with others, and a second copy somewhere for safe-keeping.\nBut maybe it\u2019s not working for everyone.\nIf you have a lot of data, you\u2019ve found that the traditional Cloud is expensive ($800+/year for 1TB). Even if that\u2019s in your personal budget, you\u2019ve discovered that pushing 1TB of data to the Cloud can take months or years -- and just as long to get back out. That\u2019s because most cloud services can\u2019t afford unlimited bandwidth and resources for heavy users, so they cap transfer speeds.\nThat just doesn\u2019t cut it.\nYou need fast upload and access to your stuff from anywhere, with any device. You need your stuff to be safe. You need to be able to share and collaborate with ease. Why isn\u2019t there a Cloud solution that is addressing our exploding demand for storage? The Cloud is tethered to an albatross: the datacenter.\nThe cloud is datacenters.\nEverything in the Cloud today is housed in datacenters. These are high-cost buildings tightly packed with expensive computer equipment. They need costly fire suppression systems, diesel backup generators, expansive power distribution systems, premium network equipment, biometric access controls, security patrols, and consume vast amounts of electricity and air-conditioning. They require 24/7 staffing and Network Operations Centers. The ongoing daily costs of keeping datacenters running is exorbitant compared to the actual cost of the hard drives that store your data in the Cloud.\nBecause of these operational costs, the only way to make any of this affordable is to pack 1000s of users onto each server and millions of users through each Internet connection and limit how much you can actually use (either through hard limits on storage amount or by throttling your upload/download speeds). In other words, slow speeds at high cost.\nIt\u2019s time to change how the world stores data, forever.\nWhat if we took the Cloud out of the datacenter and put it a little box that you plug-in at your house? What if we put software on it that allows it to cooperate with millions of other devices plugged in all over the globe to create a storage network that not only is orders of magnitude cheaper than datacenters, but is also more reliable, faster, and better for the environment?\nSpace Monkey is the answer.\nA terabyte is a lot of cloud storage. You could store approximately 250,000 photos in the Space Monkey network. That's roughly the same as storing 130 DVD's in one place.\nBecause Space Monkey provides a local device on your own network, you can transfer data 15x-60x faster than services like Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive or iCloud.\nWhen you aren\u2019t on the same local network as your Space Monkey device, you\u2019ll still experience speeds as fast or faster than the traditional cloud. Since Space Monkey\u2019s network resources scale perfectly with the number of users (each new Space Monkey device has its own network connection, hard drive, and CPU), your share of the total available network capacity doesn\u2019t shrink when new users flood the system. And, for download speed, Space Monkey can use multiple connections from different locations simultaneously to provide better-than-datacenter performance.\nNot having a costly datacenter means Space Monkey can save you money. For $10/month, you get a 1TB Space Monkey storage device.\nEven better for users that stick with us -- this cost advantage widens over time. Since Space Monkey doesn't have to pay fixed datacenter costs, the decreasing price of hard disk storage can be passed directly on to you.\nWhen Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast, datacenters in New York were flooded and some popular services went down. It\u2019s not the first time that bad weather has caused outages of cloud services (or even worse, permanent data loss), and it's not the last.\nBecause Space Monkey splits your files up into little pieces after they\u2019ve been encrypted and spreads those security-locked pieces out to geographically diverse locations, it is largely immune to Mother Nature-caused outages. This is the same design philosophy used when the Internet itself was originally created and similar to the architecture used for email. This design means that the Internet continues to work even when individual lines are cut or servers go down, and that \u201cthe email system\u201d as a whole has never \u201cgone down\u201d (even though individual email endpoints can and do fail).\nIt\u2019s also what makes your data stay safe, even if your house burns down or lots of the other devices in the Space Monkey network are stolen or destroyed. It serves as the ultimate in data protection.\nDatacenters aren\u2019t exactly helping the Earth. So when you use the traditional Cloud today, you may be unwittingly contributing to the problem.\nSpace Monkey is passively cooled by ambient air in the home in the summer. The Space Monkey device has no high-speed fan, and its embedded CPU consumes a very small amount of energy in comparison to the high-powered, AC-sucking, high-speed forced-air cooled servers in traditional datacenters.\nThe net effect is a minimal footprint on the environment.\nSo how does it work?\nSpace Monkey provides a simple folder on your desktop in which you can upload all of your stuff. No need to shuffle things in and out to stay under skimpy quotas. Everything in one place.\nItems that show up in this folder on one computer show up in another, automatically.\nFolders and files can be shared with other users.\nOnce data is in your Space Monkey, the device continues working for you in the background. It\u2019s in charge of encrypting your files and making redundant, secure copies of them to store in the network. You don\u2019t have to leave your desktop uploading data overnight, or your laptop open waiting for a transfer - that\u2019s Space Monkey\u2019s job.\nYou can get to everything over the web, too.\nComing soon: thumbnailing, gallery views, streaming, media feeds, and more!\nAnd Mobile? Mobile is the center of everything.\nIf you are like the average consumer, you already generate most of the data you own with the HD video camera on your phone. Space Monkey makes it easy to get all that stuff into the storage network, automatically uploading your content as you create it. You can also access all of your data from your smartphone.\nJoin us, and change the world for the better.\nBack this project and not only help yourself to a better way to store your own data, but join the Space Monkey storage network and change how the world stores data, forever.\nHere is the current status of the project:\nRemote Monitoring Software system: functional today, with devices reporting in with deep instrumentation of both internal system performance and core OS-level metrics. Completed in Summer 2012. New metrics are added as needed, old ones deprecated.\nRemote Software Management system: devices automatically update with enhancements when they become available. Completed in Summer 2012. Ongoing improvements always being tested.\nDistributed Storage System: all major components that make storing data safe and usable are present. There are still many opportunities for improving the performance and efficiency of the associated subsystems.\nDesktop Clients: functional and usable versions of clients for OSX, Windows, and Linux exist and early users are helping us find ways to improve them. In internal testing since Summer of 2012. In external Alpha testing since late 2012 (See above demo).\nMobile Clients: client for Android exists today but is in internal test only at this point. iOS version will enter internal test soon.\nWeb Client: web client is functional as shown above. Reliability and bug fixes are being constantly worked on. Initial functionality completed in February 2013 (See above demo).\nOther network-ready integrations: Support for DLNA, SMB, and other local network protocols for making your files easier to access and use from your existing devices such as web-enabled TVs and set-top boxes will enter internal test soon.\nMechanical: All mechanical components including PCB, plastic covers, and tooling for the product were completed in early 2013. Device has been drop tested and heat tested.\nElectrical: Circuit design has gone through 3 revisions and declared ready for production.

To address these challenges, we\u2019ve assembled a team of employees with deep distributed software design experience from companies like Google, Mozy, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and Microsoft, and have relied heavily on hardware experts who helped create the iPod and the Nest learning thermostat.\n\nThe most significant risk to hardware manufacturing is managing the suppliers of over 100 components that make up the Space Monkey device. We've made relationships with all these suppliers and have already begun small prototype runs. We can't predict future issues that these suppliers might have delivering components on time, but we are extremely confident in the companies we've chosen to work with to deliver the Space Monkey device.\n\nWe have not yet delivered more than a few hundred units to customers, and will need to scale not only the manufacturing process, but the distributed software system, the support organization to help customers with issues that may arise, the fulfillment organization to get devices into user hands, and reverse-fulfillment processes to handle returns and defects.\n\nCurrent estimated delivery dates are based on the first 5,000 units.

Finance ; CBSNews ; Mercury News ; Sacramento Bee ; Geek News Central ; Net PR News ; PC Magazine Security Watch ; Slash Gear ; Device Magazine ; IT PRO ; HEAVY ; Entrepreneur ; Android Police ; ManyOfMany ; \nUnlocked (and protected) with the swipe of a finger, myIDkey is the Industry's first biometric secure Bluetooth / USB drive and password manager.\nWhy did we create the myIDkey? We recognized a familiar pain point in most digital users lives and built a simple password management device. Today, we have literally hundreds of passwords, account numbers and other important information that we have to remember. myIDkey is the first fingerprint, voice-search, secure Bluetooth / USB drive that displays passwords and ID on the go as well as works with all smart mobile devices and personal computers. Now passwords and account information is at the tip of your finger.\n\"The (myIDkey) thumb drive stores passwords across various services, letting you take 'em on the run.\" - Engadget\n\"I hate to use the term \"sexy\" to describe a gadget, but if the myIDkey isn't \"sexy,\" at least it's \"damn fine.\" - CNET\n\"I tried to think of anything I might want to add to this password management powerhouse, and didn't come up with anything.\" - PC Magazine\n\"For interacting with mobile devices, myIDkey communicates over Bluetooth, providing password management using their iOS and Android apps.\" - BYTE (& Information Week)\n\"If you're worried about accidentally brushing your finger against the drive on your keychain, you can add an optional tap sequence to further protect passwords.\" - LAPTOP Magazine\n\"You can plug the device into a computer via USB, or you can connect it to a laptop or a mobile device via Bluetooth - it's a veritable all-around password depot.\" - Digital Trends\n\"The device can even generate unique passwords that would be too complicated to remember otherwise for additional protection\" - SlashGear\n\"Should you happen to misplace your myIDkey or have it stolen, it is a snap to deactivate its contents for added peace of mind.\" - Ubergizmo\nUnparalleled protection + Quick and easy access. With myIDkey, your finger (or thumb) print is your key to unlock your highly personal data such as passwords, bank accounts, passports, etc. Simply swipe your thumb or finger across the reader to view passwords and more.\nWhen you need it fast, simply speak. After unlocking your myIDkey with a finger swipe, you can simply press and hold the microphone button and speak into your myIDkey to quickly recall and see that important number, date or whatever personal data is needed in a flash.\nComplete password management. Whether wirelessly connected to your phone or tablet via Bluetooth, or when directly plugged into your desktop or notebook PC via USB, myIDkey autofills your credentials for any site. With complete password management that is also protected by your fingerprint, you never have to remember another password again! Plus, myIDkey can automatically generate unique passwords for further protection - all of which is easily managed with the myIDkey app.\nNow you have a key to all your devices. By wirelessly syncing your myIDkey to your iPhone, iPad or Android phone or tablet via Bluetooth, you can create an extra layer of security for protecting what matters most. \nFree myIDkey app makes it easy... and safe.  Customize your log in with multiple finger swipes, tap sequences and more to create unbreakable access to all of your most important or sensitive content.\nYou have stuff you want protected no matter what. We can relate, and with the myIDkey app, you can easily select anything you'd like to have more security on your iPhone, iPad or Android device.\nWhen you need it, there it is. With built-in and customizable OLED display, you can easily see that important data no matter what the lighting is around you. With voice search and included scroll buttons, you can easily find your passwords and important data.\nWant even more protection? With optional tap sequence, you can set up a personal sequence that needs to be administered along with your thumbprint to unlock your myIDkey. So set up one tap, two taps or a custom pattern only you would know to further protect your passwords and identity.\nMade to fit your busy, mobile lifestyle. myIDkey easily attaches to your key ring, your purse or whatever you choose so it can always be by your side. Think of it as your personal, safe key to all the numbers, codes, dates and passwords you use every day.\nSecurity and style in one. With a removable ONYX BLACK protective case, you can ensure your myIDkey is protected during your busy lifestyle. The case easily slips over the device and locks into place for ultimate protection from scratches, wear and tear.  Bonus for Kickstarter backers:  in addition to the included case, we're throwing in a free PEARL WHITE case.  Plus, we'd like our backers to vote on the next case color!\nYou can't be too safe when dealing with passwords. We employ the latest security and encryption protocols to ensure your passwords and other personal data is always safe. We never keep your data anywhere in a form that isn't encrypted - so only you (and your fingerprint of course) can access.\nFail-safe protection, even if lost or stolen. If your myIDkey is ever lost or stolen, you're still protected. If there are multiple attempts to access the information within, myIDkey will automatically erase everything so you're still protected. If you retrieve your myIDkey or purchase a new one, you can simply restore your information by syncing to your desktop or to our secure cloud.\nGet complete protection AND complete control. Connecting multiple myIDkeys together for sharing secure information is simple. Plus, you can easily set your backup settings to sync with our cloud, another cloud service (ie DropBox or Google Drive) or via encryption to your PC, phone or tablet. So in case your myIDkey is ever lost or stolen you can stay protected. \nThe news is catching on quick. We've only just begun talking publicly about myIDkey and the response has been overwhelming. We're getting product requests from all around the world and have already been recognized by the Consumer Electronics Association with 3 innovation awards. \nLet us show our appreciation!

You don\u2019t ever need to worry about what platform it\u2019s on!\nBut even in that world, we've developed a reputation for being a bit different at Days of Wonder:\nwe focus on developing board games with the coolest components, best theme and gameplay, not on producing the cheapest games possible;\nwe develop digital versions of our games ourselves, in-house, rather than licensing them to third-parties;\nand we never, ever, discuss new products and future plans ahead of their actual release.\nBut this time, we'd like to Play Different!\nThe Project: Small World 2\nA year after the launch of Small World - the Board Game, on the first day the original iPad became available, we launched Small World for iPad, pioneering a whole new world of board games on Tablets! \nThe game earned critical acclaim and hordes of devoted players, but soon took a backseat to our own Ticket to Ride - the train game that pays the bills at Days of Wonder.\nThe game didn\u2019t die though. While fans kept playing the original iPad version, deep in a corner of our Paris office, a dedicated team started creating the next generation of Small World.\nDevelopment of Small World 2 is now well underway...\n... and it will ship later this year, no matter what!\nSmall World is about to get A WHOLE LOT BIGGER, in Small World 2. \nComing soon to a screen near you?\nFor the first time, the game will accommodate not just 2, but 3, 4 and 5 players, each players configuration with its own map, just like the board game!\nSmall World ain't so small anymore - just a bit crowded (here, with 5 players!).\nMore players also means more ways to play: Beyond its original Solo and 2 players Face-to-face mode, Small World 2 will now also support Pass'N Play, Local Play and a true Turn-by-Turn asynchronous online mode that lets you play with friends across different platforms and multiple time zones, while remaining fast enough to support real-time play.\nPlay alone or with friends, on one device or multiple ones, even on different platforms!\nThere will also be more Races and Special Powers than ever competing for world domination in Small World 2, now. In addition to the original Cursed! and Grand Dames expansions, Be Not Afraid will be available as an In-App Purchase. \nAnd if this campaign gets funded, all backers at the Tritons level and higher will automatically unlock and receive The Kickstarter Backers digital Bonus Pack, a set of 3 new Races and 3 new Special Powers that Philippe Keyaerts has developed specially for this release.\n\"Be Not Afraid...\" - Famous last words of a Small World Pigmy about to roll a die\nEven better, all these expansions will be playable under a generous \"boardgame-like\" policy, where as long as the person who initiates a game owns an expansion, all players in that game get a chance to play with it; no risk of waiting for opponents with the same set of expansions you own!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe're committed to releasing Small World 2 on iPad no matter what; but we've also heard those of you clamoring for a port onto Android and Steam. \nFor a small company like us, especially one doing all its development in-house, creating versions for these platforms is a non-trivial project, and one that will divert significant resources away from our Ticket to Ride mainstay. \nIn our forums, on Facebook and on Twitter, enough of you have told us you\u2019d like to spend some hard-earned cash on Android and Steam apps to make it worth our while. Now is your chance to prove it. \nAnd to sweeten the pot, we've come up with some very cool swag to help you decide to pledge!\nThe Rewards\nThe Online game and Kickstarter Backers digital Bonus Pack\nPhilippe Keyaerts has designed 3 new races and 3 new special powers specially for Small World players who choose to back us with their pledges during this campaign. These new races and special powers will be unlocked through a special achievement linked to each backers (at the Tritons level and higher) player account, when Small Word 2 for Android and Steam ships.\nPledge at the Skeletons level if you want the bonus races & powers along with a copy of the game on the platform of your choice.\nIf you already own Small World iPad, and are interested in getting a copy of the game on another platform, no problem - Go ahead and pledge for this new platform, and your Bonus pack will automatically appear and be playable on all platforms you own Small World 2 on!\nIf you already own Small World iPad, but don't care about the Android or Steam versions, pledge at the Tritons level instead:\nPhysical board game rewards for higher pledges\nIf you're a committed player of the board game, you might also be tempted by the rewards for some of our higher pledges, such as...\nThe 6 Player cardboard Map of Small World that Philippe is designing for this campaign.\nFeaturing Small World on one side, Small World Underground on the other, this reward will ship with all the additional tokens (mountains, lost tribes, monsters, etc.) required to play with 6 players around the table.\nIf you already own Small World on the iPad, and don't care about any of our other digital versions, but choose to pledge at the Goblins level to get this map, you will be given a chance to donate the digital copy of the game you receive as part of your pledge to a friend, while still choosing to keep the Kickstarter Backers digital Bonus Pack for yourself!\nFinally, if you don't care at all about any digital versions, but still lust for this map, we hope to offer some for sale on our web site, at a later date and slightly higher retail price.\nWe're also busy designing The Small World Pocket Encyclopedia, a 110x140mm hard cover notebook filled with 84+ full-color pages of concept art, illustrations, strategic advice and trivia surrounding the denizens of Small World.\nTo receive the Encyclopedia, simply up your pledge to the Orcs level.\nThe same comments as for the Goblins pledge apply, if you're interested in the Encyclopedia but don't care about digital versions of the games (or already own the iPad version, and have no friends to donate a digital copy to ;-)).\nAnd last but not least, for the most committed, crazy, extravagant or dedicated of you, we are offering a very limited number of opportunities for you to design your very own Small World race or mini-expansion! \nWe will professionally illustrate this expansion, lay it out, print it, and who knows? - maybe even publish it or code it into the game, if we really like it!\nSome all important Add-ons...\nBut it wouldn't quite be Small World if we'd stopped there, right?

Furthermore, even if everything goes according to plan, we might receive feedback and suggestions we want to incorporate, which could delay the product.\n\nThis being said, the iPad version of Small World 2 is already well underway, and we feel confident in our capacity to also ship Android and Steam versions within the next 12 months.\n\nBoard game risks: We work with a small number of highly specialized partners and vendors; some of the coolest rewards we describe in the various pledge levels and add-ons on this page rely on components we have never attempted to incorporate into our games before - or at least never in this manner. This could result in unforeseen production delays, and even possibly force us to modify or change some of the specifics described here.\n\nWe have managed projects of similar scope and complexity before, and are confident in our - and our suppliers' - capabilities to come through and deliver a truly desirable Designer Edition of Small World the Board game (likely the most complex reward item, listed as an add-on on this page).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "The Small World Designer Edition is available for everybody: order your copy on June 9!", "update_content": "R\u2019hka and his dwarf companions were digging for gold, but nothing could prepare them to the discovery they were about to make.\nWith shovels and pickaxes, they were progressing in the mine.

As a pro photographer shooting movie posters, magazine covers, and ad campaigns back in the day, I was lucky to get face time with lots of famous people. On photo assignments, after I got the shot for my client, I'd often ask my subjects to wear The Nose. It was not only good fun, it became a successful public relations campaign for my photo business. I called it WHO NOSE TOM ZIMBEROFF! On a regular basis, I mailed a series of postcards depicting personalities wearing The Nose to potential clients. It was obvious whose famous face was hiding behind the goofy disguise, but that was the joke, of course.\nThe negatives for these photographs have been tucked away in storage for more than twenty years. All of the film (b+w negatives and color transparencies) has to be scanned to make digital files. That's the purpose of this Kickstarter project. With your support, we can scan all of that film and, who nose!, turn the restored collection into a book, so a new audience can share in the fun\u2014and the history.\nAll photographs \u00a9 1989 - 2013 Tom Zimberoff\nSteve Jobs and the Rosetta Stone\nPoster N\u00ba1\nI shot STEVE JOBS on a magazine assignment, in 1989, at NeXT Computer in Palo Alto, California (before he reconnected with Apple).\nI arrived on location early to look around for props. I found a replica of the Rosetta Stone hanging on his office wall. Perfect! Consider it the original tablet computer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone. I took it to the lobby, where I had more room to set up lights and cameras, and I wouldn't have to drive Jobs out of his own workspace while making Polaroid test shots with a stand-in. (In the analog era we called them \"Paranoids.\")\nBut there were several huge windows in the lobby. I sent my assistant out to bring back yards and yards of opaque, black velvet drapes to block the daylight, so I could control my lighting effects. It took a few hours to seal out the sun and turn the lobby into a makeshift studio. Everything was ready to make this photo shoot as convenient as possible for Jobs.\nHe arrived accompanied by an entourage that included musician Stephen Stills (of Crosby Stills Nash & Young), whom I already knew from an album cover shoot we did in 1977. Jobs brushed right past me, took a perfunctory look at my set and said, right In front of everyone, \u201cWho\u2019s stupid f*%#@\u00a2# idea was this?\u201d I said it was my stupid f*%#@\u00a2# idea, and if he didn\u2019t like it he could go f*%# himself because I went to a lot of trouble just to make him look good\u2014for me to look good for my client, too.\nI don\u2019t remember the details, but while some huffing and puffing went on among Jobs\u2019s acolytes, I went over to say hello to Stephen Stills. I was prepared to pack up and leave without a picture. But Jobs came over, all smiles, and apologized.\nOnly recently, after reading his posthumously-published biography, I discovered that such startling outbursts of invective were not reserved for visiting photographers, like me. Apparently, they were pretty common. Jobs used shock and awe to separate the meek from those with more mettle. Anyway, we got down to work. Several different setups and wardrobe changes later, we finished with The Nose.\nPoster N\u00ba2\nGEORGE LUCAS and YODA\nPoster N\u00ba3\nThat same year, 1989, I was invited by George Lucas to visit Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, California. The invitation and portrait shoot came about in an unusual way.\nI was the featured artist at a Sausalito gallery in conjunction with the Mill Valley Film Festival (both in Marin County, which was also my home). We were displaying huge framed prints I'd made of movie stars, directors, and writers. Almost at the last minute, I realized that the person most singularly associated with movies in Northern California lived and worked practically around the corner: George Lucas. And he wasn't represented in the exhibition. How could that be! Well, that's exactly what I thought I should tell him. So, in an uncharacteristically brazen moment for me, I picked up a phone and called Skywalker Ranch. \"Hello, I'd like to speak with Mr. Lucas please.\" What do you know! He took the call. I told him who I was and how I hoped to include him in my pantheon of portraits celebrating the film industry. He kindly agreed.\nThe next day, I drove out to Skywalker to meet Lucas and scout for props and a space to set up my backdrop and lights. During our first meeting in his office, George tossed his assistant a set of car keys and told him to drive me down to \"the warehouse\" in San Rafael, about a dozen miles away. We arrived at an innocuous looking building surrounded by body shops and furniture stores. When the door was opened for me, I experienced what Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon must have felt like, as they peered into King Tut's tomb for the first time. Entering, I was immediately confronted by the Death Star (a plastic model about the size of a large beach ball). Standing nearby were C3PO and R2D2. Awestruck, I turned my eyes toward\u2014well, props galore hardly does justice to describe what I saw. Arrayed on shelves like Costco was everything. Looking back through the fog of time, it seems as immense as Costco. Surely it wasn't that big. But it was larger than life. Here were Indiana Jones's whip, his hat, and leather jacket. Here were the light sabers. Just sitting on a shelf. I could touch. I could hold. Here was the robe of the Emperor of the Dark Force, which I later got George to wear. Here were all the handmade models of Acclamotor assault ships, Corellian corvettes, a Naboo royal starship . . . the Millennium Falcon. Holy crap! All there. Storm Trooper helmets and Darth Vader's mask. I could go on. I did go on a fantasy shopping spree. I picked some of this and some of that, along with a few of those. And we drove back to the ranch. Yoda was, in fact, already there, waiting for us; although a number of his stand-ins remained in the warehouse. On the way back, I kept imagining what might happen if we got into a fender bender on Hwy 101 or got stopped by a cop heading north to Lucas Valley Road with all of this booty in the back of our SUV.\nA very patient George Lucas persevered for all the time it took to run dozens of rolls of film through my Hasselblad. I printed two separate portraits for the show: one of George wearing the Emperor's robe and the one you see, here, with Yoda. And, at the end of the shoot, he put on my own precious prop: The Nose. Later, he visited the Hanson Gallery in Sausalito, and bought one of my prints.\nPoster N\u00ba4 . . . This is the only image (poster or print) available in color.\nThank you.

Read all about it here.\nUpdate: Halo Co-Creator Chooses LiveCode to Build Graphic Novel Experience\nThis is such an amazing new iOS app that we wanted to share details here.\nWhat is this Kickstarter Campaign About?\nHave you ever had an idea for an app but don\u2019t know how to code?\nHave you ever wanted to learn how to code but found it too difficult?\nHave you ever been frustrated by how long it takes to write an app?\nAre you frustrated with the current state of computer science education in high school?\nDo you want to help establish coding as a new form of literacy?\nAre you interested in a better way to write software for your company?\nIf you answered YES to any of these questions, then we need your help.\nIn 1987 Apple created a program called HyperCard. If you haven\u2019t heard of it, all you need to know is that tens of millions of end user programmers used it. It was the easiest and most popular end user programming environment ever created, before or since.\nLiveCode is like a next generation version of HyperCard. It is used to create #1 one app store apps, real-time flight booking systems and control satellites. It is used to create simple one off apps and utilities to solve day-to-day problems.\nThere are some things it can\u2019t do \u2013 yet. This project is to create a next-generation LiveCode.\nOur vision is that this new next-generation LiveCode will be free and open source.\nIt will run on every popular platform and device.\nIt will let you write programs in English.\nAnd by being open, its English language programming will be extensible to any computing problem out there. That's a world first.\nIf you couldn\u2019t code before, LiveCode is the answer. If you\u2019ve used the existing version of LiveCode before and it didn\u2019t do everything you needed, this next-generation version has you covered.\nWhat is LiveCode? Our story.\nComputer Science Students Love LiveCode\nAlmost a quarter of secondary schools in Scotland are now teaching with LiveCode.\nEvery school that has used LiveCode for more than a year has seen a doubling of uptake in advanced computer science classes!\nBy supporting this project, you\u2019ll be helping create a version of the platform even more suitable for teaching.\nIt will be free for schools and universities worldwide.\nWe believe that computational thinking and programming is a key form of digital literacy and that enabling a new generation to write interactive software is critically important in today's economy.\nStudents use LiveCode to create games and apps for their own smartphones and tablets. Although the LiveCode language is easy to use, it is a sophisticated and complete programming language suitable for teaching all aspects of computational thinking needed for this age group, even including advanced concepts for older students (e.g. arrays, parameter passing by reference). \nThe open source edition of LiveCode will be free and available to schools globally. Read more about LiveCode in Education.\nWhat is your money going toward?\nWe need to raise \u00a3350,000 to fund an experienced team to do this right.\nWe will re-engineer the whole platform so it is easy for the community to contribute to the code base. Did you know that Linux only took off after a version of it was created that was modularized with a kernel? We\u2019ll be doing the same to LiveCode. If you\u2019re technical, you can read all about this here.\nWe will introduce a new technology called \u201cOpen Language\u201d. With Open Language, the more technical members of our community can create English-like words and phrases to enable everyone to write programs that use any aspect of a computer or device. If you\u2019re technical, you can read all about that here.\nWe will introduce a new visual editor designed around today\u2019s usability standards. The editor will be open. The more technical members of our community can create simplified versions of the editor for tablets or primary schools.\nHere is a screenshot of the prototype:\nWhen Will it Be Completed?\nWithin a month of the campaign closing we will launch the Community Edition with the source code. That version will have the source code as it is today. This will provide everyone who has made a pledge access to the platform.\nOver the following few months we will be hard at work on the main goal of creating the next generation of the platform. We will restructure the code into modules that plug into a new kernel and deliver this version for testing over the summer. Once that is complete the community will be able to contribute to the source code easily.\nTechnical Summary of Kickstarter Deliverables\nWe are going to use the Kickstarter funding to deliver the next generation of the entire LiveCode language and visual development environment. To do this we need to do some packaging and updating, including:\nPacking the source code into community-friendly modules\nOptimize the execution engine and some older components\nAdd a clean architecture to allow new language plugins to be developed\nCreate a new, beautiful graphical front-end for building your apps\nThe scope of these tasks is considerable. We will be reorganizing some half a million lines of C++ code, running on six platforms - Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android and Server, into straightforward modules that plug into the new kernel. We will be porting our English-like syntax into a new uniform virtual machine layer and adding a way to let the community add its own syntax. Another team will be working on re-designing the visual editor in parallel to make the platform even easier to get started with and use!\nWhile we will be making the code base available in its current form immediately, these important changes will take the platform to the next level, and make it much easier for the open source community to make contributions. At the end of this we will have a beautiful, consistent and openplatform.\nStretch Goals\nWe have designed the project to be flexible and there is so much more we can add to the new Open Source platform.\nWe have some truly amazing stretch goals - features for students, for gamers, for commercial companies and more. Supporting our stretch goals will let us deliver the future to you much faster. Example stretch goals include a brand new multimedia layer, new sprite capabilities and support for additional platforms!\nWe have goals covering virtually every enhancement request our customers have ever made, so please stay tuned.\nWho You Will Be Working With\nThe LiveCode Team - click to learn more about us\nRewards\nEvery pledge you make is so important to the success of this exciting project and we have developed fantastic rewards to thank you for your support.\nEveryone who contributes more than \u00a312 ($20) will get a complete set of LiveCode Training Academies where you can learn everything you need to know to create your own app or game.\nThe pricing in euros and US dollars is an estimate and your actual conversion rate may vary slightly.\nPlease Make a Pledge.

Well now you can!\n3Doodler is the world\u2019s first and only 3D Printing Pen. Using ABS plastic (the material used by many 3D printers), 3Doodler draws in the air or on surfaces. It\u2019s compact and easy to use, and requires no software or computers. You just plug it into a power socket and can start drawing anything within minutes.\nThe latest model 3Doodler\nOh, and it\u2019s also the most affordable way to 3D print\u2026 by a looong way! With 3Doodler we\u2019re making fun 3D creation accessible to everyone.\nHow does it work?\nIf you can scribble, trace or wave a finger in the air you can use a 3Doodler.\n3Doodler in action\nAs 3Doodler draws, it extrudes heated plastic, which quickly cools and solidifies into a strong stable structure. This allows you to build an infinite variety of shapes and items with ease! Most people will instantly be able to trace objects on paper, and after only a few hours of practice you will be able to make far more intricate objects.\n3Doodler is a brand new way of creating objects and artistic works. Whether you are an artist, hobbyist or 3D printing fanatic, we can\u2019t wait to see what you 3Doodle!\nSix little men and the other one said... 3Doodler! 3Doodler!\nWhat can I make with 3Doodler? \nThere are many ways 3Doodler can be used. 3Doodles can be created as flat forms and peeled off a piece of paper, as freestyle 3D objects, or in separate parts, ready to be joined together using the 3Doodler. The creative opportunities are endless, including:\nBasic 3D shapes and 3D models\nJewellery, pendants and hanging ornaments\nDecorative art and fridge magnets\nPersonalization of everyday objects (iPhone cases, laptops, pens, etc.)\nA mini Eiffel Tower or a soccer pitch for your Lego men\nAnd much much more\u2026\n3Doodler works on almost any surface, including plastic, allowing users to personalize items such as iPhone cases, or anything else they feel like 3Doodling on. 3Doodler can even be used for minor repair work.\n3Doodler \"stencils\"\nWe\u2019re particularly excited about 3Doodler \"stencils\" - sophisticated print-out stencil kits to help you create awesome objects (like our Eiffel Tower). We'll be making these available online for everyone. Simply print it out, 3Doodle each part according to the stencil and then join them with your 3Doodler. As time goes by we, and the 3Doodler community, will be able to create hundreds (maybe thousands) of stencil kits that can easily be emailed and shared with friends. We\u2019ll be hosting these on our website, the3Doodler.com, for anyone to download and use for free.\n2 ft Eiffel Tower Stencil\nWe\u2019re looking forward to seeing what people create and supporting 3Doodler communities everywhere.\nThe Sellers of Etsy Special\nWe're collaborating with some fantastic sellers on Etsy, all wire artists, to showcase how 3Doodler can be used to create beautiful objects and pieces of art. We're thrilled to be working with Bud Bullivant, Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight), Nakisha and Ele McKay to bring our vision to life. \nWire Art by Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight) - sparkflight.etsy.com\nWire Art by Bud Bullivant (wiredbybud.etsy.com)\nBud and Ruth will be creating a limited edition run of the first professional 3Doodles (see the Seller on Etsy Special Reward above). The ideas are already flowing, and we'll be working together to bring you a truly unique 3Doodle creation from these top artists. The expected size of the 3Doodle is approximately 4 x 2 inches. It will be beautifully boxed and shipped by August.\n\nNakisha will be producing an exclusive template for anyone ordering a 3Doodler. Created especially for you, the template will showcase 3Doodler's capabilities and allow you to make your very own artist-designed 3Doodles. And we'll be announcing a special collaboration with Ele shortly.\nWire Art by Ele McKay (elemckay.etsy.com)\nWire Art by Nakisha (wireanimals.etsy.com)\nMore to come on all of this in an Update! Bud, Ruth, Nakisha, Ele, we're truly grateful for your support!\n3Doodler Components & Accessories:\nThe pen: The 3Doodler pen is 180mm by 24mm. The pen weighs less than 200 grams or 7 ounces (the weight of a typical apple), although the exact weight will depend on the final shell specifications once in production. And we are using a universal power supply, so provided you have the correct adapter for your country, 3Doodler will work just fine on 110v or 240v.\nThe evolution of 3Doodler\n3Doodler is not a toy for children (it's recommended for ages 12+). While the plastic extruded from 3Doodler is safe to touch once it has left the pen, the pen itself has a metal tip that can get as hot as 270C. There is no reason for any user to touch the tip while in use, but safety comes first, and we are creating a video series that will explain how to use the 3Doodler, covering off the different techniques and safety precautions necessary.\nThe Ink (i.e. ABS/PLA plastic): The 3Doodler uses 3mm ABS or PLA plastic as its \"ink\" - just like a 3D printer. Each 3Doodler backed on Kickstarter comes with at least one bag of plastic; each bag will contain ten 1ft strands of plastic; and each 1 ft strand produces approximately 11 ft of 3Doodling fun... yes, you read that right, a foot of plastic goes a very long way in the 3Doodler.\nSome suitably attractive photos of ABS plastic\nABS is one of the most common plastics around. It's used in most of the plastic stuff around you. PLA is what we call a \"bioplastic\". It's made from corn, is biodegradable and has a lower melting temperature than ABS. We are offering both choices as each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nWe plan to offer plastic sold in strands (making it easy to switch colours and create different styles), but 3Doodler-compatible plastic is also available in 1kg spools from between $30 to $55 from a variety of sources... such as here, here, here, here, and here. And for some stunning PLA have a look here. This is no ink cartridge model!\nFun Fact: The average 1kg spool of 3mm ABS contains approximately 360-370 feet of plastic. That's approximately 3,960-4,070 feet of 3Doodling, or 3 Empire State Buildings with enough to spare for several more weeks of doodling.\nThe Future of 3Doodling: We have a ton of ideas for add-ons and accessories that will make 3Doodler even cooler, more useful, fun, and generally awesomer (is that a word?). We hope that the 3Doodler will be a big success so that we can share all our ideas and offer you even more 3Doodling fun...\nPete & Max, Inventors of 3Doodler\nWe have a lot we want to tell you about 3Doodler, so we\u2019ve created an extensive FAQ to answer all of your questions. And we\u2019re on standby to respond to any other queries you may have!\n*The 3Doodler was created at the Artisans Asylum in Boston. The whole team would like to thank the Artisans Asylum for their help and support. Without hacker-spaces like this, projects such as 3Doodler could not happen.

We held back so that we could ensure the prototype worked perfectly (check out the video, it does!) and so that we could speak to more factories (and make related visits to Hong Kong and China). Comfortable that we can deliver this, we\u2019re now launching 3Doodler! \n\nBelow are a couple of the main challenges we will tackle:\n\nChoice of Factory: As with any physical item there are a number of challenges to getting it right. We have been part of numerous projects that have made it through development, into the factory production phase, and then into consumer hands. While our experiences have helped prepare us to avoid major pitfalls, we have been very selective in our choice of factory, choosing a partner that we know we can work with and that is perfect for our needs. They are large enough to scale 3Doodler, but without being so big that we'll be lost amidst the shop floor, and they have a great development team. We also intend to spend a large amount of time in person at the factory.\n \nQuality Control: Good QC is a major focus of ours. The quantity of orders on Kickstarter will help determine how we handle this. If we receive orders for under 1000 units, we will hand test each and every 3Doodler ourselves at 3Doodler HQ in Boston. If we received over 1000 orders we will carry out all QC in situ at the factory, with the assistance of dedicated QC personnel, and with relayed video footage of each 3Doodler going through testing.\n\nThis is about getting the best possible 3Doodler into your hands ASAP.

The circuit board is designed to withstand typical use and abuse seen in a purse or in your back pocket.\nFlatLight is more than your typical light.  It uses an array of LEDs mounted on a flexible printed circuit board that transmit light into a flat fiber optic backlight.  The backlight redirects and distributes the light to evenly emit from the lens.  A specially configured processor controls the functions and controls the duty cycle of the LEDs so they run at a brighter level.  The processor also gives the device the advantage of some additional features, including extended runtime, a sleep time out, duty cycle corrections, and low voltage shut off.\nFlatLight's Flexible Circuit Board\nSpecifications:\nCredit Card Sized (51 x 91mm)\nThin Profile (<3.5mm)\nSuper Bright LED Backlight\n10+ Hours of Continuous Usage\nFlatLight size comparison to a credit card\nFeatures:\nPhoto Quality Graphics\nReplaceable Batteries (CR 2016)\nUses:\nFlatLight is a convenient source of light for:\nFinding your keys after you've dropped them.\nReading your book without disturbing your neighbor.\nSearching through your bag.\nUsing as a map light in the car\nWhy Kickstarter?\nDue to the investment in designs, development, and tooling, we need help purchasing the first order of FlatLights.\nAdditional Information\nIf you're interested in getting more than one FlatLight, just add $15 increments to your pledge  (i.e. $20 + $15 + $15 = $50 for 3 FlatLights)\nStretch Goals\n$20,000 - We\u2019ll add an extra set of batteries for everyone who pledged for at least one FlatLight\nDesign and Manufacturing History\nFlatLight started with the idea of creating the thinnest light possible and through many iterations, FlatLight was born.  There are many challenges when designing smaller and smaller devices, this applies to making things thinner as well.  Battery size and how the contacts will be arranged, position of LEDs relative to the fiber optics are just a couple of the challenges overcome in the FlatLight\nDevelopment Process\nThe FlatLight has gone through a typical development cycle:\nIdeation Phase:  Through a series of brainstorming sessions a bucket of ideas were collected and filtered.  Initial sketches were made and out of this phase the idea of FlatLight was born, to create the thinnest light possible.  A market study was performed to insure market placement\nConcept Phase:  A feasibility study was conducted to evaluate hardware, software, integration, and tooling.  A proof of concept was constructed with the basic elements of the FlatLight (fiber-optic back light and power source).  It was tested for battery life and light intensity.  Various sketches were created to evaluate the industrial design (look and feel).  From this process a product brief was created to document form, fit and function. The CAD database was started as well to get initial space claim.\nDiscovery Phase:  A more detailed product specification was developed and the manufacturing partner was engaged for budgetary quotes, design for manufacturing and design for assembly.  A rapid prototype was made to further evaluate the look and feel of the FlatLight.\nDevelopment Phase:   Mechanical samples were produced by the factory and evaluated, along with the circuit board and firmware.  The packaging specifications were defined and verified with the factory.  Remaining bugs were dis-positioned and correction plans were put in place.\nPre-Production:  A tooling PO was issued and the tooling plan was reviewed.  A packaging review was completed to verify the FlatLight would survive typical shipping methods.  A final bug scrub was completed and a quality control plan was put in place.  A pilot production run of 50 pieces was used to verify the manufacturing process.\nRamp & Production:  Any low risk running changes will be rolled in to the design during ramp.  Once the first order is filled, a first article inspection of all the design specifications will be done.\nVolume Production:  Higher risk running changes will be rolled in during this phase.  A review of the entire development cycle will be done and changes will be applied to the next product.\nPrototype FlatLight Packaging", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the production tools approved (T1 and T2 parts have been inspected and verified), packaging design complete and the package tooling in process, the remaining risks are minimal.\n\nRemaining tasks (most are done in parallel):\n1. Inspect and verify packaging samples (1 week). If changes are needed, it should only take a week to modify the design and get the factory to sign off. Status - In Process\n\n2. Setup product import channels and verify required documentation in in place (4 weeks). A sample shipment will use these channels to verify the process. Status - In Process\n\n3. Develop shipping process for order fulfillment (2 weeks). A sample will be shipped domestically and internationally to verify the package is sized appropriately. Status - In Process\n\n4. Verify the assembly process during the pre-production engineering build (1 week). \n\n5. Verify the component purchasing channels are working correctly during production ramp. This will validate the component lead times and costs and allow for more accurate order times (1 week). Status - Not Started\n\n6. Lead time to manufacture the first production lot (3 weeks). Status - Not Started\n\n7. Quality control inspections, pack out and shipping preparation (1 week). Status - Not Started\n\nThe FlatLight design uses commonly used components to avoid part availability issues. It has also been thoroughly tested for functionality and shipping yielding a robust product.\n\nWe understand that as backers you would like to receive your rewards in a timely manner, so we have done our best to give realistic delivery dates to all of our rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Beyond Kickstarter", "update_content": "For all of you who missed the FlatLight Kickstarter campaign or want additional FlatLights we have FlatLights on Amazon."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "All Rewards Have Shipped", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nWe have officially shipped all of the remaining rewards with the exception of 7 (still missing surveys).

So we came up with a Super Sampler Pack, a 24 cube assorted box that includes all of our flavors, for $20. If we release another flavor (hint, hint) in the future it will be automatically added to this box and the cubes per flavor will decrease by one.\nJiva Coffee Cubes are delicious Colombian coffee and raw, unrefined cane sugar in a cube!\nWe know making a good cup of coffee isn't always possible. We're students, in between classes we have personally timed the lines at every coffee provider on campus, most of which are too long to endure without being late. Unless it is one of those days where your overall mood exudes the \"the whole world can wait\" attitude. Or when running through a terminal to catch an early flight, the smiling kiosk attendant surely has that tower of no-name, muddy coffee that was brewed sometime that morning, but do you wait for the small cup of folgers served on the plane or do you settle for the overpriced kiosk sludge? There are those blessed coffee fanatics that whip out their portable brewers anywhere, making the room around them smell like a full-fledged Coffee plantation with their ziplock bags of finely grounded micro-lotted coffee. But thats not us and it probably isn't you either.\n  Coffee can be time-consuming, it can require various parts and machines and it can get pretty expensive. As an alternative to this we personally needed an instant coffee but the problem with that is that most instant coffee aren't any good. The quality of the coffee in instant is acceptably subpar and the mixture of instant, creamer and sugar often yields us an uncoordinated, unhealthy cup of joe.\nJiva Cubes blends the quality of a gourmet cup of coffee with the ease of making a cup of instant.\nWho is Jiva Cubes for?\nJiva can be enjoyed by almost anybody. It\u2019s especially convenient for students, travelers, the outdoorsy type, and office-folk. It\u2019s also good for those who are OCD about their beverage consistency, are always busy going places or are just plain lazy. No, we are not trying to insinuate anything...  Okay, fine, yes we were talking about you.\nJiva is not for proud coffee snobs. Those out there who will whip out machinery of any (backpack fitting) size, hand-grinders and all, to enjoy coffee in the only way acceptable. You guys are special and we need you, so continue spreading the aroma of fresh grinded espresso for the sake of all of us. (And although we cower beneath your shiny handpresso, we need coffee too :/) We all can\u2019t be at that level of awesome so we made Jiva for ourselves and now for you.\nWhere did Jiva come from?\nOur cubes are sourced from Colombia but we are based in Miami, Florida and Jiva got its start, here, on Kickstarter. Check out our first Kickstarter project page:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jivacubes/jiva-coffee-cubes\nWhat is this project for?\n\u25d8 We have been taking our time with the product, developing flavors and the hot cocoa cubes and have been tweaking the cubes to reflect reviews and suggestions received from our first group of amazing Kickstarter backers. \nWe transitioned the product into larger production capabilities and managed to do so at a lower cost to us.  We successfully overhauled the production process, and in some aspects the product itself, in order to transition a handcrafted product to a larger production item. Our current obstacle is our ability to wrap the cubes, which is currently done individually, by hand. Right now we can package about 40 boxes a day; with a standard packing machine our packaging capabilities would extend to over 300 boxes an hour. Over a 7 Fold increase per hour.\n With this packaging capability we would be able to get Jiva into the coffee shops and stores that are already interested in housing them!\nAlso, and most importantly for us, we would like to field test our new hot chocolate cubes, Caramel, Strong and Decaf, in order to receive your reviews and suggestions on these. This is an invaluable process for us that will allow us to perfect them before officially rolling them out. Although, as of right now they are pretty delicious!\nOH YEAH! BRING ON THE CHOCOLATE!\nAllen & I are huge fans of chocolate. When experimenting with new flavors we also played around with the idea cubes made with cacao grown from the mountains of Colombia. We stuck with raw, unrefined cane sugar and we found the finest Criollo type Cacao grown in the higher mountains of Colombia.\nLike wine, chocolate reflects the distinctive features of the region. The kind of cacao beans grown, climate conditions, and how the beans are dried and fermented vary from country to country. There are three Cacao varieties, the Criollo, Forastero, and Trinitario. The Forastero is the makes up almost 90% of the market because they are a robust plant that has solid full bodied taste.  Colombia experiments with many types of cacao varieties but specializes on the Criollo type which is known for its flavorful, fruity richness. This strain is harder to grow but it proves to be worth the trouble. \nTry out our decadent cubes and let us know what you think!\nWhat makes Jiva Coffee Cubes special?\n\u25d8 Jiva Coffee consists of Excelso Beans, the highest quality coffee exported from Colombia. Unlike other instant coffees that are made of lower quality coffee, (because hey its instant, nobody expects quality instant anything) we use the highest quality beans.\n\u25d8 Our instant coffee is freeze-dried not sprayed. Why does anyone even care? Freeze-drying method is a bit more costly and it requires more time and expertise to execute, but it is well worth higher quality coffee. Spray methods are economical and much quicker to make, but it takes a whirlwind of chemicals you will never be able to pronounce to process it and it leaves chemical residue which is unhealthy and icky tasting.\n\u25d8 Jiva Coffee Cubes are always made of 100% Colombian coffee. We never mix or dilute our coffee with beans from other countries to make quotas.\n\u25d8 We know our farmers (some of them are even Natalia\u2019s family- uncles and such) and we have a direct connection to the farms where the coffee and Panela is grown, enabling us to learn and participate in the cultivation and production process.\n\u25d8 Our Jiva Cubes contain NO chemical additives, preservatives, GMO\u2019s, or colorants.\n\u25d8 Our coffee beans are hand-picked from the famous Santander growing region in Colombia.\nWhat is Panela?\n\u25d8 Our sweetener is raw, unrefined cane sugar that is known in Colombia as Panela. It is minimally processed, chemical-free and is never bleached.\n\u25d8 During the production process the sugar cane is gently heated and cleansed naturally without the use of chemicals. This yields sugar that retains nearly all of its raw nutrients. This process also makes Panela easier to digest and break down into energy.\nDelicious doesn't always have to be difficult.\nHelp us spread Jiva and bask in warm, delicious glory.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn our last project we were tested by almost every obstical possible, including having to transition a handmade product into a mechanical production. We cleared all of those issues and always kept our backers updated along the way. \n\nPackaging time is the only issue that could slow down shipments in any way. We would have the machine setup and running within a month and would take a week to transit and clear Customs and the FDA. \n\nIf we are overwhelmingly successful, it may take a bit longer on the shipping & handling end but we have planned for expediting the shipping process in that event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "New Coffee Cubes Launch - New Formula, Now Made in USA, Discount + more", "update_content": "Hi Everyone!\n  We are happy to present our new coffee cubes to you!\n     We\u2019ve been out of stock for the last six months because we recently moved all of our manufacturing from Colombia into the United States.

As a pro photographer shooting movie posters, magazine covers, and ad campaigns back in the day, I was lucky to get face time with lots of famous people. On photo assignments, after I got the shot for my client, I'd often ask my subject to wear The Nose. It was not only good fun, it became a successful public relations campaign for my photo studio. It was called WHO NOSE TOM ZIMBEROFF!  I mailed a series of postcards depicting celebrities wearing The Nose to potential clients who might hire me. It was pretty obvious whose famous face was hiding behind the goofy disguise, but that was the joke, of course.\nThe negatives for these photographs were lost in storage for years. More of them are turning up from my archives all the time. All of the film (b+w negatives and color transparencies) has to be scanned to make digital files. That's why I'm asking for your support. Other than the self-promo postcards, these portraits have remained unpublished. With your backing, and your enjoyment of these posters, we can scan them all and, perhaps, turn the restored collection into a book, so a whole new audience can share in the fun\u2014and the history.\nSTEVE JOBS and the ROSETTA STONE\nREAD the CULT of MAC story: http://www.cultofmac.com/212065/nose-jobs-the-story-behind-the-most-incredible-steve-jobs-photo-youve-never-seen-feature/?all=1\nPoster N\u00ba1\nAll photographs \u00a9 1989 - 2013 Tom Zimberoff\nI shot STEVE JOBS on a magazine assignment, in 1989, at NeXT Computer in Palo Alto, California (before he reconnected with Apple).\nI arrived on location early to look around for props. I found a replica of the Rosetta Stone hanging on his office wall. Perfect! Consider it the original tablet computer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone. I took it to the lobby, where I had more room to set up lights and cameras, and I wouldn't have to drive Jobs out of his own workspace while making Polaroid test shots with a stand-in. (In the analog era we called them \"Paranoids.\")\nBut there were several huge windows in the lobby. I sent my assistant out to bring back yards and yards of opaque, black velvet drapes to block the daylight, so I could control my lighting effects. It took a few hours to seal out the sun and turn the lobby into a makeshift studio. Everything was ready to make this photo shoot as convenient as possible for Jobs.\nHe arrived accompanied by an entourage that included musician Stephen Stills (of Crosby Stills Nash & Young), whom I already knew from an album cover shoot we did in 1977. Jobs brushed right past me, took a perfunctory look at my set and said, right In front of everyone, \u201cWho\u2019s stupid f%\u221e&@\u00a2# idea was this?\u201d I said it was my stupid f%\u221e&@\u00a2# idea, and if he didn\u2019t like it he could go f%\u221e& himself because I went to a lot of trouble just to make him look good\u2014for me to look good for my client, too. \nI don\u2019t remember the details, but while some huffing and puffing went on among Jobs\u2019s acolytes, I went over to say hello to Stephen Stills. I was prepared to pack up and leave without a picture. But Jobs came over, all smiles, and apologized.\nOnly recently, after reading his posthumously-published biography, I discovered that such startling outbursts of invective were not reserved for visiting photographers, like me. Apparently, they were pretty common. Jobs used shock and awe to separate the meek from those with more mettle. Anyway, we got down to work. Several different setups and wardrobe changes later, we finished with The Nose.\nPoster N\u00ba2\nGEORGE LUCAS and YODA\nThat same year, 1989, I was invited by George Lucas to visit Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, California. The invitation and subsequent portrait shoot came about in an unusual way.\nPoster N\u00ba3\nI was the featured artist at a Sausalito gallery in conjunction with the Mill Valley Film Festival (both in Marin County, which was also my home). We were displaying huge framed prints I'd made of movie stars, directors, and writers. Almost at the last minute, I realized that the person most singularly associated with movies in Northern California lived and worked practically around the corner: George Lucas. And he wasn't represented in the exhibition. How could that be! Well, that's exactly what I thought I should tell him. So, in an uncharacteristically brazen moment for me, I picked up a phone and called Skywalker Ranch. \"Hello, I'd like to speak with Mr. Lucas please.\" What do you know! He took the call. I told him who I was and how I hoped to include him in my pantheon of portraits celebrating the film industry. He kindly agreed.\nThe next day, I drove out to Skywalker to meet Lucas and scout for props and a space to set up my backdrop and lights. During our first meeting in his office, George tossed his assistant a set of car keys and told him to drive me down to \"the warehouse\" in San Rafael, about a dozen miles away. We arrived at an innocuous looking building surrounded by body shops and furniture stores. When the door was opened for me, I experienced what Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon must have felt like, as they peered into King Tut's tomb for the first time. Entering, I was immediately confronted by the Death Star (a plastic model about the size of a large beach ball). Standing nearby were C3PO and R2D2. Awestruck, I turned my eyes toward\u2014well, props galore hardly does justice to describe what I saw. Arrayed on shelves like Costco was everything. Looking back through the fog of time, it seems as immense as Costco. Surely it wasn't that big. But it was larger than life. Here were Indiana Jones's whip, his hat, and leather jacket. Here were the light sabers. Just sitting on a shelf. I could touch. I could hold. Here was the robe of the Emperor of the Dark Force, which I later got George to wear. Here were all the handmade models of Acclamotor assault ships, Corellian corvettes, a Naboo royal starship . . . the Millennium Falcon. Holy crap! All there. Storm Trooper helmets and Darth Vader's mask. I could go on. I did go on a fantasy shopping spree. I picked some of this and some of that, along with a few of those. And we drove back to the ranch. Yoda was, in fact, already there, waiting for us; although a number of his stand-ins remained in the warehouse. On the way back, I kept imagining what might happen if we got into a fender bender on Hwy 101 or got stopped by a cop heading north to Lucas Valley Road with all of this booty in the back of our SUV.\nA very patient George Lucas persevered for all the time it took to run dozens of rolls of film through my Hasselblad. I printed two separate portraits for the show: one of George wearing the Emperor's robe and the one you see, here, with Yoda. And, at the end of the shoot, he put on my own precious prop: The Nose. Later, he visited the Hanson Gallery in Sausalito, and bought one of my prints.\nPoster N\u00ba4\nIt's been fun to reminisce.

We've compensated for that on this project by making very specific pledge levels in which the shipping costs are fixed.\n\nThe second issue also came from allowing backers to add items. It did not allow for a very clean survey or batch processing of any kind so many of the pledges took substantially longer to put together.

We intend to continue expanding the game both with new content and new features. A good example of this is planetary landings. We have an ambitious goal for landings to include new gameplay and a rich variety of worlds to explore. To achieve our goal we want the planets to come to life. We also want to add leaving the ships so you can explore space stations or board enemy vessels or even just to look around your own.\nThe main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.\nAnother avenue we intend to explore is other platforms, but for now the focus is very much on the Windows PC release. Only once the initial game is done will we start to look at other platforms.\nReally big expansions are likely to be paid for while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to \u00a380 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.\nPress Links\nThe POD  Delusion (Podcast)\nhttp://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2012/12/21/episode-167-21st-december-2012-end-of-the-world-special/\nBBC News:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20205555\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20165344\nVG24/7:\nhttp://www.vg247.com/2012/11/23/elite-dangerous-brabens-square-peg/\nEurogamer:\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-26-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-multiplayer-gameplay-as-kickstarter-pushes-past-500k-mark\n BeefJack:\nhttp://beefjack.com/features/david-braben-elite-dangerous-interview/\nPC Gamer:\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/03/new-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-off-galaxy-evolution/\nIncgamer\nhttp://www.incgamers.com/2012/11/credits-cobras-and-crowd-funding-david-braben-tells-us-about-elite-dangerous/\nInternational Press Links\nDeveloper Diary 3:\nhttp://www.playm.de/2012/12/elite-dangerous-drittes-entwicklervideo-mit-neuen-spielszenen-66215/\nhttp://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2012-12-12-news-videogiochi-un-nuovo-filmato-per-elite-dangerous\nDeveloper Diary 2 / Interview part I:\nhttp://www.gizmodo.de/2012/12/06/elite-dangerous-hat-die-halfte-seiner-kickstartersumme-eingespielt.html\nDeveloper Diary 2:\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73093\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73209\nhttp://www.gamesblog.it/post/75423/elite-dangerous-in-un-nuovo-video-diario-di-sviluppo\nIntro video:\nhttp://www.gameplorer.de/elite-dangerous-kickstarter-projekt-fuer-die-fortsetzung-eines-klassikers/\nhttp://www.stern.de/spiele/vorschau/neues-elite-dangerous-entwicklertagebuch-zeigt-evolution-der-galaxie-12101.html\nGolem.de:\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-dangerous-raumstationen-schiffe-und-planeten-besuchen-1212-96386.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-macher-david-braben-ich-mag-keine-zwischensequenzen-1211-95684.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/frontier-developments-david-braben-stellt-elite-dangerous-im-video-vor-1211-95630.html\nBooks Set in the Elite: Dangerous world:\n\"Elite - Reclamation\"  by Drew Wagar.

This is currently part funded on Kickstarter here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1483152934/elite-chronicles\nMostly Harmless.\n\u201cElite\u201d has gone down in history as one of the most successful games of the 1980s. It was the first \u2018open world\u2019 game in which the player can freely roam a vast space. It was the first true 3D game too, and set many other benchmarks. Ian Bell and I set out to make a game for ourselves rather than for some imagined market. We were sick of games with three lives then a new life every 10,000 score; we wanted something new.\nThe original \u201cElite\u201d fitted into around 22K of memory, out of a total of 32K on the BBC Micro Model B computer on which it was launched (8K was needed for the screen, 2K for the system). This is less than a single typical email today. In it were eight galaxies each with 256 star systems. Each planet in those systems had its own legal system, economy and so on. Clearly some magic had to happen to fit it into 22K, and that magic was procedural generation.\nCombat in the original \"Elite\" on the BBC Micro\nCompetent\n\u201cFrontier\u201d followed in 1993 on 16 bit computers, and pushed these procedural techniques further. In it I made a model of the whole of the Milky Way galaxy with all 100,000,000,000 or so star systems, and many more planets and moons, each of which you could visit. It is something I am really proud of, as it was as scientifically accurate as I could make it, and provided a great backdrop for a game. I loved the richness of the galaxy, but with the benefit of hindsight I think the way the ships flew detracted from the joyous immediacy of those in \u201cElite\u201d.\nData on the Fomalhaut system in \"Frontier\" on the Amiga\nDangerous...\nImagine what is now possible, squeezing the last drop of performance from modern computers in the way \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d did in their days? It is not just a question of raw performance (though of course these elements will make it look gorgeous), but we can push the way the networking works too \u2013 something very few people had access to in the days of Frontier.\nFrontier Developments, the company I founded in January 1994 (and whose first product was a version of the \u201cFrontier\u201d game for the CD32 console), is now a very well established game development company with 235 people in the UK and Canada, with its own technology and tools and a great team of game developers.  We have a long track record of delivering high quality games on time and to budget, both published by ourselves and through big publishers like Microsoft, LucasArts, Atari, and Sony.\nElite: Dangerous is the game I have wanted Frontier to make for a very long time. The next game in the Elite series - an amazing space epic with stunning visuals, incredible gameplay and breath-taking scope, but this time you can play with your friends too. I want a game that feels more like the original \u201cElite\u201d to fly, and with more rapid travel (to allow for the multi-player nature of the game) \u2013 so you travel quickly using local \u2018hyperspace\u2019 travel rather than by fast-forwarding time \u2013 but with the rich galaxy of Frontier \u2013 and more, so much more.\nI\u2019ll be frank - we have had a couple of false starts on this over the years, where progress wasn\u2019t as good as I wanted. Also, understandably, other projects have been prioritised \u2013 projects with announced dates or other commitments. Up to now \u201cElite\u201d has been worked upon by a small team as a \u2018skunk-works\u2019 activity in the background as availability permits. Nevertheless, we have been preparing; laying the technology and design foundations for when the time is right. And that time is now.\nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter both as a means of test-marketing the concept to verify there is still interest in such a game that extends beyond the individuals who regularly contact me about the game, and raising the funds to do so. There is also the fact that as long as we hit the threshold, it commits us to making the game. From where we are now, $2M/\u00a31.25M will get us the minimum game, but I am hoping we can get more than that as it will allow us to be more ambitious with content and platforms; something the design decision forum members (the \u00a3300 reward tier and above) will be part of a discussion about.\nWe will rely heavily on artist-directed procedural generation, using techniques that are a logical expansion of what was done in the previous \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d games. This will greatly reduce the required budget \u2013 bringing it to within reach of Kickstarter. It also means it becomes a viable project to avoid the conventional publishing route \u2013 something that I don\u2019t believe can deliver a game like this successfully.\nProcedural generation of content is a technique where content is generated from rules. It abstracts repetitive or arbitrary elements of content creation in a very efficient way. Imagine a medieval landscape. Laying out towns, roads, castles, farm land, forests and so on can be done by a system of rules \u2013 putting castles widely spaced out on vantage points, towns near rivers but under the protection of such a castle, roads between them, then with farm land to support them all. An artist can still design the castle, the houses in the towns, but this approach greatly magnifies the content that can be created. \u201cFrontier\u201d did this for the star systems, and planets, and with Elite: Dangerous, we will go further.\nFor those who are interested in further information on procedural generation, here is a video talking some more about it. It is not everyone's 'cup of tea' as it is quite detailed, but there is some more game footage in the background...\nIn the game, you will of course begin with a spacecraft and a small sum of Credits. You will be able to trade, pirate, bounty-hunt, explore, and salvage your way to wealth and fame, building on those key elements of the previous games, and with sumptuous graphics only now possible with the performance of today\u2019s machines. Only this time some of the ships out there will be other players like yourself \u2013 other members of a secret \u2018Elite\u2019 group of space-farers\u2026\n\u00b7         Multiplayer: you will be able to control who else you might encounter in your game \u2013 perhaps limit it to just your friends? Cooperate on adventures or chase your friends down to get that booty. The game will work in a seamless, lobby-less way, with the ability to rendezvous with friends as you choose. This technology is already working, using a combination of peer-to-peer (to reduce lag) and server connections.\n\u00b7         Play it your way: Your reputation is affected by your personal choices. Play the game your way: dangerous pirate, famous explorer or notorious assassin - the choice is yours to make. Take on missions and affect the world around you, alone or with your friends.\n \u00b7         Trade: Buy low, sell high and discover the most profitable trade-routes. Keep an eye on the markets, supply and demand may create opportunities for quick profit. Unscrupulous players may even try distorting those markets.\n \u00b7         Fight: take on the pirates, or become one yourself. Engage in combat missions within a rich and dynamic simulation to earn a reputation, or perhaps you want to become a famous bounty-hunter \u2013 feared by those that you chase, but staying the right side of the law.\n \u00b7         Travel: Travel across star systems and between them. Risk leaving the relative safety of the Corporate-run space station to explore distant planets or stars. Space is big and you never know what you might find; perhaps a salvageable freighter wreck or some valuable asteroids? There are secrets and startling beauty waiting to be discovered by the intrepid explorer.\n\u00b7         Ships: save your credits and upgrade your ship. Get new weapons, engines and equipment and customize your ship the way you want it. Check out the body-kits and paint jobs on offer, give your ship that personal touch.\nA render of just the mesh of a heavily damaged Anaconda\nThe game is planned to be released on the PC in March 2014. Make no mistake \u2013 this is a massive game, but by using procedural techniques that we have been cultivating over the years, a new approach to multiplayer, and bringing the raw power of today\u2019s machines to bear, it is astonishing what is possible. This is your chance to help make it happen. Become one of \u201cThe Elite\u201d once more.\nDavid Braben\nConcept Art\nPlease note: the Kickstarter system reduces the resolution of these images.

Projects can run out of time or money, people can leave, assumptions that were made at the start may prove to be mistaken, or the results may simply not be as good as expected. Games development is no different.\n\nLooking at all the high quality games we at Frontier have produced, from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 to Kinectimals to LostWinds to Disneyland Adventures, I think the risk of non-delivery is small. We already have a large team who are very experienced at delivering complicated projects, and the key high-risk components (like networking) are already in place. If necessary then we will delay the release beyond March 2014, but I do not believe we will need to do so.\n\nFundamentally this is the game I want to make and have wanted to make for a long time. I want to make this game for myself \u2013 it is the sort of game I want to play. There are many more like me at Frontier that want this for themselves too, and, I hope, out there in Kickstarter-land. Right at the start, Ian and I took that risk when making the first \u201cElite\u201d amidst cries that it needed three lives and a score \u2013 but we took the risk that others wanted what we wanted \u2013 and the result was a great success. If Elite: Dangerous is something you also want, then let\u2019s all take that risk together and help make the fantastic freedom of the \u201cElite\u201d series return to our screens, in current state-of-the-art glory!\n\nDavid Braben\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary #12 Released", "update_content": "Hi all,\nas I'm sure you all relaise, it's a busy time here with the release of Alpha 4 and the upcoming Premium Beta launch!

We want to engage people in fresh new ways with accessible, delightful games and experiences. We\u2019re calling them experiments. Curiosity \u2013 what\u2019s inside the cube was the first of these and we\u2019re taking what we\u2019ve learnt from it and applying it to future projects such as our next step - GODUS. \nPopulous was created over 22 years ago, and we believe that to date, nothing has come close to emulating its powerfully godlike experience. It\u2019s this experience we aim to reimagine. GODUS blends the power, growth and scope of Populous with the detailed construction and multiplayer excitement of Dungeon Keeper and the intuitive interface and technical innovation of Black & White. The original Populous hailed from the 8-bit era but GODUS will use the most modern technology the world has to offer. \nAnd you can help us make it!\nAs a god your destiny is to spread your influence throughout the world. But you are only as powerful as your following. Using your ability to sculpt the land, you can create a habitable environment that will allow a population of believers to flourish. In your crafted utopia you can grow as a god in the face of various challenges that affect the population. You can watch hundreds of individual followers live out their lives with dynamic and captivating behavior. If you choose to spread out and conquer more lands however, you will confront other gods with their own civilizations of followers. There is only room for one god, so prepare to guide your worshippers into battle by altering the world around them with your god powers, then watch your followers reign victorious across the world.\nHalf a living sandbox world, and half a strategy game, players can choose to explore the power of the almighty however they wish. Whether it\u2019s granting the power of life and blossoming the world around your believers, or using godly powers to wreak havoc via natural disasters to defeat the armies of other gods, prepare for the Ultimate God Game: Single Player, Multiplayer, Cross-Platform gameplay, sandbox worlds, strategic battles, living populations, and the power to create, change, and destroy the very structure of the world.\nAn essential part of GODUS is single player. We all love to take the time to hone our godly powers before venturing into the exciting multiplayer wars with other gods.\nIt\u2019s a living world, unique and detailed. And it\u2019s a world you influence, whether you\u2019re good or evil.\nGODUS is instantly accessible, easy to learn but immensely deep.\nAs you flourish and build your own cult, you\u2019ll engage in pitched battles with other gods and their cults. It\u2019s a multiplayer power-struggle the way it should be.\nGODUS draws on the cunning battle-psychology of Dungeon Keeper, the living, changing world of Black & White and the instinctive, satisfying gameplay of Populous.\nPlus you get to be a god. In fact, play well and you get to be the ultimate god!\nGODUS will be developed for the Mac, PC and Mobile devices, we hope to be able to add more platforms as our Kickstarter campaign progresses.\nClick here to back us\nWe are a proudly independent company founded in March 2012, and we\u2019re passionate about creating the next generation of innovative digital entertainment. We believe that a great team with great ideas can lead to great success, and, driven by true innovation and creativity, we\u2019re determined to make some truly unique products.\n22cans has been set up with our own personal savings and the talented team we\u2019ve assembled has already built and released the bizarrely popular Curiosity \u2013 what\u2019s inside the cube. But we need funding to continue, and rather than partner with a publisher, we\u2019re keen to explore the exciting new Kickstarter platform. It means we can stay independent and it gives you the opportunity to have a voice in the development of GODUS.\nOur backgrounds include Bullfrog Productions, Lionhead Studios, Electronic Arts, Microsoft and many others. Most of us have been developing computer games for a long time, and we\u2019ve worked on titles such as Populous, Syndicate, Theme Park, Theme Hospital, Magic Carpet, Dungeon Keeper, Black & White, Fable, The Movies, Risen, Moshi Monsters, Sniper Elite V2, and Curiosity \u2013 what\u2019s inside the cube of course.\nOne member of our team is Tim Rance, who in 1989 as Technical Director for Electronic Arts worked on the two-player multiplayer feature for the original Populous as it was released for DOS (those of you unfamiliar, it's the version before Windows). We also have people from Rockstar London, Mind Candy and several other places we really can't mention. Paul McLaughlin has worked with Peter on every Bullfrog game since Populous.\nWe\u2019re a talented team, highly experienced at playing and creating games and it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re extremely passionate about them. Plus we love the idea of using Kickstarter to fund GODUS. Why? We\u2019ll tell you\u2026\nWith GODUS we want to make a game in a culture of openness, co-operation and honesty. Creating a game involves imagination and passion, and we\u2019re keen to share the experience. So we want to make GODUS with you watching and, we hope, participating. Funding it via Kickstarter allows us to stay a small independent team with unlimited freedom in our creativity. It\u2019ll just be you, us and our unbridled dedication (no publishers).\nYou see, although GODUS is a new idea, we\u2019re keen to return to the spirit which started it all. In 1989, in a small, cramped office in Guildford, England, a hard-working and enthusiastic duo experimented, collaborated, took risks and came up with Populous, a game which would become a legend and which would launch the god game genre. \nWe\u2019re going to make GODUS in that same spirit. And your support will enable you to be involved at every stage as we share everything we do and learn with you. We\u2019ll produce video diaries, blogs, live streams, developer chats and a great deal more. We aim to end up with a truly delightful game and as you play it, you\u2019ll be able to say that you also played your part in its very creation.\nWe\u2019ll fund an experienced team of 22 people to make GODUS. That\u2019s not a big team \u2013 we\u2019re doing this efficiently. But we\u2019re committed to quality, so we\u2019ll create outstanding gameplay, characters, artwork, animations, sound and music, and the very world itself. With your help we\u2019ll turn our great idea into successful reality.\nWe need \u00a3450,000 to do this. Yes, games typically cost more than that to make, but we\u2019re sticking to a small, highly effective team and we\u2019ll be employing careful management to keep the project on track and get the most out of our funding.\nGodus Avatars for our backers\nGODUS will take seven to nine months to complete, but if we exceed the amount of funding we\u2019re asking for, we\u2019ll use the extra to enhance the game further and support additional platforms which will add a little more time to the development schedule. Should we find ourselves in that happy situation, as a thank you, we\u2019ll collaborate with you to implement the ideas and features you love the most.\nWhat do you get for pledging? The full details are just over there, on the right. As you\u2019d expect, the greater your support, the more you\u2019ll get in return. But everyone who pledges will be able not only to watch as the game takes shape and get cool stuff, they\u2019ll also be able to influence its design. During GODUS\u2019s development there will be many instances where specific decisions need to be taken and choices made. As a valued supporter we see you as part of the Project, so you\u2019ll be able to suggest, comment and vote to determine many elements of the game. As you\u2019ll discover, designing games is intriguing.\nDepending where you are are in the world, you might start thinking about Thanksgiving and even Christmas soon. We\u2019ve got you covered...any gamers you know, people who maybe even played the original Populous or Dungeon Keeper, you can now get them a very special gift.\nHere's a visual indication of the exciting items you will receive in return for your generosity:\nWe would love to hear from you. We have a website, can also be found and liked on Facebook and we also send out little updates of 140 characters or less on Twitter.\nOur Peter Molyneux can also be found on Twitter @pmolyneux.\nOf course we\u2019ll continuously update this page until we've finished and released GODUS, we will also listen to what you have to say and refine our Kickstarter page  accordingly.\nThank you so much for helping us make GODUS. If you are unable to back and pledge (but we really hope you can help us make GODUS a reality with however small an amount) then sharing this page with your friends and family would be wonderful too. \nWith your help we will make GODUS a reality and reinvent the entire god game genre.\nDigital Add-Ons:\nDigital Download Gift Pack. Receive an acorn that you can plant in your home-world, and over time a tree will grow.

If you have not pledged yet it will say 'Back this Project'.\nIncrease your pledge in the 'Pledge Amount' by the total of the add-ons you want.\nYou do not need to change the tier you are currently pledging for. If you want to do so, you will then need to add the total of your add-ons onto the amount of the new tier you have choosen.\nWe will send all our backers a survey at the end of our Kickstarter campaign that will ask you which add-ons you want.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenge is to reinvent a genre and make a great game in a short space of time. We\u2019ll only release GODUS once it\u2019s the fantastic game we know it can be. And we want to get it into the hands of players in less than a year from now. GODUS is going to be powerful, unique and rather wonderful, and luckily we\u2019re going to be able to draw on our Kickstarter backers to beta test it with us. Yes, if you back it, you can help us finish GODUS and we\u2019ll have taken another huge step towards the big game which will be the culmination of 22cans\u2019 22 experiments.\n\n22cans has a lot of game industry veterans so we know the risks \u2013 GODUS will be using new technology and that has to be tested and perfected. Balancing and bug-testing the game will also take time. And there are many other factors; for example, Curiosity \u2013 what\u2019s inside the cube showed us what happens when everyone wants to engage with your product online at the same time. We learnt a lot from that in a very short space of time.\n\nFinally, trying Kickstarter is itself a risk. Our backers deserve a great game they\u2019ve funded, seen in through its development and helped create.

I played tons of these games in high school.\nI wondered at the cause of the drop off...\nOld, boring, ugly cards.  That had to be it, or at least a portion\nShortly after that, a friend approached me to make beautiful custom playing card decks.  Duh!  The light bulb brightened, I guess it wasn't burnt out, just unscrewed.  \nThat fell through, but I realized I had all of the skills and experience to make this happen, and to do it right.  And with their permission, here we are...\nSo I started looking for an artist and created a new company...\nA company by a geek, for geeks, and of geekiness.  Dedicated to making beautiful custom decks of playing cards that appeal to our inner geek. Functional decks of cards that delight visually and are of the highest quality.\nMaybe we can help revive these great card games in your life.\nWe are delighted to bring to you our debut deck, \"Deck of Amazing Adventurers\".\nThe Card Backs\nPrinting a custom deck of Bicycle\u00ae brand playing cards with the United States Playing Card Company is an expensive proposition, but it wouldn't be right to put this beautiful deck on anything other than the best in the world.\nThe good news is that as we get more than $10,000, we can provide more to you.  That is what \"Stretch Goals\" are all about.\n@$10,000 - The deck funds, and will be delivered to you promptly upon completion.\n@$15,000 - Custom deck sealing stickers for the decks instead of the USPCC standard sealing sticker.\n@$20,000 - Custom dealer button design created.  Rob will create the design, and we will make it available on this project for you to get your own made if you desire.\n@$30,000 - Poker chip design created.  Rob will create the design, and we will make it available on this project for you to get your own made if you desire.\n@$40,000 - Poker Optimization - Those of you who play poker know that having 2 decks with different color backs is ideal, and with this stretch goal, we'll give you that.  USPCC counts there as separate decks for pricing and minimums, so we cannot afford to do this until funding goes over $40,000.  For clarification, every 2 decks will have alternating color deck backs.\n@$60,000 - Additional custom card back instead of just having a different colored back.  Artist Rob Lundy will make this extra fancy. Rob estimates that creating such a back will take a full day of work.\n@$90,000 - Additional custom card back instead of just having a different colored back.  Artist Rob Lundy will make this extra fancy.  So, every group of 2 decks will have 2 unique and awesome extra fancy backs. Rob estimates that creating such a back will take a full day of work.\nClick here or the image to \"pin it\"\n\nWe want nothing but the best for our decks of cards.  That is why we make fully custom suit symbols along with the beautiful and functional artwork of the court cards.\nIn this tradition, we would also settle for nothing but the best in manufacturing, and that is why we are working with US Playing Card Company which owns and manufactures Bicycle\u00ae brand playing cards.\nThanks to Kickstarter, you can make this happen.\nEverybody loves magic and illusion.  It is definitely something that I wish I continued working on as a child.  As it is, I can amaze my young children (quite young), but my skills are lacking.  \nI look forward to seeing better magicians do some amazing things with the color inverted 10 of Spades and the alternate colored deck back.  FYI, the standard backs will be red and blue.\nThese are not part of the standard 54-card deck, and they are 2 gaff cards specifically made for performing magic tricks.\nThe cards are Bicycle\u00ae brand playing cards printing by the United States Playing Card Company with the magic finish.

Venture Capitalists only want to back mobile or social gaming start ups.\nWe say they're wrong. We say that there is a large audience of PC gamers that want sophisticated games built for their platform. And inside this audience, a significant group of people that have always loved space games, and if given a quality one again will be happy to play it.\nAsk not what your genre can do for you, but what you can do for your favorite genre.\nLet's put high-end PC gaming and Space Sims back on the map!\nStar Citizen brings the visceral action of piloting interstellar craft through combat and exploration to a new generation of gamers at a level of fidelity never before seen. At its core Star Citizen is a destination, not a one-off story. It's a complete universe where any number of adventures can take place, allowing players to decide their own game experience. Pick up jobs as a smuggler, pirate, merchant, bounty hunter, or enlist as a pilot, protecting the borders from outside threats. Chris Roberts has always wanted to create one cohesive universe that encompasses everything that made Wing Commander and Privateer / Freelancer special. A huge sandbox with a complex and deep lore allowing players to explore or play in whatever capacity they wish. That universe is Star Citizen.\nThe Reasons You'll Want to Play Star Citizen\n A huge universe to explore, trade and adventure in\nSpace is unending, endless and so are your opportunities. Strike out to make your fortune amongst the Stars or sign-up for a tour of duty in the UEE Fleet.\nConstantly expanding and evolving universe\nWe\u2019re committed to making Star Citizen a living, breathing universe that is its own entity. It will be a constantly shifting and evolving place for players to explore and affect.\nMicro updates rule!\nWe\u2019re not interested in having yearly updates. Once live, we will have a team of people adding content on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. So we\u2019ll always be adding data, stories and campaigns as well as reacting to the needs and actions of the players.\nSquadron 42 - A Wing Commander style single player mode, playable OFFLINE if you want\nPlayable offline or online, co-op with friends, you sign up for a tour of duty with the UEE fleet, manning the front lines, protecting settlements from Vanduul warbands.\nLife during wartime\nIf you distinguish yourself in combat, you might be invited to join the legendary 42nd Squadron. Much like the French Foreign Legion of old, they can always be found in the toughest areas of operation and always snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, regardless of the odds.\nThe conflict never ends\nUpon completion of your tour you\u2019ll re-enter the persistent Star Citizen universe with some credits in your pocket and Citizenship to help you make your way.  But in the universe of Star Citizen when one conflict ends, another is just around the corner.  You\u2019ll have opportunity to spend more time with your squadron mates as additional Campaigns are released as part of the content update plan.\nActions of the players impact the universe and become part of its history and lore\nThe universe will change based on the players' actions and adventures allowing them to become part of the history of the universe. As an example, players can scan for gravitational anomalies while out in space. If one is discovered and the player manages to successfully navigate this uncharted jump point, they\u2019ll be able to sell their Nav- Computers recording of their jump flight path for a great profit to a space company for other users to download. But the real prize is getting the system or jump-point named after them!\nAllowing user generated content is a key design goal\nOur modding tools will allow players to design new ships for both submission to the persistent RSI ship dealer network or to build custom ships and items for the self-hosted multiplayer mode.\nIt\u2019s about the gameplay and your interactions with others\nWe plan to put a lot of social ideas in the universe. Since the universe is dynamic, it will create some divisions and factions. For example, it\u2019s a perfectly valid choice not to be a Citizen and operate outside the protection of Earth. We think there will be people that gravitate to crime or helping enforce the law or defending the galaxy from the alien raiders or just accumulating as much money as possible. We want to include all these social divisions so players will gravitate to one or the other much like the real world operates. \nFully dynamic economy driven by player actions\nIf too many people fly iron ore to the smelting plants of New Pittsburgh, steel prices will drop. Buy low\u2026 sell high\u2026 you hope.\nThe cost of society\nIn game trade landing and trade tariffs pay for law and order in the civilized systems. Want to make a bigger profit? Try the outer world - outside earth\u2019s infrastructure and protection. The downside? No military or local police to protect you from an opportunistic pirate!\nMoney isn\u2019t everything\nYou could be a trader, a miner or an industrial magnate. Amass great wealth or just run enough missions to earn a comfortable living and upgrades for your ship.\nSpace is empty but you\u2019re never really alone\nIf caught alone in an online ambush, send a distress broadcast to your friends and if they\u2019re nearby they can jump in-system to save your bacon. In each combat instance player slots are reserved for your friends so you can rally forces to join you in combat!\nBigger ships offer bigger multi-player action\nOn larger ships, friends can join you to man turrets, repair systems, or switch with you on the pilot\u2019s chair. Think the Millennium Falcon with Han-Solo piloting and Luke on the turret.\nFull rigid body simulation of all spaceships\nYou wanted proper Newtonian mechanics. You got it! Spaceships adjust their trajectory and orientation just like the real thing.\nIntelligent Flight Control System (IFCS)\nLike a modern day F-35, the ships have fly by wire systems which take the player\u2019s inputs and then translate them into the commands for the ship\u2019s engine and thrusters to articulate and deliver the required thrust to achieve the pilot\u2019s request.\nDynamic Ship Maneuverability\nShip\u2019s performance is calculated dynamically based on various physical variables and the ability of your jet maneuvering to deliver thrust towards a requested vector. What does this mean? Infinite customization with component damage, mass or energy changes affecting maneuverability on the fly \u2013 allowing for endless combat strategies and results.\nShip Components matter!\nBecause we are fully simulating the physics and flight dynamics, the actual components matter. If a port thruster is damaged, it will affect your maneuverability organically.  If you upgrade your thruster package with enhanced thrusters that gimbal faster and deliver more thrust it will affect your performance. Dump cargo, you may be able to get the edge in turning in a dogfight.\n10X the detail of current AAA games\nMost current gen \u201cAAA\u201d games have around 10,000 polygons for a character and 30,000 or so for a vehicle. In Star Citizen, the characters are detailed at 100,000 polygons, the fighter at 300,000 and the Space Carrier 7 million! This allows unparalleled detail, making the visuals more immersive than has ever been achieved before.\nEverything you would imagine would move or articulate on a spaceship or a device \u2013 does!\nEvery spaceship is built from 100s of sub-components, many of them moving and articulating just like they would in the \u201creal\u201d world. If a component gets damaged during combat be prepared to feel the effects on your ship.\nRange of scale never seen before in a game\nFrom a vast 1km long carrier to a 27m fighter, to your 1.8m tall pilot, Everything is rendered and to the same level of detail. Zoom in to the paneling of the carrier and its texel density is the same as the 27m fighter. All without a load screen or loss of visual fidelity.\nReally feel the scale of ships and space battles\nBecause of the ability of the game to scale seamlessly you could be looking out the windows on the bridge of a carrier watching the battle unfold or jump into a cockpit and take the fight to the enemy.\nJoystick, gamepad, mouse, keyboard are all supported.\nWe\u2019ve all got our preferences, so why be forced to choose?\nAdvanced peripheral support\nAs part of commitment to high end gaming we are dedicated to supporting the more exotic enthusiast peripherals; HOTAS, flight chair, rudder pedals. It\u2019s all about the immersion and if you've got the equipment we want to support it!\nVirtual Reality is here!\nWe have backed Oculus Rift and will support it in Star Citizen / Squadron 42. Who doesn't want to sit in their cockpit, hands on your joystick and throttle, swiveling your head, to track that enemy fighter that just blew by?\nNext generation, TODAY\nBuilt on top of Crytek\u2019s award winning CryEngine3 technology, Star Citizen\u2019s engine is built to scale for the PC\u2019s of today and tomorrow.\nA PC gaming enthusiast\u2019s friend!\nAs you upgrade your PC, Star Citizen will take advantage of your extra processor cores, memory or GPUs. This is why you\u2019re a PC gamer \u2013 you love being on the cutting edge, not stuck in the past!\nToday\u2019s game publishers, like their Hollywood counterparts, want predictable returns from sequels to last year\u2019s hits. A game in an out- of-favor genre, set in an original universe is viewed as a bad investment. And the concept of developing a new product exclusively for the PC sends publishing executives and most Venture Capitalists running for the exits.\nAnd that hero is you, the unappreciated PC gamer. The ignored Space Sim fan.\nThis is your chance to have your voice heard. To tell the world that high end PC gaming lives. That you want to sit in the cockpit of your space fighter defending the galaxy or making your fortune as a wily entrepreneur.\nStar Citizen is meant to be everything you ever dreamed you could have in a Space-Sim, all in one glorious ever-evolving package.\nWe know it may not look like this, but we do!\nWhat you've seen was put together by a very small team over the past year. We felt that this vision needed to be shown rather than talked about so we invested our own money to build the technical and visual prototype that shows just how Star Citizen is going to push the limits of PC games.\nInstead of taking this prototype to a publisher for a green light, we are cutting out the middleman and taking it to you.\nYou as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we make this game. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a great game.\nWe have investors that have agreed to contribute the balance we need to complete this game as long as we can validate that there is a demand for a high end PC space game. By meeting or surpassing our target on Kickstarter you tell the world that you want a PC based Space Sim and allow us to make this game.\nBut we're offering more than just the chance to support the platform and genre.\nAs an early backer, you\u2019ll also be getting a lot more than just the finished game.\nFor the people who pledge for their spaceship in the Star Citizen universe, you\u2019ll be part of a select club that has exclusive access to early gameplay and behind the scenes development updates.\nThe people who pledge for their spaceships will get to test-fly them long before the general public. 12 months in, we will allow the early backers to play the multiplayer space combat Alpha, and then 20-22 months in they will get to play the Star Citizen Beta, adventuring around the huge open galaxy, well before the general public. We are going to limit our alpha slots to 200,000 as we want to stress test the game with real users, but will not be ready for the full load until we have finished Beta.\nIn addition, part of the money we are asking for is budgeted to maintain the Roberts Space Industries site with constant updates. Our goal is for the game\u2019s website to be live from day one, constantly giving information about what\u2019s happening in the galaxy even before the game is live, sharing interesting insights into the development process and canvassing the early backers for their opinions.

Also, when we reach 50k funding we are comitted to completing all of our stretch goals all the way up to our Prospector Game mode, Random World Events, and Auction Mini Game 100k goal.\nUPDATE 1: We are now comitted to supporting Android, iOS, and PC regardless of our funding level!\nYou and three other colonists are dropped on a distant planet somewhere in the wild-western outer spiral arm of the galaxy. Here, you will explore, build, and trade in order to become the richest root'n-est toot'n-est land baron in town. However, your success is also contingent on the success of the colony, requiring a unique blend of cooperation and competition to ultimately succeed.  \nYou will explore the alien landscape and lay claim to plots of your choice. The key to your survival is a multi-purpose robot called a Rover.  You'll transform this always lovable but sometimes unreliable robot to suit your needs and harvest planet's four natural resources: energy, ore, gems or food.\nWith luck and strategy, you'll strive to be the most productive colonist.  But it'll also take wit and cunning to hoard and haggle with your neighbors. Each trade affects the price of a resource. Outsmart those other wampus-wranglers by buying low and selling high, to come out on top!\nBest of all, you can try our Wampus Hunt Mini-Game prototype to explore the Alpha Colony world and get a taste for the game RIGHT NOW!\nAlpha Colony has four different game play phases for colonists to enjoy, each with their own fun and interesting decisions.\nExplore -  At the beginning of the game, the map is unexplored and covered by fog. During the explore phase players select a land plot and claim it as their own. This process reveals that land plot as well as the surrounding tiles, removing the fog.\nBuild - During the build phase, players can buy, outfit, and install rovers on their land plots to continue to harvest resources. If they finish this and still have time left in this phase they can scout other land tiles and prospect soil samples to plan for future turns, or they can attempt to catch the wampus for a bonus stash of resource cards.\nProduce - All of the developed land plots produce resource cards for their owners during the Production phase. Before this happens though, random events affect the colony. These events can be anything from a meteor, a pest infestation, or solar flare. Each of these events has its own effect on the players resources and thier installment's resource production.\nTrade - The last phase of a player's turn, the trade phase allows players to compete with eachother in a silent auction for three randomly selected resource cards. Players bid with their current collection of resource cards, and hope to outbid their opponents. Other players' bids are not revealed until all the bids are placed. The player who bids the most cards for a certain resource is the winner. Once the trade phase ends, the turn cycle begins again in the explore phase until twelve turns have been completed.\nKickstarter-Exclusive In-Game First Colonist Badge: All pledge levels include this exclusive in-game item!  Other gamers will view you with envy, as there will be no way to ever complete your collection of in-game badges without backing our Kickstarter campaign. The first Colonist Badge proves your fandom.\nDVD Game Boxes: Hard copies are difficult to produce, which is why the lower tiers only include digital download copies. The Pack-Mule Swag Pack level includes 2, one of which is signed by the whole team which you can leave mint in box while you play the other one. Higher tiers include multiple copies of the game. That\u2019s because these tiers actually let you contribute a game idea into the game and come with designer credits. We figured that\u2019s something you\u2019d like to show off to your friends, so we\u2019ve bundled a few extra boxes for just that purpose.\nDigital Game Download: Pioneer and Explorer tiers both have Mobile, Desktop and Combo options. Mobile includes iOS and Android, while Desktop includes PC and Mac. Combo Editions include all platforms including Ouya, as do all higher tiers. Digital Soundtrack Download: This is an awesome soundtrack composed by Arnold Nesis. DRM free.\nExclusive Bonus Race: This exclusive playable bonus race will be available ONLY to Kickstarter backers. So the only way to play it is to back our campaign. This may be the race that the First Founder pledge level gets to design. If no one pledges at the First Founder level, we will ask the community to choose between ideas we have.\nName in Credits: Everyone above $60 will see their name in lights! er\u2026 the credits.

You\u2019ll really get a chance to see how the game develops, and to voice your opinions as a VIP to help shape the process.\nGame Designer Credit: Several tiers actually allow you to give us your game ideas, and we\u2019ll implement them. All of these tiers include the words \u2018within reason\u2019 in the description. We\u2019re really committed to working with each and every person who pledges at these levels in order to bring your ideas to life. But, for obvious reasons there are a few things we cannot allow: 1) We\u2019d like to keep Alpha Colony family-friendly so we cannot implement \u2018mature content\u2019. 2) We can\u2019t implement anything that violates anyone else\u2019s intellectual property laws, meaning we can\u2019t use licensed characters or names. 3) We can\u2019t implement anything that\u2019s game-breaking. If you\u2019d like to make a negative event called \u201cEveryone instantly loses and the game never starts again,\u201d well that wouldn\u2019t be very fun or fair to the rest of our audience. Other than these 3 simple guidelines, your ability to see your dreams come to life in Alpha Colony are pretty unlimited. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing what you come up with.\nCreate a Positive Game Event: You\u2019ll get to make a random event that will be a boon for all players or just one. Everyone gets an extra Rover? You win 30 gold in a pie eating contest? You discover runes from an ancient civilization which magically slow time and give you 10 extra seconds this turn? You can be the patron saint of Irata by bestowing your custom blessings on all future colonists.\nCreate a Negative Game Event: You get to make a random negative event that will effect one or more players in the game. The lead player loses half their food to space bugs? Solar flares take out power stations for this turn? Meteor destroys one plot of land? Colonists will shake their tiny fists, paws or tentacles at your diabolical genius.\nName a Planet for All to Play: You\u2019ll get to name your own playable planet that will be available for all Alpha Colony players forever. If you\u2019d like, you can have some input as to the design or features of your planet. Naming your own planet also comes with the next prize\u2026 1-of-a-kind Print of your planet: We\u2019ll make a print, custom for you that shows your planet\u2019s map. It\u2019ll include your name, your planet\u2019s name, the date your planet was \u2018discovered\u2019 and the icon of your race of choice. There will only be one of these prints in the galaxy, and it\u2019ll belong to you.\nDesign a Playable New Race: We have lots of ideas you can choose from, or you can come up with your own. You can pick what your race looks like, what it\u2019s called, and it\u2019s special abilities. We\u2019ll work closely with you to ensure that your vision fits well into the game world.\nChristopher Williamson - Lead Designer and Lead Programmer Christopher Wiliamson founded DreamQuest Games in 2000 and has been leading mobile game development since 2004.

As befitting a deck like this it will be printed by the United States Playing Card Company.\nFor those who love flash and style and the kinds of cards that grab attention we have created the never before seen chromatic back just for this deck. This design style is pretty unique and can only be found here on the Apocalyptica cards. Various different hidden images can be found within the backs' art. \nThe chromatic deck design was created by renowned artist Diego Candia specifically for this deck. An artistic mixture of arcane mysteries and scientific technology the deck is styled in a way to please any kind of playing card fan. With a thin but printable border, and overlain images on the backs the Apocalyptica cards are beautiful for any kind of cardistry.  \nNormal and Stretch Edition Deck (Limited edition will ONLY be available at a locked stretch goal amount)\nWith the future uncertain we also created a unique back for a far off Stretch Reward. Our focus however, is to get the normal edition into fans hands.\nUnique Deck Features:\nEach suite in this deck is crafted with secrets on their faces and connections to other cards in the deck via artistic expression blank space and overall pattern design.\nAces are tri-colored with the pip artwork front and center.\nCourt cards are unique and reflect a fantasy and post-apocalyptic world where science meets magic.\nCard backs have hidden images.\nNumbered cards are faced with a light silver underlay from the back's design.\nOur suits are unique in design and layout with custom pips. Mushroom clouds and gears for Clubs, special cut gems for Diamonds, a razer sharp weapon for the Spades, and an ancient sacrificial heart from the Mayans for the Hearts.  \n*All black courts will have blue shading while all red courts will have red shading or hidden cards on their images.\nAces by Diego Candia\nJacks by Diego Candia\nQueens by Diego Candia\nKings Shown At Bottom of KickStarter\nRandoms\nFor the numbered cards, the entire face of the card is custom and has a unique but fitting variation in pip layout for each suite. Not enough to ever detract from game play, the layout of the faces attract attention and were artistically chosen to meld seamlessly within the overall design. \nAmazing Tuck-Box by Spectre-7\nThe result of all the tremendous hard work is a beautiful, unique, and mysterious deck.  \nCard Specifics:\nPrinted by the U.S.P.C. with original art \nBeautifully designed chromatic card backs with a multi-layer design with hidden mysteries\nCustom Gaffs\nCustom jokers  \nCustom pips\nCustom court cards\nCustom designed tuck box (the first 200 sent out will be signed)\nSome Reward Item Specifics:\n*These are just some additional information about rewards like size for shirts and posters and the type of limited card boxes we have*\nAfterEarth: Apocalyptica t-shirt with your choice of art with or without card borders and up to 6XL.\nArt Prints 10.5 x 7.5 print of any card with or without symbols\nArt Posters 21 x 26.5 of any card with or without symbols\nCard Boxes for 2, 4, and 6 deck orders.

Here they are the tricksters and the grifters, those looking to slice your pocket open and take away whatever useless coin you have. Led by the Queen of Thieves the Diamonds are more cutting and cruel. Oh the King of Diamonds thinks he rules all. But we know better.\nHearts...ah love. It isn't in the air. Dangerous and depressive the hearts are just a little insane with battle lust and a lot of deep seeded anger issues. Led by the King of Hearts, a rampaging beast of a man, the King of Hearts wants yours.\nSpades are tricky to define. Always suspicious, always a trick up their sleeve, you never really know where you stand with the Spades. The King of Spades is the worst of the lot. A con-man with a hidden secret.\nWhere does the money go?\nStraight into the KickStarter rewards, printing the cards and covering shipping as well. All stretch rewards are also possible due to pledge donations. We want to get the design teams amazing work out to people but we can not do it alone. Not even close.

The design has been color swapped, and modified to fit other themes, but overall the design has stayed the same. With keeping in the tradition of what makes the design great, we have worked with the USPCC to push what makes the rider back great and bring you a new design inspired by the original. A design which keeps the integrity of what we are familiar with, yet something new to add to its LEGACY. BICYCLE LEGACY is a TRUE set of unique poker cards. This means both decks have identical faces with 2 back color variations. Hand drawn courts, aces, and joker cards add to the decks appeal while a simplistic layout keeps the deck familiar.

So we had to make a big, BIG change!\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 20th at 12:00 NOON is our cut-off time for placing orders for the limited-edition print run. ALL DECKS BACKED AFTER THAT TIME will not receive the limited edition deck...\n...because instead, they'll get our NEW EDITION deck with a cool, new color on the back and tuck box! Instead of the original in rather handsome red, the new deck (displayed below) replaces the red areas with a quite gorgeous black, giving it a different look while still retaining that \"Bohemia\" style all our backers love and will still share all the same art work on the face cards and pips. READ MORE about the change and what it means for pre-existing backers in Updates #7 & #8.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollowing on the heels of our sold-out Uusi Blue Blood deck comes Bohemia - an entirely hand-painted and hand-lettered playing card deck. Bohemia is the second limited-edition Uusi deck in a planned six-deck series. Play with them, collect them, but most of all, we hope you will enjoy them for years to come.\nAnd now, onward to Bohemia!\nTHE INSPIRATION\nThe artwork for Bohemia was inspired by the unlikely pairing of 17th-century Baroque style with contemporary, urban street art. Each have a flair for drama, tension and grandeur that when mixed together create one lush, combustible style! This deck is perfect for your neighborhood or family poker game, a few heated rounds of gin rummy, spades or hearts with friends or simply to add a little drama to your favorite game of solitaire. In the skilled hands of a magician or flourisher, our deck's colorful card backs and custom face designs become a dazzling display of hypnotic, moving color and beauty. For the collector, it is a true original with an attractive, unique tuck box and made in limited quantities.\nTHE DECK\nFifty-two playing cards and two jokers, all with unique art that's executed in the traditional \"Anglo-Rouen\" design pattern, ideal for magic and card games due to being unique and eye-catching, yet at the same time very familiar and immediately recognizable by players and spectators alike.\nCompletely hand-painted with gouache paint for the illustrations on every single card, right down to the pips and indices.\nOne blank-faced card with the same background pattern that's repeated on all the faces, suitable for use as a cut card, a magician's gaff or a replacement for a damaged card.\nOne illustrated Uusi Design ad card.\nPrinted by the United States Playing Card Company (USPC) in a run of 3500 decks.\nMade on Bicycle playing card stock with an Air Cushion Finish for a glide that's easy and smooth without being too slick and slippery.\n*All images of the deck and tuck boxes you see in these photos are prototypes made at Uusi's studio. The finished product may vary slightly from what you see here - backers will be kept up-to-date of any minor changes that may occur. The overall design and theme will remain UNCHANGED throughout the funding and printing process.\nThe Bohemia Court: With our second deck we wanted to incorporate all the traditional elements of the court cards most used in games such as poker: two one-eyed Jacks (Spades and Hearts), the \"Suicide King\" (Hearts, with sword \"through\" head), the \"Man with the Axe\" (King of Diamonds) and the \"Bedpost Queen\" (Spades). For added drama, we gave each of the Jacks an elegant horse unique to their suits. Last, but certainly not least, we used archetypal and unique Jokers in an uncommon position, coyly posed facing away from the player. \nThe Bohemia Pips: Each pip on every card has big, juicy, hand-painted suit symbols that vary in shades of brilliantly luminous blue for the dark suits of spades and clubs and lushly romantic red for the light suits of hearts and diamonds.\nBohemia Tuck Box: Handsomely decorated to match well with the card back design and labeled in calligraphy lettering typical of the Bohemian region of Central Europe (formerly the Kingdom of Bohemia).\nThe Bohemia Uncut Press Sheet: When seen combined, the cards of Bohemia create a beautiful work of art, suitable for framing and a gorgeous accent piece and conversation starter in whatever room or office you decide to place it - preferably one where you receive guests!\nUncut showing face cards above, back of cards below.\nFUNDING\nBecause we have chosen to print in small quantities, we need the card collecting community's support in putting out these limited-edition decks. With every deck we also create unique items exclusive to that deck's project on Kickstarter. Our goal is to add value and enjoyment to your passion and we hope you find it worth your investment.\nA LOOK AT SOME OF THE REWARDS \nDisplay Stand: Playing card deck display stands made from reclaimed, old-growth redwood that was milled from early 20th-century water towers in Chicago.

Our eight month old stares intently at pictures of baby faces on the iPhone and my son and daughter knew how to slide to unlock before they could crawl.

We plan to get Tiggly Shapes into the hands of the toddlers in your life this winter!\nTiggly Shapes includes...\nTiggly Shapes package for our Kickstarter supporters\nSafety info: Needless to say, as a father with kids that will use this toy, we're taking every precaution. The shapes will have NO hard corners, small parts, electronics, or batteries. They will be made of a soft, flexible and non-hazardous plastic. You can feel at ease if your child is chewing or throwing these shapes! Finally, before we ship, we\u2019ll pay for the best toy testing we can find to ensure we meet all industry safety standards. See our FAQ for more safety details.\nYour iPad will also be safe. Tiggly's soft outer cover and silicone touch points won't scratch or harm your iPad.\nTiggly\u2019s beginnings\nMy two-year old son, Kirkland, has always been interested in my iPad since we got one last year. In fact, he\u2019s really good at using it.  Looking back on it, however, my wife and I probably let Kirkland spend too much time using the iPad. How can you strike a happy medium between real play and the digital world? \nEarlier this year, the answer to our question hit me: why couldn\u2019t we take something that is age appropriate and that Kirkland does use very well\u2014traditional toys\u2014and add technology so that these toys could be used on an iPad? Imagine the possibilities if we could take one of Kirkland\u2019s favorite toys, a wooden shape puzzle, and make it more interactive and engaging by using an iPad!  We could keep the best of the digital world and blend it with the physical world.\nOkay, so how does the technology work? \nCAD rendering of final triangle\nWithout getting too nerdy, we\u2019ve created shapes with special sensors that replicate human touch. Each shape has a unique set of touch points that allows our customized iPad games to tell which shape it is. We\u2019ve been able to create these touch points without using any batteries or electric currents so it\u2019s totally safe for your child and you won\u2019t have another toy that needs recharging every week.\nMore about our 3 apps\nWe have 3 apps under development that encourage both creative and critical thinking and are specially designed for our shapes and for toddlers!\nTiggly Safari is a fun, immersive app where toddlers are guided to place shapes on the screen to form animals that come to life  Target age: 2 to 3 years\nGo on a shape Safari!\nTiggly Draw allows toddlers to use the Tiggly Shapes as stamps and as paint brushes. Target age: 18 months and up\nTiggly Match is a game that teaches kids how to identify shapes.  Target age: 18 months to 2 years\nYou can learn more about each of these apps in the FAQ section.\nIn developing these apps, you can rest assured that we are consulting with creative and educational advisors with decades of experience working with toddlers to build the best possible apps.   Additionally, we're testing our beta apps weekly to ensure that we're creating quality learning and fun. In the coming months we hope to release even more great educational apps that work with Tiggly Shapes.\nHow did we get here? \nThe many prototypes leading up to our final star\nIn April we built a rough prototype that we tested with dozens of kids. With even a basic app, kids were still very engaged\u2014and parent feedback was incredibly positive.  Phyl and I also spoke with over 50 folks in the toy, retail, app, and early child education industries. \nOver the summer, we worked with an industrial design firm to create and test a variety of design concepts with toddlers and parents. We went through 6 different iterations including mock-ups and 3D prints. Our final design met all our key criteria: safe for the toddler, safe for the screen, inviting to play with and easy to hold and use.\nT-Shirt designs for our backers\nWhat\u2019s next? \nWe wanted to start with a simple product for the youngest iPad users, hence Tiggly Shapes!

Check the website for even more info.  \nHow does BodyFloat\u2122 work?\nSimply put...our patent pending dual spring system levitates you over your bike, isolating you from the terrain below while allowing for better pedal efficiency, more comfort and increased riding confidence.  BodyFloat\u2122 does this in two distinct ways:  \nFirstly, our design allows for comfort! It effectively isolates you from the terrain below and greatly reduces the amplitude of surface vibrations and small bumps thus making your ride more comfortable in every way. You can ride without negative effects and feel relatively fresh after your ride.  Quicker recovery from any ride is a good thing, right?   And no sore butt!!!   \nSecondly, our design enables you to maintain a smooth, comfortable and efficient pedal stroke without bounce, flex or wasted energy. Our non-damped spring design (meaning no elastomers, oils, air or other substance) allows for the natural vertical compliance necessary to encourage an efficient pedal stroke. It does this intuitively with your body weight and natural movement that creates circular and efficient pedaling.\nWhy no damping? \nGood question...and this is the genius of BodyFloat\u2122. Damping slows frequency response by definition.  No damping allows for the best possible isolation of the power plant (ie: you...the motor) and allows for the best transmission of energy into forward motion.  So you can be more comfortable, conserve more energy and put that energy into getting you from A to B quicker and more comfortably. \nThere are two small dampers in the BodyFloat\u2122.  A small top-out elastomer located in the pre-load bolt and a progressive bottom-out elastomer housed in the lower spring guide.  These two small elastomers work to soften the endpoints of your specific travel range. \nWhat's difference between the 2.0 and the 3.0: \nIsolation is what the BodyFloat is  all about and both models do a fine job at it.    The 3.0 does a bit better by utilizing 8 silky cartridge bearings, a beautiful carbon seat post and sculpted side links that are manufactured with a higher grade material.  The 2.0 uses a highly efficient bushing system, an alloy seat post and sports solid side links capable of providing you ample space for personal engraving options.   The 3.0 will be a bit lighter than the 2.0 as well, not sure exactly how much yet, but in the range of 30-50 grams.  \ntrade show image\nHow much travel does it have?  \nUp to 1.5\" (38mm) of true vertical travel, pre-loadable down to less than 1/4\" (6.4mm) if desired. Somewhere in the middle is your ideal 'sweet spot' that works best for you and your needs. Just like fine tuning a car or motorbike suspension; performance and comfort can only be maximized once the suspension is tuned. \nFuture models will have over 3\" of available travel for mountain specific applications.   \nWhat is the \"Sweet Spot\"?  \nAKA \"heaven\". The 'sweet spot' is the ideal combination of spring rate and pre-load that allows the rider to be most effectively isolated from the terrain below without negative movement or action.  Your 'sweet spot' is easy to find and easy to change based on your weight, riding style, bike and selected terrain.  BodyFloat isn't about suspending you over everything like a full suspension bike or other suspension systems... its about effectively isolating you from the terrain allowing you to increase your efficiency.   \nWhat is \"pre-load\"?  \nPre-load refers to the force applied to spring component before external loads, such as rider weight, are applied. For instance: on a comfort based bike you may want less pre-load that offers a more plush feel using more travel. For performance, pre-load the BodyFloat to maximize efficiency, minimize travel and find  your optimum range.  Adjusting pre-load can be done on the fly with the simple turn of the pre-load hex bolt located on the rear of the unit.    \nCan I adjust or change the springs? \nYes!  Adjustment of the spring is easy.  BodyFloat\u2122 comes pre-configured based on your weight and riding characteristics.  As mentioned above, you adjust the spring with the pre-load screw.  This reduces the effective travel of the unit.  If you find that you often bottom-out or it's too stiff, you can change the spring out with a spring of a higher or lower spring rate.  This is done by removing the lower spring/spring guide and replacing the spring with one that better suits you.    \nHow and why to get additional springs?  \nSwapping different springs allows you to customize your BodyFloat to exactly your needs. There are so many options here!!  You may prefer stiffer springs for a more upright position, carrying a messenger bag/pack or for less isolation.  Use a lighter spring for more plushness and/or with more pre-load, or for high performance applications like racing or stationary bikes. Different springs with different spring rates are available for sale directly through our website and at retailers.\nWhat is its size and weight?  \nThe 3.0 production model will weigh about 430g +/-.   It's about the size of your Ipod.   The 2.0 weighs about 470g.  \nWill BodyFloat\u2122 fit my bike? \nBodyFloat\u2122 is designed to work on just about any bike. Available in 27.2mm & 31.6mm seat post diameters, with shims for other sizes. Other diameters will be available soon. It will fit any standard twin rail bike saddle.  \nHow much clearance is needed between my bike frame and the saddle?  \nIt can be preloaded so that only 80mm is required from the top of the seat tube to the saddle rails.  \nWhere will it be made?   \nIn North America...of course!!  We are currently producing a limited number of prototypes in our Bellingham, WA facility for beta testing. Production will be done through local suppliers and assembled in-house. Our objective is to keep all manufacturing in North America. \nWhen will my BodyFloat\u2122 be available? \nWe plan on having 3.0 model BodyFloat\u2122 in production by December, 2012 and the 2.0 model by February 2013.\nWhat was the origin of the BodyFloat\u2122?  \nThe BodyFloat\u2122 came about as a blend of two passions: cycling and the desire to help others.   \nTwo years ago, BodyFloat inventor Paul Barkley was assisting rural village development groups in Kenya and Uganda. Needing to cycle between remote villages, he was looking for a spring seatpost to ease the ride.\nNone of the available spring seat posts provided the features he was seeking, so he was inspired to build one himself. He continued refining the design, building several more versions, improving the spring rate, travel, durability and weight.   \nWhat emerged in the spring of 2011 was the patent pending dual spring version that allowed the BodyFloat\u2122 to be lighter, more compact and suitable for even performance road bikes. \nAt the end of summer 2011, Barkley and Charlie Heggem formed Cirrus Cycles to bring the BodyFloat\u2122 to market and allowing them to pursue their passions of cycling and sustainable grassroots development.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter update October 2, 2014", "update_content": "Dear Kickstarter Supporters,\nAs most of you know from our previous updates, we are finally in full production mode with BodyFloat seat posts now being assembled and shipped daily.

This gave me the idea that if we could light up the wheels, the bike would be instantly recognizable. For the original design, I took a couple sets of computer case black lights, mounted them to the front and rear forks, and rewired them to run off of a 12 volt scooter battery. The black lights activated a glow-in-the-dark paint that I had sprayed on the rims of my wheels.\nExcept for being a bit bulky, the original design worked great. I was so impressed with how cool it looked, I uploaded a video to youtube. It didn't take long for the video to become more and more popular and I started getting tons of requests and messages from viewers that wanted a Nori lighting system for their bike. (To see the full original youtube video click here)\nI was thrilled, but there were some improvements that had to be made in order to make this something that could be packaged for the public. I saw that I had 5 key goals that had to be reached.\n1 I needed to make this easy to apply to any bike. \n2 The design needed to be physically smaller and lighter. \n3 It had to be much more energy efficient (longer run times on less power). \n4 No compromise of brightness or effectiveness of the lighting system. \n5 Final product needs to be affordable so it will be accessible to everyone. \nAfter extensive product testing, and several design revisions later, I am very pleased with the results.\n1 Easy to apply to any bike - Instead of using paint, the glowing surface is now a high phosphorescent material that is available in two forms. For bicycles that don\u2019t use a rim braking system, we offer a flexible band with an adhesive backing that can be applied to each side of the bikes rims. And for bicycles that use a rim braking system (where pads make contact with the sides of the rims to slow or stop), we offer the \u201cNori Lights system featuring the C-rings\". The C-rings act as extensions of the rim, providing more surface area for illumination. They are made up of 4 semi-circle segments wrapped and sealed with our high-phosphorescent material. To install, simply place each segment between the spokes so that they rest snug towards the rim to form the inner contour of the bicycle wheel (see our projects \u201cupdates\u201d for photos of the C-rings, how they fit on various wheel sizes and types, and a brief video demonstrating installation). They connect by overlapping where a small but strong magnet is embedded into the tip and holds snug against the side of neighboring C-ring segments, allowing them to cascade in or out adjusting to your specific wheel size. They glow bright, are light weight, very durable, and make installation fast and easy.\n2 Smaller and lighter - The bulky black light tubes have been replaced with 4 pods. Each pod contains two high intensity UV LEDs, and each pod mounts easily onto the frame next to the rim. \n3 Energy efficient -  Because of the energy efficiency of LEDs, now the whole system is powered by just 2 AA lithium batteries that will provide over 150 hours of run-time. \n4 No compromise of brightness - The results of maintaining a high standard while testing materials for the new design has actually made this version brighter than the original system. \n5 Accessible to everyone -The final goal remains, but in order to reach it, I need your support. The overall costs of each unit drops considerably when manufactured in bulk. Even a small quantity of pre-orders (100) will enable this system to be offered at a very reasonable price. \nIf you are interested in the Nori Lights - bike illumination system, please consider making a pledge. And if you have friends that ride and could benefit from this, please share this project page with them. \nI have named this project Nori, after my Grandfather. He always told me \u201cIf something\u2019s worth doing, it\u2019s worth doing right\u201d. I believe this is worth doing, and with your support, we can get this done right. Thank you for your time and interest.\n\nAs you can see, in the video and photos, the Nori Lights look really cool. But, even with how effective the system appears in the video, that is nothing compared to how electric and vibrant they are when you see them in person. I wish I could be there to see the look on each of our backers faces when they fire up their Nori Lights for the first time. If you are able to, please take a quick video of your reaction, or if it's a gift, capture it on video and upload it on youtube! I can't imagine ever getting tired of the initial reaction it causes.\n\nNOTE: NORI LIGHTS ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROPER FRONT AND REAR LIGHTING ON YOUR BIKE. THIS SHOULD BE USED IN ADDITION TO A FRONT HEADLIGHT AND REAR FACING LIGHT. PLEASE ALWAYS BE CAREFUL WHILE RIDING A BICYCLE AT NIGHT AND NEVER ASSUME THE DRIVERS ON THE ROAD CAN SEE YOU. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI already have an electronics and plastic manufacturer lined up and ready to process the orders. One challenge I am prepared for is having the production of the power supply housing and the LED housing (pods) created to scale and to the specifications for the Nori Lights system. In submitting a minimum order of 400 pod units (100 full sets) and knowing that people may be needing this to be delivered well before the holidays, I want to make sure the parts are built right the first time. Fortunately, I have a degree in 3D modeling and animation, and owned a business constructing digital 3D models and renderings of high-end residential and commercial land development projects to scale from precise architectural plans. This has already helped me with providing the manufacturers with exact design specifications in the native 3D file format that they would otherwise have to create from a rough product description. \n\nI also understand there are always challenges that one may not foresee. I am confident in my abilities, determination and passion, that whatever challenges I may face, I will get this project completed on time and as promised.

With up to 20% of homes power consumption coming from lighting, it makes sense to switch to LED technology and even more sense to switch to LIFX LED smartbulbs. But this is just part of the story, LIFX is about the experience.\nWhat can I do with LIFX smartbulbs in my house?\nControl your lights from anywhere\nChoose any brightness for a specific bulb, a room or your whole house\nCreate the colors to match any mood or decor\nGet notifications such as Twitter, Facebook, Texts and more\nReduce your energy consumption and save money\nVisualise your music with animated colors\nMake an impression at your next dinner party \nGet creative with colors and effects \nCreate a night light for your kids\nSecurity mode when you're on holidays \nCreate groups of lights \nRobot dance like it's 1999\nThere's many more things you can do with LiFX smartbulbs in fact we're creating a software developer kit (SDK) and a hacker kit so hackers and developers alike will be able to release more and more apps to do things we haven't even thought of yet.\nThe LIFX App\nThe free LIFX App will be available on the App Store and Google Play and we also have plans for a Windows, Mac and Linux app. If we achieve our goal we'll fast track the development of these apps across each platform.\nThe LIFX app is one of our favorite aspects of the entire project, and we've spent countless hours thinking about how you can interact with your lights. We have mapped out a very smooth configuration UX from the app to the LIFX master bulb. In essence you place your LIFX smartbulb into a light socket, turn the switch on and then launch the app. You will be guided through a process of choosing your home network from a list and then entering your password. The LIFX master bulb will then auto configure itself to your router and all the slave bulbs will auto connect to the master. If you add more slave bulbs down the track  these will also auto connect. Each smartbulb can be controlled individually. eg. they don't just mirror the master bulb.\nRegarding security: LIFX will be as secure as your WiFi network. eg. without the WiFi network password you can't control the smartbulbs.\nWe're aware that while the hardware is the most visible and interesting part of this project our software is the soul.\nWhat do I get?\nLIFX comes as either a single bulb or can be purchased in packs. Each LIFX bulb is ready to install straight away. Simply choose the type of bulb you need (Edison Screw, Bayonet Cap or Downlight) and you're ready. If you ever need to purchase additional bulbs, these all form part of your mesh network, meaning every LIFX you buy can be controlled via the same app without reconfiguring.\nWhat types of smartbulbs are available?\nBayonet cap [B22]\nEdison Screw [E27]\nDownlight [GU10]\nSome backers have recently asked for specific fixture model numbers.\nAfter the project has finished we will be sending out surveys to all KS backers asking which type of the above LIFX smartbulb casing you want. You will be able to mix and match bulbs styles in any combination. We are preparing more details on the above casings and other options that will be available in the next few weeks including dimensions and more. The more pledges we receive the more options will be available. Please direct message us if you have a preference for casing style/type that is not on the above list.\nThe Tech\nLIFX uses a master/slave concept to connect to your home router via 802.11n and then onto all the other LIFX smartbulbs via 802.15.4 mesh network. Each LIFX can connect to all country electricity systems from 110V to 260V. This includes USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Australia and 95% of other countries around the world. \nYour light switch needs to remain on for the smartbulb to be accessible with the LIFX app. However you can use any light switch to turn your smartbulbs on and off like you do with traditional bulbs.\nLIFX uses a mesh network. The standby power usage of each bulb is very small, in fact a AA battery would keep a LIFX smartbulb in standby mode for approximately 1-2 years. [note: The master bulb requires a WiFi connection which uses approximately 2-3 watts. Only 1x master bulb is required in each home/office.]\nThe LIFX prototype uses an RGB phosphorous COB LED lamp which is approx. the equivalent of a 60 watt incandescent bulb or 50 watt halogen downlight. We are looking into all the options on the best type/brand of LED lamp to use in the production model. Getting this right is something we are very passionate about. (real world comparison - actual lumens of LIFX rated at higher levels than 60w incandescent bulbs)\nWe couldn\u2019t have done this without our distributed systems hacker Andy Gelme who is the lead engineer on LIFX. He\u2019s been at the forefront of automation technology for many years creating systems that run on top of open industry standards.\nWe will be releasing a LIFX Software Development Kit (SDK) that will allow mobile App developers and home automation hackers full control over their LIFX smartbulbs. This includes using a small scripting engine that runs within the LIFX smartbulb. Stay tuned for more details. We can't wait to see what amazing hacks you come up with.\nWe have set up a LIFX Tech blog where you can interact directly with our lead software engineer Andy. Just pop on over to that page if you have some curly questions.\nhttp://tech.lifx.co\nComments\nWe are receiving lots of awesome comments. Keep them coming. One of our favs below.\n\"Out of all Kickstarter projects I have pledged for the LIFX is the first one which, when I showed my wife the intro movie, she immediately said \"Oh, I HOPE you're backing THIS!\" - so, LIFX is as of now officially WifeApproved (tm) in our home, which kind of makes me want to up my pledge to about three dozen lamps.\" - KS LIFX Backer - Nick Sakellariou\nEdits\n- On the back of questions and information we are receiving from the Kickstarter community regarding wattage and lumen output of bulbs in general we have adjusted the video to more accurately reflect this new information. One of the things we love about the Kickstarter process and community is it allows people like us to crowd source funding but more importantly ideas and smarts. We are committed to creating the worlds best smartbulb and will adjust our thinking and approach to achieve this. Given the overwhelming response to our project we are also now planning to hire the best darned LED experts we can find!! Thanks again for your support - we're glad we can share this journey with you.\n- Removed IPV6 from the main info page. Our aim is to use IPV6 but we prefer not to guarantee this until our development matures over the next few months.\nThe Internet of Things\nWe love the internet of things, home automation and the overall concept of the smart home but we also understand for most people it is a large chasm to jump. This understanding has been one of the guiding forces in the design of the LIFX smartbulb - to start with one commonly used household item and make it smart, easy to use and accessible to everyone.\nManufacturing \nLIFX Smartbulbs have been designed and prototyped in Melbourne, Australia and San Francisco, USA and we plan to manufacture via a trusted partner with operations in based in Melbourne and Shenzhen. We realise that whilst we're reinventing the lightbulb this doesn't mean we have to reinvent the manufacturing process. We are using as many standard LED lighting components as possible. These components have undergone rigid testing and stood the test of time. We are also very excited to create our own LIFX customised computer board \"the brains\" of this project. Also fully featured FREE apps will be available on the App Store\u00ae and Google Play\u00ae designed by Bonobo Labs.\nOur Vision\n\"LIFX answers a need that is well and truly overdue. Everyone in the world needs light bulbs. Existing light bulbs are based on an archaic technology that threatens our environment. Light bulbs consume approximately 20% of electricity in homes around the world. They need to be more efficient, smarter and last longer. In the twenty-first century, people need lighting that matches the \"smart culture\" and eco aware sensibilities of our day.\"\nPhil Bosua - Inventor of the LIFX smartbulb", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "mini update - correct shipping addresses", "update_content": "It's been a pretty exciting couple of weeks at the LIFX office.

As a result, a great deal of the art Shane produces tends to take on a darker tone, and I have to ask him to lighten it up a bit.\nBut not this time!  I fear I've quite literally unleashed a monster, as Shane has been given carte blanche.  Creative freedom has shown us here at Albino Dragon just how deep the rabbit hole goes into the darker corners of Shane's twisted imagination.\nThe result is one of the most beautiful, amazing, and horrifying adaptations of the Cthulhu mythos that we've ever seen.\nThe Cthulhu playing card deck is printed by the famous United States Playing Card Company, featuring 56 poker-sized cards with custom faces that bring the Cthulhu mythos to life.

Thank you!\nQuotes from people eating Kerfluffles for the first time:\n\"These are the best marshmallows I've ever tasted! Where can I get more?\"\n\"I have never liked marshmallows. Then I had one of yours, and suddenly I am a huge marshmallow fan!\"\n\"One word: YUM!\"\n\"I can't stop eating them. Why can't I stop eating them?\"\n\"I'm not sharing. Just so you know.\"\nThey really are that good.\nAfter making my first batch of marshmallows from scratch, I had an epiphany. Those dry, rubbery, powdery things in the bag at the grocery store are distant, misguided cousins of real marshmallows. Handmade marshmallows are tender, fluffy, flavorful, and just a wee bit addictive. The more homemade marshmallows I made and the more I shared them, the more people I found that agreed with me. And the idea for Kerfluffles Marshmallows was born. \nAfter fifteen years of cooking, baking, and candy-making, I have discovered a passion for making marshmallows, and I am ready to start selling Kerfluffles Marshmallows locally and on-line. I have developed and tested recipes, researched ingredients and food safety guidelines, and prepared a 100 dozen little bites o' yum in preparation for selling them. I also test-shipped dozens across the country and used the recipients' reviews to ensure the packaging and product live up to the highest standards.\nI love what I am doing, and I can't wait to share these scrumptious little goodies with everyone! I need funds for professional-grade kitchen equipment; ingredients to stock the Kerfluffles pantry for the first bulk run of mallow-making; packaging and shipping supplies; and fees for a retail presence on the web.\nCan a marshmallow be responsible? \nKerfluffles will surely try. I have worked to perfect my marshmallow recipes, to create a consistently tasty treat with just the right balance between chewy and fluffy, a confection that is sweet without being cloying. I am sentimental about food: I believe that the joy I take in making these little guys matters, and I believe customers will recognize that and keep coming back for more.\nI am completely committed to using only 100% all-natural ingredients and choosing organic whenever possible. My pledge to you: Kerfluffles marshmallows will never contain artificial flavors or preservatives of any kind. No weird chemical stabilizers or low-quality ingredients bought for value instead of taste. No shortcut, industrial-strength flavor extracts either: if a marshmallow is supposed to taste like lemons, it will have fresh lemon juice and zest in it. Vanilla flavor will come from actual vanilla beans; coffee flavor from quality, fresh-brewed espresso. \nI have done painstaking research to ensure that I can sell a delicious, profitable product without compromising the integrity of either the candy itself or the people making and eating it. I have sourced ingredients and equipment down to the teaspoon so that I can produce delicious marshmallows that outshine the competition in both flavor and price, while still preserving the fun of creating and eating them.\nCan a marshmallow be exciting?\nThey are to me! :) I would like to start Kerfluffles with five main flavors: Vanilla Bean, Double Dutch Chocolate, Mocha Chip, Orange Dreamsicle, and Lemon Meringue. There will also be at least two Flavors of the Month that vary according to the season. I have already brainstormed and tested all sorts of marshmallows, from fruity White Peach to spiced Vanilla Chai, as well as seasonal flavors like Pumpkin Spice and Gingersnap. \nThere are Key Lime Pie marshmallows dipped in graham cracker crumbs, and PBJ Ripple marshmallows made with all-natural peanut butter and Concord grape juice. What better way to end Thanksgiving dinner than Maple Pecan marshmallows? With winter and the holiday season come flavors like Peppermint Crunch and Chocolate Clementine, plus fantastic gift ideas, including holiday samplers, hot cocoa kits, and a Marshmallow-of-the-Month club. And don't forget to check the rewards sidebar for information about how to help select a Flavor of the Month, or even have a custom marshmallow flavor made in your honor!\nIf you're going to do something...\nDo it right. Do it with passion, integrity, and commitment. And also lots of sugar. (Did I mention the sugar?) That's my goal with Kerfluffles Marshmallows, and I would very much appreciate your support.\nAnnouncing Mayan Hot Chocolate Kerfluffles: \nA Kickstarter Exclusive\nAfter a blistering launch to our Kickstarter, what better way to show our appreciation than to introduce a little more heat? Mayan Hot Chocolate Kerfluffles are rich chocolate marshmallows balanced by the warmth of cinnamon and chile. Inspired by the chocolate drink invented by the ancient Mayans, these Kerfluffles feature the highest quality dark cocoa, freshly ground cinnamon, and fruity Aleppo chiles. The mix of deep chocolate flavor and sweet fluff make these a delight, even for those who don't normally count themselves chile-lovers.\nMayan Hot Chocolate Kerfluffles are only available to Kickstarter backers, and will not be sold after October 4th. They are available as a flavor choice to all Reward levels $15 and above, and will be included in the Sampler. Mayan Hot Chocolate will also remain a flavor option through December for backers who select the $75 or $200 levels, or who purchase a Holiday Mallows Add-on. (Whether you choose to taunt your friends with them or share is entirely your call. ;)\nAdd-ons \nPlease note, shipping anywhere in North America is included with Add-ons. International backers should add $10 for shipping. If you would like more than one Add-on shipped internationally, please contact me for an exact shipping quote. Thanks!\nHoliday Mallows -- $25\nGive yourself something to look forward to in December with the Kerfluffles Holiday Mallows Add-on. Raise your pledged amount by $25, and we will send you three dozen marshmallows in December. You can choose from the five Classics, as well as the December Flavors of the Month. Want to get your holiday shopping out of the way early? We are happy to ship a Holiday Mallow Add-on to any address in North America, not just yours! \nMallow-of-the-Month Club -- $75\nFor $75 added to your pledge, join the Mallow-of-the-Month Club, and add three months of marshmallows to any giving level. You or your gift recipient get two dozen Kerfluffles per month for three months, selected from any of the Classics, Kickstarter Exclusive flavor, or Flavors of the Month. Add as many as you like for any address in North America, and never worry about going without yummy fluff again!\nHoliday Sampler -- $25\nHoliday Samplers will feature sixteen marshmallows, four of each flavor in Peppermint Crunch, Chocolate Clementine, Gingersnap, and Salted Caramel Pecan. They will be larger than our normal Kerfluffles, in order to provide more real estate for yummy decorations like drizzled chocolate, crushed peppermint candies, and cookie crumbles.\nAll of this delectable holiday goodness will be packaged in layers in a bright red candy box, complete with an insert identifying each flavor. The hand-crafting involved means Holiday Samplers will be made in limited quantities, and we are making them available to Kickstarter backers first. Includes customizable gift card enclosure and shipping anywhere in North America. \nStretch Goals\nWith such wonderful support so far, we are happy to announce our Kerfluffles stretch goals:\n$7,500 -- Kerfluffles Flavor Sampler -- COMPLETED!\nThe Kerfluffles Flavor Sampler includes a half-dozen marshmallows: one of each of the Classic flavors (Vanilla Bean, Double Dutch Chocolate, Mocha Chip, Orange Dreamsicle, and Lemon Meringue), plus one of the Kickstarter Exclusive flavor (Mayan Hot Chocolate). This is your opportunity to taste Kerfluffles, so you can choose your favorites before we fill your pledge order.\nNow that we have reached $7500, all backers at the $50 and higher Reward levels are automatically signed up to receive a Kerfluffles Sampler, free of charge. For Reward levels under $50, just add $5 to your pledge to receive a Sampler. Samplers will ship in October, limit one Sampler per backer.\n$10,000 -- Vegan Kerfluffles -- COMPLETED!\nHandmade marshmallows are hard to come by, and vegan marshmallows are even more scarce. But I am confident that, with patience and thorough recipe-testing, we can create a vegan Kerfluffles option. Now that we reached $10,000 on our Kickstarter, we are working in earnest on our vegan recipe, with an eye toward releasing it by the end of this year. \nIf you are vegetarian or vegan and want to pledge now in support of our efforts, we can hold your order fulfillment until vegan Kerfluffles are available, or ship your traditional Kerfluffles as a gift to a friend or family member in North America. You will be given an opportunity to let us know about your choices in the survey you receive after our Kickstarter's completion.\n$25,000 - We're going to need a bigger kitchen\u2026 -- COMPLETED!\nThank you for stretching with us to $25,000 to fund a bigger kitchen space and an equipment upgrade. Thanks to you, we can be sure we have the tools and the helping hands to get your marshmallows out as quickly and efficiently as possible. We guarantee every single batch will receive the same attention to detail and be crafted and packaged with care. Now let's get on with the fun part. :)\n$30,000 - Kerfluffles Duos -- COMPLETED!\nSome flavor combinations just cry out to be paired together, and we are only too happy to oblige! We would like to debut Kerfluffles Duos, a box containing a half-dozen each of two complimentary flavors. For instance, Cherry+Limeade: six sweet cherry marshmallows, and six tart lime. Eat them separately, then together, until you find your perfect mix.\nNext on our list to try is Bananas+Foster: a half-dozen creamy banana marshmallows and a half-dozen spiced brown sugar. How about PB+J? Six toasty peanut butter Kerfluffles, and six Concord Grape Jelly Kerfluffles. Pina+Colada anyone? And we can't imagine autumn without Caramel+Apple, made with warm vanilla caramel and juicy apples.\nThanks to your amazing support, we will now be able to offer a new Kerfluffles Duo each month, beginning with the inaugural Duo, Caramel+Apple in November. We will also give every pledge $15 and up a Caramel+Apple Duo tasting-size pack (one caramel and one apple). What ideas do you have for Duo flavor combos? We'd love to hear your suggestions in the comments section!\n$40,000 - Holiday Marshmallow Gift Extravaganza -- COMPLETED!\nYou won't find a better present than Kerfluffles. They taste great, they're all-natural, and they have this funny way of making even the most serious grown-up giggle out loud. Now that we met this stretch goal, we are excited to offer some fantastic gift options for December.\nThe Kerfluffles Holiday Flavor Sampler will come with four limited edition flavors: Peppermint Crunch, Chocolate Clementine, Gingersnap, and Salted Caramel Pecan. Add beautiful packaging and customizable gift card enclosures, and you have a delicious, unique present for anyone on your list. No re-gifting, guaranteed. Check out the Add-ons section above for details about adding one to your pledge.\nCold weather also calls for Kerfluffles Hot Cocoa Kits. As you might guess, we here at Kerfluffles are the sort that like a little hot chocolate with our marshmallows, instead of vice versa. However, we respect the diversity of marshmallow beliefs, so we've got options. :)\nAll Kerfluffles Cocoa Kits will include an 8 oz. jar of homemade, all-natural hot chocolate mix, made with the highest quality cocoa. Marshmallows will be available in Vanilla Bean or Peppermint Crunch, as well as two choices of mallow size: a heap of mini-Kerfluffles, or a half-dozen round, jumbo mallows designed to fill the top of your mug. Hot cocoa perfection. To show our thanks for reaching $40,000, we will include a sample of our hot chocolate mix in every $25 Holiday Mallow Add-on.\n$65,000 - Can you keep a secret? -- COMPLETED!\nWe can! Now that we passed $65K, we will be adding a Kickstarter backer-only section to our web store when it opens the first week of November. After all, Kickstarter isn't just some fancy way to pre-order a product -- it's a community. Your support is making it possible to found our business, providing funds to pay employees, kitchen rental fees, and purchase a long list of ingredients and supplies. And because your commitment to us is paving the way for long-term success, we want to be sure we show you some long-term appreciation.\nNow that we stretched to $65,000, every backer will have access to a secret Kickstarter section of our web store, featuring exclusives like limited runs of test flavors and first look at new products. We will also offer special Kerfluffles swag not available to the general public. Mums the word. :)\n$75,000 - Soft and Sweet -- COMPLETED!\nPerhaps the only thing more irresistible than a little cube of sugary fluff is a plushie made to look like one! Now that we reached $75K, we will commission a special edition stuffed Kerfluffle. Fluffle will be a 4\" plush white cube, complete with adorable embroidered expression and a secret message on the tag. Fluffle will be free to backers pledged at non-international Reward levels of $60 and up, and it is available as a $10 Add-on for everyone else, including our international friends.\nCuddle your Fluffle; let it keep you company at work; tell it your secrets; or give it to a special someone. Guaranteed sweet companionship, plus a reminder of four weeks of Kickstarter Kerfluffles fun. (Just don't try to eat it! ;)\n$80,000 - Be Mine\nFeeling the Kickstarter love for the last few weeks has got us thinking about Valentine's Day. In our house, Valentine's Day isn't about greeting cards or stressful deadlines. Valentine's Day is about showing love to the people who make our world a better place. We make handmade valentines for friends and family and share yummy treats with pretty much anyone who comes within hugging distance. I want Valentine's Day at Kerfluffles to feel the same way: warm, loving, and cheerful.\nOf course, our final stretch goal is also devoted to our romance with marshmallows. If we reach $80K, we will be able to produce several Valentine's Day products. We would love to feature a heart-shaped tin full of chocolate-dipped Kerfluffles in fun Valentine's Day flavors like Vanilla Chip, Pucker-up Pomegranate, and Sweet-Tart Cherry. (See what we did there? \"Sweet-Tart\"\u2026 \"Sweetheart\"\u2026 ;)\nWe would also like to make treats that are easily shared, so we're thinking of heart-shaped Kerfluffles shaped so they can perch on the side of a mug of hot chocolate. Our I <3 U Mug Mallows will be available in all three of our Valentine's Day flavors.\nAnd let's not forget that Valentine's Day is the perfect time to be in love, whether your relationship is a few months old or decades in the making. We're dreaming of Kerfluffles Fondue-for-Two Kits, with Kerfluffles marshmallows, chocolate, candles, and everything else you need for a romantic chocolate fondue for you and your sweetheart.\nStretch with us to $80,000, and we'll offer all our Kickstarter backers a cutie-pie Cupid Kerfluffle t-shirt design, as well as some extra-sweet Valentine's Day swag in the Kickstarter Ninja section of our web store.\nKerfluffles T-shirt\nPresenting the designs for the Kerfluffles T-shirt, available with the $50 Reward level. It is printed on a 100% heavyweight cotton ringer tee, white with black detailing, available in sizes YS-3XL.\nThe T-shirt is also available as a $20 Add-on for backers at any giving level, including those pledging at the $20 International Reward level.\n(To take advantage of this Add-on, either add $20 to an existing pledge, or make your initial pledge at $20 higher than the Reward level of your choice. After our Kickstarter is completed, we will email you a survey to find out which Add-ons you selected, including details like t-shirt size.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 1213, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1649827049/kerfluffles-marshmallows-all-natural-handmade-yumm", "project_name": "Kerfluffles Marshmallows: All-Natural ~ Handmade ~ Yummy"}}, {"backer": "Andrew Soderberg", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "THE MOVIE\nTRENCHCOATS. CIGARETTES.  REVOLVERS.  FEMME FATALES.\nLos Angeles, 1958: A detective holes up in a downtown hotel waiting for killers to come and get him. As one long night turns to day he meets various characters with haunted pasts of their own, and the truth is revealed of how he ended up in this predicament.\n\"HOTEL NOIR\" is a black and white film noir starring CARLA GUGINO, DANNY DEVITO, ROSARIO DAWSON, RUFUS SEWELL, MALIN AKERMAN, ROBERT FORSTER, MANDY MOORE and KEVIN CONNOLLY.\nTHE MOVIE IS FINISHED.  And we are so goddamn proud of it.  It's got AMAZING PERFORMANCES and cool-as-hell black and white cinematography and a fantastic analog, period-correct Jazz score, like something that might have been heard in a Jean Pierre Melville movie. \nTHE TRAILER\nWatch it here:\nwww.hotel-noir-film.com\nTHE TWITTER FEED\n@hotelnoirfilm\nTHE CAST\nCarla Gugino is a film, Broadway and TV actress best known for her work in Spy Kids, Sin City, Watchmen, Sucker Punch and, most recently, USA's Political Animals. Last month she was voted the Number 1 Most Underrated Actress Alive in an Internet poll.  Time for that to change.\nDanny DeVito is one of the most beloved film and TV stars in the world. You may know him from Taxi, Batman Returns, It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia or from movies he's directed (The War Of The Roses) or produced (Pulp Fiction, Out Of Sight, Get Shorty).\nRosario Dawson is a film actress, political activist and all-around cool person with a killer smile.  She has been in Sin City, Men In Black 2, Deathproof, Eagle Eye and Kids.\nRufus Sewell is so much suaver than you, it's crazy.  He's like a killer Shakesperian actor who hasn't actually done Shakespeare (that's how freakin' suave he is).  You may know him from Dark City, The Illusionist and A Knight's Tale.\nMalin Akerman is Swedish.  And her character here is called Swedish Mary. (which of course is a reference to Burt Lancaster in The Killers). You may know her from Rock Of Ages, Couples Retreat or Watchmen, but you've never seen her like this.\nRobert Forster is so cool, he's pretty much an institution of cool.  Just watch Jackie Brown.  Or his scene-stealing turn in The Descendants.  Wait til you see him here, completely in his element.\nMandy Moore is an actress and singer who you've seen in A Walk To Remember, Saved! and Tangled. She is super polite but can also kick your ass. For real.\nKevin Connolly is best known for his role as Eric in HBO's Entourage but has been craftily stealing scenes for years.  You may have seen him in He's Just Not That Into You, The Ugly Truth and Secretariat.  He's also an accomplished director in his own right.\nTHE DISTRIBUTION MODEL\nI'm interested in cracking the new code of indie distribution.  Last year I made a feature length movie expressly for the internet with many of the same cast members, \"GIRL WALKS INTO A BAR\".  It used a corporate sponsor for its release, and on its opening weekend was watched (in its entirety, not just as a playlist) by 250,000 YouTube users.  It was a big success and yet, for a variety of reasons, the money still did not exactly trickle down to the people who made the movie.  I want this to change.  I WANT ARTISTS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE COMMERCIAL THINGS AND GET PAID FOR IT, without having to stand in the back of a convoluted back-end line built on Byzantine accounting.\nThe KICKSTARTER REVOLUTION is well underway and there is no reason it can't apply to movies with well known casts. This movie was done completely outside the studio system, in total DIY fashion, so why trust the corporate world to release it?\nThe fact is, these are STRANGE TIMES IN THE WORLD OF INDEPENDENT FILM DISTRIBUTION.  Unless you are a lottery winner and get plucked by a Fox Searchlight from the thousands of competitors at Sundance, you are facing a quicksand landscape in which most of the revenue comes from VIDEO ON DEMAND.  We have secured a promising VOD release and are now in the process of carving out DVD, iTunes, Netflix and TV sales, but also need to get a LIMITED THEATRICAL RUN in order to best promote the movie (in the press, talk shows, etc.) and qualify for POTENTIAL AWARDS and things like that.\nThis is where you come in.\nWe are looking for fans of NOIR.  Crime picture enthusiasts who appreciate rapid fire dialogue, sexy dames and plot twists rendered in high contrast black and white.  \"HOTEL NOIR\" is no throwback relic, it's A MOVIE FOR FILM-LOVERS who like their pulp married to existentialism.  Who worship at the altars of Wilder, Tourneur, Siodmak, Ray and Melville (and if you don't know all these guys, think of all the cool movies you're about to immerse yourself in!)\nYou know who you are.   \nWE NEED YOU\nWe need to put the movie in a theater in New York and LA because ideally, we want this movie not just on VOD and digital platforms but ALSO on good old fashioned, popcorn-serving movie theaters.  At the same time, we believe that a run in New York and LA -- while FANTASTIC -- could be the start of something bigger.  An old-school grass roots movement to roll the movie out theatrically in other cities.   (Make no mistake, it's not like we don't LOVE the superhero movies crowding every screen, it's just that it'd be cool to have other options too.)\nThis is Noir Calling.  Come out, come out, wherever you are. \nAnd, to quote the awesome Amanda Palmer, who knows what she's talking about: WE ARE THE MEDIA: as soon as you support this kickstarter, PLEASE TELL EVERYONE YOU'VE DONE IT, AND SPREAD THE LINK FAR AND WIDE.\nthank you, thank you, thank you (and also: thank you).\nFAQ\nWhat will the KS-Backer DVD look like?\n(both the DVD and SOUNDTRACK CD will be limited edition \"kickstarter-backer\" editions, never to be made again.)\nAnd the Soundtrack CD?\nIf the movie's so good, why didn't a distributor buy it at a festival?\nBecause we didn't go to any festivals.  We screened it in Cannes to sell some foreign territories and right away were enticed by a VOD deal that made sense.  \nIs Danny DeVito really funny in this or is it one of those indie movies where actors play against type and he's all like, tragically dour?\nVery perceptive.  A little bit of both.  There is definitely humor in the story.  But things get serious.\nWhat do these new-fangled old school lobby cards look like, exactly?\nHere's two:\nCan I pledge for different tiers that offer different rewards?\nYou can pledge the cumulative amount for both rewards and then shoot us an email and we will make a note of it.\nWhat is a \"Chicago Overcoat\" in Film Noir slang?\nA coffin.

By setting goals and tracking your spending in real-time, you\u2019ll never be surprised by your energy bill again. Wattvision is designed with a great end-to-end user experience in mind. How much money are you spending on energy right now? You\u2019ll always know with Wattvision.\n\u201cIf Apple created an energy monitor - it would be the Wattvision. I love it.\u201d - David G, real Wattvision user\n\u201cThe Wattvision monitor has already paid for itself in the first 3 months and now I receive credits on my bills.\u201d - Brandon D, real Wattvision user\nHow does it work?\nSensor > Wattvision Cloud > Your Phone & Web\nWattvision works by gathering data from your electricity meter -- that funky device that wasn\u2019t designed by user experience experts. Setup is easy: just surface-mount your Wattvision Energy Sensor to the outside of your meter, connect the Wattvision Gateway to your network, and then go online on your computer or mobile device to see and analyze your real-time energy data.\nIf you have an analog meter, our analog sensors will watch and time the rotations of the disk inside your meter. Each rotation marks a fixed quantity of energy used by your house. If you have a digital meter, our digital sensor will read the infrared pulses emitted by your meter that also mark the energy coming from the grid. Your sensor sends the data through your home network (via the Wattvision Gateway), to Wattvision servers. You can then view the data live on your mobile device, on your computer, or anywhere you choose. Look at historical trends in your energy use, receive e-mail and text message alerts, and track your home\u2019s overall efficiency compared to similar homes.\nUnlike most systems, there is no electrician required to set up Wattvision! Because we connect to your meter, we track your whole home's energy use -- not just one outlet or one appliance!\nHow can I use Wattvision?\nSave money by setting daily energy spending goals, and track your progress against these goals in real-time. \nSee if the green changes you make are actually making a difference.\nCompare and rank your home with similar homes across the country.\nFind energy-draining devices, including faulty appliances.\nReceive alerts and catch problems before you get an unusually high energy bill.\nUse our API to integrate data into your home automation system or send to other 3rd party services for detailed analysis.\nThe Project: Wattvision 2\nWe have great feedback from our amazing early adopters across the country, and we\u2019re ready to act on this feedback and expand Wattvision to more users.

But we can\u2019t make this happen without your support.\nWith a successful kickstarter campaign, we\u2019ll be able to:\nComplete development of Wattvision 2\nMake a large production run to get Wattvision 2 in your hands\nExpand our reach to more types of power meters -- our goal is ALL meters\nSupport Ethernet and more types of wireless networks (specifically g and n)\nFeatures and Specs for Wattvision 2\nWattvision 2: You'll get a Gateway and one sensor appropriate for your meter\nHardware\nDurable, heavy-duty sensors designed for outdoor use\nSet and forget (no batteries involved)\nCompatible with most analog and digital power meters\nAccurate to within 2 watts\nData updated ~ every 10 seconds\nQuick and easy to set up\nManufactured in the USA\nSoftware:\niPhone and Android support\nE-mail and text message alerts and recommendations\nData download into Excel or any other software\nDeveloper API for custom and 3rd party applications\nShared community energy graphs\nTop Energy Savers Rankings\nBecome a Wattvisionary by pledging to our Kickstarter campaign today. Your pledge will help us create the hardware and software needed to realize our collective vision for a more energy efficient future!\nAt a glance, see how you're doing\nPlan\nCase Studies\nWe sold out of the first version of Wattvision on Amazon, and received a solid 5 stars across 8 user-submitted reviews. Here are some excerpts:\n\"Simplicity wins compared to the competition\"\n\"My New neurosis\"\n\"Simple, Effective Energy Monitoring\"\n\"It paid for itself in 3 months\"\n\"The one that works great\"\n\"Super cool device great value\"\n+Most of our customers have discovered phantom loads, appliances which periodically turn on and off and cost money in the background, and then added schedules or made adjustments.  With Wattvision you can see how much it costs you to run anything from a light bulb to a microwave to a hair dryer.\n+A customer calculated the cost of drying a load of clothes, and decided to air dry his family\u2019s clothes after discovering the high cost (hard to beat sun and wind power!)\n+An industrial customer in Michigan uses Wattvision to avoid a higher cost of energy that can kick in when their industrial equipment draws too much power.\n+A customer with solar panels had been unable to zero his energy bill, but with Wattvision he was able to make the changes that now allow him to get paid by his utility each month\nAPI\nWattvision allows you to download data as fast as we receive it, through our download API. Pretty neat stuff. Researchers and third parties have already shown that it\u2019s possible to take whole house data and break it down by appliance, a scenario we\u2019re excited to enable.\nWhile we make strides to use clean and renewable energy in the future, it\u2019s vital to remember that the cleanest energy is the energy we never use. One of the most important steps towards improving our energy habits is simply to cut down on our existing energy use, and we can do that by first knowing where we stand. Wattvision makes this possible by showing you your real-time energy use on the web or on your phone. We want everyone to take charge of their energy lifestyle and bring the future to the present!\nSee QA below.\nSpecial Thanks\nJared Flesher - videography - http://www.sourlands.com.

See Update 16 for details. \nYOUR WORLD, SMARTER\nSmartThings makes it easy to connect the things in your physical world to the Internet. You can monitor, control, automate, and have fun with them from anywhere - at home, office, or on the go.\nWe've made it possible to install apps that interact with your SmartThings, as well as online and other services. This unlocks a world of possibilities and and unlimited potential to make your life easier, more convenient and fun.\nWe call these SmartApps.\nSMARTAPP POTENTIAL IS LIMITLESS\nSmartApps are able to mash up and interact with connected things in your physical world, as well as online and other services, allowing for incredible creativity.\nGet notified immediately if your pet runs out of your yard without you with the \"Oh No, My Pet Is Loose!\" SmartApp.\nGet an early warning or directly contact a plumber when there is a leak somewhere (bathroom, basement), before damage gets out of hand with the \u201cIt\u2019s Leaking!\u201d  SmartApp.\nMonitor drawers and cabinets that contain precious or dangerous items with the \"My Stuff is Secure\" SmartApp.\nBrighten, dim, or flicker the lights when you get another fan or follower on social networks with the \u201cBuzz Barometer\" SmartApp.\nEven more SmartApps...\nIT WORKS WITH A LOT OF THINGS\nThink about all the things in your home: doors, desks, lights, stereo, pet food bowls, basement floor... isn\u2019t it time they started to chip in and do a little more around the house on their own? SmartThings makes it possible. \nINSTACUBE UPDATE!\nWe built SmartThings as an open platform, because we knew there would be a world of useful, beautiful and creative products that could be made smarter with SmartThings.\nToday, we\u2019re thrilled to announce a unique partnership between two Kickstarter projects - SmartThings and Instacube - that shows the power of this integration and collaboration. Together, we're making Instacube smart.\nWe will be working with the creators of Instacube to integrate the SmartThings technology - imagine the possibilities:\nElegant, visual notifications for the events in your life that matter most, including someone arriving at your door, your pet leaving, or a reminder that you\u2019ve left the garage door open right before you head to bed - without taking your phone out of your pocket.\nA beautiful, touchscreen interface for controlling the physical world around you, such as your lights, doors or air conditioning\nThe presence awareness of SmartThings can drive Instacube to turn on or off and to display the photo stream of the user who is present enabling many intelligent interactions.\nIntegrated SmartApps such as \u201cMorning Routine\u201d that can turn Instacube on as an alarm, get the coffee brewing, and turn on the bathroom lights\nIf you love SmartThings, please consider backing Instacube.\nMore info in Update #9.\nMany of the existing things you own can be made smarter using SmartThings Kits. At launch, the following core devices will be available:\nPower Outlet - anything that can be plugged in, can be turned on and off\nOpen/Shut Sensor - know if doors, windows or cabinets are open or closed\nMotion Sensor - detect movement within a room\nPresence Sensor - know when people and pets come and go\nSmartThings are designed to be compatible with many of the existing standards for home automation, smart energy and more. There are literally hundreds of existing sensors and devices you can use. And with your support, many more of these devices will be certified for use and made available in the SmartThings Store.\nDoor Locks\nThermostats\nTemperature and Humidity Sensors\nIn-Wall Switches and Dimmers\nSmoke and CO Alarms\nMoisture and Flood Sensors\nVibration and Pressure Sensors\nAnd much more\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!\nYou can help bring SmartThings to the world. We\u2019ve highlighted a few of the backer levels below, including:\nSmartThings Packs\nEarlybird and Non-Earlybird SmartThings Packs in a handful of flavors (choose one) that will give you everything you need to get started including the SmartThings Hub and a selection of connected Things.\nYour SmartThings Pack will also include access to a range of SmartApps that you can use to start making your world smarter within minutes.\nSmartThings Pack backers will receive early access to the ThingStore to expand your world of connected things at will.\nSmartThings Pack backers will also receive an invitation to suggest new SmartApps and types of Things and to vote on submissions from the community of developers and makers.\nUPDATE: You can now add as many additional Things to your reward as you would like. See Update 7 for details.\nNote: SmartThings Packs will support a variety of connectivity methods, including Ethernet, cellular, Zigbee, Z-wave, and Bluetooth. The initial launch units will be U.S. only, and may or may not include cellular connectivity.\nIf you\u2019re a developer or Maker, SmartThings is an open platform and we\u2019ve got a whole program just for you.\nDeveloper and Maker Kits\nWe're giving the more adventurous among us early access to all the SmartThings tools.

While you're at it, visit SmartThings on Facebook and \"Like\" us there too! :)\nDonate your brain to science. Every day our team, spouses, partners, and friends come up with interesting, fun, helpful (and occasionally bizarre) new ways to apply SmartThings and SmartApps. We want everyone in the community to share their ideas. Just go to the Comments section and tell us how you envision making your life smarter.\nDEVELOPERS: HACK THE PHYSICAL WORLD\nWe want to free physical devices from the iron grip of the few who understand the ins and outs of firmware. That's why SmartThings will be a completely open platform. Our core mission for SmartApps is to enable developers to unleash their creativity in the real world just as easily as they have been able to on the web and mobile devices.\nThere are two paths to creating new SmartApps. Basic, and Advanced.\nAt the Basic level, you can generate new SmartApps using a web based interface with full access to existing triggers and available actions within the SmartThings cloud.\nAt the Advanced level, we are creating and exposing an SDK for the physical world of non-smart devices \u2014 enabling them to plug into the digital one and become smart.\nWe give your front door an API. We give your bed an API. We give your toilet an API... your imagination is the only limit.\nWe are working hard to make sure that our APIs are both straightforward and secure. You can use your preferred development language and tools to do amazing things with the physical graph that SmartThings is bringing online.\nWe are ready to integrate with all of your favorite web services.\nThe uses are endless, so don\u2019t be shy. Let\u2019s work together to make the physical world smarter.\nA SPECIAL NOTE FOR MAKERS\nWe\u2019ve got dozens of ideas to share for how to make our lives smarter, but we're also eager to hear yours. Tell us about them in the Comments section.\nBut, if you\u2019re handy with a soldering iron, know that a breadboard isn\u2019t just for cutting Rye, can casually slip Arduino into daily conversation, and are ready to hack your own physical world, we\u2019re ready to support you.  For you makers and open hardware buffs, we\u2019ve got:\nSmartThings ThingModule - add cloud intelligence to any device\nSmartThings ThingShield and Sketch for Arduino - make your existing project smarter\nSmartThings Software Development Kit (SDK) - develop SmartThings-friendly software\nCloud Platform API - integrate your device or app directly with SmartThings\nMobile App Extension Template - embed controls for your project in the SmartThings mobile app\nTell us about your project and we\u2019ll help you bring it to the world.\nPROJECT TIMELINE\nWe currently have working prototypes of the key hardware and software components of the SmartThings Packs that you are backing as part of this Kickstarter project, including the hub, end-devices, maker tools, cloud platform, and mobile app.\nHere is our timeline for putting SmartThings into your hands:\nSEPTEMBER \nFinal stage of design and certification process for SmartThings Hub, Packs, and Maker tools\nOCTOBER\nCertification completed for SmartThings Packs\nInjection molding and final packaging design\nNOVEMBER\nVolume manufacturing of SmartThings Packs (Hubs and Things)\nDECEMBER\nDistribution - Kickstarter backers get their SmartThings Packs \nSDK ready for Developers and Makers\nSmartThings Mobile App available including SmartApps\nMEET THE FOUNDERS\nThe SmartThings founders share a vision: A product experience that is beautiful, functional, fast and revolutionary. We can\u2019t wait to get SmartThings into your hands. Reach out to us in the Comments section if you want to speak with any of us directly.\nAlex Hawkinson\nAndrew Brooks\nBen Edwards\nJames Stolp\nJeff Hagins\nJesse O\u2019Neill-Oine\nScott Vlaminck\nHISTORY AND EVOLUTION\nThere were two major \u201caha moments\u201d that inspired us to develop SmartThings.\nLike most innovation, SmartThings started with a flooded basement. During a power outage, the pipes at Alex\u2019s cabin froze and burst, flooding the basement. In looking for options to get notified about temperature drops and flooding, it became clear that available solutions required a separate Internet connection. Even if the cabin had one, it would have shut off in the power outage.\nSo the concept of \u2018it just works\u2019 for SmartThings was born. We built a platform that easily connects everyday things to the Internet. Our vision is to include always-on cellular connectivity in every SmartThings Hub, so you just take it out of the box, plug it in, and it\u2019s connected. Even better, when you buy new devices, what we call Things, from the ThingStore, they\u2019ll be pre-assigned to your SmartThings Hub. Plug them in or turn them on, they show up in the app, and you\u2019re immediately in control.\nOur real inspiration came when we realized how intelligent everything in our lives could become through the power of computing in the cloud - SmartApps were born. Installing applications into your real life should be as easy as it is on your phone. SmartApps let you combine schedules, events, notifications, information from the Internet and many sensors and devices to create useful solutions that make life easier and more fun.\nTHANK YOU!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "Update 41: SmartThings + __________ = Even Smarter Homes", "update_content": "SmartThings Blog Launched\nWe've created a resource that helps to explain who we are, what we're doing, and why it's important.

Based on the need to interact with devices and poll devices, there are scenarios where we can exceed that limitation. This is core functionality, so we\u2019re evaluating either firmware modifications to dynamically address and throttle the polling and radio, or fixed strategies to reduce our polling frequency based on device type and other variables.

Check out SmartThings here. ***\nNew Video: Ubi & SmartThings\nUbi - Always on. Always ready to help.\nUbi is a voice-activated computer that plugs into a wall outlet. You talk to the Ubi and it talks back. It directly connects to the Internet through wifi.\n\"Look ma, no hands!\"\nWe believe people want to do things when they're at home - they clean, they fold laundry, they cook, they eat, they spend time with loved ones. These are all things that (for the most part) take up use of our arms and hands. When we're at home, we'd rather use our limbs for other activities than typing, scrolling, or swiping.\nUbi is short for ubiquitous computer because it's always on, always listening, always ready to help. It can scribe, listen, analyze. Ubi will either talk back to you the information you seek or indicate information through multi-color lights. \nUbi listens to its environment and senses it through sound, temperature, light, pressure, and humidity. It can record this information or use it to trigger events and communication.  \nWhat can it do? \nUbi can be used for potentially hundreds of applications. The applications we plan to ship with the Ubi are:\nVoice-enabled Internet search \nSpeakerphone \nIndicator light (light changing based on events, e.g. weather, stock, email) \nHome speaker system with sound piping \nVirtual assistant (audio calendar, feed reader, podcast etc) \nVoice memos \nAlarm clock \nIntercom system \nBaby monitor \nNoise pollution monitor \nControlling the climate of your home perfectly (through web enabled thermostats like Nest)\nA Helping Hand\nWe see a huge potential for Ubi to assist those who have visual, hearing, or mobility impairments. With its indicator lights and talk-to-activate functionality, Ubi is super simple to setup and use. We want the Ubi to make it easier for our parents and loved ones to stay connected with us and the world. \nYour Kickstarter Contribution \nWe're serious about making this technology of our dreams easily available to everyone. Your Kickstarter contribution is going to allow us to get safety approval (FCC and CE) so that it can be used everywhere. It will also help driving down the cost of making the Ubi so that everyone can afford at least one.  In a nutshell, your contribution will:\nAllow us to meet regulatory approval\nGet our first production run in place (tooling, machining, and chip printing - we are working with local firms who are very talented)\nAllow us to complete the initial apps we're going to deliver with the Ubi\nRewards\nEach Ubi reward above the $1 level comes with one Ubi unit that has wifi and a slew of other functionality. It also includes the Ubi web, iPhone and Android app and access to the Ubi portal to monitor and setup the Ubi remotely. You'll also get early access to the API.  \nUbi is available in arctic white or midnight black. Please specify which is your preference when you back the project.\n$1 - Access to backer-only updates and early offers when product is launched    \n$149 - Early backers - 1 Ubi (limited to first 100)\n$189 - Single Ubi \n$349 - Two Ubis \n$479 - Three-pack of Ubis \n$649 - Five-pack of Ubis\nNEW! - $1249 - The Inner Sanctum - The Ubi 10-pack and much more\nHow it works \nUbi plugs into a wall outlet and accesses the Internet through a wifi connection. It has a microphone and speakers and listens for commands. Saying \"Ubi\" wakes up the Ubi for receiving verbal commands. You can then instruct the Ubi to do your bidding. Ubi will receive plain language commands. Ubi communicates back to you through speech or by using lights.\nOnboard the Ubi are sensors to monitor your environment: \n\nTemperature\nHumidity\nAir pressure\nAmbient light\nThis data can be stored online or used to trigger alerts to your mobile device or email. \nThe Ubi runs Android with a powerful processor to perform voice recognition and also has the ability to connect to other devices. You can plug in speakers, USB drives, or connect through Bluetooth directly to your iPhone or Android device. For developers, you can also communicate with potentially thousands of devices (through RF, wifi, or Bluetooth) and we're making the device open so peripherals and other applications can be used with it. \nTechnical Specs on the Ubi \nAndroid 4.1 Jelly Bean \n800 MHz ARM Cortex-A8 Processor\n1 GB RAM \n802.11 b/n/g Wifi Enabled (WEP, WPA, and WPA2 encryption)\nHi fidelity speakers and omni-directional microphone \nUSB 2.0 with 5 V power supply \nBluetooth 4.0 \nTemperature, humidity, and air pressure sensors \nAmbient light sensor \nRF Transceiver Module \nPlugs into a standard NA 110 V, 15A power outlet (world versions to be forth-coming)  UPDATE: NA two-prong plug, but 100-240 VAC, 50-60 Hz support! UPDATE #2: worldwide plug support available!\nDimensions (approximate): 4.0\" x 4.0\" x 1.1\"\nWhere We're At \nWe've been working for over ten months on the concept, design, and prototyping of the Ubi and we're now at a point where we're ready to bring it to the Kickstarter community. We've also built an early working prototype and have been refining the design to make it more compact and easier to use. We've been in contact with manufacturers and suppliers and have spec'ed out the costs for bringing the Ubi to market. Ubi is currently slated to work in English with North American voltages. We hope to expand this to other regions and languages. \nWe're working with local and overseas suppliers for sourcing the Ubi's electronics and plan on completing the machining, assembly, testing and certification of the Ubi in the Toronto area. We've also worked with certification authorities for pricing of safety and communication testing of the Ubi and inspection will be completed at the final point of assembly.\nOur team is experienced in working on dozens of projects for engineering research institutions. All of our team members have engineering backgrounds and have delivered on real engineering projects in the past.\nSample Data from the Ubi \nBelow is an example of some of the data that will be available from the Ubi as it monitors different aspects of its surrounding environment. The Ubi can constantly monitor your home to provide triggers or feedback. \n    Special Thanks and More\nThanks to all of our backers for helping us get this exciting project off the ground! We'd also like to thank the other Kickstarter projects that have inspired us like Twine, t\u014dd and Pebble.   \nA HUGE thanks goes to our extremely talented friend, Joe Sarafian, of RapidParts.ca for his help in creating our Ubi prototype. \nA special thanks also goes out to El Cantador for allowing us to use their music in our Kickstarter video.

Everyone benefits if more things in our life become smart, especially Instacube!\nWe Love Instagram\nWe use it. Obsessively. Instagram represents a whole new way of sharing and viewing photos. It's a unique experience that puts photo-sharing front-and-center, and Instagram does it better than anyone else.\nPhotos are pushed to your Instacube real-time.\n\nInstacube: A Living Canvas\nWhen designing Instacube, John Whaley (D2M's Head of Industrial Design) was inspired by the idea of creating a living canvas that pushes beautiful images to a stand-alone device as they happen -- all on a big, beautiful display. No need to launch an app on your smartphone and squint at tiny images. Instacube makes enjoying your Instagrams more enjoyable than ever before.  You are now free to effortlessly enjoy, display and show-off beautiful Instagrams in your home or office, all day long.\nWake up to sunrises pushed from your friends around the world!\n\nFinally... Instagrams at Full-Resolution\nIf you've ever downloaded your Instagrams to your computer, you'll notice that they export at just over 600x600 pixels. We've chosen a display that matches that resolution, pushing your Instagrams to you just as they should be -- in the moment they're taken, and at full resolution. That's why we've chosen to develop Instacube with a 600x600 LCD touch screen display.\nStream to your Instacube using Hashtags\n\nEasy To Setup, Easy To Use\nSetup is in 3 easy steps.  Plug it in, connect to your home wireless network, then log in with your Instagram account and you're done!  Using it is just as easy.  Turn it on and your stream is there waiting for you.  Use the touch screen to navigate through your stream just as you would on your phone.\nLog in using your Instagram account\n\nIt's Tactile\nThere are three tactile buttons on top.  One is for power.  The second one toggles between your Instagram feeds. The third one allows you to \"Like\" the photos you love using the heart-shaped button. Bypass the ones you don't using the touch screen display.  \nToggle through your feeds. \"Like\" the photos you love. Bypass the ones you don't.\n\nIt runs Android.\nWe believe in open platforms to spur creativity and innovation.  Right now we're 100% focused on making the Instacube work seamlessly with Instagram so that we deliver the best user experience possible, but we hope to add new features and applications in the future and would love to eventually open it up to the developer community.\nInstacube...Anywhere You Go\nYes, it truly is wireless in every sense of the word.  In addition to the powerful WiFi b/g/n wireless data connectivity, we've also loaded Instacube up with a rechargeable lithium battery so that you can untether it and move it wherever  you want.  \nInstacube has an internal Lithium Ion battery, so it's cable-free and ready to wander with you.\nWho should buy Instacube?\nWe think any current Instagram user will love our Instacube as a fun, new way to enjoy Instagram photos in the home, office or anywhere you've got a wireless connection, but it's not just for consumers.  We believe that if you're a business owner, then Instacube can also be a powerful and innovative way to communicate and interact with your customers.  Imagine the brand building possibilities as your customers use your company's product or service and post their experiences to the Instacubes in your stores.\nEnjoy Instacube... Anywhere!\n\nHow it Works.\nLog into your Instagram account using the touch screen keyboard, and bam! You're up and running. Photos from your Instagram feed will start pushing to Instagram immediately.

We\u2019re trying to satisfy folks that are interested in each aspect \u2013 near- mid- and long-term elements of building the Space Elevator. Also, we\u2019ve created a lot of rewards (14) under $51 \u2013 that\u2019s more than some Kickstarter campaigns use as their complete rewards list. We did this on purpose, too.\nPlease scan our reward levels, even if you can\u2019t afford to commit at the higher price points. We\u2019re doing some pretty interesting stuff we\u2019d like you to know about; some of which is only described in the rewards list.\nMaybe you know someone at work, or school, or a relative, that might want to get involved? We\u2019d appreciate their support as well as yours.\nNewsweek Magazine: #4 \"Invention that will Change the Century\"; Our Elevator to Space\n___________\nTo begin...\nHave you heard of a project called the \u201cSpace Elevator\u201d?   I hope so.  If not, please look it up.  If you\u2019re aware of it, at all, in any capacity other than old Science Fiction, then it is a safe bet that my talented team at LiftPort was somewhere in the background. You see, we\u2019ve been catalyzing and coordinating the commercial development of the Space Elevator for over nine years.   I was personally involved with NASA\u2019s 2001-2003 definitive research study.  My company, LiftPort, grew out of the results of that study. Between 2003-2005 we researched Carbon NanoTubes (the strongest material in the world) \u2013 and we were not very good at it... \nSpace Elevator Rising Over the Ocean\nHowever between 2004-2007 we got really good at building robots that climb into the sky. (More on that in a moment.) At our height we had about 60 university research partners, and somewhere between 800-1000 volunteers working on different aspects of the project. But then, in 2007, when the economy crashed, LiftPort got crushed. (Video at 3:15) We closed the company and our team went into hibernation. And now it is time to awaken! \nThis Kickstarter campaign marks the public return of LiftPort Group!\nWhere We\u2019re Headed\nEarth\u2019s Space Elevator\n     -  A Long Way Off\nUltimately where we are headed is \u2013 as my friend often repeats \u2013 \u201cto get off this rock\u201d. (3rd video, at 3:10)  Ultimately, we are going to build an Elevator that climbs into the sky\u2026 an Elevator that takes humanity from \u201cthis rock\u201d, en masse, to space!   But that is a long way off. Perhaps 20-25 years. Before that happens there are some vital interim steps.\n     -  Technology Derived From this Research\nEveryone reading this message \u2013 using a computer over the Internet \u2013 in one way or another is a descendant of the Apollo era. We have all had our lives made better by the advanced technology that is created \u2013 all the time \u2013 as a by-product of going to space. At LiftPort, we hope to do the same thing; to make living on Earth better, by going to space. We call ourselves an \u201cIdea Factory\u201d because the breakthroughs that we need for our beloved Elevator will also have practical \u2018down-to-Earth\u2019 applications \u2013 just like Apollo did.\n\n     -  LiftPort.com\nOur (brand new) website has tons of resources for you to review: technical documents, images of our team building the future, and lots of other stuff. Whether you choose to support our campaign or not, we\u2019d love to have your participation on the site: www.liftport.com. Or join as a member, and get involved in the conversation, add to the wiki or simply ask questions. \n\nLunar Space Elevator Infrastructure\nFeasibility Study - This is Where We're Going\nBefore we can build Earth\u2019s Elevator, we\u2019ll need to build one on the Moon. It is significantly easier, and much much cheaper. Importantly - we can build it with current technology \u2013 in about eight years.\nTo meet our target date, we need to complete a 1-year Feasibility Study, beginning next year. That will cost $3M. I don\u2019t expect to raise that through this Kickstarter campaign. But I\u2019m throwing it out there so you know what\u2019s ahead for this program. (But if you\u2019re feeling generous \u2013 surprise me! All kidding aside, if you think the rewards we\u2019ve got for Kickstarter are good, you should talk to us about the \u2018rewards\u2019 if you fund our Study!)\nThis Lunar Elevator is a new effort. It is part of LiftPort's revival program. This system can be built now, while Earth\u2019s Elevator requires several more breakthroughs. We think we should focus on building this Lunar Space Elevator Infrastructure  (LSEI or \u201cElsie\u201d) as a prerequisite to the main goal.\n Project Description \nTethered Towers\n     -  How Relevant?\nSo if the Lunar Elevator is a precursor technology to Earth\u2019s Elevator, then our proposed Kickstarter campaign of Tethered Towers is a precursor to the Lunar Elevator.\nThat\u2019s where you come in!\n     -  What we want to do is:\nBuild a robot that can climb 2 kilometers straight up. \nBuild a test platform of high-altitude balloons - tethered to the ground.\nOur Robot (which you can NAME) will climb the test platform \u2013 and set a world record.\nLet the world know that we didn\u2019t quit, give up, or fail\u2026 we just had to \u2018pause\u2019 for a while.\nRebuild our connection with the global community of supporters.\nRaise a little money to cover the cost of this specific experiment.\n\n\nIn the spirit of full disclosure, my team already climbed 1 mile, 6 years ago. At 2 kilometers, this proposed experiment is only a quarter mile farther\u2026 But most of my team at LiftPort 2.0 are new.  The folks from LiftPort 1.0 moved on to other projects.  I\u2019m bringing in several of the experienced guys to help transfer knowledge to our new team.  We\u2019re \u2018passing the torch\u2019 if you will.  This is a critical milestone in our development as an organization. \nOnce we\u2019ve done that, the new team can reach ever higher. (See our Stretch Goals at the bottom of the page.)\nI wanted our Group to hit a new altitude record, right out of the gate.  But I didn\u2019t want to push the team too far.  I feel confident that we can achieve this goal.  Afterwards, an altitude of 3-5 km is reachable.  It becomes substantially more difficult with greater altitude. Cold is a real problem: lubricants freeze, motors seize and materials become brittle, fast.  Depending on our starting location, its base altitude, time of year, and cumulative altitude, temperatures can easily drop into double-digit negative numbers\u2026 and robots don\u2019t like that.  Add in weather effects and things get complicated, fast.\nSo the plan is to first build the \u2018bot, then an indoor test rig.  Imagine a vertical treadmill; our little robot can climb and climb and climb, and still get nowhere. (Do ya feel like that some days?) Once we\u2019re satisfied with its performance, then we build out the Tethered Towers test platform of helium balloons held to the ground with a Ribbon.  We can pre-test this up to 200ft without causing a ruckus at the Federal Aviation Administration.  Any further, and we need airspace clearances from the FAA, Air Force and Navy.  We\u2019ve done this 14 times, so we are not worried about that aspect.  Once the regulators give us the dates, locations and clear skies, then we aim for the record books...  a (temporary) man-made structure that is 2km tall \u2013 and a robot that can climb it!\n     -  Communication / Observation\nBeyond its usefulness as a Space Elevator test platform and an interesting experiment, does this system have any practical value in the real world?\nWe\u2019re glad you asked that.  The answer is yes!  Radio frequency communications are all based on \u2018line-of-sight\u2019.  Which means the farther you can see, the farther you can communicate (within the limits of sending and receiving power).  That is why cell towers and TV broadcast towers are constructed on hills, mountains and tall buildings.  Every vertical foot matters.  The system we\u2019ve designed can be used for communications in remote villages, to monitor crops for efficient harvesting, early warning for forest fires, perimeter security or to provide wireless internet to a campus.  (Did you see the \u201cKony 2012\u201d videos?  I\u2019ve just started an email conversation about how we might provide an early warning system to those in need.)\n     -  Emergency Support System\nDuring a natural disaster, communication infrastructures are overwhelmed.  The people that need comms\u2019 the most \u2013 aid workers \u2013 don\u2019t have it.  But our system can be deployed in 2 hours from the time our boots hit the ground.  Speed matters.  We think we can save lives.  We can use our \u2018eye in the sky\u2019 to provided camera support, to scan through infrared and detect human heat signatures in the rubble \u2013 and connect the nearest responder to the nearest victim.  Tethered Towers can provided vital support to the brave folks trying to help.\n     - For the Fun of It\nFinally, perhaps we can raise your adrenaline level?  What if you could use our balloons and robot to calmly, gently and quietly float into the sky, and then parachute jump from the top?  Every time we\u2019ve conducted an experiment with our Tethered Towers, we\u2019ve gotten emails from folks that wanted to jump\u2026\nWhy \"only\" $8000?\nWe\u2019ve gotten critiques from our friends that \u201cwe\u2019re not asking for enough\u2026\u201d  The (usually unspoken) implication being that \u201cif you\u2019re really serious about building an Elevator on the Moon, why are you only asking for $8,000?\u201d\nWe made this financial decision for a reason.  Sure, there are many things we can do (will do) that will take a lot more cash\u2026 But that\u2019s not the point of this \u2013 specific \u2013 campaign.  The goal of this Kickstarter event is to rebuild our community.  We will launch another campaign; and another, and another and another.  Over time, after some successes and after we\u2019ve rebuilt trust that our company can do what it says it can do, we\u2019ll raise our financial targets.\nI realize that the point of most Kickstarter projects is to raise money.  Trust me, I get it.  And I do want you to commit cash to our campaign.  Let me restate that \u2013 I want to trade your capital for our goods and services.  This is not a \u2018donation\u2019, but a transaction.  I think that sometimes people misunderstand what Kickstarter is all about. \nI did some pretty deep analysis on the top 39 Kickstarter campaigns. (Ask me about this.)  I looked at the top three campaigns over Kickstarter\u2019s 13 categories.  One detail I learned is this: that 2/3rds of the folks that contribute to a campaign give less than $51 and that that total only amounts to 12% of the funds raised. What this tells me, is that while the media and hype points toward Kickstarter as being a fundraising tool \u2013 Kickstarter\u2019s most important value lies in coordinating and confirming a community of supporters. \nAnd that\u2019s what we need now.  We need you!\nWe feel it is much more important to re-connect with our supporters.  We\u2019ve been out of business for 5 years \u2013 but we didn\u2019t quit!  We\u2019re using this (first!) Kickstarter campaign to let people know that we\u2019re back and we\u2019ve got a new and better plan. \nAs for the cost of our experiment, my team is volunteering so labor is not a factor (yet).  We\u2019re really just talking about purchasing new hardware for the system.  We already know how to build the robot \u2013 this will be our 20th.  We already know how to build the Tethered Tower \u2013 this will be our 15th.  But all of our equipment is 5+ years old and both for safety reasons and because technology has advanced, we think it\u2019s important to start fresh.  Also, because I\u2019m trying to do a \u2018brain-dump\u2019 from the LiftPort 1.0 team to the LiftPort 2.0 team, I want the 2.0 team to get their hands dirty building stuff. \nPart of the LiftPort 1.0 Team.\nAlex, doing emergency field-repairs to the 'bot \"Damocles\".\nWe are going to have multiple Kickstarter campaigns.  In the future, we\u2019re going to raise more money for specific programs \u2013 sub-projects that are within the scope of the penultimate goal: an Elevator in the Sky!  But for the first experiment since our recent restart, I felt it was better to not target \u2018cash\u2019; but to target \u2018community\u2019 instead.  I\u2019m certain the financial support will come\u2026 but I missed you guys.  Really.  And no, I don\u2019t expect to raise $800M for the Lunar Elevator through Kickstarter, but if we raised the $3M for the Feasibility Study I\u2019d probably lose my mind!\nThere is a time and place to ask for a lot of money, but this first Kickstarter campaign isn\u2019t it.  Still, I\u2019d be very grateful of we went substantially over our Kickstarter minimum.  I hope we do. \nWhat We\u2019re Doing for this Campaign\nWhat We'll Do - For as Long as it Takes\n     -  So what will we do with the money?\nThis is not a very expensive experiment; that\u2019s why we chose it first.  To push an analogy too far \u2013 It\u2019s low-hanging fruit; but it\u2019s the tree we\u2019re after!  So it seemed like a good place to start.  It is hardware focused and that\u2019s very important to our team.  It\u2019s achievable within our current resources of people and time.\nThe robot is time consuming and somewhat complicated.  There have been advancements in all sorts of relevant technologies in the past five years.  Motors are lighter and stronger, batteries perform better, and computing and communications are much much simpler.  To put that in perspective, we used to have to build our radios and computer boards from scratch, and hope they worked.  Now, we can simply order them from a parts catalog!  In contrast, the Tethered Tower balloon test platform has not changed much.  She\u2019s still a temperamental little beastie\u2026  But so long as the weather cooperates, I\u2019m not anticipating any serious problems with that infrastructure. \nSpecifically, we\u2019ll build a robot, and climb a string into the sky.  We\u2019ll reach as high as we can, safely, and collect all sorts of data.  If we raise more, we\u2019ll do more.  If we go beyond our $8000 goal, we can add all sorts of stuff.  I\u2019ve detailed that in our Stretch Goals below.\nLong-term, we\u2019ll use results from our first experiment to build a better \u2018bot; a better Tethered Tower.  And we\u2019ll climb higher.  We will do this until we reach the limit of what can be achieved here on Earth: ~ 30 kilometers/100,000ft.  Once we\u2019ve got altitude, we\u2019ll combine that with long-term endurance, starting with 6 hours, then 24, then a week, a month, a year, and then finally 2 years.  Once we\u2019ve got that, we\u2019ll make the top \u201chuman rated\u201d because our robot Lifters will need a tested life support system, or else what\u2019s the point of all this\u2026?  \nAre we going to do all that on $8000 from this Kickstarter campaign?  No.  But I include it here because I want you to see where we\u2019re going.  This stepped approach was laid out in our technical roadmap in 2004 and we stand by it.  If we only reach our $8000 goal, then we\u2019ll only do one part of this plan.  If we raise more, we\u2019ll do more.  See our Stretch Goals.\nStretch Goals\n$20,000\nMore Sensors: Telemetry is the key to climbing higher.  Knowing the kinds of conditions our little-\u2018bot-that-could\u2019 is climbing through, is vital.  At the $8,000 level, that is a bare-bones system.  If we stretch to $20k, then we can install a much improved sensor suite.  Sensors will likely include things like GPS, a full package of weather monitors like temperature, wind, humidity, and placement of sensors on vital elements of the robot \u2013 wheels, motors, Ribbon guides.  And we\u2019ll improve the communications network, too.  This might seem pretty dull, and an uninspired first \u201cstretch\u201d, but it is essential knowledge if we want to climb farther.\n$30,000\nHigher: With the improved sensors, we\u2019ll have a better handle on the environmental factors we are facing.  With that knowledge \u2013 we\u2019ll climb higher.  It will depend on the results of the first test, and what the sensors tell us, but I presume that we should be able to climb to at least 3-5km.\nWeb Video: I\u2019m especially excited about this part.  I think we can provide a live video feed from the \u2018bots-eye-view\u2019!   Take a trip with us \u2013 from the comfort of your computer monitor \u2013 as we break new ground.  Imagine the view from 3-5km high.  Is that much different from being in an airplane?  Yup.  360 degree visibility.\n$50,000\nHigher:  This will require a new robot.  If we surpass the 3-5km mark we\u2019re in unknown territory.  Exciting right?  We\u2019ll need thermal protections, interior heating, and a different communications configuration.  Something\u2019s bound to break.  We know our balloons are not made for this, so we\u2019ll have to figure something out.  We call that \u2018science\u2019.\nLonger: (Subject to FAA approvals) We\u2019ll aim for \u201clonger\u201d.  Honestly I can\u2019t really tell you what that means; not until we run the first test.  But whatever we get for the first one, we\u2019ll try to double that.  It will probably be for just 6-12 hours.  We\u2019ve stayed up as long as 60 days, but that was at a stable 200ft.  It\u2019s a completely different problem when it\u2019s at higher altitudes. \nWeb-Controlled Camera:  Remember the camera?  How about an upgrade?  What about a web-controlled Pan/Zoom/Tilt, that our community of supporters can manipulate? \n$75,000\nEven Higher: What does this mean? I have no idea.  I can\u2019t even guess.  But at this point, we\u2019re transitioning the problem of \u2018altitude\u2019 to that of \u2018endurance\u2019.  It\u2019s a trade-off.  While altitude is more important for the robot and the end-goal of the Space Elevator, endurance is more important for the life-saving applications of Tethered Towers.\nEven Longer: Before our company crashed, we were in talks with the FAA to redefine what a \u201ctower\u201d meant\u2026  If we\u2019re aloft for very long, we\u2019ll have to re-open those conversations.  You see, a normal tower is a rigid structure, and they are clearly labeled for pilots.  They stay in one place\u2026 And there is a column of restricted airspace.  However our Tethered Towers are flexible.  The move with wind...  We need to cordon off a \u2018bubble\u2019 of airspace, instead of a column.  If we hit the 24 hour mark, we\u2019ll need blinking lights and radio equipment to warn aircraft.  It would be \u2018bad\u2019 if a plane flew into it.  That\u2019s why we get approvals from the FAA, Air Force and Navy for an experimental system.  They keep our skies clear.\n$100,000\nSeries: At this point, it stops being about a single experiment, and becomes a complete series of independent experiments \u2013 each with their own goals and achievements.  At this point, LiftPort Group is back in business for real; doing what we should be doing \u2013 building an Elevator to Space.  At this level, everything changes.  We transform from being an ad hoc collection of volunteers with a vision \u2013 into a cohesive team with a plan.  The series will be a set of experiments along the continuum of altitude and endurance.  Kickstarter enforces a minimum threshold for a project, because of its \u2018all or nothing\u2019 model.  And we can absolutely run our initial experiment for the amount we budgeted.  But this is really the target I want to hit.  If we \u2018only\u2019 hit $8001, then we are going to remain a \u2018hobby\u2019 team.  If we can hit this number, then LiftPort is a \u201c\u2026before this decade is out\u2026\u201d Lunar Elevator company!\n$250,000\nEdge of Space:  It\u2019s a misnomer that I\u2019m reluctant to extend, but the limit of balloon technology is about 20 miles high, whereas the \u2018edge of space\u2019 is about 60 miles.  For whatever reason several balloon experiments talk about reaching the \u2018edge of space\u2019.  I disagree with the terminology, but bow to convention.  However you define it, we\u2019ll reach for the practical limits and aim for ~100,000ft (30km).  We\u2019ll stay there as long as we can.  We\u2019ll have our webcam running and you should be able to see the blackness of space, perhaps some stars, the curve of the Earth, and a helluva view \u2013 straight down.  We\u2019ll have to do this somewhere off the East coast; perhaps on a boat. (Winds blow from West to East in America).  That way the Tethered Tower is out over the ocean, away from air traffic.  We\u2019ll keep this system in place as long as we can\u2026 and we\u2019ll test it to its literal breaking point.  We\u2019ll do our best to recover the system, but it\u2019s unlikely.\n$500,000\nLife Support:  Look, eventually we\u2019re going to space\u2026 to the Moon.  It would probably be a good idea if we had some basic understanding of what it takes to keep a person alive, right?  O.k., that\u2019s not going to happen on $500k, but we can do basic tests like plants and such.  (No, PETA folks, we\u2019re not sending up a kitten or monkey to freeze to death.)  Since cold and oxygen will be our biggest problems we\u2019ll want to ensure that we have lots of sensors, heaters, and thermal insulation.  Perhaps we\u2019ll test this on some tropical flowers that will wilt/freeze if we get this stuff wrong.\n$3,000,000\nFeasibility Study:  Obviously, we\u2019re pretty sure this plan of ours is \u2018feasible\u2019.  But there is a lot that we don\u2019t yet know.  I spent more than a decade working on the Space Elevator, but we\u2019ve only been working on the Lunar system for about 10 months\u2026 I\u2019m often quoted as saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t even have all the questions, yet, let alone all the answers.\u201d  If that is true of Earth\u2019s Elevator, it is especially true with the Lunar Space Elevator Infrastructure.  To that end, we need to gather (back together) a group of some of the smartest folks I\u2019ve ever encountered \u2013 the team of world-class experts that form the core of the Elevator community.  We need to assign problems, and give them time to work on this stuff.  At the end of a year, we\u2019ll finish with a set of three deliverables:\nGo/No Go Decision \u2013 Build it or don\u2019t build it (there is no \u2018try\u2019!)\nLibrary \u2013 ~500 Independent Research Projects, and ~1500 Technical Documents reviewed and assembled.  This is the documentation, and results of the questions we need to answer - before we proceed with the Lunar Elevator.\nPath Forward \u2013 Specific Plan on how to build the Lunar Space Elevator Infrastructure  or a Detailed Analysis on how to get to the point where it\u2019s possible \u2013 if there is still required technology development.   \nHere's some other resources we thought you might be interested in:\nInternational Space Elevator Conference kicks off in Seattle this weekend.\nMoonAndBack has a nice set of video interviews with me.  The second video specifically talks about this Kickstarter effort.\nAnd our YouTube and Flickr channels of some of our past robots and tether experiments. (That Flickr is my personal account.

As the \"gadgette\" navigates him from destination to destination, he must learn to abandon his need for nurture and stability, and find happiness outside of his comfort zone, in order to finally find love in the real world...with a little guidance.\nThis film is an ambitious project, that started as a small spark of an idea, and has developed into a complete tale about love, life, and happiness. And a robot.\nThe film has a projected budget of approximately $10,000, and I am using this campaign to generate at least a portion of that, and hopefully more, with your valued support!\nSome examples of things that are essential to creating this film from scratch, telling this story, and bringing it to you, my audience, are as follows:\n- Several locations around the Los Angeles area, including a large, vacant office space, a fully-functional bar, an outdoor city park, and an electronics store, cluttered with old and obscure electronic devices.\n- Props and wardrobe that make the vibrant characters and environments on paper come to life.\n- Transportation and food for the hardworking and invaluable cast and crew by my side.\n- Generating the awesome rewards that will be reciprocated to all those who help us make this film a reality!\nI genuinely believe that this film will speak to people from all walks of life - young or old, male or female, happy or sad - because we have all felt the strange pain of love, and the jittery anxiety of attraction. It is familiar to everyone, yet unique enough to capture your attention and make you smile.\nMy goal for this project is to take a simple idea that many people have often thought about, or wondered \"what-if\", and transform it into a visual story that anybody can watch when they're feeling down, or lonely, or just wanting to share a quick laugh with friends and family. That's where YOU come in!\nYour generous support will go directly into this project, and every little piece of your contribution will make a big difference in turning this little dream into a large, beautiful reality! \nPlease do not feel that your contribution is too small. To give you a better idea, think about this: something as simple as a clothespin can attach an orange light gel to a bright light, and turn the \"boring conversation on a couch\" into the \"intimate moment by the fireplace\", simply by playing with the color of the light!\nThank you for your support, and please drive carefully!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 2, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1764347263/recalculating-0", "project_name": "Recalculating..."}}]
