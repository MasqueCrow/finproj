Lindsay developed her techniques in her hometown of Mariemont, Ohio, weaving basic thread into unique pieces. After graduating from the textiles program at RISD in 2010, she moved to New York City and continued her concept-based binge knitting. Lindsay launched her mostly unisex line DEGEN in 2011, becoming well known for her fresh take on knitwear.\nDEGEN & friends in Paper Magazine\nThis year, the premiere babyDEGEN collection was conceptualized and brought to life after much testing and swatch making. babyDEGEN combines the fun-quirky fabrics of DEGEN with wearability, durability, and tiny sizing just for babies ages infant to 24 months. As Lindsay says in the video above, babyDEGEN came from wanting to make knits precious. And what is more precious than a baby? Lindsay hopes her pieces will be that item of clothing that is kept as a fond memory for when your baby becomes a teenager and adult.\nbabyDEGEN in WWD\n\u201cMy main mission is to keep the \u2018cute\u2019 in children\u2019s wear. There is a trend to make children\u2019s sized adult clothing. Why not keep them cute?\"- LD\nbabyDEGEN prides itself on the craftsmanship and integrity of each piece. The DEGEN studio is located in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where pieces are knit on hand operated knitting machines as can be seen in the video above. We use the softest high quality yarns, to ensure the comfort of you and your baby. This yarn is also very durable and can easily be washed in a machine (but never put in a heated dryer, same as most wools). \nbabyDEGEN is proud to be knit in America.\nphoto by Hanna Agar\nWith the recent launch of the babyDEGEN website, we have found that there are certain materials and finishing touches that need to be integrated in to our process. We strive towards being able to easily produce, ship, and share all of our products. This Kickstarter will give us the extra funding to make babyDEGEN an efficient online store and company.\nWhat this Kickstarter is funding: \nYarn: Of course the most important part of a knitwear line is the yarn. babyDEGEN uses the softest high quality yarns perfect for snuggling with baby. Part of this funding will go towards purchasing these high quality yarns for this season and next season.\nBulky Machine: At the DEGEN studio, we currently have four 7 gauge hand operated knitting machines. In order to make knit pieces using chunkier yarn, we would like to invest in a bulky knitting machine. This will add to our textile development and range of knit weights.\nPhoto: Since babyDEGEN is mainly available online, we would like to have a small set up in studio to easily take pictures of new babyDEGEN products. This will involve purchasing a digital camera, some sort of small white background, and lighting.\nLabels: We would like to get custom labels made so that each garment can have the correct sizing, cute babyDEGEN logo, and a hang tag with washing instructions.\nShipping: We would like to have custom packaging printed for the babyDEGEN items, including small sock boxes and colorful packing tape. This will further the fun experience of getting new babyDEGEN products in the mail! To ensure shipping accuracy we would like to buy a scale to weigh packages before shipping them. We also need to purchase a new printer because the one we have only works when it wants to.\nWebsite: This past August the babyDEGEN website was launched thanks to the amazing Zak Greene. Part of this funding will go towards maintenance and up keep of this awesome website as babyDEGEN grows.\nphoto by Hanna Agar\nRewards:\nWe have a range of fun and exciting rewards for babies, parents, and those who just want to help. Below are some fun examples of the rewards that are being offered, but be sure to check them all out!\n#2 A 5 pack of babyDEGEN postcards, printed with original sketches of the collection drawn by Lindsay Degen herself.\n#3 One pair of babyDEGEN sockies!

After those needs are fulfilled, some of the challenges that we face are machine maintenance and quality control. Since we are people working in a studio and not automated machines in a factory, mistakes can happen. Sometimes you work on a piece for 3 hours and find out you have to remake it because of a small mistake. When this happens we try to find what caused the error and fix it before starting again. Sometimes it is simply human error, which can happen to anybody. If we receive a large volume of orders that we are not prepared for we will have to deal with production delays and risk upsetting our customers.\n\nThe main obstacle we face is working to build a community of loyal customers. We are new to the diverse customer that is associated with babyDEGEN and since we are mainly based online, it is important to understand how this demographic uses the Internet. We have already begun to tailor our presence by creating an Etsy store and promoting the #babyDEGEN tag. Hopefully we can attract customers who will rep babyDEGEN even after their own baby has grown up.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "WE DID IT!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "One More Day!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "5 Days to go!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Special T-Shirt Desgin Revealed!", "update_content": "As promised, the design for our special Kickstarter T-Shirt is here!

Let's surpass $60,000 and I'll include a behind-the-scenes booklet for every backer at $80 or more.\nHello there! My name is Cameron, and I re-imagine buildings and structures as if designed entirely with type, such as the Roman Colosseum and the Salt Lake Temple. These are sold as letterpress printed posters, and I've been fortunate to ship hundreds of copies to friends in more than 30 countries.\nThree years ago, I convinced myself to visit Brooklyn for the first time to study one of the world's most stunning bridges. I immediately fell in love.\nThe Journey\nTrust me, I didn't intend for this project to take three years. But I don't re-imagine structures without an intense amount of research. Several trips to the bridge for photography and filming. A thorough reading of David McCulloch's \"The Great Bridge\", a 562-page tome on the history of the bridge and the major players of the period. An exhaustive search for typefaces that were designed or in use during its construction from 1869 to 1883. And so forth.\nAt last, I settled on the following photo, which allowed me to capture the entire bridge while showing the beautiful details of the stone, wire, and Gothic arches:\nDuring one of several trips to the bridge, I captured this photo. Eventually it became the blueprint for the artwork.\nThe Artwork\nThe completed piece will be letterpress printed by Bryce Knudson of Bj\u00f8rn Press in Provo, Utah, United States. And that's where you come in.\nAssuming we can pull it off, because everything fits so tightly, the artwork will be printed with two colors instead of one. Bryce has printed my first two pieces, and if anyone can pull it off, it's Bryce. He's as nuts about details as I am.\nThe final artwork will be 24\"\u00d716\", printed on Crane Lettra Pearl.\nPress colors for this piece will be carefully selected to match the granite and limestone used to construct the bridge. Yeah, I actually took a Pantone book on the bridge to get color samples. Crazy, right?\nThe artwork is designed in Illustrator, and it's incredibly tedious. Some sections can be copied and pasted, but 70-80% of the characters you see in the artwork are positioned, sized, and rotated one by one. I generally can do only an hour at a time, as my eyes (and brain) go bonkers if I stretch it out any longer.\nHere's a screencast of me at work, sped up rapidly:\nHere are a few close-ups from the artwork:\n And, because people often ask if I hide things in the artwork, I've hidden a metric ton of stuff in this one: \nJohn Roebling's name, hidden in the artwork.\nThe last names of those who died during construction of the bridge are also hidden throughout the artwork. Here you can see the names of Burns, Donahue, and Johnston.\nSome of my favorite locations in Brooklyn are also embedded in the artwork. Here you can see One Girl Cookies, Bien Cuit, and Nu Hotel.\nRewards\nBack this project at $80 or more and you'll receive one of the first copies of this limited-edition artwork. Only 1,500 copies will be printed. \nYour copy of this artwork is protected with a 1mm polyethylene bag, rolled, and shipped in a 6\"\u00d724\" heavy-duty Kraft tube. Please note: If your order is shipping to Europe, especially the UK, you may be required to pay customs fees to retrieve your poster.\nFor those who aren't prepared to purchase a poster just yet, please consider backing this project at the $10 level. I'll send you a thank you card printed on the same paper as the poster, individually signed.\nLetterpress Printing\nIn a nutshell, letterpress-printed pieces are a thing of beauty. The artwork is transferred to a polymer (or metal) plate, and the paper is pressed into the inked plate. The texture is palpable, as seen in my Salt Lake Temple artwork: \nLetterpress detail in the Salt Lake Temple poster.\nWill it arrive in time for Christmas?\nThat's my hope, and I think it's very possible if the project is successfully funded.\nThank You\nDanke. Honestly. This has been a wonderful journey, albeit arduous at times. Your appreciation of this artwork means everything to me.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause I've not yet done a two-color piece, it is unknown how the press will react to the tight registration of the artwork. However, I've consulted with Bryce Knudson (printer) on a couple occasions, and we both feel it's very feasible.\n\nSome backers, such as those in the UK, may have to pay customs fees to retrieve their reward. (For shipments of my previous two pieces, UK customers have reported customs fees as high as \u00a330\u201340 in some cases.)\n\nBeyond that, the only other risk inherent in backing this project is possibly falling in complete love with the bridge, and subsequently booking an expensive trip to New York.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Thank you for the journey.", "update_content": "A few project wrap-up items are below the photo. \nWhat a ride it's been.

We're striving to make life easier for designers and developers and we hope you'll join us. Check out the video below to get an in-depth walkthrough on how Macaw works.\nFluidity comes in many forms within Macaw. Not only is the process of designing made fluid with Macaw's intuitive drawing mechanics \u2013 everything within Macaw is also fluid. The canvas is fluid; the grids are fluid; even the elements you draw are fluid. So, designing percentage-based layouts is made dead simple. Drag and drop elements where you want them and Macaw will take care of the calculations for you.\nMacaw is bringing popular development practices such as Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) to the design world. Save commonly used styles, apply them to multiple elements and edit them in one place with Macaw's Style Editor. You can even save complex components such as headers and footers in your library to reuse across multiple pages. Again, edit them in one spot and the others will automatically update.\nDeriving usable code from a design tool has long been thought impossible. Macaw unlocks the language of the web with its powerful design-to-code engine called Alchemy, which is programmed to learn as you design and applies the same logic a developer would use \u2013 considering things like applicability, specificity and semantics. Alchemy also provides an advanced workflow for developers looking to pull code that meets their personal preferences.\nIf we hit $200,000 we'll integrate a broadcast mechanism so you can preview your designs across multiple devices as you work! You'll be able to use your phone or tablet's standard browser and view the fully interactive pages that you're designing within Macaw. We'll even include a live reload so you don't have to hit that pesky refresh button.\nWe're two guys tackling a very large problem. We've been working on Macaw for well over a year now. We have a ton of Macaw already built, but it's an extremely complex app and we could use some developer muscle to help finish things up in a timely manner. Kickstarter funds would be used to bring in development resources for the following areas:\n1. Core development: Much of the core is complete. We need to round out a couple features and take the time to thoroughly test everything.\n2. Native OS X: We need to round out some application support mechanisms such as updates and feedback.\n3. PC version: We've been focused primarily on the OS X version, but can easily port it over to PC.\n4. User support mechanisms: We'll be deploying forums and developing a robust help section.\n5.

Our small team had met accidentally in San Francisco; and through our intense effort, trial, and error, plus a dash of \u201cdesign thinking\u201d, we eventually able to complete the film \u2013 with significant assistance from the Kickstarter community. \nIn the desire to make another great film, our team members have once again put aside their daily jobs and have been hard at work on this new project. Through our own savings we have finished shooting in San Francisco, Arizona and New York; gathering a wealth of informative interviews and interesting footage. Currently we have finished the initial production phase and are moving on to post-production. \nOur initial funds been able to get us a little over halfway to the final product, but at this point we still have to do editing, scoring, sound mixing, color correction, and graphics in order to finish the film. Then we will need to move into the distribution phase where promotion and marketing expenses will also require a significant amount of funds. \nYour support will help cover these expenses and increase the production value of the final product; ultimately assisting in spreading the exciting and inspiring ideas of the maker movement to as many as possible.\nOur Backer Map\nWe will be marking the countries/areas of our supportive backers, to show the world which countries are involved in supporting our project.\nFor our Backers with no countries listed, do not fret!

I'm the director of the documentary films Helvetica, Objectified and Urbanized. I've had the pleasure of having conversations with an incredible group of designers for these films. But while each conversation might last two hours or more, we only get to use maybe two minutes of it in the film. So if you've watched my three documentaries, you've actually only seen 3% of the conversations we recorded. That means there are almost 100 hours of amazing interviews that are still unpublished. So we're going to release the full text of these interviews in a book!\nThe book will include in-depth discussions with designers and thinkers like Paola Antonelli, Alejandro Aravena, Chris Bangle, Michael Bierut, Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec, Neville Brody, Tim Brown, Amanda Burden, David Carson, Matthew Carter, Candy Chang, Yung Ho Chang, Noah Chasin, James Corner, Wim Crouwel, Ellen Dunham-Jones, Tobias Frere-Jones, Experimental Jetset, Dan Formosa, Sir Norman Foster, Naoto Fukasawa, Jan Gehl, Jonathan Hoefler, Jonathan Ive, Hella Jongerius, Bruce Katz, David Kelley, Rem Koolhaas, Rahul Mehrotra, Bill Moggridge, Marc Newson, Oscar Niemeyer, Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, Michael C. Place, Rick Poynor, Dieter Rams, Karim Rashid, Alice Rawsthorn, Stefan Sagmeister, Paula Scher, Ric Scofidio, Erik Spiekerman, Davin Stowell, Jane Fulton Suri, Massimo Vignelli, Rob Walker, Hermann Zapf, and many more... over 75 of the world's most creative and innovative people.  \nMy approach to interviewing has always been to let the subject discuss whatever they think is important about the topic, and not make them simply answer a pre-determined list of questions. So I don't prepare questions in advance, and the result is that the conversations are fluid, wide-ranging, and fun. We talk about their creative processes, design philosophies, personal stories and background, and much more. But in the documentaries, we only used the bits that worked within each film's narrative arc. So if you enjoyed the films, now you can get the full stories and the full context. \nEven if you haven't seen the films, you'll be inspired by some of the most innovative minds on the planet, and you'll get a better understanding of how design affects our lives. Creativity, graphic design, typography, architecture, cities, technology, visual communication, product design, consumerism, transportation, street art, modernism, post-modernism, sustainability... they're all part of these conversations.\nThe book will be a high-quality paperback, approximately 400 to 500 pages long, and is being designed by our friend Michael C. Place and his cohorts at Build. \nBut the purpose of this Kickstarter is more than publishing a book, it's to edit, organize, and conserve these video interviews for the future. At some point we may find a home for all this footage at a design institution or organization, or perhaps create some sort of online resource. We want to index and archive these 100 hours of video in a way that can facilitate that. \nWe've got plenty of rewards for backers who become part of this project. In addition to the book and an eBook version, we'll be editing together one hour of the best of the unreleased video footage from all three films, sort of a mashup bonus movie, that will be available only to backers of this Kickstarter campaign. We've also got custom Design Trilogy Field Notes notebooks, and bundles featuring signed copies of the book and limited-edition photographs of designers in the films. And all backers will be the first to get details on my next documentary.\nWe want this book to be the most comprehensive design interview book ever published, an invaluable resource for designers, design educators, or anyone interested in the creative process. We hope you'll join us in making this happen.\nCheers! -Gary\n-----\nSome nice things about the project have been written in Fast Company, Slate, Gizmodo, Indiewire and PBS's POV blog. Give 'em a read. \n-----\nP.S. The book cover image is a photo of our trusty Rode NTG-3 microphone that we used to record the interviews for all three films.

That's how Simple Wallet was born.

The M2057 pieces come in one of two gorgeous Italian fabrics that have a high-tech quality, but still feel soft and luxurious against the skin.\nLiquid: The \"liquid\" jersey flows and moves like water, for silhouettes that embody a chic but effortless style. Most of the dresses made from the liquid jersey have a \u201csecond skin\u201d slip that \u201csmooths out the bumps,\u201d so you never have to worry about clingy fabric.\nForm: The heavier, \"form\" jersey keeps a shape while still maintaining an incredible softness. With this fabric, I was able to design silhouettes that are a little more architectural and urban. Because of the thickness, you never have to worry about transparency issues, even in the light \u201cAvalanche\u201d shade.\nI'm happy to say that the entire M2057 collection will be made in the USA at extremely reputable factories in Chicago and New York.\nColors\nLiquid jersey garments available in all colors\nForm jersey garments available in Black, Cargo, Avalanche, and Midnight\n\u201cKickstarter Red\u201d\nAlong with a palette of lovely shades that will travel from spring to summer to fall, I'm excited to offer the liquid jersey pieces in a special \"Kickstarter Red\" exclusive to my Kickstarter backers, which I'll retire once the Kickstarter ends.

With Kickstarter, not only can I give women beautifully designed dresses for a great value, but I get this unique opportunity to connect directly with women and build a community. \nIt's also a responsible way to start a line: The fashion industry is littered with waste, but with Kickstarter, I'll only produce what backers want, and backers' choices will inform future collections. I find this an incredibly exciting evolution for the industry and how it works. Moreover, in keeping with both Kickstarter and M2057 values, the collection will be manufactured in the USA at some of the country's most reputable, responsible factories.\nWhat Happens at the End of This Campaign?\nA successful M2057 Kickstarter campaign means we can cover production costs, and will get to work fulfilling all backer gifts. It also means I can start designing and producing the next M2057 collection that I plan to launch in spring 2014.\nBacker Gifts\nI've got some fantastic backer gifts in addition to the clothing. If you're more into art than fashion, you can get a signed print of my \"Root Love\" painting. Every Kickstarter backer will also receive a signed thank you note from me on a frameable notecard featuring my artwork, \"M2057 Ginko,\" a painting I did that helped inspire the look of the entire collection. Additionally, all Kickstarter backers will be listed as special contributors on the M2057 website, and be given special access to online design previews of future collections.\nAt the higher levels, I'm offering some ways you can see what being a designer is really like: you can spend a day with me at my studio, or host a fashion party with me and 50 of your friends at one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, Sepia. \nPlus see the new backer gifts I've added, listed above!\nMy hope is that this is only the beginning! Thank you so much for visiting, and I appreciate all of your support!\nRoot Love, by Maria Pinto\nA Little More about Me\nI've always been passionate about designing, and I've been designing in one way or another for more than 20 years. For several years I owned and designed for a high-end store in Chicago, where I learned all about craft, quality, and high design standards. I closed my store a few years ago, but I never lost the love of designing unique and eye-catching fashion.\nClosing my store gave me the opportunity to explore the other side of the industry. I worked as the Creative Director for the department store Mark Shale, where I led the buying team and curated the women's fashion collections. This gave me the chance to talk to women in a way I hadn't before\u2014I got to listen to what they really needed in their wardrobes but couldn't find. It was a great experience, but I really missed designing\u2014I realized that I could create a collection that fulfilled women's needs in fashion.\nWomen want pieces that can keep up with their busy lives, make them feel beautiful and confident, have a high design quality and durability, but are still a good value. That was my inspiration for M2057 by Maria Pinto\u2014to create pieces that are extremely versatile, lasting, and chic. M2057 is really about the modern woman, and what she wants and what she needs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction + Timing\nBecause of the high quality fabrics and designs I'm using for M2057 by Maria Pinto, production will require 5 months from the end of the Kickstarter, hence the March 2014 ship date. \n\nFulfillment + Delivery\nAs an experienced designer, I'm very aware of the challenges associated with manufacturing. I have contracted some of the country's most reputable factories to ensure that all orders are met and shipped on time. Production and shipping dates will also be dependent on how quickly backers return ordering information, but I've built in extra time for information collection to guard against delays. If a high volume of orders or other unforeseen circumstances arise that may cause delays, I will communicate directly with all my backers and work to fix the problem. My customers' happiness and enjoyment of this experience is most important to me.\n\nExchange Policy\nIf you're not happy with your clothing purchase you will be able to exchange it for a different size.

No worries! Head to http://www.studioneat.com/products/neaticekit to order a Neat Ice Kit.\n  Hi Kickstarter! We're back with a new project, one that we think you will really dig. Especially if you take your at-home cocktails seriously.\nWe both love making cocktails at home, whether it's something simple like a Gin & Tonic, or something more fancy like an Old Fashioned or Mint Julep. One thing that has been missing though, and is often overlooked, is the right kind of ice for various cocktails. That's why we made the Neat Ice Kit.\nFancy cocktail bars often have a dedicated ice program, where they use expensive machines to freeze large blocks of ice they then cut with chainsaws and ice picks. The result is beautifully clear ice \u2013 the holy grail of cocktail ice \u2013 but it's unattainable for someone making cocktails at home. Until now.\nWe wanted to create something that made it easy and fun to create beautiful cocktail ice, right at home. After months and months of prototyping, we've arrived at something we think is pretty great, and will add a ton of fun to your at-home cocktail making.\nWhat is included in the Neat Ice Kit?\nThe Neat Ice Kit includes:\n- An ice mold\n- An ice chisel, with built-in bottle opener\n- A Lewis bag, for making crushed ice\n- A wooden muddler, also used as a club with the ice chisel and Lewis bag\nIce Types\nThe Neat Ice Kit contains everything you need to create 3 distinct types of ice, which cover the gamut of cocktails.\n1. A big-ass, crystal clear ice cube. \nBreak the ice brick in half, and you have a perfectly clear cube. This is perfect for drinks like the Old Fashioned, where slow dilution is required. Plus, it looks amazing in a rocks glass. The \"cloudy\" half of the ice brick can be used in a shaker or stirring glass. \n2. Large ice chunks. \nUsing the included ice chisel, break the ice brick into chucks. These will work in any drink, and are especially useful in tall and narrow drinks like the Tom Collins.\n3. Crushed ice. \nWith the old school Lewis Bag and the wooden muddler, you can create the perfect ice for summertime drinks like the Mint Julep.\nHow Does It Work?\nScience, my friends. Using an insulated ice mold, the water freezes from the top down, rather than from the outside in. This pushes trapped air and impurities to the bottom, resulting in a brick of ice that is perfectly clear in the top half. As far as we know, this is one of the only products for producing ice of this quality at home.\nDesign Process\nThe Neat Ice Kit is the result of over 9 months of trying to figure out how to make clear ice at home. As the photo below indicates, we went through lots of prototypes, in every conceivable shape and size. Our wives have noted that our freezers have turned into \"science laboratories.\" We extensively researched the science behind water freezing and thermal insulation, and have learned a lot along the way. We are happy with the design we landed at; not only does it produce beautifully clear ice, but adds a lot of fun to the cocktail making process.  \nLots and lots of prototypes.\n  Manufacturing Plan\nWe have already reached out to several manufacturers to get quotes for the various parts that make up the Neat Ice Kit. The designs of the lewis bag, muddler, ice chisel, and silicone ice cup are all finalized. We are pursuing two different design options for the foam insulation piece, and have quotes for both options. This will come more into focus when we have a better idea of how many we need to produce. \nThe silicone ice cup is the only part that requires a mold, so it will likely be the piece that takes the longest to manufacture. All other pieces of the Neat Ice Kit are made using processes that don't require extensive tooling. \nAs you may have noticed, the estimated delivery date for the Neat Ice Kit is April 2014. This is a very conservative estimate, based on our past experience with bringing hardware products to market, knowing that things always take longer than estimated. However, if things go moderately smoothly we hope to deliver well before that estimate. \nAside from the ice chisel, every part will be made in the USA. If we can find a manufacturer in the US to do the ice chisel for a reasonable price we would love to do that, but so far our research hasn't found anything that would be cost effective. \nBecause we already sell and ship hardware products, the order fulfillment aspect is already in place; and if we end up needing kitting help (assembling all the pieces into the package to be shipped) we have already talked to a local company about their services. \nWhy We Need Your Help\nAs you can see, the Neat Ice Kit has quite a few parts, which have sizable upfront manufacturing costs. That's why we're here on Kickstarter. With your help, we'd love to make the Neat Ice Kit a reality, and bring at-home cocktails to the next level.\nThanks for checking out our project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo.

Thank you all so much! If you're in the San Francisco area, please join me in celebrating the completion of funding this evening!\nSee the collection as I scan it on Tumblr\nMore information at WalterKoessler.com\nI have a hundred page photo album with nearly a thousand photos my great-grandfather Walter Koessler took in World War I. It's in pristine condition, beautifully preserved by my family over the last hundred years in Southern California. They've even saved the negatives\u2013 untouched, crisp and unfaded \u2013and a box of stereographs from the war and the early 1900s.\nThis album is a real treasure. Trained as an architect and conscripted into the German Army directly from the classroom, Walter became an officer in the reserve artillery battalion and he took advantage of many unique opportunities to record his experience on film. He captured the haunting experience of building and living in the trenches, the sunlight pouring in through the broken windows of bombed churches, and the clouds through the wings of biplanes as an early aerial reconnaissance photographer. After moving to Los Angeles to work as an art director in films, Walter made this album. The story the book tells begins with a pack of young men playing at war and ends with their crushing realization of what war really means.\nThese photos have captivated me for nearly two years, even after paging through them hundreds of times. It's an unbelievable, rare and intimate story, a deep look into the first world war you can't find anywhere else.\nThe images deserve to be seen and appreciated in the context of their whole story. They're compelling on a digital screen, but having spent many hours with the originals, they are significantly better on the pages of a book you can explore as a physical object. If I can find enough supporters and meet a minimum order requirement for this ambitious project, I will create a book from this album at its original size with my notes in the margins so you can have this full experience with history too.\nSaint Quentin Cathedral, August 1917 (Walter Koessler) - October 2012 (Dean Putney)\n\"When Dean first shared this discovery with me, I knew he'd found a rare family history treasure \u2014 but I don't think I, or he, or anyone realized at first what a treasure of shared world history this collection would turn out to be. It's such an amazing story: a time capsule from an ancestor, finding its way to the hands of a young man who works in the digital world. I'm glad Dean is able to preserve it, and I'm happy to see it shared with the world.\" - Xeni Jardin, Boing Boing\nAs seen in:\nWhat I'm doing\nI want you to experience this part of our shared history. I've done a lot of research about the photos in this book and Walter's journey. I even went to France to attempt recreating the photo above. This project means a lot to me and I've spent a lot of time working on it.\nMy goal is to scan and archive each image in the book, make an annotated version of it in its full form, and share that with all of you. I've already begun this process by posting some of the pages and their photos on Tumblr. I also want to print these images in a book roughly the size of the original, with space for my notes and closeups in the margins so I can share my research.\nDigital images are neat because they don't take up space, you can zoom in closer than the eye can see, and they are easy to share. But the images in this book belong together, not separated or in a mishmash online. They deserved to be printed, held and spent time with. They're a priceless, rare look into forgotten age that you'll come back to again and again.\nThe book itself will be available in high resolution PDF form and as a high-quality offset printed, casebound 11\"x17\" coffee table book. I've rejected vanity press for this project because it's absurdly expensive at nearly $1 per page, and it greatly limits the sizes at which you can print. Each book would cost over $150 and the quality would not be worthy of Walter's work. I've begun researching the best ways to do photo printing, found a printer, priced it, checked paper samples, and begun laying out the book. These are going to be really beautiful prints, with a fold out page in the back for the large aerial panorama. A collector's item for sure and much higher quality than a vanity press could deliver. Here's a blank copy of the book's actual materials, this is the size and format I'm making it at:\nI need supporters to help me approach a 1000 copy minimum order quantity so I can move forward. When ordering a book from the non-early bird levels, you'll also receive a print from one of the book's photos.\nI'd also love to get people following along as I scan images so they can spot things I wouldn't normally see and share their expertise. The Internet has been invaluable in identifying military equipment, locations, people and much more. For backers $25 and above, you'll receive access to high resolution images of prints and negatives as I scan them so you can see my progress and pitch in if you'd like. Definitely get in on at least on this level, this stuff will knock your socks off.\nThe goal here is to have rewards dated for December 2013 in your hands before Christmas. I cannot guarantee that will happen (see Risks and Challenges section), but if I meet my funding goal I will do everything I can to meet this goal.\nI hope that this project will make you consider the stories in your life. How do you create and record new ones? How do you review the ones you've already made? How do you preserve the stories from your family? Go make those stories something you can share, can't ignore or forget, and want to spend more time with.\nHigh level rewards\nFor those of you particularly interested in early 20th century photography, military history or World War I specifically, I have some very special rewards for larger backers.\nStereoscopic View-Master\nWalter took fifty nine stereoscopic photos throughout the war. These show military equipment, biplanes, and possibly a crucifixion in 3D when seen through the proper viewer. I'm planning to make classic View-Masters and reels of the best ones to make viewing these images easy and fun! You'll also receive digital versions of the stereograms in anaglyph magenta/cyan and side-by-side formats. I'm expecting to be able to include four reels of six images for each backer here, but I may be able to make more if there are enough backers at this level. Here's an example of one of the 3D photos as an animated GIF:\nTriptychs or panorama\nThese photos are incredibly detailed, and as I've been scanning the prints and negatives I've found nuances and hidden bits you can't see in a small image. Walter took photos that tell stories, and I'm curating a few triptychs for this. These may change in the future as I find more negatives, but here are some mockups of possibilities. You'll receive options from me if you back at this level.\nTrenches\nChurches\nThe back of the book will include a fold out copy of this aerial panorama Walter took, with annotations of trench and front positions. This reward level will have an option to receive a print of this panorama instead of a triptych. The book board will be removed in this image.\nPrints from the original negatives\nI've started experimenting with printing photos in the darkroom using traditional photo enlarging and processing techniques from the original negatives I have, and the results so far are exciting. \nAs I work with these images, get better and larger paper, and learn more about enlarging them, these photographs are only going to bring you closer to the day they were shot. Walter's negatives are pristine and clear, and he took many wonderful photos. Printed large, they show details you just can't see with the naked eye.\nI won't be making many prints. The negatives are nearly a hundred years old now, and I'd really like to put them back in storage. But for the few of you who want a beautiful and rare art print from the original negative, this is a great opportunity to get one made for you. Few people have negatives from this era, and I doubt anyone besides me is crazy enough to actually print from them now. Sizes to be determined, but at least 8x10, and I will provide a series of images for you to choose from.\nVisit from me, showing of all the materials, and discussion\nI want to make these photos available for the hardcore enthusiasts to see first hand. It's so much fun sharing the story and images with people, and I could talk all day to the ones who are most interested. So let's do that.\nAt the highest tier, I'll fly out to your gallery, museum, club or organization with all the materials I have. We can spend a day discussing them and going through everything. I've limited this to five so that I can prevent undue stress on the album and materials, but I've priced it relatively low so that small but determined clubs still have a chance of organizing a meeting. Can't wait to meet you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter. It's been a long time in the making because I believe this is a deeply important thing to share and share right. Here are some points I expect may present challenges and how I intend to reduce the risk behind them.\n\nI have never written or published a complete book before. Fortunately I am getting excellent advice from print designers and publishers who do this regularly. Since I work for major online publishers (boingboing.net, Kevin Kelly and others), many of my friends have made books and print products before, and the printer I've chosen comes highly recommended by the publisher of Coilhouse Magazine, so I'm confident that I'm in good hands. I've already begun the layout of the book, received financial quotes and checked paper samples. I've set out a timeline from now until I plan to ship, and I'm ready to commit to it. I've given myself a substantial time buffer between each stage of the process to prepare for things going wrong.\n\nI expect shipping physical product to have some unforeseen hangups. I have first-hand experience in seeing this done, but I have not done it myself. I've consulted with experts in retail shipping to make sure my timeline and goals are reasonable. International shipping is particularly risky and troublesome, but I've already begun pricing it out and preparing for it. I am hiring help with packing and shipping once the books arrive to make sure this goes smoothly.\n\nPrinting large numbers of photos is new to me. I've priced this out, done test prints, and begun learning more about printing from negatives. I've got experience printing high quality photographs, and I've connected with SF Photoworks to print the reward images. I've done test prints at RayKo Photo and I'll be working with them to create the best traditionally processed prints from the negatives I can. I've been working with photos for years, but I've never printed them in large quantities, so this is an area I'm actively learning more about to get the best results.\n\nAlthough unexpected production challenges will undoubtedly arise, I've spent a year and a half and plenty of my own money on this already, and I will not give up until you get your rewards. I look forward to you joining me in reliving history through First Lt. Walter Koessler's photo journal of World War I.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "From Grandma's closet to the museum walls!", "update_content": "Dear friends,\nJust about all rewards have been shipped to backers!

We'll get all that once we're funded.\nThere are pictures at the bottom of this page and on our website and Facebook.  Let us know if you have any questions. Thanks for checking out our project and you're rad!\nhttp://www.newkitday.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/newkitday\nNew Kit Day\nOur Story\nNew Kit Day is the creation of Anthony Borba and Eric Chao. We both live and ride in the San Francisco Bay Area. Anthony has been racing bikes in Northern California for many years and Eric is an avid cyclist who is also an amazing designer.\nNew Kit Day brings fresh designs together with custom kit ordering to provide high quality kits for less than the other high-end bicycle clothing manufacturers.  The awesome part is that we use the same lycras, chamois and technical fabrics they use.\nWe make everything here in Northern California! \nPrinted in San Jose.  Sewn in Oakland.\nWhy Kickstarter\nWe are launching our first collection on Kickstarter with the hopes of growing our business and sharing our passion with riders everywhere. The funds we are raising here will go towards fulfilling this kit order and setting up the next kit order.\nIndustry Experience\nTogether we bring years of experience in custom bike clothing design and production. Anthony has been managing the design and fulfillment of his team's cycling clothing for years. Eric has been designing some of the best looking kits in the peloton.  We have worked with many of the vendors in the industry.  We know the good materials from the bad. \nNew Kit Day hand picks the lycras and high-end chamois for our bib shorts and wicking stretch-poly fabrics for our jerseys. The Chamois is fantastic; perfect density and without bulkiness.  It is truly an all-day riding chamois. More info and photos below.\nWhat's Next\nWe combine these great materials with awesome designs at reasonable prices because we are ordering on a limited edition basis and working directly with the riders. Essentially, we are creating custom order around each design. Since we fulfill each order the riders get awesome, pro-level gear directly without having to pay the mark-up.\nAll of our kits will made in small runs and they will be numbered. It will be a lot like getting custom made suit. Our kits are printed in San Jose and sewn in Oakland.  New Kit Day will publish a new design  about once a month and there will be a short early ordering period with freebies like t-shirts, stickers or arm warmers for the first 100 orders.  Once we have 100+ orders, we go into production and a few weeks later it's New Kit Day! \nEvery design that reaches 100 orders will also be available to reorder in the New Kit Day Vault.  You can catch a glimpse of some of our future designs at the end of our video.\nFabrics, Lycra and Chamois\nThe most important components are the materials. We'll let you in on a little secret: There are only a handful of Chamois manufacturers in the world and about dozen good Lycra/Spandex manufacturers.  We use a Cytech Chamois.  This is the same brand you will find in virtually all the high-end bibs on the market.  Here is our actual chamois.  It's same one you may be sitting on right now.  This chamois was chosen by a multiple time national champion road racer for his personal use.  We absolutely love it. \nOur bibshorts are feature a solid medium-weight spandex/polyester blend that has great wicking properties; so the shorts never feel heavy. The stretch-compression of the spandex is high and the pad stays in place.\nOur jersey is made from high stretch, wicking polyester and has great features like easy access, non-sagging rear pockets and a full length zipper. It also has a silicon gripper at the bottom, but not on the arm openings.\nThe Kickstarter Kit & Reward Notes\nThe first kit we are producing is detailed below.  You may notice some slight design variation between our snap-on form and the photos below.  The actual kit will be marked as Design #1 and will have the lightning bolt rear-pocket.  The Chinese characters on the kit translates to \"New Kit Day\".\nWe have a men's and women's versions of the kit.  There is a size chart below.  Both the women's and men's fit similar to other high-end brand likes capo, pearl and others but are not cut tiny like rapha. \nThe women's bibs come with a slightly different chamois than the men's (men's is pictured below).  The women's bibs also have a silicon gripper at the leg opening.  The women's jersey is a feminine cut.  Korina is wearing an x-small jersey and small bibs in the pictures.  She is 5'4\" and 120 Lbs.\nFor the men there will be two Jersey styles: Race Cut and Club Cut.  Club Cut is a looser version of the Race Cut, the sizing is the same.  The Bibs will come with the Chamois pictured below and powergripper at the leg opening.  Tony is wearing a medium Race Cut jersey and medium bibs in the pictures.  He is 5'10\" and 172 lbs with a 32 inch waist.\nOnce our project is funded, we will gather all the details like the cut, size, quantity and so on.  You will be able to order any combination of sizes per kit/color.  For now please just choose your reward and we will deliver a New Kit Day.\nBeautify The Peloton\nThat's our mission! Please help us out and get a great kit in return. If this Kickstarter is successful we can launch our next few designs in the coming months. We have some amazing kits coming soon. So join us and let's make it a New Kit Day!\nThe Rewards (in images)\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day\nNew Kit Day", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhy we are relaunching: We set a high goal because we needed to order enough materials to get the pricing we wanted. Since launching the project our vendors have a better understanding of our business plan and they are willing to extend the 'bulk' pricing to us on smaller orders. This is because they expect us to order another batch next month and the month after and the month after. Anyway, we convinced them that in the long-run we will get to the number we need. So that's basically it, we raised just under $13K before, so we set the goal there. Let's do this! \n\nThankfully our risks and challenges are fairly few and minor. New Kit Day is producing everything right here in the San Francisco Bay Area. We oversee the whole process. Here are some possible risks and mitigation.\n\nProduction Time - Typically is takes 4 to 6 weeks to produce and ship custom clothing depending on the number of other projects currently manufacturing at the facility. Since we have a professional designer our layouts will be production ready. We also handle the ordering process, so our deposits and shipping information will also be ready before production is completed. This should cut down on overall production time.\n\nMaterials & Chamois - We have samples of all the materials and chamois already and New Kit Day will review the actual kits coming off the line to make sure all the materials, workmanship and quality stay top notch.\n\nShipping - Our order will ship directly to the customer from the production facility with tracking information.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Our New Design is Available", "update_content": "Hey Kickstarters!\nThank you so much for supporting this project.

With these influences in mind we\u2019re creating an epic, replayable turn-based tactics game where you train generations of heroes to repel a demonic invasion.\nAnd with Kickstarter, we can do it. We have a great concept and team ready to go, and we want to work closely with our community to control the future of MASSIVE CHALICE free from outside interference.\nMASSIVE CHALICE is a single player turn-based tactics game within a multi-generational strategy campaign built for replayability.\nAs an immortal King or Queen, you must unite your kingdom under a powerful dynasty, eliminate the demonic threat, and reforge the MASSIVE CHALICE!\nThe game is structured into two main layers: strategy and tactics. In the strategy layer, you oversee your kingdom, arrange royal marriages, conduct research, and make the far-reaching decisions that will determine the fate of your legacy.\nIn the tactics layer, you fight brutal turn-based battles to defend your kingdom using small squads of customizable heroes.\nForest environment (early concept) - click for Hi-Res version\nPermadeath is inevitable: your heroes will grow, age, and eventually die. You'll have to choose between keeping your favorite heroes on the battlefield or retiring them from combat to foster a new generation of warriors.\nA Hero (early concept)\nDrawing from roguelikes we love, content is modular and randomized. Each playthrough begins with a random assortment of male and female heroes from various bloodlines, guaranteeing that each game is unique. Your knowledge and skill will increase over multiple playthroughs, but the details of every game will change based on your decisions and the whims of fate.\nStrategic map (early concept)\nCore Game Features\nYour story emerges as you defend against attacks, complete quests, and respond to randomized events in your attempt to preserve the kingdom.\nLine of sight and fog of war mechanics come into play as your squad explores beautiful dynamic 3D battlefields where danger may lurk behind any corner.\nDistinct, customizable heroes learn new melee, ranged, and arcane abilities as they age and gain combat experience.\nArrange marriage alliances to ensure your heroic bloodlines can handle any future combat situation.\nBattle alongside your ancestors by equipping your heroes with uniquely powerful Bloodline Relics.\nInvest your resources in forging new weapons and armor\u2014and gamble on polluting a bloodline by researching dangerous demonic artifacts.\n\nAnother Double Fine Kickstarter?\nLast year, you Kickstarted Double Fine Adventure, shattering records and bringing video games to the Kickstarter spotlight! Now known as Broken Age, that game is in full production and is already a beautiful and unique experience\u2014but the Broken Age team only represents a third of our multi-game studio.\nDouble Fine\u2019s goal is for all our teams to remain independent and responsible directly to their players. Kickstarting MASSIVE CHALICE allows us to maintain a pure creative vision, put out updates on our own schedule, respond to feedback without roadblocks, and release it all DRM-free.\nWhere are your stretch goals?\nThis Kickstarter is clean and simple. We\u2019re asking for the minimum amount to make an awesome game, and the game\u2019s scope will grow based on the amount of total backing we receive. There will be ongoing conversations with the community as new features are considered, so stay tuned and let us know what you'd like to see in the game!\nFor MASSIVE CHALICE we\u2019re getting back to basics and focusing on the project itself.

These will be released to the general public, but backers will also get exclusive access to high-quality HD downloadable versions ($50 tier and above).\nProject Lead: Brad Muir\nMASSIVE CHALICE is helmed by Brad Muir, creator of Iron Brigade, the fan-favorite tower defense mech shooter. A longtime Double Fine veteran, Brad served as a programmer on Psychonauts and a designer on Br\u00fctal Legend. Brad is a turn-based strategy and roguelike fanatic, and is the friendliest guy you'll ever meet! :D!\nDouble Fine Productions is an award-winning, independent game development studio founded in 2000 by games industry veteran Tim Schafer. Located in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market district, Double Fine is committed to making high-quality games with an emphasis on originality, story, characters, and fun.\nThe MASSIVE CHALICE team comprises artists, designers, and engineers who recently worked on Double Fine projects like The Cave, Br\u00fctal Legend PC, Dropchord, Middle Manager of Justice, and various prototypes. The crew is ready to work on something big. Something MASSIVE.\nThe Buddha Engine\nMASSIVE CHALICE is being developed with Buddha, our versatile in-house 3D engine first created for Br\u00fctal Legend.

We believe we can find a substantial audience for this unique combination of strategy, squad tactics, and multi-generational gameplay.\n\nMASSIVE CHALICE is still in its earliest stages, so its backers will join us for every phase of development. We're tackling a new genre for Double Fine, but building on our years of experience making games of all types with our own technology.\n\nGames are complicated and expensive projects, but MASSIVE CHALICE has been scoped appropriately for our fundraising goal. By targeting open PC platforms and relying on a modular game design, we can create a core experience and build on it over time. The more backing we receive, the more systems and content we can create, and the better the game will be!\n\nMost importantly, we're passionate about what Double Fine can bring to fantasy tactics games, and we're dedicated to rewarding our community with the best game possible.\n\nSo please support MASSIVE CHALICE, spread the news, and join us on our journey!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "MASSIVE CHALICE Boxes are ready!

I've won the Sundance Film Festival Grand-Jury prize twice - once for DIG! in 2004, and again five years later for We Live In Public.  Both of these films now reside in the permanent collection of the MoMA NY.  It\u2019s been a wild ride, and I have been blessed to shoot these stories and share them around the world. \nAnd the adventure continues:  My team and I have spent the last two years interviewing some of the most influential minds in technology for our web portal, A Total Disruption. I set out to do this, because I am fascinated by the people and ideas that are changing and shaping our lives each and every day. Tech innovation moves so fast that we\u2019ve struggled to keep pace with all the riveting content. We have managed to collect 300 hours of footage and put out 50 episodes so far.  And now we really, really need your help.\nI\u2019m asking for your support, so I can keep bringing you these vital stories, and enhance your experience with them in even more empowering ways.  This project has been super-punk so far, but we\u2019ve outgrown ourselves. \nWhy did I begin this amazing journey? Why am I passionately distributing these stories for free? Because I realized that we are living in the midst of the greatest revolution in human history, but the stories of this unprecedented era of innovation are not being told in ways that everyone can enjoy, understand, and connect with. And so I've turned my lens on this oft-intimidating industry, and its infinitely inspiring leaders, to empower all of us to get smarter and faster, together. By sharing our stories, we can all learn how to make our own visions fly, or figure out how to make a life doing what we love. There is an unprecedented opportunity right now, and I want us all to have the power and knowledge to seize it.\nSo far we\u2019ve interviewed over 100 captivating innovators and entrepreneurs. During the past two years, we chased down the best minds changing the world through technology, media and entertainment.

But that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg, people. We have over 100 additional interviews that we have yet to edit, and every day we learn about another dynamic innovation that requires investigation. IF we are successful with this campaign, we'll be interviewing Jack Dorsey (Founder of Twitter and Square) and other chief disruptors in San Francisco next month! \nHistory is happening around us right now, and we are determined to make sure that we capture it, and transform it into something we can all learn and benefit from. By supporting ATD, you will guarantee that we continue to produce at least one episode a week of groundbreaking tech innovation to feed the innovator in you.\nGOAL #2 - THE DATABASE\nWe are creating a never-before-seen repository for the stories of technology, as they unfold, accessible through one singular online portal.\nWe know a web series episode can only tell so much of the story. For every 5 minute video we produce, we film between 1 and 2 full hours of each subject as they convey a wealth of valuable information and insight. The solution: We will convert these hundreds of hours of interviews into a highly searchable database where all of the experience and knowledge of the biggest minds in tech will be at your fingertips.\nLearn in detail about every aspect of their experience from what motivates them, to their successes, failures, and everything in between. Tech fans, innovators, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, schools, universities, and historians will be able to plunder this knowledge database for years to come. It can become a time-capsule of the revolution we are still experiencing in our lives each and every day. \nGOAL #3 - THE NEW CEA SERIES - Season One: Amanda Palmer\nWho is Amanda Palmer? Not only is she an epic musician (best known for The Dresden Dolls), but she had one of the most successful individual campaigns on Kickstarter, raising over 1.1 million dollars to produce her next album. Wow! How did she do it? She harnessed the power of social media and the enthusiasm of her devoted fan base - not just for her art, but for her inspired mission to change the way the game is played.\nIf this campaign is successful, we will launch a unique new series called CEA (Chief Executive Artist), taking a look at innovators in the fields of art and music. We will begin by chronicling Amanda's next world tour - which is dedicated to playing for the fans that contributed to her unparalleled crowdfunding success. By leveraging technology to become a successful CEA, she turns the business into an art form in and of itself. Amanda's story is one everyone can learn from and reproduce-- a singular story that represents the larger zeitgeist in which we all live.\nOnce the series gets kicking, we will release these episodes on A Total Disruption every week - following Amanda's tour of house parties, Ninja Gigs, and many other disruptive events to be revealed. The more money we raise here, the further we can go - both geographically and in terms of number of episodes!\nShare This Campaign!\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/ATotalDisruption\nTwitter:  www.twitter.com/TotalDisruption\nThank You, Disruptors!\nI hope you will become a part of the documentation of the disruption, one of the biggest shifts in human history.

Don't worry, we've hit the goal we set, so no chance now of your pledges not being counted!  Here's the deal:  The original budget for this film was $125,000.  Can we make an awesome film for $60,000? Yes!!! And we're going to, thanks to you!  But while we have time, we're continuing to raise funds for marketing the film - getting it out to festivals, meeting with distributors, publicizing the project once it's finished.  It's a huge part of the process!  We're forever grateful for the opportunity you've given us, for your support that's allowed us to make this film.  Let's keep sharing it today and see how far we can go!  Above all else, again....\nTHANK YOU!!!!!\nTHE STORY \nOn Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, in a series of four nondescript brick tenement buildings, sits the Streit\u2019s Matzo factory.  In 1925, when Aron Streit opened the factory\u2019s doors, it sat at the heart of the nations largest Jewish immigrant community. Today, in its fifth generation of family ownership, in a rapidly gentrifying Lower East Side, it remains as the last family owned matzo factory in America. \nThis is place rooted in history and tradition, and not only in the sense that the recipe for their product is 3,000 years old.  The machinery still used here to bake and pack 40% of the nation\u2019s matzo is as old as the factory itself.  The owners still sit at their great grandfathers desks, declining to clear the drawers of the contents left by their forbearers.   They have, again and again, refused exorbitant sums offered by developers for their real estate, and resisted modernizing the facility, worried at the potential effects on their fiercely loyal workforce, made up of neighborhood residents and immigrants from around the world, many of whom have been working there for 30 years or more.  \nAnd yet, while in many ways Streit\u2019s may seem a relic from another age, they continue to thrive, consistently receiving more orders than they can fill. \nIn a neighborhood where the Jewish immigrants have long ago moved on, in a nation where progress and profits trump all else, where manufacturing has left the cities if not the country, where family businesses are bought out by giant corporations and workers move from job to low paying job, Streit\u2019s remains a Lower East Side institution, and a glimmer of hope for the American Dream. \nTHE FILM \nThis film, a feature-length documentary, will tell the story of Streit\u2019s - of the factory, of the family, of its workers, of its place in the rich history of the Lower East Side and in America.   It is a story of tradition, of resilience and resistance, of the perseverance of the Jewish people, and of immigrants of all faiths, so many of whom have found home in the Lower East Side, behind the doors of Streit\u2019s, or in the matzo they bake.\nThe film is being directed by Lower East Side-based documentary filmmaker Michael Levine, and produced by Michael Green (see the FAQ for more about the production team).\nWE NEED YOUR HELP! \nBy joining in our Kickstarter campaign, you can help us get this film made! \nAs you can see from the teaser, we\u2019ve begun production, and the experience has been amazing!  The owners of Streit\u2019s and everyone who works at the factory are extremely excited about the project, and helping out every way they can to help us capture their story.  \nBut to this point, the production has been self-financed, and that can only take us so far.  A feature length documentary is a major undertaking, and we need to raise money to complete the film (see the FAQ below to learn more about where the funding will go).\nWith your support on Kickstarter, and by spreading the word about the project, we will be able to finish the film and get the Streit\u2019s story out into the world.\nBE REWARDED FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nNot only will your pledge help us tell Streit's amazing story, but it'll get you some pretty nifty rewards as well... Posters of vintage Streit's advertising, the hats worn by workers at the Streit's factory (well, the same type of hat, we're don't plan on sending you a used hat unless you really want it), tours of the factory with the owners and the film's director, gift packages from Streit's, festival passes, and of course the finished film itself!  Check out all the reward levels available on the right...\nAnd for those outside the United States, while the rewards say \"Ships within the US only, we are happy to ship internationally!  Please just add $10 to your pledge for shipping, and send us a note letting us know that your reward will need to be shipped outside the United States.  Thank you!\nHOW DOES KICKSTARTER WORK? \nThrough Kickstarter, you can make a pledge to help us reach our funding goal, and we offer you rewards for your support.  If we reach our goal within our 45 day fundraising period, we receive the donation you pledged and you receive your reward. If our goal is not reached, no money changes hands and the film remains unfunded.  It\u2019s all or nothing! \nCAN WE EXCEED OUR GOAL? \nYes! In fact, as thrilled as we would be to reach our goal of $60,000, and as much as those funds will allow us to do, exceeding that amount would be of huge benefit to the production of the film, and to you.  And here\u2019s why\u2026 \nAs for the filming, we\u2019re not too worried about going hungry \u2013 we\u2019re in a matzo factory, after all.  But when it comes to licensing archival footage, music, and other materials, spending the time it takes to really edit a feature-length film, making the final product truly worthy of the Streit\u2019s mark of quality, the extra money goes a very long way, so we\u2019re setting our sights high! \nHOW ELSE CAN I HELP?\nThe most important part of a Kickstarter campaign (aside from reaching our funding goal, of course!) is getting the word out.  We\u2019re doing everything we can to let people know about the project, but we could sure use your help!  So, tweet about it, like us on facebook and post about it, tell your friends and family about our Kickstarter page.  Do you run a blog? A student paper?  The New York Times?  Get in touch!  We and the folks at Streit\u2019s are always available for interviews.  It all helps!\nGET IN TOUCH!\nHave a question that's not answered here?  Looking to do a story about the film?
