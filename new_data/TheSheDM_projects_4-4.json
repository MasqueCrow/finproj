[{"backer": "TheSheDM", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Mock up of the book. Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow. We'll also notify you when late pledges are available after the campaign.\n Tinkerer: $20 With this pledge you get everything the Whisperer gets, plus a full color PDF version of the physical game, including all of the art.

Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

A very kind person pointed out that our icon for the Warrior was almost identical to the modern icon used in Black Power messaging. This was entirely an error on my part. I used a placeholder mock-up instead of our final icon and we've since remedied that. You can see the actual icon for the Warrior in the current image on the Campaign page. The icon that was there previously was an internal use only illustration that was meant as a developmental reference and was never intended for print.  I apologize to anyone who was confused or concerned, and I truly hope there was no offense caused.  We have the deepest respect for our Black allies and our icon was always meant as a nod to them.

All the dinosaurs and other animals featured will be shown in a fantastical way based on real and popular culture. Like many other artists I've always had a huge affinity for dinosaurs, and while I am no paleo artist, I do my best to do justice to both the realistic and fantasy dinosaurs we know and love. This is a follow up of my Disappear Kickstarter from last year which featured animals recently, and currently extinct, and I thought what better way to follow that up than with dinosaurs! \n\nHow Does it work?\nIf you are new to kickstarter here is something you should know:\nWhen you back a kickstarter the money is not taken from you right away. It is only taken when the KS is fully funded and AT THE END OF THE TIMER. Which means not until February for this specific kickstarter!\nLike most pin Kickstarters the funds go directly into manufacturing and shipping. My last three Kickstarters I made sure to use all funds appropriately and make sure every pin was packaged well and was shipped correctly. The funds go to packing supplies, postage, taxes as well.\n\nWho am I?\nI am an enamel pin artist who has been working with pins as an art form for over 8 years. I have designed over 500 pins for various clients all over the world and am well versed in vector design and illustration. I also dabble in children's books from time to time. This is my fourth kickstarter of my own and was the artist for a friends kickstarter.  I hope you will help make it just as successful as the last! \n\nWhat about the pins?\nAll pins will be 2\" - 2.5\"  for the standard pins; that's why they're a little more pricey than most. Most pin tiers will unlock four pins: A main animal and a glow or special variant, and a mini pin and it's variant, a few tiers later on won't but will be bigger pins. If we unlock all goals more pins will be added until we reach 10 main creatures!

I'll put the 24 instrumentals that go with d20 into its download package (for the Digital Vinyl support tier and everyone who ordered the vinyl) and I'll put all the instrumentals into another package for everyone who pledged at Deluxe Edition or higher.\n\nAt $33K, a New Video\nLet's make a very nice music video for any track on d20 that hasn't already had a very nice music video! I'll poll all of you to find out which one we should make.\n\n\nThanks.\nI'm very keen to get this project rolling! It's something I've wanted to do for a very, very long time.

Each creature is presented like those you would find in a monster manual complete with lore, artwork, and the notes of the infamous demi-lich Zargoth.\nUnlike a traditional monster manual, these creatures are each designed not simply as foes to be encountered, but as companions to accompany players on their adventures.\n\n\nThe tome not only includes a myriad of new variant familiars for the find familiar spell, but focuses on creatures that can be taken as pets and companions by any class. These unique pets can be gained through new Feats, to become a core part of a character's identity -- both thematically and mechanically.  \nEach new feat gives access to a specific type or family of these new creatures. Some of these categories are very close to the traditional idea of a familiar; the Necromancer feat gives access to a wide variety of undead creatures that can be summoned by the find familiar spell in place of its standard options. Other feats give access to creatures that are very different from the traditional idea of a familiar; the Alchemist feat allows a character to grow strange alien creatures in jars and consume or release them for powerful effects. \nIn creating each of these feats and types of companion creatures, balance was as important to us as strong thematic elements. Each familiar has a unique power or ability and can help to define a character at any tier of play, from 1st to 20th level.\n\n\nCornered in the alleyway, a ranger backs against the stone wall as shadowy assailants advance. A low growl comes from the unusual dog at her side. She rests her hand reassuringly on its fur, and, in a swirl of blue mist, they are gone, bounding side by side along the city rooftops.\nThe bonded feat gives a character the ability to form an unshakable bond with a young creature, raising it as their own.\nExamples: Blinkdog Pup, Flailing Snailing, Displacer Cub\n\n\n\n\nAn artificer clicks a lens over her eye as she turns a delicate mithril tool, making a final adjustment to the ornate clockwork on her workbench. Warm amber light begins to glow in the eyes of her creation, a fox made of gears and sleek silver plates.\nThe Tinker feat allows a character to use artificer's tools to create clockwork creatures, each with a specific function and the unique ability to transform.\nExamples: Quicksilver Fox, Clockwork Spider, Bronzeback Armadillo\n\n\n\nA warlock treads carefully on the ancient stones of the tomb, buried beneath burning sands. Behind him walks a cat, its ancient bandages falling away to reveal a white fire in its eyes. In the darkness of the tomb, the ancient guardians recoil in the shadows as the ankh around the cat's neck glints in the pale light of its eyes.  \nThe Necromancer feat allows characters to use the find familiar spell to raise an undead minion as their familiar.\nExamples: Mummified Cat, Floating Skull, Ossuary Hound\n\n\nThe barbarian's cloak unfurls to reveal the arm he had told his companions he had lost in battle -- huge and grotesque, it writhes and pulses, a mass of eyes and gibbering mouths. With a great heave he grips the portcullis, and slowly begins to lift the iron bars.\nThe Symbiotic Host feat links a character to an aberrant symbiotic creature, granting them great powers at a horrifying cost. \nExamples: Gibbering Arm, Silent Lurker, Spine Worm \n\n\n\n\nA wizard careful pours a dark bubbling liquid from a glass vial into a strange jar. In the murky liquid of the jar a dark shape floats, suspended in the green fluid. With sudden speed, it darts through the fluid, tentacles and teeth, pressed against the glass.\nThe Alchemist feat allows a character to use alchemy supplies to grow creatures in jars, creating powerful and dangerous potions.\nExamples: Green Ooze, Sanguine Lampreys, Pickled Watcher\n\n\n\nIn a crowded market, a bard juggles a cascade of brightly colored balls to the cheering of a crowd. Her accomplice, a small, four-armed imp, moves nimbly through the throng,  alighting only to liberate certain treasures; a pearl earring, a gold signet ring, and a coin pouch almost as large as the creature itself.\nThe Devil's Pact feat enables a character to strike a bargain with a dangerous devil lord, gaining the service -- and vices -- of one of its imps in exchange. \nExamples: Thieving Devil, Feasting Devil, Flayer Devil\n\n\n\nWe need your help to bring Zargoth's Tome of Familiars to life. Funds acquired during the Kickstarter will go towards making a beautiful, full color, hardcover book. Money will be spent on lavish illustrations and a professional layout, as well as funding the actual printing of the physical books. The more support we can raise, the more content, additional material, and polish we can bring to the finished tome. We want Zargoth's Tome of Familiars to look good on your bookshelf alongside your collection of core books.\n\n\n\nUNLOCKED - Monster Sketches. Many of the creatures with alternate forms (a phoenix in its egg, a mechanical fox that can transform into a sword, a parasitic aberration that latches onto a host) will be given alternate art sketches to enhance their full color illustrations.\nUNLOCKED  - Bonded Race. We will include an all new race that begins the game bonded to a powerful familiar that shares their soul.\nUNLOCKED - Magic Items. We will add a section of magic items, specifically designed to interact with the familiars in this book. Includes artwork.\n$35,000 - Artificer\u2019s Dungeon.

Neoprene Playmats to make any flat surface a quality gaming table.\n2. Premium Bags for taking several options to game night with great style and protection.\n2. Lightweight Bags as a smaller sized option, meant for quick trips or a short night with friends.\n4. 2021 Weekly Desk Calendar with 53 beautiful board game photos taken by members of the community.\nThe Playmat is a premium play surface designed with the help of over a thousand gamers who participated in surveys and provided insightful feedback.\nWhether you're a casual or diehard gamer, there's no doubt this will elevate gaming experiences for you and your friends and family, at home or on the go.\nBased on survey data, it will come in two sizes:\n 3 x 5 ft (91 x 152 cm)\n 3.5 x 5.5 ft (107 x 168 cm)\nThe smaller size will fit on 75% of your tables and the larger size will fit on 45% of your tables. These two options should be a good balance between fitting on as many tables as possible, while giving you as much room to play as possible.\nAs an added bonus, the small size will fit in the play area of our affordable and available-for-purchase Jasper Board Game Table, and the large size is the same size as the Jasper's dining topper.\nExtra Thick Padding\n         Our premium Playmat is 5mm thick, a noticeable improvement over typical 3mm options. This makes it closer to a real gaming table feel designed to elevate your tactile experience. It's not just a pretty backdrop.\nInset Edge Stitching\n         The edge stitching really takes the Playmat from basic material to a fine product. We've also made sure the stitching has a lower profile than the rest of the mat, so it won't catch cards if they slide to the edge.  \nNo-Slip Rubber Backing\n         Few things are worse than a board sliding across the table and pieces falling to the floor. We've tested this. Trust us. The Playmat won't be sliding anywhere.\nEvery Playmat will come with a carrying case specifically designed for it. We want it to go with you to a friend's house, a community game night, a con, or a weekend getaway.\nI'm always a little skeptical of \"gift-with-purchase\" items companies use to increase interest, so it was important this wasn't just a cheap add-on. We've made sure the quality of the case matches the quality of the mat. The Playmat slides into the case easily and the adjustable straps make it comfortable to carry. We bet you'll end up using it even more than you think!\nWhy do I need a board game bag, you ask? We agree you could use a small grocery bag or precariously bungee-cord a big stack of games together - but wouldn't you and your games feel much safer with something made exclusively for them?\nWhen we first launched these bags, we had no idea just how much you'd love them and how important they'd be. From going over to a friend's house or even traveling (yes, this will happen again!), having a durable and padded bag has saved countless boxes getting lost or ruined and pieces exploding all over the floor or car. Now, with a bunch of real-life product testing, the Premium Bag is even better with upgraded shoulder straps and limited-edition colors.\nDurable water resistant exterior with reinforced seams \nRubber feet\nHeavy padding on all six sides\nMultiple compartments\nTough metal zippers \nSeveral options for different carrying methods\nDifferent situations (or hand cramps) call for different transport methods, so your new Premium or Standard bag is built for several options.  You can wear it as a backpack, secure it to your luggage, or carry it the good old fashioned way. The backpack straps even hide under the luggage handle slip so that everything is tucked away when you aren't using them.\nPremium Bag Bonus: A removable shoulder strap with heavy-duty metal parts and a padded strap.\nOne of the most popular requests  was to add more colors and we definitely agreed, so here they are: Ruby Red and Fern Green. These are limited edition colors so if you like them, now's the time to get them!\nPlease note, Heather Blue bags are not available in Europe for this campaign.\nYou're only as good as your weakest link, so they say. And whoever \"they\" are, they're probably right.\nWhich is why we're adding all metal parts to the Premium Bag. Now, the weight capacity has increased and you can be certain that you'll be able to carry any ambitious packing list.\nPlus, doesn't metal just look way better, and well, more premium?\nMetal parts!\nThe Premium and Standard Bags are both the same shape, but the main differences are the upgraded materials, colors, carrying options, and weight capacity.\n Fabric & Colors: Premium bags are made with a high-end soft-touch blue, red or green fabric. Standard Bags are made of a basic woven fabric and are only available in grey.\n Carrying Options: Premium bags offer a heavy-duty and removable shoulder strap. \n Weight Limits: Premium Bags are rated at 65 pounds for every carrying method while the Standard Bag handle is rated at 50 pounds for the handle and the backpack straps at 40 pounds.\n**Upgrade: The premium bags have been upgraded from our previous bags. They now have metal clasps and clips instead of plastic.** \n\"Chad really listened to his customers and his reviewers and went back to the drawing board and redesigned it and you can tell he is also a game player because he made the perfect game bag. Price point - perfect. The quality - for what it is, for what it does - it's a spot-on perfect.\"\nSometimes you don't need everything our Premium and Standard bags have to offer, so we're excited to launch a completely new and very affordable companion product, the Lightweight Bag.\nIt has the solid construction of our Premium and Standard offerings but is a bit smaller.\nFolds flat\nDual-layer water resistant fabric exterior\nWraparound handle straps to fully support game boxes\nI realized I needed this because grocery bags aren\u2019t built for games. The proportions aren't right for games to fit comfortably, no lid meant everything falling out in the car, there was no protection from light rain, and they weren\u2019t built for the weight.\nI also felt it wasn't quite appropriate to bring a big imposing bag when going to dinner with friends and they asked me to bring over \"just a couple of games\". \nPriced at only $6, its dollar-to-value ratio will definitely impress you!\nNote on weight limits: The Premium, Standard and Lightweight bag weight limits are based on factory testing. These bags are made for board games not for bricks, gold bars, or dirty laundry, so please use them responsibly. Weight limits also may vary depending on the weight distribution and how the bag is handled.\nOur 2020 Weekly-View Calendar was a huge hit (little did we know how many board games we'd actually end up playing) so we're bringing it back for 2021 with updated photos.\nThis is a feature-packed calendar that will include weekly gaming prompts, gamer profile cards, full year overview, 10x10 Challenge, weekly tracker, habit tracker, and space for notes.\nHave you seen some great board game photos that should be in the calendar? Recommend a specific photo (with link to original photo and/or photographer profile) in the comments section and we'll choose some photos to include! (assuming the photographer is on board).\nIt's basic business that if you're using someone's work, they should get paid. All photographers will be paid a royalty based on a percentage of calendar sales and will receive a free calendar. Each photo will say the name of both the photographer and game. \nAnytime before your items ship, you may cancel your order for a full refund, no questions asked.\nAnd when you do get your items, if you don't think what you ordered lives up to expectations, we'll also refund you 100% and even pay for return shipping.\nWe are quite confident you should receive your items by the end of December, before Christmas. There's also the possibility that, depending on your order, our inventory and fulfillment speed, you may receive your items as early as October (We'll caffeinate our elves and try our best!).\nNo additional duty or taxes will be due when your rewards are delivered to US, Canada, UK & European Union, and Australia locations.\nFriendly shipping means your package will ship from your own country or region. This is done to expedite delivery and eliminate taxes and fees.\nUS Friendly Shipping\nEU/UK Friendly Shipping (Will ship from Germany)\nAustralia Friendly Shipping\nCanada Friendly Shipping\nDo not manually increase your pledge amount to pay for the shipping now.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign in the Pledge Manager. You will get an email and an update from us after the campaign with instructions for the Pledge Manager. If you pay for shipping now, it will make things much more complicated during the Pledge Manager.\nBoardGameTables.com was founded in 2014 by me, Chad DeShon. I'm a gamer who wanted a nice table for playing board games and figured other people might as well.\nNow, in addition to selling high quality custom board game tables, BoardGameTables.com also sells a less expensive, some-assembly-required, solid wood table called The Jasper Board Game Table, and a line of quick but deceptively strategic board games.\nWe started selling board game bags for a similar reason. I needed something to carry my games in. No off-the-shelf options worked for me. They were too big, too small, or not protected enough.\nI published a board game calendar back in 2011, simply as a hobby, and sold 100. It was the first time I sold a product online, and it planted a seed of things to come; starting a business that would serve the board gaming community.  It's so rewarding to still be doing that.\nFirst: Choose the pledge level you want.\nSecond: If you want to buy lightweight bags or calendars, you will need to manually increase the price to pay for those.\nAdd $6 to your pledge for every lightweight bag.\nAdd $14 to your pledge for every calendar.\nYou can also add additional regular/premium bags or small/large playmats by adding $29/$46/$59/$69 to your pledge for each.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though this Kickstarter consists of several different products, I am confident we can deliver them on time.

Our differences make us strong.\nWith the Stonehaven Adventurers 2020 project, we are creating a variety of adventuring parties. Some will include variations of a single fantasy race, others will be a mix of different fantasy races. The parties will not all include the same number of miniatures becuase of the difference in the cost of production due to size, and not all of the parties will be included in the Core Set. Some are only available as add-ons.\nThe miniatures will be made in the USA. They will be cast in 100% lead free pewter (or polyurethane resin in the case of the dragon) and some assembly will be required. They will be sculpted on the standard 28 mm scale. Slotted round bases will be included with miniatures that are pictured on round bases.\nAnd now we present the Core Set:\nPictured from top to bottom, left to right: Grippli Warrior ($4), Grippli Samurai ($4), Kobold Archer ($5), Half-Dragon Wizard ($7), Pygmy Lizardfolk Rogue ($5)\nCold Blood Clan!

As the common room fills up with merchants and laborers, a few more faces stand out to Cyragnome: A man carrying a strange contraption who talks loudly about it's enormous value, an overconfident tiefling with a long bow, and a gang of half-orcs who are clearly working themselves up to some violence. \nIn addition to the Core Set, we've got some other stuff that is only available as add-ons. This is that stuff!\n\nPictured from top to bottom, left to right: Male Orc Fighter ($9), Female Orc Cleric ($9), Female Orc Archer ($9), Male Orc Wizard ($9), Male Orc Warrior ($10)\nThe massive mountain Orcs have formed an uneasy alliance with the mountain queen. Orc warriors, once feared and killed on sight, are now commonplace among the caravan guards and mercenary companies that come down from the northern steppes. (Party add-on cost: $37)\nThe Mushroom Folk have lived under the dark trees for as long as time has been counted. Mercurial creatures, they can change their form to best suit the needs of the coming day. Although many will prefer to maintain a single form, others will change form each night: from simple form to warrior form, or from spore form to mage form. Each form has its strengths and drawbacks.\nThe Mushroom Folk have interchangeable parts and can be assembled into thousands of different combinations. \nPictured from left to right: Seedy ($5), Mushroom Sporeling with Leaf Scroll ($6), Mushroom Warrior with Hammer ($8), Mushroom with Bean Blade ($6), Mushroom with Sweetgum Mace ($6)\nAdd-on: Mushroom Folk Subset A  (Party add-on cost: $25)\n Pictured from left to right: Mossling ($5), Mushroom with Beanbow ($6), Mushroom Snail Rider ($9), Mushroom Mage with Crystal Staff ($6), Mushroom with Maple Blade ($6)\nAdd-on: Mushroom Folk Subset B  (Party add-on cost: $25)\nPictured from left to right: Carrote ($6), Mushroom Druid with Oak Club ($6), Mushroom with Blowgun ($6), Mushroom Mage with Seedy Staff ($6), Mushroom with Thorn Daggers ($6)\nAdd-on: Mushroom Folk Subset C  (Party add-on cost: $25)\nPictured from left to right: Vinesnake ($6), Mushroom Warrior with Slate Sword ($8), Mushroom Sporeling with Satchel ($6), Mushroom Mage with Moon Staff ($6), Mushroom Druid with Briar Club ($6)\nAdd-on: Mushroom Folk Subset D  (Party add-on cost: $25)\n\n\n\nPictured from Left to Right: Porcupinecone ($4), Mutoe ($5)(Locked), Mushroom Warrior with Axe ($8), Mushroom Mage with Seed Fan ($6), Mushroom Sporeling with Stick ($6)\nAdd-on: Mushroom Folk Subset E  (Party add-on cost: $25)\nMushroom folk unlocked by stretch goals will be added to the Mushroom Folk Set.\nThe Reclining Dragon rests comfortably on your tabletop, awaiting delicious adventurers to walk into its jaws. Or you could barter with it, or whatever, he's pretty chill that way! \nThis dragon is big! It measures 105mm across and will be cast in polyurethane resin. The wings come unattached. (Add-on cost: $25)\nAs we hit these stretch goals, more miniatures will be added to the Core Set, Mushroom Set, and/or made available as add-ons!\nFirst up:\n\nWe reached $12,000! Cyragnome the gnomish swashbuckler will be added to the Core Set. He will also be available as a $4 add-on. Cyragnome is a fearless fighter with a flair for the dramatic. Many a bandit has had his knees bloodied by Cyragnome's flashing blade!\n\nWe reached $14,500! the Male Goblin Warrior will be unlocked and added to the Otker and the Mob adventuring party in the Core Set. He will also be available as a $4 add-on. Goblin warriors are fearless in battle. Often facing much larger foes, they often triumph through a combination of lucky crits and really bad attack rolls from lvl 1 adventurers!\n\nWe reached $17,000! The Female Goblin Ranger will be unlocked and added to the Otker and the Mob adventuring party in the Core Set. She will also be available as a $4 add-on. Ricochet the goblin ranger got her nickname by bouncing a bolt off a guard's shield and into another guard's exposed back. \n\nWe reachd $19,500! The Male Human Mad Scientist will be added to the Core Set and will be available as a $6 add-on. He's been tinkering with that handheld lightning cannon for years and he's reasonably sure it won't explode when fired . . . well, pretty sure any way. I mean, he wouldn't just be carrying it around like that with his finger on the trigger and everything unless he'd tested it first. Right?\n\n\nWe reached $20,000! The Female Tiefling Ranger will be added to the Core Set and will be available as a $6 add-on. Tieflings are universally mistrusted and occasionally feared, but Sen has tried hard to do the right thing, though it has often enough lost her both wealth and friends. Maybe she just never had the right friends?\n\nWe hit $20,750! The Mushroom Warrior with Axe will be added to the Mushroom Set and will be available as an $8 add-on. This guy means business. Warrior form is inherently tougher than the other forms, and mushroom folk will often take this form if they know a fight is coming in the next few days. \n\nWe reached $22,000! The Male Human Lordling has been unlocked and added to the Core Set and available as a $9 add on. The Lordling is still very much trying to prove himself to his father. He's not really a bad person, just self-centered, priveledged, and full of the overconfidence of youth.\nWe reached $22,500! The Mutoe will be added to the Mushroom Set and will be available as a $5 add-on. To create a mutoe, a mushroom person must carefully carve the figure as a single piece from a living oak tree. The final stroke of the carving blade separates the mutoe and imbues it with the consciousness of the oak tree from which it was cut.\n\nWe hit $23,275! The Mushroom Mage with Seed Fan will be added to the Mushroom set and will be available as a $6 add-on. This wind mage carries the chosen weapon of his order, using it to strengthen the summoning of his gales and dustdevils. \n\nWe hit $23,877! The Male Half-Orc Ronin will be added to the Core set and will be available as a $7 add-on. He's not a real samurai. He's clearly part of the peasant class, and everything from his accent to his brutal fighting method give him away as a fraud. You'd be a fool to say it to his face though!\n\nWe reached $24,500! The Spore with a Stick will be added to the Mushroom Set and will be available as a $6 add-on. Spore Form is ideal for travel, carrying messages, or for fleeing combat. When mushroom folk are defeated in combat, they revert to this form. \nWe reached $25,000! The Mushroom Druid with Glaive (Octopus Stinkhorn Head!) will be added to the Mushroom Set and will be available as a $6 add-on. \"Old Devil's Fingers\" they called him. But he showed them. He showed them all . . . by being really kind to everyone!\nWow! You scrolled so far!

Prohibition, the Constitutional ban on the sale of alcohol in the United States, comes into effect.... And business couldn't be better at the Little Daisy Cafe.\nBut things aren't what they seem. Atlas May, proprietor, uses the charming little restaurant as a front for his real cash cow; the Lackadaisy speakeasy, where flashing the club symbol from a deck of cards grants everykitty in-the-know access to more moonshine than they could ever drink. Life is good... Until Atlas is murdered in cold blood.\nNow, it's 1927. Mitzi, Atlas' widow, struggles to keep Lackadaisy afloat, as the patrons drift away and a skeleton crew of staff sticks by her side. Scrappy young musician/rum-runner Rocky Rickaby, his wide-eyed but tightly-wound cousin Freckle McMurray, and the endlessly resourceful and sharp-tongued Ivy Pepper, heiress to the quickly-dwindling Lackadaisy fortune, are forced to make do in a world of increasingly unfriendly competition, intent on shooting, smuggling, and conspiring their way back to a successful bar, against all odds. \nLackadaisy Cats has been running online since 2006, immersing its readership in a world of sepia-toned crime, adventure, action, and comedy. And now, it's ready for its next big move... to a screen near you.\nWhy a cartoon? Why now?\nThere's never been more interest in adult animation, with shows like Bojack Horseman, Big Mouth, and Primal capturing the attention and imaginations of millions of viewers. \nLackadaisy is an exceptional webcomic, but in her mind, Tracy has always pictured it as an animated film. It\u2019s a side effect, perhaps, of a childhood nourished on Looney Tunes, Disney, and Don Bluth features; a dream of sharing that living, breathing, musical version of Lackadaisy with its dedicated readership. But the when-and-how something like that could ever be achieved has always lacked an obvious ingress.\nAs the 20s dawn upon us again, with new animation tools and techniques available, with talented and excited artists on deck an raring to get to work, and with the internet eager for more independently-created media, the auspiciousness seems writ-large - splashed across an art deco picture palace marquee, if you will. \nNow\u2019s the time.\nThe Lackadaisy animated short proposes a 10-minute, fun-and-action-filled adventure, full of car chases, shootout, sass, and  un-requested violin solos. And with your help, we can make it happen!\nThe finished short will be available for everyone to watch!\nMeet the people in charge of (and contributing to) the project! \nA former game dev, illustrator and graphic designer, Tracy Butler began Lackadaisy after researching the history of her century-old Saint Louis home, and being inspired by her love of jazz music and 1920s aesthetics. Boasting over 1,600 backers on Patreon, Lackadaisy has been her full-time job for years, garnering a dedicated readership of thousands. As the creator of the comic, Tracy will play a role as co-director on the animated short, as well as overseeing art direction.\nFable Siegel is a veteran animation professional, boasting a resume that includes Titmouse, Starburns, the internet phenomenon Hazbin Hotel, and two Game Grumps Animated shorts, along with storyboard work for Cartoon Network (Ben 10), Stoopid Monkey (Adam Ruins Everything: Reanimated History), Warner Brothers (Wacky Races), Shadow Machine (F is for Family), and more, as well as being a board artist, animator, and designer for Six Point Harness (Like Share Die).  Brought onto the Lackadaisy animated short as a production manager, director, and producer, they'll be overseeing the project utilizing their years of professional experience and skill.\n Our awesome line-up of talent, in no particular order:\n Michael Kovach  (@kovox) as Rocky Rickaby! \n Belsheber Rusape (@BelRusapeVO) as Calvin \"Freckle\" McMurray! \n Lisa Reimold (@lisareimold)  as Ivy Pepper! \n Ashe Wagner (@TheQueenViking)  as Mitzi May! \nand SungWon Cho (@ProZD) as Mordecai Heller! \nCharacter Design\nTai (@corvidmonster)\n3D Modeling\nZachary \"Newt\" Nall (https://www.noneuclideandesigns.com/)\nStoryboard Artist\nAshley \"Kilomonster\" Green (@AshGMonstrology)\nSound Direction\nM.

Storyboards, animatics, a soundtrack, 3D models! Back at the Goodie Bag level and higher to grab all these cool bits 'n' pieces. The perfect backer level for folks who wanna see how the sausage is made. Higher levels even grant special thanks in the credits!\n ALL IN! Really wanna become an indispensable part of the project? Maybe even make animation history? The very highest tiers of support grant in-story cameos, personalized Lackadaisy-sona designs, original art from Tracy and the crew, and MORE. \n There's something available at practically every level of support!\n $85,000 is the minimum we would need to make sure this one-of-a-kind project comes to fruition. But in case we overfund, we already have some awesome plans to make this Kickstarter even better.\n\nAnd our final two stretch goals...\n\nWhatever you may decide, thanks for getting this far down the page, and reading all about this new venture!

Design your color scheme online and have your miniature sent directly to professional artists who will recreate your digital color designs by hand!\nWe are working with top-notch painting studios like Den of Imagination and Mixed Dimension to bring you high-quality display-worthy professional paint jobs that are true to your digital design.\nOur favorite painters will work from your saved color design, replicating your color scheme choices by hand-mixing paints to match your digital design.\nToken Maker Unlimited\nDesign and export unlimited custom \"tokens\" for use in your favorite virtual tabletop platform.

While we ultimately expect to reach our typical fulfillment speeds, note that orders placed during this closed beta may take several months for fulfillment as we ramp up capacity. Fulfillment will be gradual, as we work through orders in the order they are received. \nThis timeline is our best estimate, but we will open submissions and start shipping orders as early as possible. Note that, in the case of high order volume, order submission for both hand-painted and 3D printed color miniatures may be made available in stages, with priority based on time of the pledge. Backer reward redemption will be facilitated by digital voucher codes redeemable on www.heroforge.com.\nWe have been developing exciting new tools to fully utilize the most revolutionary 3D printing technology and hardware. It is a big job, but who better to do it than the makers of the original 3D printed custom miniatures?\nHigh-Quality Web-Based Rendering\nWhether you want to fully paint your design with a couple of clicks or hand-tune unique digital 'paints' to capture your character's aesthetic perfectly, we have you covered.\nWe wanted users to be able to do more than apply flat colors, so we looked to traditional, real-world painting techniques to inform our designs. Our rendering and UI has re-imagined classic techniques for the digital world. Replicate the beautiful subtlety of dry brushing, ink-washing's ability to add depth, and much more. Printed designs will include subtle shading and lighting within the color texture, making details pop and adding fantastic realism to your design.\n\nBy giving you the option to hand-tune highlights, low-lights, shininess, hue shift and more, we will give you unparalleled design tools and let you see a whole new spectrum of possibilities.\nCutting Edge Manufacturing Technology\n3D printing has evolved at incredible speeds, with new technologies emerging all the time. We're happy to say that this thrilling new print technology means that highly detailed, color printed tabletop minis are finally possible! \nHigh-tech, full-color 3D printers turn pixels on the screen into atoms in your hand!\nColor is produced by mixing a range of color materials on the fly, allowing for full, vivid CMYK prints with beautiful gradients and detail. This technology employs dissolvable support materials, removing the need for support sprues and allowing for smoother, more consistent surfaces than ever before.\nThis plastic is similar in durability to our premium plastic material. Faint layer lines may be visible on the surface of the figures, especially in strong direct light.\nOne-Click Color Schemes \nNo need to have an art degree or knowledge of color theory to have fun coloring your character. You will be able to quickly paint your character in seconds, using a wide range of artist-designed color motif presets so you can \u201ctry on\u201d a wide range of color schemes or use them as a jumping-off point for your own design.\nA Multitude of Digital Paint Options\nWe'll offer a library of artist-tuned paint options for a wide range of materials. Experience the coloring-book joy of turning a character from grayscale to full, rich color quickly and easily!\n We'll also offer the ability to \"mix your own paint.\" Customize more than just the color: adjust shininess, highlight, mid-light, and low-light tones, and more. Your hand-crafted digital 'paints' will be saved with your character, allowing you to revisit and tweak them to your heart's content.\nTons of artistically tuned options for every material, all at your disposal!\nFive years ago, Kickstarter's support allowed us to launch revolutionary web-based design tools for custom miniatures. Since then, we\u2019ve shipped hundreds of thousands of miniatures to dozens of countries around the world. We've continued to work tirelessly, adding content and working with the world-leading 3D printing service providers to deliver the latest and greatest technology--and the best custom miniatures on the market.\n\nSince our launch, we've expanded our tools and customization options. We've added over a thousand new parts, two dozen new fantasy races, and ever-improving materials in both plastic and metal. In 2019, we began adding fresh content every single week. \nTens of thousands of users have visited every \"Treasure Tuesday\" to see what we\u2019ve added from our ever-growing \u2018user wish-list\u2019 of content requests. And we're certainly not done yet! You'll even find several sneak-peeks at upcoming parts sprinkled throughout this very Kickstarter! We continue to develop new models for the site, prioritizing the most commonly requested additions. \nHero Forge adds new content every single week on what we call \"Treasure Tuesdays!\"\nWhy Kickstarter? \nKickstarter has been an incredible tool to help us connect with tabletop and miniatures fans. This direct connection has helped us work with our most passionate supporters and offers an avenue to hear about what features and content you'd like to see added. Your backing will help us in the process of updating our library of thousands of parts to support rich, in-depth color customization, and launch exciting feature additions sooner.\nThe Future of Hero Forge\n\n                       Hero Forge 2.0 will expand and enhance the design capabilities that Hero Forge is famous for. You can expect us to continue our tradition of innovation, setting the bar for customization and artistry for custom miniatures. \nPreview just a few of our planned additions and advancements in the hero featured in our splash image: XL epic wings, dynamic and detailed bases, magical weapon effects, and cute new companions represent just some of the exciting new features we have planned, so even more people can design their perfect miniature.

Established in 2014 after the runaway-hit Hero Forge crowdfunding campaign, we continue to grow our cutting-edge web-based design application and explore the latest in 3D printing manufacturing. \nSpecial thanks to Fantasy Grounds for letting us feature screen captures of their virtual tabletop program, Kraken Dice for providing the dice featured in our photography, Izzy Gramp for color design, and Kate Elliot at www.kvephotography.com for editing our Kickstarter video.\nWe are lucky to work with incredibly talented artists all over the world, and would like to thank them for their contributions to Hero Forge. In particular, for their creativity and dedication, we would like to thank Glenn De Leon Garza, Ilya Bondarenko, Roman and Vadim at ZugZug Art, and Rich Carey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Will reaching your funding goal distract you from adding new content? Color is great, but I want more stuff on Hero Forge too!\nA: Our modelers\u2019 time and effort will still be dedicated to new content, parts, fantasy races, and features, even as our tech development team works on color at the same time. With independent, focused effort by our art team, we anticipate accelerating additions to the site, even as we add our new color features.\n\nQ: Will I be able to redeem my reward for an \"XL\" or mounted \"XXL\" figure?\nA: For simplicity, we have set rewards for our standard size-range, unmounted figures. If you prefer to redeem your reward's value towards a more expensive XL or mounted figure, that's alright: we will apply your pledge value and you can pay the difference. Pricing on larger-sized XL and XXL figures is TBD.\n\nQ: I saw a part or feature in your video which isn't on your site yet! What's the story?\nA: We have new parts, features, and content in development constantly. In order to keep up with weekly content releases, our art team works diligently on future releases, both those near completion and ones much further away. If you don't recognize any particular parts on this page, chances are they are in development and will appear on the site in the future!\n\nQ: When are you going to add X part? Will Y feature be available when color launches?\nA: We process all feature and part requests through the following survey, so please feel free to fill it out to have your request added to our official user wish-list: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HeroForgeRequest. Our user request wishlist has many hundreds of unique entries, so we cannot provide estimated dates for specific additions.\n\nQ: Will Hero Forge 2.0 be backwards compatible?\nA: Yes! All of your existing characters and saves will be fully compatible with our new tools. You will be able to revisit old designs and add color.\n\nQ: Will digital download .stl files be available in color?\nA: No. Not initially, at least. File formats which support color are less widely supported by 3D printing software platforms, as color is not yet common for home 3D printers. While we expect to one day offer textured, color 3D model files, for the time being we will continue to distribute digital download model files in .stl format: the most commonly supported format for 3D printing software platforms.\n\nQ: What Printer are you using for your color prints?\nA: We plan to manufacture full color prints using the Mimaki 3DUJ-553 full color printer. We have experimented with a wide range of color printers, and have found this technology to offer the most vivid color, cleanest gradients, and best quality at miniature scale. At Hero Forge, we are always exploring the latest and greatest materials, and have historically added to or updating our material options as 3D print technology improves--this is always a possibility for the future.\n\nQ: Do I have to use all my rewards at once, or can I order figures one at a time?\nA: Backer tiers include one instance of shipping. If you'd prefer to redeem your backer rewards one at a time, you will simply need to pay for any instance of shipping after the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1x 3D Printed Color Mini", "descp": "Receive Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on a full-color, 3D printed tabletop miniature!\nINCLUDES:\nCustom FULL-COLOR 3D PRINTED miniature\nGet early access to full color design tools\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17,577 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1 Year Access to Token Maker Unlimited", "descp": "Get a full year of access to the new Token Maker.\nINCLUDES:\nGet early access to full color design tools\nReceive 1-year access to the Token Maker Unlimited\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["834 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Print and Paint Yourself", "descp": "Receive special Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on 10 digital download .stl files for 3D printed tabletop miniatures!

Go to the Reaper Pledge Manager to see how much you should add. You can always add more to your pledge later, but only money added right now during Kickstarter will count towards unlocking future stretch goals!\n We've taken the Core Set and broken it into smaller chunks, so if you want a specific miniature you can just add the amount shown to your pledge and select it as a reward in the Reaper Pledge Manager.

Each stop along the way unlocks more fun!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\n!! VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ !! \n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion.\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates.\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change/subtract or add a piece to a specific model.\n4) The bulk of our Kickstarter will be made in China. A tariff in excess of 50% or a ban on Chinese imports would seriously delay delivery and/or, in a worse case, shutdown this project entirely. If such an event occurs early on in this project, refunds (less charges and expense payments made) might be possible. If it occurs later in this project (after almost all expenses have been paid) there would be little and possibly no refunds. \n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment against loss or damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that helps us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays that are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and dock yard labor strikes are examples of delays out of our control. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to back it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nAlso we reserve the right to modify any model or piece of a model shown to meet cost and production requirements. Modifications may include the removal or addition of new parts to a model. \n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored.\n\nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by August 31, 2020 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after August 31, 2020.\n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after April 30, 2021) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit.\n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery. These include, but are not limited to: import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant and taxing authorities, VAT and GST due and delivery acceptance, brokerage and collection charges.\n\nYou are required to provide correct address information and ensure this address is deliverable by normal methods before your rewards are shipped.\n\nYou must have your address correct and up to date in the Reaper Pledge Manager when we announce shipping is beginning. You may change it at any time until then. There may be a shipping surcharge associated with changing countries.\n\nRewards returned to us as undeliverable will be shipped again postage prepaid by the Backer.\n\nALL OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIS KICKSTARTER WILL BE VIA KICKSTARTER UPDATES ONLY.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wave 2 - United Kingdom (NOT Europe)", "descp": "2019 Bones 5 PLEDGE LEVEL This reward level pledges enough to get you into this Bones 5 Kickstarter.

But not any miniatures. Our expert team of Gnome Wizards work tirelessly to bring the most customizable and powerful figures for your character. Our sleek, seamless, flash-less miniatures are unrivaled in appearance and each is blessed by a team of Clerics. \n    Can\u2019t find the perfect miniature for your Dwarven Fighter?  \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Are the only miniatures available carrying a broadsword instead of a warhammer? \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Is the figure\u2019s beard too short for your perfect avatar? \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Through dark and forbidden rituals, we have given you, the player, the ability to select everything about your character. Complete customization is now in the hands of the player. Whatever hands, head, tail, wings, clothes, weapons, and practically anything else you can think of, we can do. Even the most mundane of coin purses will look amazing on your character \u2013 through our high-quality 3D printing.  \n This project combines everything you want from a miniature - the original creative art, with the best quality that can be found for a customized unique printed miniatures.\n*Warning: Miniatures may contain bonus Experience Points \n     The Eldritch Foundry has partnered with the leading US 3D printer manufacturer, 3DSystems, and our in-house printers utilize the most advanced technology available on the market. As such, we are printing at a quality that is substantially higher than anyone else. We print at about 40% higher definition than anyone else on the market.\nMost miniatures currently available on the market are printed at around 50 microns. An Eldritch Foundry miniature is printed at around 32 microns. In addition, we use wax supports. This process means your miniatures will have no flash, no mold lines, and no seams. \n       Our character creator interface is like nothing you\u2019ve seen before, except perhaps in video games. We have developed a one-of-a-kind character creator to a look and feel that closely resembles the character creators in Baldur\u2019s Gate, Planescape, Torment, or even Skyrim (well, at least the starting bit). The interface is intuitive and easy to use, while providing for a maximum level of customization for your miniature.\n    Each and every character choice, from race and class, to armor and weapons, has a unique lore associated with it. We have partnered with several brilliant writers (most notably- the amazing Patrick Stuart!) to create a lore that is as unique as our character creator. \n    This process, from the unique character creator to the expansive and in-depth lore,  makes creating a high quality and custom miniature more immersive and helps create a world-building experience.\n       We have developed the first and only conditional marker base for your miniatures. This base allows for the quick and easy identification of conditional statuses of your character, without the need for conditional rings or milk jug rings. The conditions available on your unique Eldritch Foundry miniature base include poisoned, restrained, concentration, deafened, petrified, grappled, blinded, and frightened. We have even provided conditional marker bases that are blank, if you prefer to draw your own. We\u2019ll even have an option where you can choose which conditions you want on your base (but that\u2019s a bit more down the line).\n      In order to bring you the finest quality miniatures, every piece is first individually drawn by gentle hands of our Tiefling concept artists. Then, these sketches are animated, given sentience, and turned into 3-dimensional models.  Our miniatures are then crafted from these models by an expert team of Gnome Wizards. This process is designed to bring you the highest-quality, unique, and magically enchanted miniatures possible. \n      To bring you more, we must first provide offerings to the lords of darkness and miniatures, who enslave hapless concept artists for no less than 99 years. These concept artists provide us with all the exquisite art, in order to bring the most realistic and beautifully rendered miniatures to you, the player.  Through this project we intend to bring you more items, races, mounts, perhaps a campaign setting, and even a little thing we think of as \"the bits box\".\n       The Eldritch Foundry's founders are gamers, like you. We would like to let gamers take their character from the imaginary and make them a reality. To provide miniatures of the highest quality, both in the form of the model and in the quality, while using the latest in 3D printing quality available. More than that, table-top gaming is a community experience. As such, we provide services both with online sales and through friendly local gaming stores.  \nEnjoyable and intuitive site - for the quick and easy customization of your characters.\nUnique and original craftsmanship -of all the items, armor, weapons, clothes, and accessories your character will ever need.\nBuilt-in status indicator bases - for quick and easy identification of character status' \nNew origin lore written for Eldritch Foundry - making the character creation process much more immersive and interesting. \nQuality 3D printing - showing the finest detail available on the market, exactly as designed by you, the player.\n      The Eldritch Foundry, a group of nerds and geeks dedicated to bringing the most unique and customizable miniatures available. We are committed to improving your games. And we are enthusiastic about our mission.\nThe Eldritch Foundry loves the TTRPG community- and acts on it with a business model that is geared towards helping your local gaming store thrive. We incentivize foot traffic by offering free shipping if you send your avatar to your local gaming store. We share in every miniature sale made within store grounds, and for every miniature sent to stores.\nRetailers- feel free to reach out, we'd love to discuss this in person!\nOur partner FLGS, Knight's Watch Games:\n  \"Eldritch Foundry is a revolutionary company that bridges the gap between producers, retailers and customers.  The ability for a customer to design, purchase and pick-up their customized miniature at the brick and mortar store facilitates better relationships between buyer and seller, guarantees a better shopping experience, and higher customer satisfaction. The immersive process of personalizing a character and reading the powerful descriptions for the various options makes building your dream character super entertaining!\" - Brenda and Paraic Mulgrew of Knight's Watch Games\nThe Eldritch Foundry is a firm believer that the TTRPG community is just that- a community. We strive to work with everybody- from stores, to local artists, to gaming streams, and beyond. As such, we've begun partnering with the D4 D&D stream (go check them out!) to provide their gaming miniatures.\nWe've also started working with artists from the community which we love- first and foremost- the Griffon's Saddlebag (you can see his Retaliating Shield on some of our minis, even!).\n      Based on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all.\nUS shipping (to your local gaming store)- FREE!\nRest of the world - shipping will cost $10.\n What is the Eldritch Foundry?\n      We are two friends, who quit our day jobs, and founded Eldritch Foundry. We provide miniatures of the highest quality, both in the form of your miniature\u2019s model and in the quality, while using the latest in 3D printing technology available. This process will give your miniatures a sleek, seamless, flash-less appearance not available in any other product on the market.\nHow do the miniature coupons work?\n      All rewards for \u201ccustom miniature coupon(s)\u201d are presented as coupons, and as such, are good indefinitely. This allows you to redeem at any point and even for future releases and features.  \nWhen will the Miniatures Ship?\n      Tricky question! Our full Character Foundry will be up and running August 1st, when we debut at Gen Con. We are currently gunning for a weeks turnaround (1-2 days to print, 3-6 days of shipping in the US), but a two week turnaround is a bit more likely (especially if we have a huge backlog). \nIt should be noted that we will be adding more and more items, races, weapons and\u2026 stuff(?) as time progress, so if you have a specific idea for your mini, look up our development schedule on our site!\nWhat about international shipping?\n      Shipping to the US is free of charge. Shipping to Western Europe is going to add about 10$ on top of your pledge level.\nHow do I select more than one pledge goal?\n     In Kickstarter you can only really select one pledge goal, but no worries. If none of the pledge levels are just right, pick the one closest to what you want, and you can adjust upwards later in our backer kit. \nRetailers - What are the typical cost of an Eldritch Foundry miniature in a retail store?\n      Our current pricing point for a single miniature is about MSRP 35$. The conditional marker base should add another 10$ on top of that.

As such, we have a hard deadline to have our character creator site up and running by August 2019. With this in mind, our current plan is to launch as soon as possible, with various additional features being introduced later on in the development phase. These additional features, which are being considered non-essential for initial launch, are thus marked down as a phase 2. For example, these additional features consist of features like \u201cbits\u201d purchasing and social media sharing with cool filters are lower on our priority list.\n In all regards, development of the product is largely complete with high-quality highly detailed miniatures. This project is intended to raise capital in financially reasonable way.\n\n\n2) Asset creation:\n\n Our asset creation timeline is very much dependent on how successful the Kickstarter campaign is. Our current funding is enough to let us reach Gen Con 2019 with an already assembled asset library of high Fantasy weapon and armor sets, and the base races of Humans, Elves (& half-Elves), Dwarves, Goliaths and Halflings.\n The greater our success, the faster we hope to add additional assets and features to the system. However, there is an upper limit to how fast we can add additional assets, while still maintaining a high-quality of production. We will have a production schedule posted on our home website once we see how far ahead, we are. This will allow Eldritch Foundry fans to come and see new products and plan ahead for when their favorite race and genres come online.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "",

It's about polyamory and queer families and safe havens in a world that wants to hurt us. It's about seeing problems that others refuse to solve and taking the matters into our own hands. In this game, we will take on the role of the titular Dust Wardens, people bound together by a force called Limerence which allows us to draw upon potent magical powers.\nHow does it play?\nDust Wardens has a similar structure to powered by the apocalypse games, with the caveat that there are no playbooks, and it uses a tarot deck instead of dice.\nCharacters in Dust Wardens have four stats:\nGuts measures your forcefulness and how comfortable you are enacting your will on others.\n\nGlamour measures your dramaturgy and how comfortable you are putting yourself on display for others to see.\nGuile measures your cunning and how comfortable you are manipulating others.\n\nGive measures your tenderness and how comfortable you are acknowledging other people's struggles.\nWhen you do something that corresponds to one of the Basic Actions or would be cause for a moment of tension, you draw a number of cards equal to the stat that most closely aligns with the action being taken. The outcome of your action is determined by the value of the highest card drawn:\n2-5: You suffer a major setback and don\u2019t accomplish your goal.\n6-10: You succeed at a cost or face a difficult choice.\nFace: You succeed, gaining exactly the outcome you wanted.\nAce cards and Major Arcana cards are special cases:\nAces: You succeed, and activate a special ability based on the Ace drawn.\nMajor Arcana: When you draw a Major Arcana, something weird and magical happens. Additionally, if the card is upright, treat it as a face. If it's reversed, consider it a 2. Interpret the card as a group, and decide on its consequence together.\nAdditionally, you'll swear Vows to each other at character creation. These inform your party dynamics, and are also a crucial part of creating your Coven together. Your magic is powered by love and trust, so upsetting the balance between members of your Coven may have dire consequences! On the other hand, if you work together and hold each other in your hearts, even miracles are possible...\nSo what's the money for?\nDust Wardens is, essentially, complete. It's currently on its seventh revision, and is awaiting contractor writing, some layout work, and a cover. Primarily, the money from this Kickstarter will be for paying for that labor, as well as ordering and shipping physical copies of the game.\n$750: kickstarter fees and \"just in case\" money\n$250: self compensation\n$1500: budget for contractor writing and layout\n$1000: producing and shipping the Zine Edition through Strikethrough Press\n$2000: producing and shipping  the Book Edition\nAll money beyond that which is needed to pay for contractors and fulfilment will go to myself, because I need to pay rent.\nWhat are your rates?\nAll contractor writing and layout will be compensated at a rate of 40 cents per word.\nStretch Goals\nFor every $1,500 beyond the goal, all contractor rates increase by ten cents a word.\nWho's on the team?\nMy name is Nora Blake (she/her & zi/zin), and I'm a podcaster and game designer and one half of Happy Rebel Tapestries! I have been working on Dust Wardens for just shy of two years now, and I'm very excited to bring it to the public eye! \nHere are some examples of my work!\n Facade, a Sparked by Resistance RPG about vampires and the pressures they live under in a society that marginalizes and exoticizes them\n Seeds of Rebellion, an anti-fascist RPG of emotion and memory magic\n Delver by Happy Rebel Tapestries, a surrealist dreamscape RPG of meaning-making and dungeon crawling\nI've also contributed to a number of RPG Kickstarters in the past, including:\nThe Hunted playbook from Interstitial: Our Hearts Intertwined by Riley Hopkins\nThe Zalmoxis playset from Thirteen Demon Princes by Taylor LaBresh\nThe Fallen playbook from Exodus by Erika Shepherd\nI'm also joined by a number of fantastic contractors!!\nNatalie the Knife (she/her) is a tremendous designer with an eye for delicate and specific writing. You may know her as the other half of Happy Rebel Tapestries. She'll be contributing a chapter about safety at the table and what it means to keep each other's wellbeing in mind when we sit down to play together.\nSasha Reneau (they/them) is a spectacular artist and designer who excels at stirring and evocative language. You may know them as the creator of Spindlewheel. They'll be contributing a tarot glossary to help interpret Major Arcana cards at the table and make sure your game stays weird and magical even if you don\u2019t know tarot!\nErika Shepherd (she/her) is a wonderful writer and designer whose passion and earnestness are a constant inspiration of mine. You may know her as the creator of Exodus. She\u2019ll be contributing a chapter about road trips and vulnerability and what it means to put yourself in the hands of your companions and the people you meet along the way.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne way or another, the game is coming out.

It envisions an utopian enclave hidden so deep in the wilderness that it is considered forbidden territory. The tribe is focused on preserving an ancient magic with the help of gods and dinosaurs. Be the first to explore it!\n\"Bloodsail Island\" is an established line of ruthless ogre pirates. Upon discovering the Temple of Serpent they have became overpowered by the desire to plunder its treasures. They are going to need every hand on deck for this one, so the line is getting a massive extension! \nOur products are in 28mm scale and come with square bases. Check rotating pictures at the bottom of our campaign to see all the details. All miniatures are made from high-quality resin that ensures highest details, durability and flexibility. \nBased on our Kickstarter experience and community feedback we have came up with the simplest Reward System to date. You can choose one of the following pledges.\n***UPDATED - Now every backer that pledged at least $1 will receive a free .STL file with the Dwarven Swashbucklers. 4 amazing miniatures for 3D printing!\nDeckhand Pledge is for you if you are not sure what you need but you want to be a part of the campaing. It will give you the access to the Pledge Manager where you will be able to spend your additional funds on any miniatures you want. \nBasic Pledge is for you if you do not want to pick a side. It is really simple. You plede $99 and you receive $99 to spend on addons. But on top of that you will choose and receive either a set of Serpent Freebies OR Ogre Freebies. The more SG we unlock the more value will come with those freebies packs.\nIn Captain Pledge you become the commander of ogre pirate army! Pledge $199 to get Captain Krabor in special offer for $40.

In order to get them you need to choose Basic Pledge and pledge $117 (3x $39) for it. This will allow you to spend that $117 in Pledge Manager and choose 3x Raptor Riders. On top of that you will be able to choose a set of freebies (either Serpent of Ogre one).\nExample 2: You want Captain Krabor, 3 units of Sharkman that are $39 each and 5 units of goblins that are $12 each. In order to get those you should choose Captain Pledge and pledge $217 for it. In this pledge Captain Krabor is in a better price and you will also get $159 for other addons. You need 3x $39 + 5x $12 = $177 so you need to pledge $18 on top of the pledge price to cover everything. \nIn case of any mistakes, there will be no problem with make a correction. You will always be able to add funds in the Pledge Manager via PayPal, so if you do not pledge enough through Kickstarter, you will still be able to get everything you need after the campaign ends.\nShipping will be charged in the pledge manager after our campaign ends.

The only problem is, nearly all of the tastiest snacks are unhealthy. And when we turn to healthier snacks, most of the choices are bland and taste like cardboard (we're looking at you, kale chips!).\nWe've worked for over two years to bring to life a snack without any tradeoffs. To do that, we had to throw out potatoes and tortillas and create a chip out of an entirely new base-- egg whites! \n As Featured In:\nWith notes of salsa and spice, our signature flavor combines the eggcitement of gourmet huevos rancheros with the convenience of a bag of chips. With only 2 net carbs per bag, it fits right in to the Keto lifestyle. Did we mention it'll get you jacked, too? Each bag of Rancheros has 10 GRAMS of protein. And as if that all weren't good enough, this flavor has 6 grams of fiber. If you watch your macros, you need some Quevos Rancheros!\n\nSour Cream & Onion, like all our flavors, is lactose free, but you would never know it! If you're looking for a delicious, creamy flavor with a hint of onion zest, this one's for you. Sour Cream & Onion has the same stellar macros as Quevos Rancheros-- 10 grams of protein, 2 net carbs, and 6 grams of fiber. \n\nA NEW FLAVOR LAUNCHING RIGHT HERE ON KICKSTARTER!\nFresh off the grill, this flavor provides the classic Barbeque chip experience. On the sweeter side but with a hint of smoke, this one on is a snack lovers dream! We pack in five grams of protein and five grams of fiber into every bag of Sweet Barbeque so you can indulge without any of the guilt of a conventional BBQ snack! \n\nThis flavor is also a NEW INTRODUCTION to the Quevos family specially released for kickstarter! Cheddar has the same macros as Sweet Barbeque, but with a strong cheesy punch. If you like cheese, order these, please! Incredibly, despite the powerful flavor on this chip, Cheddar Quevos are lactose free.\n The T Shirt (only available in select reward tiers)\nMost delicious snacks are cursed with one or more nutritional weaknesses. Often, they have artificial ingredients, high levels of sugar and unhealthy fats, and/or they're loaded with starch from sources like potatoes, corn, and white flour. On top of that, they're typically fried. And worst of all, most tasty snacks usually have deceivingly small serving sizes, making a quick snack into something close to a MEAL if we're not careful. \nQuevos were created as an answer to these nutritional problems. But we spent a painstaking amount of time making sure we didn't lose out on deliciousness as we crafted our product. After all, we wanted people to EAT our snack, not just think it was a cool idea! What we came up with is a revolution in the snack category. Quevos pack over twice as much protein and fiber into each serving than conventional snacks like potato and tortilla chips do. We get fats from superfood sources like avocado oil and chia seeds. Our chips are gluten free, lactose free, and soy free. Quevos don't have artificial ingredients, and they're not fried. And to put a cherry on top, each bag (one serving) is over 30 chips! Quevos leave you satisfied-- happy with a delicious snack and full and nourished from our incredible nutrient composition! \nAlso Contains: Milk (ghee)\nPlease note: Our facility also processes tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans. \nZack, our co founder, is type 1 diabetic and frequently cooks egg whites as a low carb snack. His favorite part of any egg dish he makes are the crispy pieces left in the pan. In June 2016, he was eating some egg white crispies and couldn't help but think about how they crunched and cracked just like potato chips. He wondered, \"Is it possible to make a chip out of egg whites?\" He saw the potential for a higher protein, lower carb, and overall more nutritious snack. So he called Nick (his best friend since age 9!) over and they began formulating in Zack's kitchen. \nJune 2016: First prototype batch. Our baby was ugly!\nThings got serious when Nick took the idea for Quevos and our early prototypes to the New Venture Challenge at University of Chicago. Ben, David, Nick, and Zack spent 10 weeks in a rigorous business development course that taught us about customer discovery, market sizing, financial projections, and creating a business plan. At the end of the course, we pitched to a panel of 19 investors who judged us against the 9 other teams in the class. We won first place, taking home $15,000 from the Booth School of Business.\nMarch 2018: We took this to the bank and they didn't accept it :(\nFor most of last year, our main focus was perfecting our product. We used our early seed funding to buy hundreds of ingredients, which we tried out in over a thousand different combinations. Plus, we experimented with different cooking processes at a pilot production lab we rented space in. To get feedback on each new version, we sampled with healthy snackers in gyms and health food shops around Chicago. Slowly, but surely, Quevos were improving.\nJune 2018: David, Ben, and Nick sampling product at the the IDEA Fit convention in San Diego\n\nFeedback on Quevos had become very positive by the fall of 2018 and we knew we were ready to go. Zack and Nick were working long days during the summer, and it was clear that we wouldn't be able to commit to both Quevos and our education fully. So we dropped out of college to work on Quevos full time! We found a commercial kitchen space, began production, and launched our market test around Chicago stores and online. It was tremendous to finally have a product in a package on a shelf. Our idea had become a reality! \nNovember 2018: What a crazy feeling to finally get Quevos on store shelves! @Freshii in Chicago\n\nThe reception of Quevos has been phenomenal, so much so that we sold out of our entire inventory in March. Now we are scaling up to produce at higher volumes so we can get our snack out there to every healthy snacker in need of a better option! We can't do this alone, though. WE NEED YOUR HELP to fund our first large scale production run so that we can make thousands of bags to sell online and in natural food stores around the country!\n\nMarch 2019: SOLD OUT!!\nSupport us! We don't want to live and work in our parents' house forever\n\nThanks for reading!! If you choose to support our growth, we really really appreciate it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are abundant risks with any startup company bringing a product to market. Thankfully, we have already gone through a good portion of them. We completed a market test over the last 4 months, selling online on quevos.com and in ten stores around Chicago. The reception Quevos received was fantastic, which is why we are scaling up our manufacturing facility and launching in earnest now. We need your help fronting the costs of a large production run we want to do in May. If all goes according to plan and we hit our goal in this Kickstarter, we will ship out your rewards in June!\n\nSince we need to buy new packaging equipment and that has a lead time between 3-6 weeks, there could be delays which cause our shipments to arrive at your door in July. But rest assured, if we hit our funding goal we'll go straight into squaring everything away for production and then start manufacturing bags of Quevos by the thousands!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "A few Quevos", "descp": "Try a 6 pack of Quevos!\nOptions:\n-Mix of our Keto flavors (Quevos Rancheros and Sour Cream & Onion)\n-Mix of our new flavors (Sweet Barbeque and Cheddar)\n-Mix of all our flavors\n(We'll ask you for your flavors later)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["786 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "International Pack", "descp": "The demand from overseas was overwhelming, so we lowered the international rates for THIS REWARD TIER ONLY!\n10 bags of Quevos.\nOptions:\n-Mix of our Keto flavors (Quevos Rancheros and Sour Cream & Onion)\n-Mix of our new flavors (Sweet Barbeque and Cheddar)\n-Mix of all our flavors\n(We'll ask you for your flavors later)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["147 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "More Quevos", "descp": "15 bags of Quevos!

He spent his time fine-tuning his craft and figuring out how best to convey a story. Nick moved to Portland in 2007. After years working at Barnes & Noble, he joined Katie's team to open Books with Pictures in 2016, first part-time, and then full-time.

Some of her favorite comics include Blue Monday, Giant Days, and Kiss Number 8.\n  Katie and the BwP Crew!\nThe building at 1401 SE Division St was built in 1927 to hold the Crucciola family's grocery store and butcher shop, with an outbuilding for keeping chickens just behind. Patriarch Antonio Crucciola passed away in 1946, but the neighborhood grocery carried on. By 1964, the building was in the hands of J.P. Wilder, who started advertising for shop workers and delivery personnel for his business, J.P. Wilder Company, repairing automobile brakes and clutches. The chicken coop became a machine shop, and the dirt lot was paved. The last ad for shop workers ran in 1968. By 1975 the building was tied to ads in the Oregonian for \"BOOKS BOOKS BOOKS.\" Since then--nearly half its life--this two-story wood-frame live-above retail shop has been a spot for literature.\n\n                             In 1976 the shop, Serendipity Corner Books, was purchased by Jean Bader and her friend and \u201csilent partner\u201d Frank Barst; it was already a \u201ccluttered old bookstore, then filled with empty soda bottles and sloppy stacks of musty books and magazines,\u201d Jean told the Oregonian. Serendipity sold used books, as well as both used and new comics, until 1986, when Jean moved to Lincoln City to manage a bookstore there.\n\n                             From 1985 to 1991, the shop was leased to Pegasus Books, the multi-branched comics chain that would eventually become Things From Another World. In 1991, Jon Hagen bought it and moved his decade-old store Longfellow\u2019s Books and Records there from its Moreland neighborhood location on SE Milwaukee. Longfellow\u2019s specialized in rare and antiquarian books, and also carried extensive runs of old magazines and rare folk records collected on Jon\u2019s scouting trips up and down the Oregon coast. For the past decade, Jon\u2019s son Nile had been helping him run the business, especially its online presence. In 2016, the Oregonian voted Longfellow\u2019s a \u201cuniquely Portland experience,\u201d and their \u201cfavorite bookstore.\u201d Jon died on Jan. 25 of last year, at the age of 80, and Nile put the building up for sale in the fall.\n\n                             Katie first spoke with Nile about buying it on November 6, Election Day: \u201cWhen Nile told me he was selling the building, I thought, \u2018there is no possible way I can do that.\u2019 And then I rushed home and called a bunch of people to figure out how to do it.\u201d She wound up forming the limited liability corporation Building for Books LLC, and bringing together about twenty friends and supporters to help make the purchase. Her plans for the space include not just a bigger, better Books with Pictures, but also a record store in the basement and a food cart pod in the parking lot. The new plans for this Building for Books touch on many of its roots: food, comics, books, music. But most importantly, it will bring new life to this beloved neighborhood corner.

It has been ruled for generations by the birdfolk who inhabit the Great Tree-City of Alderheart. Humblewood has endured for centuries thanks to the industry and compassion of its people...\n...but now the fires have come, and the Woods have been thrown into chaos. Flames ravage the land and destroy the homes of the humblefolk, stoking a growing resentment against the birdfolk, whose cities have managed to avoid the worst of the fires so far. Hatred burns in the hearts of those who have lost lives they cherished, and these once peaceful peoples now take up the sword and turn to banditry. The disaffected turn their gaze on Alderheart, and threaten to reduce an age of peace to ashes... \n...yet there is still hope. Even in these dark times, brave heroes can be found within the Wood. Only they can quell the raging flames that have been unleashed upon the land, and restore balance to the realm. Will you answer the call?    \nResidents of Humblewood\nThe Birdfolk \n\nThe birdfolk races have ruled over Humblewood from their canopy villages and fortified cities for as long as anyone can remember. Play as one of the five core birdfolk races:\nThe astute crow-like Corvum who safeguard Humblewood\u2019s knowledge\nThe dignified fowl-like Gallus who have faith in the power of community\nThe aloof pidgeon-like Lumas who use their gifts to bring joy into the world\nThe agile hawk-like Raptors who blaze new trails through the forest\nThe powerful owl-like Strig who defend what they believe is right\nThe Humblefolk\nThe humblefolk live in small villages throughout the Wood, but are occasionally found in birdfolk cities. Play as one of the five core humblefolk races:\nThe hearty deer-like Cerva who strive to achieve their goals \nThe sensitive hedgehog-like Hedges whose empathy lets them see what others cannot\nThe brave mouse-like Jerbeen who inspire those around them with deeds of heroism\nThe resourceful raccoon-like Mapach who can craft a solution to any problem\nThe cunning fox-like Vulpin who are always one step ahead of their foes\nThe Bandits\nOnce a loosely organized confederacy of crime, its ranks have swelled with humblefolk displaced by the spreading fires who have turned to banditry to survive. Under the guidance of a new leader, they seek to exact retribution upon the birdfolk cities and sow discord throughout the Wood.\nMonsters of Humblewood\nThe Oozes\nDeep within the murk of the Mokk Fields live several species of this most resilient life-form. Battle your way through caustic slimes whose touch is a deadly acid, sticky slimes that can suck a weapon right out of your hand, and the rare shifting slimes which feed on magical energies to become ever stronger. \nThe Beasts\nHumblewood is home to a variety of beasts whose size, strength, and abilities can only have grown thanks to the Wood\u2019s magic. Face craggy skinned mountain lions whose roar can summon rockslides, hunt the deadly forest prowlers in their woodland lair, and tangle with the giant sea monster (art coming soon!) in a battle on the high sea!\nThe Elements of Flame\n\nThe great calamity which produced the part of Humblewood known as the Scorched Grove also made the area an ideal home for fiery creatures. Withstand the searing heat of an emberbat swarm: a vortex of tiny flying creatures, each one a smouldering ember with wings! Confront the terrifying ashsnake and it\u2019s deadly pyroclastic breath! Legends say there may even be a primal elemental force lurking within the Scorched Grove.

It's a dive into pre-colonial Africa for all the rich lore you've never heard of. It's an exploration into a world where the majority of the faces are dark, yet isn't constrained to one corner. It's a world where women hold power equal to men and the merit of ones soul is what propels them through life. It's a world where spirits aren't to be feared, they are to be embraced. In a time where we know that representation matters, this project is an effort to add to that spirit in the way I know best. Narrative fiction in the nerdiest of flavors. \nSwordsfall is made up of three key parts; World Anvil, Tabletop RPG and Stories/Novels. Each of them telling a different part in the lore that is the world of Tikor. This Setting and Artbook is part of that synergy and the first step toward realizing the Tabletop RPG.\n For the Full Plan - Check out the Swordsfall Patreon\n Read our Feature in Kotaku!\nFinal Concept Piece for the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nThe Story So Far...\nIn the beginning... Tikor is a world where deities and spirits are as real as the nature that surrounds them. Since the earliest writings of mankind, the gods have been there with them. They are a vital part of the makeup of human societies across the globe. This is in a way to be expected. Humans were in fact, created by the gods. Various great deities created cultures of their design and ethos. As time marched forward, these various cultures and groups co-existed. Sometimes contentiously, sometimes harmoniously, but always striving to co-exist. \nConcept Art for the Dihoma - Artwork by Tumo Mere\n\nHistory, however, would change over the course of a tragic day and its horrific night. Mime, the Garuda deity of Wisdom, is assassinated at the hands of an alleged Vinyatian assassin. Mortal hands had never slain a deity. As tensions between the rival nations of Garuda and Vinyata soared under a long Tikor night, a bloody battle erupted between the two sides. A truce was called once the truth was revealed, but not before irreversible damage to both sides was done. \nDespite the armistice between bitter enemies, the wounds of that day will forever linger. The world heaves as the one constant, the gods themselves, waver and a new struggle begins.\nSwordsfall Logo Designed by Taylor Ruddle\nTHE YEAR 10 A.R\nAs the world still recovers, ten years after the bloody events that ended the Era, its fallout begins to appear. Rumors begin to give rise around the world of the arrival of a new kind of weapon. Instruments capable of killing gods, Grim Arms. Could this be related to the unsolved assassination of Mime? \nIn Garuda, a power struggle is in full effect as the current ruler of The Divine Order of the Phoenix, Amma Zencora, vies to hold onto his ill-gotten throne. How far will the ruler go to defend the throne he so desperately wants to hold on to? \nKevin Hou has allowed his art be used in Swordsfall\nVinyata is adjusting to a world with one less major city and cultural hub. The Eastern Node having been destroyed during the bloody war at the End of the Era. An unpleasant surprise emerges as they rebuild and a rash of malevolent spirits now roam the region. The souls of those lost 10 years still attached to the mortal plane, hungry for vengeance and retribution.\nHawklore's neutrality during The Longest Night has finally paid dividends. Literally. The God King, Hawken, basks in the increasing wealth of his nation. On the outside, it seems like a rich paradise where any want can be attained. Yet below, in the dingy streets of the capital city, High Perch, dissension stirs.\nAn early concept sketch of the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nRumors abound that the desolate stretch of land known as the Ebon Cascade has stirred with a new form of horror. Something cunning. And it's uniting the monstrous beings that call it home. Whispers say a Raksha is on Tikor, hiding away, building an army. None want to believe the horrifying rumor, yet none dare to confirm it either.\nIn the boundless waters of The Grand Divide, new forces stir as the largest pirate fleet of them all, Heaven's Fall, begins to marshal. With the cold genius of Nubia leading them, her power has begun to make those on land to take notice. The law of the sea changes as rumors of an alliance between her and the tech genius, Ken Musa begin to stir.\nIn all corners of the world, events are in motion.\n Visit the website - Official Swordsfall Website\nThe Book\nWelcome to Tikor will be an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover book, printed on premium color for the richest and vivid colors. With this being an artbook, the quality and feel of the book is important.\n*Update* Due to the overwhelming support of our backers, we hit the goal for OFFSET PRINTING! The book will be printed by PrintNinja, with the solid binding and paper quality you wanted!\nThe main point of this Kickstarter is to raise money for the art. Being able to see the dynamic characters and unique setting with your own eyes is something that can't be replaced. The goal represents the minimum needed to make that happen.\nAs for the book, the length will be around 150 pages, though it could be longer depending on the amount of money raised. The max page count will be around 200 pages no matter what. \nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\n\nThe Setting and Art Book will be a combination of T'umo's art, and Brandon's lore. Each piece of detailed full-color art will be accompanied by information about the person, place or thing it depicts For those only interested in the art, this lore will help bring the art to life and give it meaning. The kind of book you can sit down and just read.\nHowever, for those interested in the setting for their own games of the future Swordsfall RPG, then this serves as your window to the Afropunk setting. Throughout the pages, you will find a living world that easily makes the backdrop the right Tabletop System. However, this Setting and Artbook contains NO RULES. Just pure, sweet narrative world-building and fantastic art.\nSwordsfall itself has its own custom system that is deep into development.  Much of the art from the artbook will be used in the Corebook itself. Supporting this Kickstarter makes the Corebook's development even faster.\nAn early concept sketch of the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nThe Wallpapers\nAs a bonus to our backers all of T'umo's gorgeous work will be turned into amazing high-quality Wallpapers for your PC and phone. While the art will be used in both the Art Book and Corebook, I also want to share it with you the fans. And nothing is better than a gorgeous wallpaper on your home screen.\nThe World Map of Tikor makes for a sexy wallpaper\nAlmost every piece of art that is generated through this Kickstarter will be turned into a vivid piece of wallpaper. As well, there will be multiple resolutions available so you can always have the right size for your screen. We'll be conducting a poll after the Kickstarter to find out what the most used resolutions are. (I doubt we'll be able to do 15 resolutions for all the art)\nThat means you're not just getting the World Map as a wallpaper, but a ton of different ones with different art on it. Do you have a favorite profession? Or a favorite city in Swordsfall? Well, I'm sure there will be a wallpaper with it on it. We plan to have over 50 wallpapers in the bundle. \nA big ol fat zip of Wallpaper goodness.\nA Work in Progress shot of the Griot Wallpaper - Art by T'umo Mere, Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe Poster\nFor the Kickstarter there will be a Limited Edition run of a full-color Poster of the final book cover. The final art cover hasn't been finalized yet, but watch for updates on Kickstarter or the Swordsfall Patreon to see what the final image is. As well, a digital version will be included with all Kickstarter PDF's as part of the Digital Stretch Goals!\nThe Poster of the Minos, currently available on Redbubble!\nIf you like the art, like the poster, then check out our shop! We already have shirts, stickers, and more already available. Buying Swordsfall swag also supports the artists! All our artists receive royalties on shirts their art is featured on.\nCheck out our Official Merchandise: The Swordsfall Shop\nSo, what exactly is the world within the pages of this book? Well, Tikor is a world divided, both in idea and land. Yet, hope remains as the two halves are only divided, not separated. The Northern Hemisphere of Tikor sports much more moderate temperatures and expansive grasslands in the center. The tip of the northern region is snow-capped, with the furthest tips permanently covered in ice.\nThe Southern Hemisphere of Tikor, on the other hand, is essentially a desert wasteland. Or at least that's what some will say. Despite the harsh conditions and cunning predators, various cultures have made a home among the barren sand and oppressive heat. With dunes that sing hypnotic lullabies, mammoth beasts and a second sun that relentlessly bakes the land, the southern half is worlds different from the North.\nThe World of Tikor\n Garuda - The largest nation in the Northwestern Hemisphere of Tikor. A land of green and grasslands, it's headed by the Order of the Divine Phoenix. The organization itself was created by the deities of the land, The Divinity.\n Vinyata - The eternal rival to Garuda and the largest nation in the Southern Hemisphere of Tikor. The desert land is home to the Dracon, a culture descended from the only heroic dragon in history, Ryuu-jin. Despite the unforgiving landscape, the people of the desert have found solace underneath enormous domed cities.\n Hawklore - On the eastern edge of the Northern half of Tikor, lies a nation sitting singular. The country is embroiled in no battles, sieges or upsets to the throne. Instead, it's been lead by one single man, a god in fact. Hawken. And within his cool and steady grip, the nation has remained at the forefront of Azurean mining and economics.\n Grimnest -The living mountain, Enkai, separates Garuda from the western portion of the Northern Hemisphere.  The wrathful deity hasn't allowed a single person to cross his crags in a millennia. It's in this isolation that the rule less land of Grimnest sits. With no official government or ruler, its a land truly free. And also home to pirates, raiders and the spirit powered bounty hunters to reign them in.\n Ramnos - Nestled in the southernmost part of the Southern Hemisphere, this reclusive nation avoids attention at almost all cost. For them, being forgotten is the best thing they could do. Trade in and out of their nation is limited, and trust is a temporary arrangement in Ramnos. And with it being located between the horrors that wait in Ebon Cascade and the Outskirts of Vinyata on the other side, most who are born there stay there.\nSecond set of concept art for the Dihoma - Art by T'umo Mere\n\n Independent Freeland of Teslan - A small island located off of Grimnest. Tucked away in the turbulent ocean, Crystal Priest train to control their gift, all while studying the secrets to Hekan itself. The school for these Azurean molders, Druse Academy, rarely allows visitors into its halls. And the ring of Sentrylocks guarding the island makes it a place people only come to by invitation.\n The Grand Divide -The vast ocean that almost splits the land in two has its own personality. Its sparkling blue and green seas can turn harsh at any given moment. With hellish winds and torrential rain coming on seemingly at its whim. And if the weather doesn't get you, the pirates may. Yet millions flock to the sea everywhere. In search of glory, freedom, and prizes on its sea.\n Ebon Cascade - This perilous zone has swallowed up a chunk of the western part of the Southern Hemisphere. The air near the plagued lands seem to make every pore cry out, threatening to vomit. The waters run yellow with poison and the air feels stiff with suffering. Yet throughout the harshness, humans continue to visit the lands. Pushing their luck, and eventually their lives.\n The Canopy -  Located on the very western quarter of the Northern Hemisphere, this mountain region is unlike anything on Tikor. The peaks of the half a dozen mountains can't be seen from the ground level. Even if you could see them, these majestic peaks are not safe for visiting or habitation. Tales float around about mysterious creatures that whisk away anyone that dares venture into these lands.\nMinos Concept Bust - Art by Tumo Mere\n For More Lore: The Swordsfall World Anvil\n $4,000 \nMoar art from T'umo Mere\nA Deadquiver in action - T'umo Mere\nAt this Pledge level we'll be able to add more fantastic artwork to the Welcome to Tikor. Drawn by Swordsfall team member, T'umo Mere. We'll be adding in more characters to help further illustrate Tikor's diversity with more their detailed illustrations.\n\n $7,000 \nLandscapes and Cities from Sabina Lewis\nSphaerum (Previous Work) - Art by Sabina Lewis\nA world simply isn't complete without vivid scenery to immerse yourself in. To accomplish that, we've enlisted the help of a master in landscape design. The amazing Sabina Lewis! She's agreed to be a guest member on the Swordsfall to help bring the luscious world to life. When we hit this pledge level she'll be able to bring Tikor's incredible world to life.\n\n $10,000 \n Second PDF \"Tikor: The Professionals\"\nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\nWith your continued support we will be able to release a SECOND PDF as part of the Kickstarter. In the future this will be sold separately, but this and any other unlocked PDF's will be included as part of your Kickstarter!\nTikor: The Professionals will detail the 34 unique professions used in the Swordsfall Corebook. However, they are not classes, they truly are Professions. They are a symbol of not what someone is, but truly what they accomplish in life. The Professionals will talk about these professions in detail including history, location and important figures within each. Each Profession will be accompanied with full page art from T'umo Mere.\n\n $12,000 \nChibi Profession Art and Pins\nA Chibi Celestial Shield in the middle along side two other examples\nSwordsfall team member Taylor Ruddle has long had a love for Chibi art, even studying in Japan to hone his art. He's bring those skills to Tikor by designing Chibi versions of all 34 of Swordsfall's Professions. \nThen we're going to take those adorable creations and craft quality pins from them. They're cute, and fiercely adorable.\n\n $15,000 \n10 page Comic \"The Rise of Nubia\" Prologue\nThe story of Tikor's most famous and powerful pirate is one that needs more than just words. To describe the true depth of the character, only a comic can suffice. And so if we hit this goal Brandon and T'umo will credit a comic of Nubia, leader of Heaven's Fall.\nNubia has become a fan favorite among those who have read the Swordsfall World Anvil. Her strong spirit and fire has made her a often talked about character. The story of her rise may be known by some already, but it's never been shown in this kind of detail or color. \n $20,000 \nThird PDF - \"Pantheons of Tikor\"\nNot the Final Version - Art by T'umo Mere | Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe world of Tikor would not be where it is without the help of its divine beings. Almost the entire world is covered in various spirits and deities. Some influencing the people, and some hindering them.\nIf we reach this goal another PDF will be produced. This one all about the Pantheons that exist on Tikor. From the The Divinity in Garuda to the Orisha in the Outskirts of Vinyata, each pantheon will be detailed. Each pantheon will have gorgeous art alongside of it to show you the lives the divine live.\n$26,000 \nTop Notch Editing and Formatting\nAt this point with now three books in the lineup, we've more than maxed our ability to edit in house or within our circles. It's official become time to bring in the experts.\nIf we hit this tier we'll be able to commission the help of a number of freelance editors to help make the books truly shine. And most importantly, be effortlessly readable (because sometimes English is hard).\n $35,000 \nDragons and Creatures from Jonah Lobe\nDragons from Elder Scrolls: Skyrim - Designed by Jonah Lobe\nA true legendary figure has joined the Swordsfall team for a limited engagement. His creatures are ones you've certainly seen before. Jonah was the genius behind many of the Tamriel's most famous creatures such as the Dragons, Giants, and Draugr. He was also the whiz behind the grotesque Deathclaw and freakish Super Mutants from Fallout 4.\nIf we reach $35,000 the master Jonah himself will apply his dragon scales to the Afropunk style of The Wretched Ones. Swordsfall's own winged horrors. As well, he'll also draw other varied creatures from Tikor's wildlife.\n\n$50,000\nCharacter Design From Venus Bambisa\nTitan Slayer: Tinishi (Previous Work) - Art by Venus Bambisa\nThe look and feel of characters is important to Swordsfall, we want to create truly something unique. To help make the Tikor as rich as possible, we're bringing one of South Africa's most talented Character Concept artist, Venus Bambisa.\nHer design's are just jaw dropping in the way they same to flow an anime style with black faces. Her Artstation has character designs of all sorts, each of them elegant, sleek and badass. I especially love how she shows a characters increase in power. Who doesn't love transforming heroes?\n\n $70,000 \nFourth PDF - \"The Animalists' Guide to Creatures\" - Art by Jonah Lobe and T'umo Mere\nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe final and ultimate goal. A FOURTH book through this kickstarter, and the most expensive. That's because this book will be the most art heavy of them all, featuring art from both Jonah Lobe and T'umo Mere.\nAt this final amount we'll craft a trip through the wildlife across Tikor. From the monstrous Nandi Bear to the adorable and house trained Aardwolf. Each animal will be drawn by one of these dynamic pair. This is not a Monster Manual however, this, like the other books, will be narrative journey through the world. Instead focusing on the the animals and how they fit into the world. Their tales and even their bestial gods.\n\n$100,000\nThe Azurean Finish\nArtist Rendering of the Boxset, not ANYWHERE close to the final design. (The final version will be way cooler, and full of T'umo art)\nWhen we hit the $100,000 goal, I can do what people have wanted for over a week, ALL of the books printed. However, I'm going to do one better and not just print all four books, but print them in stupid high quality. And put in a few little extras. Lets see what your getting!\nThe Details\nAll four books printed\nTwo Variant covers for the Setting and Artbook\nEmbossed covers on all books\nSilk Ribbon bookmark on all books\nAll tucked in a Custom Slipcase with special art\n\n$130,000\nUnleash the Beast\nSwordsfall Studios can come to life\nWhen we hit $130,000 the Formation of Swordsfall Studios will begin! This will allow the core team to work full-time on future projects! Brandon and T'umo will be able to devote their full time and energy to the world!\nThat means more content, the RPG sooner and more! We have so much stuff planned, short run comics, adventures and even modules.

They are the culmination of months of research and development.  They are an expression of our company's mission to create products of uncompromising form and function that do more than hold all your gear. They are a personalized expression of you.  \n\nThe Deluxe, Standard & Double Dice Boxes in Black Limba\n\nWhat sets our dice boxes apart?\n A Tremendous Holding Capability \u2013 the boxes house multiple sets of dice, pens, pencils and minis.  With our multiple sizing options, you choose the size and capacity that works for you. \nHolds 2, 4 or 5 Sets of Polyhedral Dice\n Functionality \u2013 not only do the boxes help organize your gear, but the lid serves as an integral rolling tray.  \nPLAY\n\n\n High Quality Materials \u2013 from hand selected wood, to the luxurious flock adorning the inside pockets, we use the best materials available to protect your gear.\nDouble Dice, Standard and Deluxe in Purple Heart\n Extensive Engraving Options \u2013 your box should be uniquely yours. As such we have compiled an extensive catalog of engraving options to choose from.  Of course, we also offer a custom option if you have a design of your own. \nFrom Top Left: Walnut, Bubinga, Cherry. From Lower Left: Purple Heart, White Oak, Purple Heart\n\nThe Boxes\nThere are three sizes intended to fit your personal gaming gear needs.  From the mighty Deluxe 8, to the just-right Standard 7, to the compact Double Dice, there is a box to fit your indivdidual preference.\n\nThe Deluxe  The 8\" Deluxe Box holds 5 sets of standard polyhedral dice, 2 pencils or pens, and 2 standard miniatures with base.   The lid of the Deluxe also serves as a rolling tray.   This is the perfect box for Game Masters, dice addicts or anyone who needs maximum dice carrying capacity.  \nThe interior pockets and lid are professionally flocked resulting in a velvety look and feel. Rolling dice in the flocked tray has an acoustically gratifying sound that will make you excited to roll again just to hear the sound!  All surfaces of the pockets are flocked to protect your gear.  We know how important it is to ensure your lucky dice are pampered. Happy Dice = Happy RPG Life. \n8 Inch Deluxe Box in Black Limba\n\nThe Standard  The  7 inch Standard Box is designed to be the perfect size for transporting a significant amount of your game gear, while still fitting comfortably into a purse or bag.  It holds 4 sets of standard sized polyhedral dice, 1 pencil or pen and 2 standard minis with base.  Much like the Deluxe Box, the Standard Box interior pockets are flocked, and the lid couples as a rolling tray with the same impeccable acoustics.  \n7 Inch Standard Box in Bubinga\n\nThe Double Dice   Designed for the player on the go who values customization and quality  on a smaller scale, we are proud to offer our compact Double Dice Box.  Just as the name suggests this stunning box holds 2 standard sets of polyhedral dice and a made-to-fit pencil, which is included with the box.   The lid is also pocketed to serve as a rolling tray. Unlike the Deluxe and Standard boxes, the Double Dice Box does not have a flocked interior. \n4.5 Inch Double Dice in Padauk\nWood Options\nWe have selected wood options that complement your box and engraving.  Choose from a variety of Domestics (included in the base price for each reward level) or upgrade to a Premium wood option:\n\nDomestic wood options are included in the base reward price.\n\nPremium wood options available as an upgrade. See reward descriptions for details.\nFor backers of The Ultimate reward we've sourced the rare woods presented below.  Are you an Ultimate backer and have another wood species in mind that you'd like us to find?  Let us know and we'll see what we can do!\nPlease note that these are currently available only for backers of The Ultimate reward\nEngraving Options (The Fun Part!):\nThis is the core of your expression.  One of our primary goals is to ensure that your box represents and is an expression of you. We compiled an extensive (and growing) catalog of engraving options to choose from so we can do just that.  Click over to the catalog on NadarraCreations.com/pages/engraving-options to explore them. We've placed a link on each page of the catalog so you can easily come back to Kickstarter when you're done.\nWhile navigating the catalog, hover over a graphic of interest to display the name of the graphic, whether it is standard or premium and any box size limitations.\nPlease note that each graphic is evaluated for complexity and the time needed to engrave.  Simpler graphics are classified as Standard while those that are more complex have been marked as Premium.  Whenever possible, we have leaned toward Standard.  \nDo not wait to pledge because you are unsure about which engraving to choose. Every Nadarra Creations Dice Box is custom made to your specifications, and we will be producing them in the order that pledges are received.  Rest assured that you can adjust your pledge options throughout the campaign and inform us of your specific wood and engraving choice via the post-campaign survey.\nCustom Engravings:  Have something unique you'd like engraved on your box?  That's great!  Let's do it!  We have just a few key requirements so that we can engrave it for you.  \nWe will need the artwork to be provided in a 'vector graphic format' (.eps, .ai, .svg) with no open or duplicate vectors.  \nWhen the image is scaled down to the engraving dimensions for your chosen box (engraving sizes are 3\" for double dice, 5\" for standard, 5.5\" for deluxe), the line thickness within the vector must be no less than .015 inches. \nWe will evaluate the vector you provide us to ensure the format and parameters are correct, and we will get back to you with additional guidance as needed.  \nWe also reserve the right to request an alternate graphic should the provided artwork be viewed as offensive or inconsistent with the values of our company. \n\nHow to determine your total pledge\nComing up with the total price is simple: Take the pledge amount of the reward you have selected and add each upgrade option price to the total.  We will ask you about your specific prefefences with regard to wood type and artwork in the survey sent to you at the end of the campaign.\nShipping\nThe estimated shipping time frame for each reward is August 2019, but we intend to begin shipping well beforehand.  In the order that pledges are received, box production and delivery will begin at the conclusion of the campaign and continue until all orders are filled.\nInternational Shipping - Please message us for assistance If you are outside of the United States and your Country is not listed as an option, or you need help determining shipping costs.\n\n                                                      OUR STORY\nWho we are \nBased in Portland, Oregon, Nadarra Creations was founded by Scott Weinstein and Alecia Sensor with the idea that superior quality tabletop gaming accessories should be not just beautiful but exceedingly functional and, most importantly, reflect a player\u2019s individuality. We are thrilled to have created a line of dice boxes with a naturally inspired aesthetic that allow us to stick to our core value: form and function without compromise.  \n(Images captured from our first campaign video attempt!)\nHow we started\nThe very first dice box was crafted as a gift for our favorite DM and good friend, Dylan.  He needed a way to organize and transport his gaming gear more easily and in style.  After exploring many of the available options, all of which either limited the amount of gear he could bring or require that he separate it into multiple cases, he worked with us to design something special. Something not only incredibly functional, but beautiful and an expression of him.  This very first box was delivered back in June 2018 and was an instant hit.  It was clear to everyone that there was something different and special about the design and we were immediately commissioned to create several more.  We knew we were onto something and so we got to work!\nPLAY\n\nWhy Back us?\nYour pledge will make it possible for us to continue to grow.

Because we are not outsourcing any of our production, we have complete control over quality and tempo. \n\nWe have successfully developed processes that will scale with increased funding and order volumes and established funding thresholds that, when reached, will enable us to increase our tooling and staff to minimize the increase in time needed to fill the larger number of orders. We intend to deliver in the order that pledges are received and communicate proactively so that our backers are routinely updated as to the status and timing of delivery. \n\nAdditional risks include: Sourcing materials - we have addressed this by identifying multiple sources for lumber, and other consumables. Potential impacts on shipping natural wood products to different climates - We have anticipated this from the beginning and accounted for it with unique innovations in our core product design that stand up to environmental influences.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you for your support!", "descp": "We can't thank you enough for your help!

Please be sure to stay tuned to our backer updates page for behind-the-scenes production and rewards updates.\nHave a question? Please give us a shout through the 'Ask a Question\u2019 button on our Kickstarter campaign FAQ page.\nWe can\u2019t wait to bring the entire 10-episode The Legend of Vox Machina animated series to life!\n<3\nCritical Role\nCritical Role is a weekly livestreamed tabletop roleplaying game featuring a group of prominent voice actors, who happen to be best friends. Each week, veteran Game Master Matthew Mercer leads the cast through epic adventures set in the world of Exandria! Trust us \u2014 it\u2019s rad.  \nOur original storyline centered on a group of heroes known as Vox Machina \u2014 Pike Trickfoot (gnome cleric, Ashley Johnson), Keyleth (half-elf druid, Marisha Ray), Percival \u201cPercy\u201d Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III (human gunslinger, Taliesin Jaffe), Grog Strongjaw (goliath barbarian, Travis Willingham), Scanlan Shorthalt (gnome bard, Sam Riegel), Vex\u2019ahlia (half-elf ranger, Laura Bailey), and Vax\u2019ildan (half-elf rogue, Liam O\u2019Brien) \u2014 as they battled the forces of evil and learned to work as a team. Their epic tale concluded in November, 2017 after 115 episodes and 373 hours of gameplay.\nThe show is still going strong, now over 50 episodes in to our second season, which tracks the misfits known as the Mighty Nein. Critical Role reaches a wide, international audience called Critters, who are just about the greatest fans in history. \n Titmouse is an Emmy award-winning animation production company behind the hits Big Mouth, The Venture Bros., Metalocalypse, Niko and the Sword of Light and Star Wars: Galaxy of Adventures. One of the largest 2D animation studios in America with studios in Los Angeles, New York and Vancouver, B.C., it employs more than 400 of the most talented people in the industry (all guaranteed to be 100% human). Its fresh styles can be seen on major networks such as Disney, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network and streaming services like Amazon and Netflix.  \nVox Machina is back, baby \u2014 but this time they\u2019re cartoons! Here\u2019s the amazing creative team that\u2019s gonna take our tale from imagination to animation...  \nArt by Critter Hunter Bonyun (@deerlordhunter)\nWRITING TEAM\nA brand new story was crafted by the cast of Critical Role and scripted by our good friend and talented TV writer, Jennifer Muro (Star Wars: Forces of Destiny, Spider-Man, Justice League: Action). Muro is one of the most sought-after writers in the industry and she\u2019s written an in-canon adventure that takes place before the events of the streaming show. \nANIMATION TEAM\nTo bring the magic and mayhem of Exandria to life, we\u2019re sinking the vast majority of our resources into the animation budget. As Titmouse has proven again and again, they pride themselves on top notch quality and attention to detail, ensuring this story will be told with visceral, action-packed visuals. It\u2019ll be bloody gorgeous.\nVOICEOVER\nThe voice acting for The Legend of Vox Machina will (of course) be provided by the cast of Critical Role, who bring decades of experience to the table. You\u2019ve no doubt heard their voices in some of your favorite cartoons \u2014 Teen Titans Go!, Ben 10, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball Z, Sofia the First, Avengers Assemble, DuckTales, Transformers, and many, many more. And to round out the main cast, we\u2019ll bring in some extra special celebrity cameos, as well as voice over industry legends. \nOTHER DETAILS\nIn The Legend of Vox Machina, our adventuring group is right around Level 7 \u2014 fledgling adventurers, but still powerful enough to fire off exciting spells and brutal attacks.\nSo, what will this campaign allow us to create? A bitchin\u2019 high-quality, fantasy cartoon set in a world created by one of the most accomplished storytellers, Matthew Mercer. With heart-stopping action and side-splitting comedy, it will have something for everyone. \nIf we smash through our crowdfunding goal, The Legend of Vox Machina will be released in Fall 2020. But we can\u2019t do it without your help funding this campaign \u2014 which ends on Thursday, April 18th at 11:59pm Pacific.\nUPDATE (MARCH 7TH):\nDue to the overwhelming love and support of our amazing backers, we're creating an animated series!\nAs a quick refresher: the first few episodes of our animation will focus on a brand new Vox Machina adventure, which takes place before our show began streaming live on Twitch. But because of your incredible generosity, we\u2019re following your lead and going for it, diving right into a series that begins the retelling of the saga of Vox Machina. We can\u2019t wait to show you how the story shapes up!\nWe're excited to share new episode offerings as part of our new stretch goals for our campaign: The Briarwoods are coming to animated life in The Legend of Vox Machina!\nThe Briarwoods arc is one of the most exciting and popular storylines of the Vox Machina streaming campaign. When we were brainstorming about what might come next, the clear winner was introducing the Briarwoods into The Legend of Vox Machina.\nThe Briarwoods arc story so far\u2026 Vox Machina arrive in Percy's hometown, Whitestone, to avenge the murder of his family and the corruption of his city at the hands of the evil Briarwoods. Danger and betrayal lurk around every corner, and it will take all of Vox Machina's abilities to combat this deadly threat. The Briarwoods arc began in episode 24 of our first streamed campaign, and remains one of our absolute favorites.\nFor the last batch of stretch goals that we crush, we\u2019ll be able to create two additional 22-minute Briarwoods arc episodes.\nSo, to recap, here\u2019s what you can expect episode-wise from The Legend of Vox Machina animated SERIES:\n Episodes 1 & 2: A brand new story centered around Vox Machina at level 7 (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 3, 4, 5, 6: Briarwoods arc! (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 7 & 8: Continuation of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 9 & 10: Continuation and conclusion of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\nBe sure to check out our backer updates tab at the top of this page for the full download.\nUPDATE (APRIL 5TH):\nWe have unlocked our final stretch goal and now, we\u2019ll make the entire 10-episode The Legends of Vox Machina series for you AND a one-shot GMed by our very own Ashley Johnson! \nAt the moment, we\u2019re not planning on adding additional stretch goals -- every dollar that we raise after this point will be allocated directly into making an even more kick ass animation. This means more animators, more music, and more awesomeness. Of course, if that changes, we\u2019ll be sure to let everyone know as soon as possible.\nIn our wildest dreams, we never thought that we\u2019d be able to bring an entire Vox Machina SERIES to life. But, time and time again, you all continue to challenge our expectations in the best way. We cannot thank you enough and we cannot wait to roll up our sleeves and get started. \nTravis & Sam went on dozens of Hollywood pitch meetings, and found some interest \u2014 but we ultimately decided to create our first animated special on our own. By doing so, we can continue to stay true to our beloved characters and tell the stories you want to see. With an ever-burning desire to bring a Vox Machina animation to the masses, we decided to give the power back to our amazing community, roll up our sleeves, and make this special with YOU instead. \nEvery dollar you contribute allows us to embark on this animated adventure together, with the ultimate goal of producing a full-blown animated series. We\u2019ll keep you posted on how the project is going \u2014 with behind-the-scenes looks at the animation process, recording sessions, reward product creation, and everything in-between. As a backer, you are part of our team and we guarantee you\u2019ll feel empowered and informed every step of the way.   \nCONTRIBUTE if you have the means to do so! Backers will get updates along the way, receive awesome rewards, and be the first to know when the show is ready for prime time.\nSHARE with your friends and family. Even if your loved ones don\u2019t know Critical Role yet, a super badass cartoon is a perfect way to introduce them to it. Help us spread the good word! \nAlong with making the 22-minute animated series of our dreams, the money raised through this campaign will allow us to provide cool rewards and administer our crowdfunding project. \nIt\u2019s incredibly important that we remain transparent, so we created this handy chart to show you exactly where your hard-earned money will go. \nThe overwhelming majority of our funds raised will support the production of our animated special \u2014 from our incredible animation team to voiceover studio time, soundtrack composition, music, effects, sound design, etc.\nOf course, we have accounted for some boring (but important!) stuff too \u2014 like credit card processing fees, accounting, and additional staff to keep this project running at full steam. \nWe wanted to give you the coolest and most high-quality rewards, all of which are exclusive to this crowdfunding campaign, which means you won\u2019t be able to find this swag anywhere else! \n We\u2019re thrilled to offer you a selection of campaign-exclusive perks as a thank you for supporting The Legend of Vox Machina. We\u2019ve set it up this way to guarantee that most of your funds go towards creating the best damn cartoon possible. After countless creative meetings, we created this set of sweet products that we would be proud to own ourselves.    \nEach time we hit a new goal together, we'll share our new crowdfunding goal with you! This means more swag and some bad ass Vox Machina one-shots that will unlock for everyone (backers or not!).   \nFirst, check out our Kickstarter FAQ on our campaign page.

Now, with the introduction of our new parts, well over 8000 painters in more than 50 countries are using the Hobby Holder as part of their painting arsenal!\nWe have talked to hundreds of painters across the globe at conventions, online and in person, and we have listened to your wants and needs. Now we are back to add two new pieces to the Hobby Holder system: the Ergonomic Grip for even greater control and comfort and the XL Stability Bar for more support with a wider range of miniature sizes. We are also adding more color to your desks with New Colors of the original Hobby Holder parts with a second production run!\nAll 11 Colors are Available in All 4 Parts - Mix and Match\nThe Hobby Holder is the World's Most Versatile, Comfortable and Precise Miniature Holder and the ONLY All-in-one Miniature Painting Handle and Grip. \nThe translucent blue parts are resin printed prototypes.\nAttach Miniatures to the Hobby Holder with Standard 28mm Bottle Caps or Even Wine Corks for Pinning.   \nAccepts 28mm plastic caps; Citadel \u2122 Paint Caps; Formula P3 paint caps; and 20mm wine cork.\nWith the innovative bottle cap attachment method, just stick your miniatures, based or unbased, to a standard soda/water bottle cap with your favorite sticky stuff (we use Loctite Fun-tak, the best blue-tak on the market!) and you can quickly and easily screw them on and off without ever touching the miniature! Perfect for batch painting because you can switch even wet miniatures without smudging. \nBatch paint with ease and never touch a wet miniature again!\nPin your miniatures? No problem! The center hole of the Hobby Holder is perfectly sized to press fit standard wine corks or any 20mm cork. Just push them in, place in the pinned miniature and get painting! Done with the cork? Insert a paintbrush through the middle hole in the bottom of your Hobby Holder.\n360 Degree Rotation in Any Position for Ultimate Precision\n360 Degree Rotation Overhead Stability Bar Mode with the New XL Stability Bar\n360 Degree Rotation Stability Bar Grip Mode\n360 Degree Rotation in Ergonomic Grip Mode\nWith our unique patent pending design, the Hobby Holder threaded base can easily rotate 360 degrees in the Overhead Stability Bar mode, with the Stability Bar functioning as the grip in Grip Mode and now when clicked into the Ergonomic Grip Mod, with or without the Stability Bar attached, in Ultimate Support mode. This affords more control and the ability to get all around your miniature without letting go!\n New Ergonomic Grip Provides Even More Control and Comfort Tailored to How You Paint. \nClicked into the Ergonomic Grip rotate your mini 360 degrees easily with one hand!\nThe new Ergonomic Grip gives even more support when attached to the bottom of the Hobby Holder Base and allows the use of the Stability Bar and Grip at the same time. Simply click in your Hobby Holder Threaded Base and start painting. The QuickClick design allows for Full 360 Degree Rotation of the Threaded Base with one hand while attached to the Ergonomic Grip.\nThe Ergonomic Grip is two pieces and can be taken apart and weighted if desired. It also has the option to add two standard nuts to screw in the original #6-32 bolt to lock down the Hobby Holder Threaded Base and now a 1/4\" bolt to attach larger platforms if desired.\nNEW XL Stability Bar Offers More Room For Larger Miniatures With the Same Superior Support.\nThe New XL Stability Bar uses the same QuickClick design as the Standard Size Stability Bar and attaches right onto the Hobby Holder Threaded base in Upright or Grip modes.\nThe XL Stability Bar accommodates miniatures with up to 70mm bases with ease and the offset finger support design allows you to attach miniatures that are even taller than the bar itself. The angle of the XL Stability Bar has been adjusted slightly so that even with the taller profile it is comfortable and easy to use with large or small hands.\nUltimate Support, Brush Control and Comfort with the Original Stability Bar and NEW XL Stability Bar  \nThe stability bar rotates 360 degrees so you never have to let go of your miniatures.\nPaint with ease with unparalled acces all the way around your miniatures, even the top!\nThe original offset Stability Bar allows you to paint miniatures with up to 50mm bases in Overhead Stability Bar. Now with the XL Stability Bar you will be able to paint miniatures with up to 70mm bases. \nWith the offset design of the Stability bar you can even paint taller miniatures. And with the multiple pinch and finger rests built into the Stability Bar there is always a comfortable way to hold your Hobby Holder while getting even the trickiest areas painted.\nWant to paint even larger miniatures? Simply flip either Stability Bar over into Grip Mode or click on the new Ergonomic Grip and the Hobby Holder will accept any size miniature.\nEasily Switch Between Base Only, Holder, Grip and Ultimate Support Modes with the QuickClick Connection.\nHigh-strength ABS plastic means durable, longlasting QuickClick connections\nThe Ultimate All-in-one Painting Handle and Grip Now Has Even More Customization with Hundreds of Holding Positions\nAs the Hobby Holder can be customized so can your support and comfort!\nMore Great Features\nMade from strong, yet lightweight ABS plastic\n4mm center hole for removing corks. Just push a brush, file or cork popper through and out pops the cork.\nErgonomically designed and tested for maximum comfort while painting or sculpting\nDishwasher and Simple Green safe for quick cleaning\nReduced mess! Keeps your hands and work space cleaner\nMade in the USA\nGreat for everyone \u2013 from those just getting into a hobby to seasoned professionals! \nCheck out some amazing painters who use the Hobby Holder!\n\"As essential as a brush and pallet, the Hobby Holder is a must.\" - Sam Lenz\n\"I have been painting for over 20 years  and one of the things I advise everyone on is how to hold your miniature while painting. The Hobby Holder is the best on the market for this. You customize the grip to how you paint and it has endless options to personalize your painting experience. Hands down the best holder I have used.\" - Neil Hollis\n\"You can't paint miniatures without a brush, shouldn't paint without a lamp and you won't want to paint without the Hobby Holder once you have tried it.\" - Watch It Paint It\n\"Well, in short, it's really dope... I'm doing all sorts of flips with this beast and got mad angles sniped with the brush with fluid ease. Highly recommended y'all!\" - Malev Minis\n\"I've been painting for about a decade now, and one thing I've always struggled with was holding the miniature well; to help stabilize it, I always pinched down on the top of the model, which often lead to rubbing away some paint. The Hobby Holder has been a game-changer here - the vertical stability bar takes the place of that pinch, without needing to touch the model at all. The handle is comfortable and easy to use, and you can modify it to suit your needs - I've filled mine with a bit of wine cork for holding pinned models.\" - Mike Cousins, Epic Duck Studios\n\"From the first use, I fell in love with Hobby Holder, and MANY of my viewers in my stream have also fallen in love with theirs as well. Now with all of these great accessories available, how could you not use and love these products? Hobby Holder is the perfect tool for commission painters like myself, who need to quickly switch from model to model while batch painting, or get in tight on a competition piece. Hobby Holder is for literally anyone and everyone, and I feel it will help elevate any skill level!  Thank you Kit, for such a great set of products!  They really have changed my painting in a great way!\" - Impending Duff\n\"The Hobby Holder has truly been a game changer for me! Not only for improved comfort while painting, but an overall improvement in the quality of my work. The handle is just amazing! I no longer have to touch my minis messing up the paint, and the handle has an area wide enough for me to stabilize my pinky on while I paint the tiniest of details. If that isn't amazing enough,  the addition of the large hand grip is just icing on this already amazing cake. I highly recommend the Hobby Holder and the super comfortable grip for every mini painter!\" - Super Sarah\n\"The Hobby Hobby is hands down my favorite way to hold miniatures.  It gives me a consistent, adaptable way to hold just about anything.  I've used it for everything from mouselings to large terrain pieces due to its flexibility of use. With the large grip mod attached to the bottom I always have a perfect hold on my piece, no matter the size.  It's the tool I reach for with every mini.\" - Spotted Painter\n\"The Hobby Holder is seriously the best holder I have used; for my shaky hands, the Hobby Holder miniature holder, gives me the stability, control, and comfort I needed.\" - Brushforhire\nThe Hobby Holder does exactly what it says on the tin with its grip, handle and bottle cap base! It is easy to use and quick to swap bottle caps over while batch painting troops and even holding bigger models. - Garry's Workshop\nThe Hobby Holder is the perfect addition to any hobbyist's table. Whether you're clumsy of a good ol' perfectionist, it allows for comfort and precision for massive painting sessions as well as a handy way to switch between projects. I am so glad I discovered them!\" - Samriel Painting Studio\nCheck out #hobbyholder and be sure to follow us Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to see all the amazing painting happening on the Hobby Holder!\nAll pledges will let you select the exact parts you want in the pledge manager based on the number of parts you pledged for.\nMix, match and personalize your choices so you get the exact painting support you need and want from the Hobby Holder, All-in-one Miniature Painting Handle and Grip! \n*All pledges now include the \"Hit The Ground Running\" Pack that contains 5 bottle caps, sticky-tak and a custom button!* \n_____\nAvailable Parts\nThreaded Base, Standard Stability Bar, New XL Stability Bar, New Ergonomic Grip \nThreaded Base, Standard Stability Bar, XL Stability Bar, Ergonomic Grip Mod\nAvailable Colors\nAll four parts (Threaded Base, Ergonomic Grip Mod, Standard Stability Bar and XL Stability Bar) are now available in Sky Blue, Fresh Green, Black, Purple, Orange, Red, Silver, Midnight Blue, Copper, White and Yellow!\nAll 11 Colors Are Available in All 4 Parts - Mix and Match\nNumber of Parts Choices Per Pledge Level\n Just A Taste: Choice of ANY 1 PART \n The Hobbyist: Choice of ANY 2 PARTS \n The Discerning Hobbyist: Choice of ANY 3 PARTS \n The All-in Hobbyist: Choice of ANY 4 PARTS \n The Wargamer: Choice of ANY 6 PARTS \n The Professional: Choice of ANY 8 PARTS \n The Ultimate Painter: Choice of ANY 12 PARTS \nYou can choose any combination of parts (Threaded Base, Standard Stability bar, New XL stability Bar, New Ergonomic Grip Mod)\nReward Selection Example:\nIf you pledge at the The All-in Hobbyist level, you get your choice of any four Hobby Holder parts in any configuration and color you choose.

Once the go-ahead is given, we will see injection molded samples in about 15 days.\nPressure testing and quality review\nDuring this time, we will be sending out surveys through BackerKit for you to select the various painting handle and grip parts and add-ons you would like. Once the surveys are completed, we will place the order with the manufacturer and anticipate receiving the new parts at the first half of February, with pledge fulfillment starting the beginning of March.\nAfter fulfillment is complete, the entire Hobby Holder system will be available on the Game Envy website at www.gameenvy.net\nMy wonderful, supportive family <3\nAs many of you now know, my name is Kit, I am the founder of Game Envy Creations and creator of the Hobby Holder and many unique hobby accessories. I am a husband to a wonderful wife, father to two sweet boys and one cute kitty. I am self employed and dedicated to bringing amazing hobby products to life through Game Envy Creations and creating beautiful design through my freelance graphic design business. Making makes me happy and being able to share it with the world makes me even happier!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn our first Kickstarter campaign we learned a lot about the manufacturing process and acknowledge there is always the risk of delays. Working with a US-based manufacturer means we have better communication, only being one timezone apart. It also means we can get changes and parts done in several days, rather than months.\n\nWe are using our same trusted vendors who we are in close communication with to make sure everything is on track and have backup plans available if there are any hiccups. This combined with open and quality communication with our backers we were able to start delivering rewards within three months (two weeks early) in the original Hobby Holder campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Cool Project!", "descp": "Show some support, follow along with updates and access the add-ons.\nINCLUDES:\nA Nice Feeling in Your Heart", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["84 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "Just A Taste", "descp": "Choice of ANY 1 PIECE of the Hobby Holder system.

Therefore they are stone-hard, stubborn, fast in friendship and in enmity, and they suffer toil and hunger and hurt of body more hardily than all other speaking peoples; and they live long, far beyond the span of Men, yet not forever.\"\n-J. R. R. Tolkien\nDwarves really are the best! While they're often a bit rough around the edges, they have the best accents, are insatiably loot-hungry, and will fight anything that moves\u2014so we are going to make a bunch more of them! The dwarves will be cast in lead free white-metal pewter and will be on a 28mm scale.\nWe've assembled them into adventuring parties to make it easier for us to pack and ship. You can add an additional adventuring party to your base reward for $22. Additional individual dwarves can be added to your base reward for $5 each. For a slightly larger view of the minis, check them out on our blog. Here are the adventuring parties:\nFrom Left to Right: Male Dwarven Brawler, Female Dwarven Bard, Male Dwarven Deathknight, Male Dwarven Druid, Female Dwarven Warrior\nThe League seeks out the ancient dwarven knowledge hidden deep within the lost caverns. They hope that, in time, civilized dwarves will once again inhabit those hallowed halls. \nFrom Left to Right: Male Dwarven Rogue, Female Dwarven Sheildbreaker, Male Dwarven Battlerager, Male Dwarven Mage, Female Dwarven Archer\nHogg's Tavern is not the sort of place that anyone should visit . . . at least not anyone who values their life or health. Surprisingly, it has regulars. Its patrons are usually adventures past their prime or looking to make a name for themselves. \nFrom Left to Right: Female Dwarven Mechanist, Male Dwarven Automaton, Male Dwarven Gunslinger, Female Dwarven Automage, Male Dwarven Investigator\nNot everyone has embraced the \"advances\" made in the Steam Valley workshops. When the Savages descended on the valley, the Seigebreakers and their constructs helped turn the tide against the invading armies.\nFrom Left to Right: Female Dwarven Vampire Hunter, Male Dwarven Undead Elite, Male Dwarven Necromancer, Female Dwarven Huntsman, Male Dwarven Warlord\nThe lands beyond Raven's Gate are shrouded in perpetual mists and haunted by the undead. Only the very brave or the very foolish venture there. Why not both? \nFrom Left to Right: Female Dwarven Barbarian, Female Dwarven Berserker, Female Dwarven Wandsmith, Male Dwarven Fighter, Male Dwarven Barbarian\nThe Iron Hills are not an easy country to grow up in. There's bitter cold winters and orcish armies locked in perpetual combat. That's not even mentioning the greatwolves. No one ever mentions the greatwolves.\nFrom Left to Right: Female Dwarven Sorceress, Male Dwarven Gray Warden, Male Dwarven Buccaneer, Female Dwarven Cleric, Male Dwarven Barber\nMad Harry defends the eastern shores from the goblin flotillas that wash up nearly every spring. His fiercely loyal crew have learned that insanity doesn't necessarily make you unfit for command.\nFrom Left to Right: Female Dwarven Belsnickel, Male Dwarven Dancer, Male Duergar Dungeoneer, Male Dwarven Hammersmith, Female Dwarven Monk\nThe Underking has many agents in his employ that serve to further his plans in the lands beyond the Dwarvish Domains. Some are well known ambassadors, others have a more subtle role.\nGREENS:\nEvery Stretch Goal we hit will add more dwarves (or dwarf-related miniature items/companions) to the Completionist Set.

Made in the USA by BoardGameTables.com.\nYou could write the next great novel on your phone, but you'll type faster on a laptop. Things go smoother when you have the right tool for the job.\nA board game table is the perfect tool for playing board games. \nThe biggest difference between a \"normal\" table and a board game table is the recessed playing area. There are 3\" wide armrests around the perimeter of the table, and you play games in an arena. \nThe Jasper has a one-piece padded, polyester felt surface in the play area. It is about 6mm thick with a rigid back so that it lays flat without bunching. Soft and smooth so cards slide across it, the play surface is heavy enough that it won't slide around. \nEvery table comes with a gray play surface. You will also have the option to buy additional felt playing surfaces in different colors if we hit some stretch goals (more info later).\nDrinks and board games are the ultimate frenemies. They go so well together. A long gaming session needs some refreshment. But they cause so much drama. Even if you don't spill your drink, it can be a constant source of worry, threatening to damage your game, or mess up your game state.\nCup holders bring harmony.\nMost of us aren't lucky enough to have a room dedicated to gaming. If you are, that's awesome. But The Jasper is also designed to work as your everyday table in your kitchen or dining room.\nComplete list of all dimensions at the bottom of the page.\nA sleek timeless design that doesn't scream \"look at me!\", but patiently waits for you to discover its beauty, in your time, while eating dinner or playing a game.\nIts 3' x 5' playing area hits the sweet spot for board games. Six people fit very comfortably. Any game except the biggest monsters fit. But you don't have to strain to reach across it.\nThe Jasper is a budget conscious table, but that doesn't mean cheaply built. You won't find any particle board or MDF in your Jasper. It's made from solid wood. Malaysian Oak (also known as Rubberwood or Hevea brasiliensis). It is a wood that has similar hardness characteristics as North American hardwoods, but is less expensive.\nBut using solid materials doesn't automatically mean a solid table. That's why we are making The Jasper in the USA (in Jasper, MO). This gives us the tightest possible quality assurance process, and a quick turn around time if problems need to be fixed. Production will be overseen by the same woodworkers who make our high end custom tables.\nTables will be shipped in backer order. The earlier you back, the sooner you get your table.\nThe price will be higher after the campaign ends.\nBuilt on Experience. We've been building custom game tables for 4 years, and sold over 3,500 Duchess gaming tables in our previous Kickstarter. We are avid gamers. We know what gamers need. Benefit from everything we've learned.\nChad founded BoardGameTables.com four years ago. He (I?) plays games every Thursday on the very first prototype we (Kyle) built. I love Age of Steam, Haggis, Napoleon's Triumph, and Indonesia.\nKaty is our customer support champion and logistics maestro. If you email us (jasper@boardgametables.com), you will be hearing from Katy. Her favorite game is Castles of Mad King Ludwig. She was super happy about the table's name selection, as it's also the name of her pup (complete coincidence since the table is named after Jasper, MO). \nRuss has a degree in Wood Technology. He can look down the edge of a board and tell you if it is straight, even while wearing a blindfold.\nKyle has built enough custom home poker, craps, and blackjack tables to open a casino. Now he's (mostly) converted to games that rely on victory points instead of money. Most woodworkers use glue, but Kyle just squeezes the boards together, commands them to stick, and they obey him.\nRuss and Kyle will oversee the production of The Jasper, but it will take a whole team of workers to cut, drill, sand, stain, sand, finish, sand, and pack your Jasper.\nAdditionally, this would not be possible without our talented freelancers. Anca Gavril who made all the graphics and drawing on this page. Digital Lunchbox who shot and produced the main video. Max Kreutzer who made the behind the scenes video. And my many friends who help me test prototype tables and volunteered to be in videos and photoshoots. \nNo matter how many pictures or videos I show you of The Jasper, it is never the same as touching it. Feeling it. Crawling under it. Shaking it.\nSo we did the next best thing. We shipped a few early Jaspers to some lucky backers so we could test the shipping process and make sure the table lived up to their expectations, but also so they could share their thoughts on the table form an unbiased perspective.\nHere's what they had to say:\nWhen I got home last night my 9 year old daughter proudly showed me how she could take the topper off by herself and get a game set up. That should give an indication as to how easy the topper is to handle.  --Aaron Rasmussen\nThe packaging the table came in did a great job. The instructions were super easy to follow too. Chad and team have done an amazing job. The table is sturdy and beautiful. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment having a second one in the dining room (which has been discussed...). We are really loving the table! --Jason Curtis\nThe Jasper table costs $599 and has the following optional add-ons:\nUPDATE: WE ARE DOING CHAIRS!! See update #2 for a picture of the first prototype. You will be able to add them in the pledge manager. I don't have final pricing yet.\n We don't have shipping prices for the stretch goal items yet.\nA chief goal of The Jasper is that it would be both easy to assemble and foolproof to assemble.\nEasy to assemble means that you don't have to push, beat on things, or stretch too far. It means that the table holds itself together for you as you go. We added extra screws that aren't really needed structurally, but they help you hold things in place during assembly.\nFoolproof assembly means that it is almost impossible to assemble it wrong. Similarly sized screws are color coded. Boards naturally fit in obvious places. Things that need to be tight are naturally tightened correctly.\nThe only tools you will need are your own Phillips head screwdriver and an Allen wrench we provide.\nCheck out the assembly instruction pdf.\n*Extra charges for shipping to non-contiguous US states and territories (Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, etc).\nTables are big and heavy to ship. We've worked hard to keep the price down while still protecting the table.\nIn order to keep things streamlined and make sure we stay on schedule, we are only able to offer shipping to the US and Canada right now. It is our hope and plan to run another Kickstarter campaign with shipping to many more countries after we deliver on this campaign. Right now we think adding overseas shipping might cause unforeseen complications.\nThe Jasper has Canadian friendly shipping. It will ship to you from inside Canada. You will owe no duty.\nWe are already pretty far along in the development lifecycle of The Jasper. The prototyping and much of the prep work has already been done. We are ready to start building your table.\nPrototypes\nFirst prototype: Assembly was too hard. Felt was ok, but not great. Play area corner issues. Not happy with stain color.\nSecond prototype: Much easier to assemble. Corners fixed. Felt was better, but color wasn't good. Not happy with stain color.\nThird prototype: Testing wood from the final source. One more tweak needed to ease assembly. Felt great. Not happy with stain color.\nFourth prototype: Testing wood from a cheaper source. It isn't as good. Final table will use wood from same source as prototype three. Assembly is amazing. Happy with stain color.\nPilot Production Runs\nFirst batch: Building 20 tables. Creating all the jigs that will be used during mass production. Setting up the physical assembly line and defining the processes. We are almost finished with this step. We will be shipping these tables to test the packaging.\nPilot production run: Building 200 tables. Testing the process. Fine tuning it to make sure we are ready for mass production. We have the wood for this step and will begin soon.\nWe are not counting on any timeline with these pilot run tables. They are part of the learning and setup process. However, if some of them are ready before the main production tables, then we will create a higher priced \"deliver immediately pledge level\" after the campaign and give you the option to upgrade to that new pledge level in the pledge manager.\nShipment Schedule\nAs of 34 hours to go, it looks like we are on pace for people who back now to get their table in March, 2019.\nAll that prep work should really help make our estimates more accurate, but there are a lot of variables. These are our best realistic estimated dates. Tables will ship strictly based on the order you back the campaign (so don't delay!). \nThe \"Backer Number\" that Kickstarter assigns to you is a good estimate of where you will be on this list, but you will be higher on the list than your backer number would have you believe, because people with $1 pledges or canceled pledges also get backer numbers.\nWe have some backup plans in place to increase capacity if this Kickstarter really takes off. Namely building or renting more space, hiring more employees, etc. If it looks like we aren't going to get everyone their table by November 2019 (either because we aren't meeting our predicted pace or because we sell so many tables), then we will start putting those plans into place.\nThis is Kickstarter. There are many unforeseen things that could happen. However, we are much further along in the process with The Jasper than we were with The Duchess at this point. Detailed plans are in place, suppliers are lined up, molds have been made, test orders have been placed, machinery has been purchased, and we are refining the production process right now. We will have challenges. Nothing comes easy. But we will communicate with you frequently and honestly through the whole process.\nBoardGameTables.com's flagship product is Custom Board Game Tables.\nWith custom tables, we don't start building anything until you order. And then your table goes through a one-off build process. Over 60 different sizes are available. Over 30 different wood and stain combinations. Two dozen fabric colors. And more options and accessories than you can shake a stick at (what does that expression even mean?!).\nThis means you get the perfect table for your situation. In fact, I don't think we have ever built two identical tables. It means that each table is essentially a custom woodworking project. So, the typical custom table costs between $2,500 and $5,500.\nYou can build your dream table at https://www.boardgametables.com/builder/size.\nThe Jasper greatly reduces costs by:\nReducing the options and standardizing the build process. We took the most popular/versatile size/features from the custom tables and designed the one table that will work for the most gamers.\nRequiring some assembly at home. Will assembly at home ever be as good as professionally screwed-and-glued joints done by wood workers? No. But we can get pretty close and it provides excellent cost savings.\nReducing shipping costs. Custom tables have to be shipped on a pallet by a semi-truck. It costs about $300 for shipping. Home assembly means we can fit the table in a smaller box that can be shipped by UPS. It allows shipping costs to start at $69.\nAbout 2 years ago, we ran a Kickstarter campaign for a game table called The Duchess. That campaign raised over $2.5 million. We sold over 3,500 Duchess tables.\nThe Duchess was the first mass produced board gaming table ever. It was about 1/3 the price of anything else on the market. It made gaming tables accessible to people who never thought they'd be able to get one. I am very proud of The Duchess.\nHowever, we had some challenges along the way. We were not able to produce the tables as quickly as we had planned and the percentages of tables damaged in shipment was higher than it should have been. We replaced everyone's damaged pieces, and have made changes to The Jasper to directly address these issues.\nRead the campaign FAQ for more details about the difference between The Duchess and The Jasper.\nMore Info\nHaven't seen enough pictures?

Delicious. Satisfying. \nIce Cream for your Keto Journey. \nAbout Us\nWe're Gabby & Chris, the founders of Keto Pint. We create innovative and healthy dessert options to fit into your everyday healthy lifestyle. Our mission is to reduce levels of cardiovascular disease by providing the lowest sugar dessert options on the market. Crowdfunding keeps us independent of outside investment, letting us prioritize revolutionary dessert innovation, customer satisfaction, and an extraordinary experience. \nKeto Pint was born due to our frustration with ice cream offerings while on our low carb, no added sugar diet. No ice cream was low enough in carbs and every low carb option had added sugar in the pints. We were determined to change that. So, we created the first premium, small batch, Keto Ice Cream, made with no added sugar.\nFirst Micro-Creamery\nWe are the first Micro-Creamery in the U.S. based out of Portland, Oregon. This makes us different from all of our competitors. \nWhat is a Micro-Creamery\nA Micro-Creamery refers to our small batch process of making our ice cream. We use a revolutionary long-time, long-term pasteurization process, which drastically changes the texture, quality and scoopability of our ice cream. You deserve the best and that is what we promise to provide you. You will definitely be able to taste our Micro-Creamery difference.\nNew York Times Recognized Product Development Team\nThe most humbling experience. Our Product Development Team was recently featured in a New York Times best selling article.

We are making every Keto and Diabetics dream come true... ICE CREAM WITHOUT SUGAR! Don\u2019t let the no added sugar deter you, we have been in development for the past 12 months to bring you the best tasting ice cream, packed with flavor. \nWhat unique flavors are we talking about?

What is Keto Ice Cream? \nKeto Ice Cream is an ice cream that follows the macro nutritional values of a keto based diet. Keto Ice Cream uses an ice cream base that has low net carbs, high fat, and no added sugar, while maintaining impeccable flavor and texture. \nThe Keto Pint uses ingredients that PHDs and Dietary Nutritionists recommend for a Keto Based Diet including Unadulterated Heavy Cream, Erythritol, Monk Fruit Extract, Stevia, Whole Eggs, and Chicory Root Fiber. \nIt is critical to select food that has not been processed and tampered to ensure its nutritional integrity. That is why all of our products will be Gluten Free, Non-GMO, Organic, No Added Sugar, No Corn, No Soy, and No Artificial Ingredients.  \n7. What is Keto and how will it benefit me?\nAs explained by Scott Keatley, R.D. of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy, states Keto \u201cis all about minimizing your carbs and upping your fats to get your body to use fat as a form of energy. While everyone's body and needs are slightly different, that typically translates to: 60-75% of your calories from fat, 15-30% of your calories from protein, and 5-10% of your calories from carbs.\u201d\nThe predominant storage for energy comes in the form of sugar and carbohydrates, which our body transforms into Glucose. This form of energy, glucose, is use and stored as glycogen in liver and muscle tissue.\nThe goal of Keto is to put our bodies into a state of Ketosis, a normal metabolic process that shifts our energy source from glucose to ketones. Ketones are an alternative energy source when you don\u2019t have enough insulin in your body to turn glucose into energy. Instead, your liver turns fat into a secondary energy source, called Ketones. \nThere have been many studies conducted on the benefits of the Keto Diet, which include, but not limited to:\nWeight Loss by suppressing appetite \nIncreased Sustainable Energy\nIncreased levels of HDL (\u201cGood\u201d Cholestrol\nReduced blood sugar and insulin level (Improve Diabetes)\nDecreased Blood Pressure\nReduce metabolic disorders\nEliminates Cancer Cells\nWe highly recommend reading the following articles explaining the various research conducted on the Ketogenic diet and its various benefits:\nKetogenic Diet Basics: https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19434332/what-is-the-keto-diet/\nKeto Diet, A Dietician\u2019s Perspective: http://theconversation.com/keto-diet-a-dietitian-on-what-you-need-to-know-99867  \nKeto Diet Transformations: https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Keto-Diet-Weight-Loss-Transformation-44173272\nKeto Diet Benefits: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319196.php\nKeto Diet Increases Memory: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319287.php\nKetogenic Diet Helps Endurance Performance: https://www.perfectketo.com/use-ketogenic-diet-physical-performance/\n8. Why do you incorporate additional protein?\nThe Keto Diet is known for being low-carb, high fat. But what about protein?\nProtein is a building block of life, essential amino acids necessary for any diet. Protein is critical for:\nBuilding muscle mass through protein synthesis\nCutting Body fat and building lean muscle\nSkin and Bone health\nHealthy Brain Function\nReduce appetite and hunger\nBoost metabolism and increase fat burning\nMany ketogenic dieters are fearful that excess protein will kick them out of a state of ketosis, however, protein WILL NOT affect Ketone levels. \nThe Keto Pint team places a large importance on nutritional components that make healthy living as easy as possible. We believe that a healthy diet can change the trajectory of one\u2019s life, and protein is a vital source that sustains critical bodily functioning to its optimal state! \nFor more information, please read the following article: https://www.perfectketo.com/how-too-much-protein-is-bad-for-ketosis/\n9. How do you ship ice cream without it melting? \nKeto pints are shipped in an insulated box with a block of dry ice. Considering dry ice has a temperature of -109 degrees Fahrenheit, this will keep your decadent ice cream frozen while in transit.\n\n   To ensure your ice cream arrives frozen, we ship via two-day delivery to all 50 states.\n\n   What\u2019s better than having ice cream arrive at your front door? And the crowd went silent\u2026", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any new product development, considerable risks must be acknowledged, including, but not limited to:\n\n1. Finding a commercialized Co-Packer with experience in like-minded products\n2. Scaling an ice cream recipe from small batch to commercialized batch\n3. Not being able to source ingredients on a large scale\n4. Miscalculation of overrun percentage when producing ice cream for the first time\n5. Pint suppliers delay the approval of packaging designs and color schema\n6. Complications in LTL shipping from Co-Packer\u2019s facility to Cold Storage, resulting in obsolete inventory \n7. Issues with Direct-To-Consumer shipping, as Dry Ice has the potential of melting before shipment is received\n\nWe have taken the following measures in order to remediate any potential issues arising above:\n\n1. The Keto Pint Team has structured an agreement with Alpenrose Dairy, a family owned dairy since 1916, that has produced ice cream for over 50 years, including Baskin Robbins! In addition, our team has over two years of experience in producing remarkable ice cream.\n\n2. The Keto Pint team has worked with one of the nation\u2019s most notable product development experts who has been featured in the NY Times best selling article! She has scaled over 15 companies from homemade, to commercialization, and has not experienced any issues along the way. \n\n3. The Keto Pint team has partnered with an ingredient sourcing team that blends and agitates our unique formulation, offering a turn-key solution for our Co-Packers to use on site. We have two years of experience sourcing the best, all natural ingredients, and will provide the same operational processes to the Keto Pint.\n\n4. As mentioned in #2, we have worked with one of the nation\u2019s most notable product development experts to ensure our overrun and viscosity is precisely calculated. We feel confident in our ability to determine the correct overrun to ensure the best tasting Keto ice cream! \n\n5. The Keto Pint has outsourced its pint packaging design to a Portland Graphic Designer that has over 10 years of experience designing and developing like minded packaging for other product lines. In addition, the Keto Pint team has all of the connections and templates in place to ensure appropriate approval is received by our pint suppliers. \n\n6.

Perfectly scaled for roleplaying, the PVC miniatures come fully pre-assembled and ready to paint and play right out the box.\nCritical Role is a weekly livestreamed roleplaying game set in Exandria, which is the world created by veteran voice actor and Dungeon Master, Matthew Mercer. Each week, Matthew leads his friends (also fellow voice actors!) on epic adventures.  \nThe first Critical Role campaign centered on the ragtag group of heroes in Tal'Dorei known as Vox Machina \u2014 Pike Trickfoot, the Gnome Cleric, Keyleth, the Half-Elf Druid, Percival \u201cPercy\u201d Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo, the Human Gunslinger, Grog Strongjaw, the Goliath Barbarian, Scanlan Shorthalt the Gnome Bard, Taryon \u201cTary\u201d Darrington, the Human Artificer, Vex\u2019ahlia (and her animal companion, a bear named Trinket), the Half-Elf Ranger and Vax\u2019ildan, the Half-Elf Rogue. The first campaign ended in November 2017 after 115 episodes and 373 hours of gameplay.\nCritical Role is now in its second campaign, in which the Mighty Nein begin their adventures together in Wildemount. The Mighty Nein consists of Yasha, the Aasimar Barbarian, Beauregard, the Human Monk, Mollymauk Tealeaf, the Tiefling Blood Hunter, Fjord, the Half-Orc Warlock, Nott the Brave, the Goblin Rogue, Jester, the Tiefling Cleric, and Caleb Widogast, the Human Wizard. Shak\u00e4ste, a human cleric, has proven himself to be a trusted ally of the Mighty Nein.\nVox Machina Party\nFrom Tal\u2019Dorei they hail. Whether cleansing the underdark of an aberrant scourge or preventing a would-be god from destroying the globe, this motley troupe of wayward souls - Keyleth, Vax'ildan, Vex\u2019ahlia (and Trinket!), Grog, Scanlan, Percy & Pike - are the greatest heroes the world of Exandria has ever seen.\nMighty Nein Party\nFjord, Beau, Caleb, Nott, Jester, Mollymauk, Yasha, and their ally Shak\u00e4ste... names that breed fear into the hearts of Wildemount\u2019s foulest foes. On a mission for fortune and glory, these fledgling adventurers may one day be the saviors of the Dwendalian Empire - if they can outrun the shadows of their storied pasts.\nCRITTERS PLEDGE $60/\u00a345\nWe anticipate that many of you looking at this Kickstarter are brand new to crowd-funding. Which means we took the decision to keep things as simple as we can. Historically most Kickstarter projects tend to charge a little bit more for the initial offering than they strictly need to and then \u2018bump\u2019 up the perceived value through stretch goals and other complicated ideas like that\u2026it can end up being very daunting to work out what pledge levels go with what and how much you need to commit etc. \nSo to avoid this confusion, for this Kickstarter we have simply given you one pledge level at an amazingly good price. This means that pledge level already includes all the Kickstarter exclusives and no Stretch Goals will be available during the campaign. What you see, is what you get...simple! \nHowever, the world of Exandria is a rich and detailed place with many wonderful characters worthy of making into miniatures. Rest assured, this is just the beginning of this journey for all of us...and don't forget, we're all ridiculously excited about this project and working hand in hand with CR over the coming years to bring the for world of Tal'dorei to your homes. And hey, who knows what random encounters might happen over the course of the KS campaign. \nSo just one question remains: How do you want to do this?\nCaleb Widogast and Frumpkin\nAfter investing heavily in our advanced miniatures development pipeline and working closely with carefully selected manufacturing partners, the quality and detail produced in our industry-leading miniatures is simply world-class. \nKickstarter Exclusive miniatures\nEvery highly-detailed mini is a fully pre-assembled PVC model, ready to paint and play straight out the box.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping. \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs: \n\u2022 United Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers)\n\u2022 USA (US backers)\n\u2022 Canada (Canada backers)\n\u2022 Germany (EU backers)\n\u2022 China (Asia Pacific backers)\n\u2022 Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) \nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping the sets (2kg volumetric weight). These are just estimates, and may change: \n\u2022 UNITED KINGDOM: \u00a36. Channel Islands, Highlands and NI \u00a36-\u00a313 \n\u2022 USA: \u00a37-\u00a311 to the contiguous US and the US Virgin Islands. \u00a317-20 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \n\u2022 CANADA: \u00a37-\u00a315 to most cities. \n\u2022 EUROPE: \u00a38-\u00a320 to most countries. \u00a320-\u00a330 to non-EU countries. \n\u2022 LATIN AMERICA: \u00a325-\u00a340 to most countries. \n\u2022 ASIA: \u00a315-\u00a325 to most countries.\n\u2022 OCEANIA: \u00a39-\u00a318 to Australia and New Zealand. \n\u2022 AFRICA/OTHER: \u00a325-\u00a350 to most countries. \nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the UK hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs.\nBelow is the general schedule once the Kickstarter ends so you know when to expect money to be taken and our overall shipping plan. Again these are estimates: \nKickstarter Campaign Ends \n\u2022 0 Day \u2013 Pledges are charged. \n\u2022 1 Week \u2013 Survey sent confirming emails. \n\u2022 1-2 Months \u2013 Pledge Manager sent to backers taking payment for shipping. \n\u2022 1 Month Before Shipping \u2013 Pledge Manager deadline - any late confirmations after this deadline will be shipped from the UK after all other pledges are completed and may incur additional cost. \nShipping Starts \n\u2022 0 Days \u2013 China starts packing EU/AUS/US hub orders.

These stories can include sorcerers with dark secrets, rogues who covertly steal from paladins and clerics, or waifs who fall in love with high elf nobles. Parties that create conflict, fascination, and spectacle are built out of contrasts and compliments.\nHere are the miniatures planned so far!\nWith the Stonehaven Adventurers 2018 project, we are creating Adventuring Parties that have a mix of races and classes. We want to make a lot of miniatures, so we will be adding additional minis via stretch goals as the total pledge amount grows. The minis can be added individually with prices dependent on size. \nHuman, dwarf, half-elf, and owlfolk sized miniatures: $5\nKobold and goblin sized miniatures: $4\nGrippli, mechanical, and child sized miniatures: $3\nDwarf riding a Yak sized miniatures: $12\nThe miniatures will be made of 100% lead free pewter, and some assembly will be required. They will be sculpted on the standard 28 mm scale. Round bases will be included. \nAnd now we present your Adventuring Parties!\nPictured from left to right: Male Human Ranger, Male Goblin Archer, Female Human Sorcerer, Female Grippli Druid, Male Human Adept.\nWhen the west gate was breached, a handful of citizens held the gap for hours while the city's beleaguered engineers moved the chevaux de frise into place. The survivors of that fateful day still meet yearly at the Westgate Tavern to commiserate and remember those who fell. \nPictured from left to right: Male Kobold Monk, Male Human Berserker, Male Owlfolk Wizard, Male Grippli Mage, Female Half-elf Monk.\nEver since the hordes of Orcs swarmed from the great city following the call of the All-Render, Ermcrest, once an Orcish slum, has become a haven for criminals and others seeking to avoid the watchful eyes of the law. Despite the borough's ill-repute, efforts are being made to establish a semblance of order. The Ermcrest Volunteer Watch does its best to keep the peace, to little effect.\nPictured from left to right: Female Human Thief, Female Half-Elf Witch with Ferret, Male Owlfolk Rogue, Male Kobold Fighter, Male Dwarf Ranger.\nThe Skull Stabbers are a ragtag group of thieves and would-be assassins looking to make a name for themselves. Assembled by the now infamous Ralph the Old, they are available for hire to stab things, especially skulls, and all at a budget rate!\nPictured from left to right: Male Human Loremaster, Mechanical Berserker, Female Owlfolk Fighter, Mechanical Wizard, and Female Half-Elf Cleric.\nFor those in need of extra security (. . .against the Skull Stabbers?), the Protection Services Adventuring Party can act as bodyguards and consultants. They take your security seriously, because if you die, they are contractually obligated to offer a full refund to your surviving relatives.\nPictured from left to right: Male Human Hireling, Male Kobold Warrior, Female Human Elementalist, Male Human Guardsman, and Female Human Apprentice.\nThe Silent Eye watches all. It observes, learning from its surroundings and from the acts of others. The Temples of the Silent Eye are open to all who seek healing or wisdom, for what is learned should be shared and used for good. The members of The Silent Eye Adventuring Party seek to do just that: to learn through observation and to apply that knowledge, increasing the goodness of the world. Is there some sinister element secretly directing the actions of this outwardly virtuous group for their own nefarious purposes? Probably.\nThis last group is not officially a party, but you can get them all by pledging for the Completionist 2018 reward! You can also get them as individual add-ons!\nPictured from left to right: Male DwarvenTeifling, Owlfolk Child Archer (locked), Male Dwarven Wizard, Yak Mount, Male Mounted Dwarf Brewmaster, Male Dwarven Musician, Owlfolk Child Mechanist, Male Grippli Undead.\nWe've already reached a lot of stretch goals! Here are the ones that are coming up soon:\nWe reached $18,125! Celinia Di Loreto the Female Human Apprentice will be added to the Silent Eye Adventuring Party and is available to add to your reward as a single mini ($5.00). Celinia entered the service of the Silent Eye as a child. Although she is now of age to join the Sisterhood, she is still very much a child in many ways.\nWe reached $18,750! Serra Kayakomsin, Half-Elf Cleric, will be added to the Protection Services Adventuring Party and available to add to your reward as a single mini ($5.00). Who is Serra Kayakomsin? The Kayakomsin family has run the Strymian smuggling tunnels for generations, growing rich and powerful from their ill-gotten gains. Serra has left that life for one of faith, but sometimes skeletons just won't stay in the closet. That's what turn undead is for I guess.\nWe reached $19,375! Halfdan Borgarson, Male Human Guardsman, will added to the Silent Eye Adventuring Party and is available to add to your reward as a single mini ($5.00). While fighting in the Dark War, Halfdan was taken prisoner by drow mercenaries. Seven months later he was spotted in the upper tunnels, wide-eyed and feral. Though weaponless, it took five dwarven patrolmen to subdue him. Servants of the Silent Eye took pity on Halfdan and brought him to their sanctuaries, where they have begun to heal his shattered mind.\nWe reached $20,000! The remaining members of The Silent Eye have been unlocked!  They are available to add individually to your reward as well. This ]includes the Male Human Hireling ($5.00), The Male Kobold Warrior ($4.00), and the Female Human Elementalist ($5.00).\nWe reached $21,000! Brewmaster Grymm, Male Mounted Dwarf Brewmaster and Esmeralda, Yak Mount, have been added to the Completionist 2018 reward level and available to add to your reward for $12(combined). The pair will count as 2 miniatures for the purposes of rewards and will come as separate parts. Brewmaster Grymm and Esmeralda make a formidable fighting team with Grymm hurling insults and carefully brewed ales and Esmeralda pretty much destroying everything in their path. \nWe reached $23,000! Jedrian Earthbreaker the Male Dwarven Wizard has been added to the Completionist 2018 reward level and available to add to your project as a single miniature ($5.00). From a young age, Jedrian felt the call of the stone. Like decent dwarves, his parents steered him away from the arcane. But the lure of the ancient knowledge was too strong, and the voice of the mountain could not be ignored.\nWe reached $25,000! Darvinius Winderchime, Male Dwarven Musician, has been added to the Completionist 2018 Reward level and is available to add to your reward as a single miniature for $5. When Darvinius first laid his hands on a harp as a mere child of ten, it was as if he already had the knowledge that only years of practice can acquire. Minutes later, he had stolen that harp (having lulled the original owners into a peaceful slumber with his newly-discovered harpsical prowess!).\nWe reached $27,500! Orvinir Relsch, Male Dwarven Tiefling, has been added to the Completionist Set and is available to add to your reward as a single mini ($5.00). Orvinir's bloodline has been cursed through their mercantile dealings with the infernal plane. That being said, Orvinir is the first in a long time to manifest the curse physically, and the rest of the family is doing extremely well for themselves.\nWe reached $30,000!

We are a very small family business in Fort Collins, CO.\nThe DoorAjar replaces the normal strike plate on an interior door and allows the door to be easily secured in two positions - slightly ajar and fully closed.  The part requires only the two normal strike plate mounting screws and allows the door to be opened and closed like normal.  Though simple, the DoorAjar holds the door very securely in the slightly ajar position - the door can't be pushed open or closed by a pet or person.\nDoorAjar in place of normal strike plate\nPLAY\n\nBackground\nThe idea for the DoorAjar came from a very simple need - gerbils and cats.  We wanted our youngest son's door open for air circulation, but closed to keep the cats away from the gerbil cage.  Also, we wanted to be able to easily close the door at night for fire safety.  I needed to find a way to easily latch the door in two positions - slightly open and the normal closed position. I was disappointed to find that the solutions available on the market were complicated and clunky. All of the solutions required a strap that had to be disconnected, a jamb that had to be moved, or an extension that had to be removed to allow the door to close fully. There were no solutions that allowed you to simply close the door in two different positions.  \nWe started experimenting with different prototypes - gluing together strike plates, designing on our home computer, and endless plastic prototypes on our 3D printer.  We love the process of inventing! \nMany design iterations and prototypes\nEventually we landed on an incredibly simple, patent pending, one piece design. To mount it, you simply remove the standard strike plate screws and use the same two screws to attach the DoorAjar in its place. The design allows you to secure the door either fully closed or slightly open simply by turning the doorknob - no other motions or steps are needed. While simple looking, the shape and angles of the product are quite exact and required a lot of design and iteration to allow the DoorAjar to function properly. The flexible material means that you can accidentally run into the DoorAjar without breaking it or injuring yourself.   \nPLAY\n\nKeep the Pets Out and the Air Moving\nOur testers have found two primary uses for the DoorAjar: keeping pets out of a room and maintaining good air flow.   Perhaps you have...\nA room that you\u2019d like closed off, but you want the door slightly open to maintain air flow and keep the room from getting stale - like a spare bedroom or laundry room \nA house with roommates where you\u2019d like to close the door for some privacy, but not be totally closed off\nA dog or cat that you need to keep out of a room\nA bedroom that you\u2019d like to have a little open during the day, but able to easily close at night.\nOnce you have a DoorAjar, you realize how nice it is to have two possible closed positions.   \nOur Project Goal  \nWith our design complete and prototypes working in many homes of friends and family, all we need now is a true injection molded part. This will help us reduce the cost, further improve the material properties, and allow us to make higher quantities. That is where this Kickstarter project comes in. We are raising enough money to pay for the injection molding tooling and to run the needed number of parts. It\u2019s important to us to produce the product locally, so we\u2019ve partnered with a local tool maker and molder here in northern Colorado and have secured a quote for our mold tooling and parts. Once our goal is reached, the tooling will be ordered and parts will be ready to ship in 6-8 weeks.  \nAbout Colors  \nWe plan to produce the DoorAjar in two colors that you can choose from in the Rewards - \"White\" and \"Nickel\" (for a plastic approximation of Brushed Nickel).\nPrototypes \nYou'll notice two versions of the DoorAjar in our videos and pictures - a slightly transparent and \"rough\" version, and a white, precise, and well-formed version.  The white version is a purchased stereolithography (SLA) part that we purchased to check exact dimensions and show what the final molded parts will look like.  The slightly rough, slightly transparent versions are fused deposition modeling (FDM) parts. They are printed on our 3D printer at home out of a flexible and tough nylon that is closer to the functionality of the final part.  Our 3D printer was critical in developing the exact shape and material choice to get just the function of the DoorAjar that we wanted.  \nSLA and FDM Prototypes\nEuropean Customers\nGiven interest from Europe, I've added this shipping option.  Note that shipping to Europe adds $11 and make sure to check your door hardware to ensure that the DoorAjar will work.  \nThank You!\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed hearing about our project. We\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll find the DoorAjar very useful in unexpected ways, just as we have. Thank you very much for your support and please pass this along to friends and family.

While printing, shipping, and processing delays are always a possibility, we have set a reasonable delivery date based on our experience.\n\nRefunds\nIf you'd like a refund before your item ships, you have until one week before the scheduled ship date to request one. We can offer you a 90% refund since Kickstarter retains about 10% of your pledge for various fees. If there is something wrong with your item, we appreciate the opportunity to replace or exchange it. If a refund is preferred and there is no defect with the product, you'll be responsible for shipping it back to us. Upon receipt of the returned item, we'll issue you a 90% refund. Refund requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.\n\nReplacements \nWe are always happy to replace defective or damaged dice. Just send us photos of the damage, and we will ship a replacement at no additional cost to you. If your item needs to be returned, we will cover the cost of the return shipping. We provide replacement pieces while titles are active in our catalog, which is typically at least a year after their initial printing. Replacement requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.\n\nExchanges\nSometimes you may get a set of PolyHero Dice and realize that, even if there isn't anything wrong with them, you don't like them as much in person. That's OK! In this case, you'd cover the cost to ship them back to us, but we would ship you a new set of dice in your chosen color at no additional cost to you.

First, press lightly on top of the \"wings\" in the center of the battery holder to make them bend slightly downward.  If that does not improve connectivity, try using a small metal file or similar object to scrape off any oxidization on the pad below the battery holder. See the pictures below. How you remove the battery depends on how you installed the Grimlight. If you can access the circuit, simply pushing the battery gently from the side with a blunt object is enough. You can also use your magnet to remove a battery if you cant access the circuit itself (i.e. if you mounted in in a miniature base). When you mount it, you can either place it upside down for easier access to the battery or mount it so that you leave the maximum amount of space available for the battery to slide out."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Store is up!

Don't see your favorite RPG system on this list? Let us know! We may be able to add more compatible systems based on backer feedback.\nWhen playing tabletop RPGs, there are lots of different actions you can take. This can be daunting for new players. Take out the guess-work and confusion. Our Action Cards provide an easy reference. Use them as a general guide or play them onto the table during your turn.\nThe set shown above is designed for Fifth Edition (5e); it provides cards for standard actions, movement types, bonus actions, and reactions. 5e Action Cards have the standard combat actions (\"Combat Actions,\" Player Basic Rules, page 71)--everything from making a melee attack to casting a spell. Don't play 5th edition? Let us know what other game systems you'd like to see supported as an alternative set for this kickstarter.\nIf you play Savage Worlds, we will be providing an alternative set of Savage Worlds Action Cards!

There are lots of different dice in role-playing games. Quickly find the right one by using our dice system. We've designed a color-coded set that makes it easy to pick the right die every time. It's great for both new players and seasoned players in order to quickly find the right die. Get multiple sets to make rolling damage rolls even easier.\n    Because rolling dice is a such core part of any role-playing game, you need a place to roll that can keep the dice on the table.

The comic follows Binwin as he attempts to teach four level-none Minions what it means to be adventurers. In return, they'll teach Binwin what it means to be a family... or something.\nThis Kickstarter collects the first season of Binwin\u2019s Minions into the gloriously antiquated hardcopy format. But have no fear digiphiles, you can read Binwin\u2019s Minions every Friday on TableTitans.com where it is permanently entombed in the interwebs.\n  Only the mightiest, fightiest, dwarfiest, dwarf to ever wield an axe. Binwin Bronzebottom has lived an epic life and is known far and wide by many names: Bane of the Frost Giants, Puncher of Dragons, Slayer of Ale, the list is extensive. He has traveled the land on many dangerous quests and acquired more loot than any one dwarf can spend, unless that dwarf happens to be named Binwin\u2026 because he spent it all and now he\u2019s broke. A little older but not much wiser, Binwin has set out to assemble a group of fresh-faced adventurers to take on all the risks while he reaps all the rewards.\n  Unlike Binwin, there\u2019s not much to say about the Minions. There\u2019s a Warrior, a Wizard, a Druid, and a Thief, but don\u2019t bother learning their names--they\u2019ll all be dead by the time you finish reading this.\n  Beautiful books designed by famed art director, Keith Wood, in both a Softcover Retail editions and a glorious Collector's Hardcover. There are also Extras and Add-ons, but seriously get dem books!\n                          To each their own! Pick the loot that's right for you.

We\u2019d like to see if you think so, too!\nBones are still really expensive to produce, and we still need your help to expand the line. Your support makes the molds that we need to produce the figures, and in exchange you get the first crack at these figures for a fantastic deal!\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot since we fulfilled our first Bones Kickstarter project, so you won\u2019t find as many pledge levels or confusing options.

After we hit our goal, we have plans to make the value of your pledge grow. All we need is your support!!!\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nBones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade. Inexpensive, high quality, soft gaming models that are easy and fun to paint and won't break when you actually use them for games! \n  All Backers must use the Reaper Pledge Manager to select their rewards and provide shipping information\n          ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories: \n1) Overall Non-completion \n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates \n3) We do not produce a specific model or change a specific model\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and delays. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to buy it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is with within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored. \n \nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by July 31 2018 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after July 31, 2018. \n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after July 31, 2018) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit. \n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery.

In the book we're producing with this Kickstarter, Alison investigates a string of murders, encounters a mysterious figure from her past, and tries to make a difference in a world where the problems are much bigger and more complex than simply punching supervillains. \nSFP is a webcomic written by Brennan Lee Mulligan and drawn by Molly Ostertag, and has updated twice weekly online since 2012. You can read all six chapters for free at www.strongfemaleprotagonist.com! \nWe've done this before! In the summer of 2014 we successfully Kickstarted the first volume (chapters 1 - 4), raising $60,974 from 1,967 backers, and producing a beautiful graphic novel. Bringing the first book of Strong Female Protagonist to print made it easier to share with others, brought in new readers, and helped us to continue making the webcomic. \nWith this Kickstarter, we hope to publish the fifth and sixth chapters (300+ pages), as well as bonus content, in a full color paperback volume. Strong Female Protagonist is and has always been a labor of love, and Kickstarter is the perfect platform for us to fund this book. We are both artists and paying printing costs up front is not an option - we need you, readers old and new, to take SFP from the web to the printed page. \nIf you're a fan but can't contribute financially, we really appreciate when readers spread the word about the comic and this Kickstarter! We don't advertise anywhere, so the only way people can find us is through word of mouth.\nClick to see larger version\nAlison Green used to be a superhero. With her seemingly unlimited strength and invulnerability, she was one of the most powerful around, fighting crime with other teenagers under the alter ego Mega Girl. All that changed after an encounter with Menace, her mind-reading arch enemy, who showed her evidence of a sinister conspiracy that made battling giant robots seem suddenly unimportant.\nMenace retired and the remaining supervillains were put behind bars, and left with no one to fight, Alison unmasked herself on national television. Now she's going to college in New York City, trying to find ways to actually help the world while making friends and getting to class on time. It's impossible to escape the past, however, and trouble comes in the form of mysterious murders, ex-teammates with a grudge, robots with a strange sense of humor, an inconvenient crush, a cantankerous professor, and many different kinds of people who think they know the best way to be a hero.\nYou can read the whole comic here and check out the cast here. \nBrennan Lee Mulligan (@BrennanLM) is a screenwriter and house improviser at the Upright Citizen's Brigade theatre. Molly Ostertag (@MollyOstertag) is a cartoonist, illustrator, and SVA graduate, with books coming out from First Second and Scholastic. We met at a LARP camp when we were teenagers and have been creatively collaborating ever since. We started Strong Female Protagonist because we both wanted to make a story that portrayed a female protagonist in a way we felt was missing from mainstream media. Also, we wanted an excuse to spend hours discussing the mechanics of how an invulnerable person would get her hair cut!\nWe're partnering with Topatoco and Make That Thing to fulfill this Kickstarter to make sure shipping goes smoothly and efficiently. They're total pros and we're excited about working together!\nWe partnered with Top Shelf/IDW Publishing to distribute Volume 1, and we'll be doing the same for Volume 2, so in 2018 this book will find its way into bookstores everywhere! (Kickstarter backers will get it first, though)\nAll rewards include US shipping costs. There are additional costs for outside the US, which we've tried to make as low as possible. \n Here's what you can get with each reward tier!

Here's what some cool people have said about our comic:\n\"What could be a gimmicky setup rises far beyond cliche, bringing new questions about vigilantism, justice, and heroics to the field ... Humor is hard to get right, but humor with a serious message is even harder. Mulligan and Ostertag's creation strikes just the right balance. It's super.\"\n-Cory Doctorow, Boing Boing\n\"Strong Female Protagonist ... is the perfect superhero comic for people who aren\u2019t really interested in the superhero genre. Actually, it\u2019s also a pretty perfect comic for people who are interested in superheroes.\"\n-Mey Rude, Autostraddle.com\n\"Brennan Lee Mulligan and Molly Ostertag ... deliberately shatter some stereotypes with a story of their own\u2014a story about a young woman who is strong in every sense of the word.\"\n-Joshua Rivera, Entertainment Weekly\n\"A smartly written and emotional exploration of the morality of superheroes.\"\n-Lauren Davis, io9\n\"Over the four-plus years that SFP has been running, both Alison and the comic have grown and developed in complex and remarkable ways.\"\n-Charlotte Reber, Book Riot\nThanks so much for reading!\nMolly and Brennan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis campaign is a safe bet!

But after several years, my erasable tiles are getting pretty scratched and gummed up from transport and use ... so, it is time to retire them.\nShopping for replacements I've found some thin knock-offs, some really large tiles, and some extremely expensive sets ... but nothing that fit both my needs and my budget.\nThis reminded me of the predicament that led to the initial development of Gaming Paper back in 2009. So I began to wonder if, with everything I've learned over the years, I could make a quality, affordable gaming tile product to fill the niche I'd found in the market? \nHello, I am Gaming Paper Tiles!\nWe interviewed GMs who used erasable tiles to find out what other folks thought was important, and then we started designing. What we've come up with is pretty amazing and I am proud of the design and the functionality.\nThe tiles are 8\"x11\".

And now, Doug Kovacs will illustrate the endsheets to HTWAMTDS!\nMany years ago, when Goodman Games was first starting out, many sage elders in the industry gave Joseph Goodman advice on what to publish. The most common advice received was: \"Don\u2019t publish adventure modules. They don\u2019t sell.\"\nWhat we have learned since then is that advice is largely true. Poorly written, uninteresting, uninspired adventure modules do not sell.\nBut the good adventure modules \u2013 the exciting ones \u2013 that ones that read well and play well at the table \u2013 they become treasured memories for us all. They become legends. These adventures are the shared experience that builds our community. We remember our exploits, ask each other how a different group handled that encounter, and lament the secret doors we may have missed. We tell our friends about the climactic finale; we are in turns surprised and devastated and thrilled as we navigate the encounters. And most importantly, if an adventure is fun to play \u2013 if the game master and the players both have a blast \u2013 then we tell our friends, and they play, and they tell their friends, and that adventure becomes a community builder. It is played thousands and thousands of times. It becomes a legend.\nThis book is about how to create tabletop RPG adventures that become those legends. This book is about how to write great adventure modules \u2013 the ones that gamers can\u2019t stop talking about.\nWhat Is This Kickstarter For?\nThis Kickstarter funds the creation of a printed book called How To Write Adventure Modules That Don\u2019t Suck. Depending on stretch goals, it will be published in either softcover or hardcover format, possibly with other stretch goals as well. The estimated length is 160 pages. In addition, another book called The Adventurers Almanac is funded by this Kickstarter. The Adventurers Almanac, by Michael Curtis, provides a wealth of additional material to inspire a gamemaster in the direction of their campaign.\nGoodman Games has published more than 200 adventures and built an institutional knowledge on how to write adventure modules that don\u2019t suck. Many of our adventures are \u201cmodern classics\u201d that have been in print for many years, in some cases earning a 2nd, 3rd, or even 4th printing as they continue to sell year after year. For years we have run seminars at Gen Con and other conventions by this same name, How to Write Adventure Modules That Don\u2019t Suck.\nThe book How to Write Adventure Modules that Don\u2019t Suck consolidates all that institutional advice, all those great seminar discussions, all of our hard-earned lessons and experience, into an easy-to-digest format. Twenty five authors, all of them with impressive credits in RPG adventure design, have written themed articles addressing a wide variety of topics. Along with each article, each author has provided a fantasy RPG encounter that demonstrates the concepts they address.\nThe book is designed to be usable with any RPG, in any genre, under any rules set. Developer James M. Ward has hand-selected the authors and managed the topics to maximize the utility of the book. You can read the book straight through, or flip to the section that addresses your specific concerns. By the time you\u2019re done reading the book, your own adventure-writing efforts will improve. Mr. Ward says it best in his introduction:\nThis is the primer that every game designer needs to have on his bookshelf. I\u2019ve been in the role-playing game design industry for more than forty years. In many of those years my products were the best selling products out that year. I learned many new things from this set of articles. I have learned things that have improved my design skills, so I know they will improve yours as well.\n Not Just Essays: Adventure Starters, Too\nAs part of the writing process, we asked each contributor to write an essay with adventure-design advice. We also asked each contributor to write a short encounter that put their advice to use. These encounters are \"adventure starters\" - ready-to-go material for you as the game master to use! If you're stuck on while writing your own adventure, you can use the essays of advice, or utilize these \"adventure starters\" to build out your own scenario.\nAbout the Contributors\nHow to Write Adventure Modules that Don\u2019t Suck represents the distilled wisdom of a pool of great adventure writers. Fans of Goodman Games and TSR will recognize many of the names and backgrounds. This is certainly not every great adventure writer in the business, but it\u2019s a darn good cross-section. Here is the list of contributors in alphabetical order:\nJobe Bittman has worked as a freelance RPG writer and game designer for nearly a decade. His writing has appeared in publications by Wizards of the Coast, Goodman Games, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, and Kobold Press. Jobe has been privileged with the opportunity to work on professional projects with such gaming legends as James Ward (Metamorphosis Alpha) and Steve Crompton (Grimtooth\u2019s Traps). Goodman Games recently announced Jobe\u2019s latest project, a new RPG adaption of Jack Vance\u2019s Dying Earth.\nMike Breault began working on RPGs in 1984 when he was hired at TSR. Over the next eight years, he contributed to more than 80 games, modules, and hardback rules books published by TSR and Milton Bradley (HeroQuest).

Michael lives in Long Island, NY, with the requisite number of cats for a writer and far too many books.\nChris Doyle began freelance writing in the game industry in the early 1990\u2019s through volunteer efforts with the Role Playing Game Association (RPGA). He has since freelanced for several companies such as TSR, West End Games, Wizards of the Coast, Atlas Games, and Goodman Games. Although he has designed and contributed to RPG source material, the majority of his projects have been the design of adventure modules.

The only difference now is the paycheck. Jon is very passionate about the people who comprise the role-playing and tabletop game community, and they have been very kind and supportive of the work he has created. Jon is by far a Call of Cthulhu guy, and has been fortunate enough to have work published by a variety of Call of Cthulhu publishers, including Goodman Games. His most recent Cthulhu adventure is Age of Cthulhu 9: The Lost Expedition.\nKevin Melka was hired as the RPGA Network\u2019s Tournament Coordinator after a decade of writing and running adventures .

He lives in Salem, MA, with his wife, cat, and puggle.\nLloyd Metcalf began gaming in the early eighties when he and his friends all pitched in for the Basic Red box D&D. From then on, he was always dreaming of other worlds, heroes and spells. Now as an adult, he can hardly believe it is his work to create, illustrate, and produce RPG supplements. It has been just over 30 years of immersion into the game and in the last few, he has been humbled and honored to have worked with many of the people who created and illustrated the game that changed his life. Lloyd\u2019s website is at http://FailSquadGames.com \nBill Olmesdahl has been a DM and player for almost 40 years.

He is grateful to every judge that has ever run one of his adventures; you guys are the ones that make these words alive. \nJim Wampler is currently a writer, editor, and occasional art director and layout monkey for Goodman Games. In addition to the forthcoming Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Jim has written several Metamorphosis Alpha adventures and two sequel adventures for the DCC RPG Purple Planet series for Goodman Games. As overlord of the Dungeon Crawl Cabal, Jim has also overseen a secret cabal of talented writers and artists who have created three DCC RPG tournament funnels for use by the Goodman Games Road Crew.\nJames M. Ward on James M. Ward: I had the distinct pleasure of learning how to play D&D on Gary Gygax\u2019s side porch in 1974. Gary must have seen some spark in me because he allowed me to try my hand at writing Metamorphosis Alpha, the first science fiction role-playing game. I went from writing MA to writing Gamma World, the first apocalypse role-playing game. Over the last forty years or so I\u2019ve written many RPG things with my latest being the 77 Lost Worlds RPG campaign setting. Goodman Games has been kind enough to revive the MA intellectual property and now there are lots of MA adventures and accessories to enjoy; and I thank them for that.\nSkip Williams started running role-playing games in 1975, shortly after meeting a fellow named Gary Gygax.

I wanted something that would excite my players and capture the joy of random loot in video games like Diablo while preserving the wonderful tactility of tabletop gaming. With that goal in mind, I have designed and created item cards which will take the treasure in your game to new heights!\n$3000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock 3 new very rare items for the card pool. Backers at the completionist level will receive the 3 new cards, and they will be added to the card pool for the random loot decks to increase diversity.\n$4000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock a digital guide with recommended rarity distributions for each character tier. This will let you fine tune your random loot decks for your players.\n$5000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock signature weapons for either The Warriors (Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue) or The Spellcasters (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard), based on popular vote. Two powerful, character-defining weapons will be added for each of the classes chosen. Backers at the completionist level will receive the 12 new cards and an add-on will be made available to add these 12 cards to other orders.\n$6000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock blank, fillable cards. Backers at the completionist level will receive 5 blank cards. An add-on will be made available to add 25 blank cards to your order.\n$7000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock signature weapons for either The Warriors (Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue) or The Spellcasters (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard) - whichever was not unlocked at the $5000 level.\n$10000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock a lair pack for either The Alchemist\u2019s Workshop, The Forgotten Crypt, or The Wizard\u2019s Tower. This will contain 10 cards that would be appropriate in the lair chosen by a popular vote.\n$13000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock a lair pack for either The Alchemist\u2019s Workshop, The Forgotten Crypt, or The Wizard\u2019s Tower - one which was not chosen at the 10000 level. This will contain 10 cards that would be appropriate in the lair chosen by a popular vote.\n$18000: Unlock the last lair pack - the one not chosen at the 10000 or 13000 levels.\nYou get 90 item cards printed on high-quality card stock with a linen finish. The decks feature classic magic items such as Potions of Healing and Bags of Holding as well as powerful relics that your players have never seen before. The deck is well-distributed with items ranging from simple treasure to very rare artifacts.\n36 common items\n22 uncommon items\n10 rare items\n4 very rare items\n18 treasure cards\nUse the deck as a game master to give out loot! Your world will come alive as rare and magical items now live in every forgotten keep or noble house. Simply shuffle the deck and deal out a card or two when your players find some loot. Treasure chests, merchants' wares, and wizards' bookshelves can all be filled quickly and on the fly.\nDon't worry - the border misalignment on the card backs has been fixed!\nMy players love these cards. In our last session the rogue of our group was exploring a shady nobleman's house and crept into the study. Inside he found what he was looking for and then turned to me and asked \"Is there a safe in the room?\". I had not even prepared for him to be in the house, let alone a safe, but sure - it made sense that there would be a safe. He found the safe, opened it, and instead of scrambling for an answer I was able to pull out a card from the loot deck to the cheers of the players. Acquiring physical, tactile random items is a wonderful experience that sparks enthusiasm and encourages exploration.\nI simply couldn't fit in all of the items that I wanted to at a reasonable price point, so in the end each item deck will have a selection of cards randomly chosen from a larger pool. Each deck comes with a full 90 cards and is completely usable straight out of the box, however for those who want extra loot you can order extra decks and receive additional unique items!\nThe item selection has been carefully tuned to ensure that a random draw won't turn a level 1 Fighter into a monster-slaying superhero at the expense of their teammates. Each loot deck contains exotic and powerful magic items, but static modifiers that provide potentially unbalancing power boosts have been largely avoided. This allows the deck to be useful at all levels of play and in any campaign!\nThe cards themselves are printed on premium 305gsm black-core matte card stock. A linen finish makes for easy shuffling and helps prevent water damage and staining. The cards are built to look incredible and hold up to the abuse of many long nights of dungeon delving.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there are some timing risks when creating any physical product, I have been through a print run with a trial version of the loot deck and through that have worked out the kinks with the process. A second trial print run is planned before the final run to ensure that the production process has no issues. The cards will be printed through The Game Crafter, who are based in the US and have an excellent reputation. With this experience on hand I expect the production process to go quite smoothly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Loot Deck", "descp": "Get one deck of 90 semi-randomized loot cards.

Our first Kickstarter was a huge success and we've picked up a lot of new fans since then, so with this Kickstarter we're offering both Table Titans Volume 1: First Encounters and Table Titans Volume 2: Winter of the Iron Dwarf as beautifully oversized KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE hardcover books!\nThough our reward tiers with Table Titans Volume 1: First Encounters are VERY LIMITED there's no need to worry; we will always keep the whole comic series FREE TO READ ONLINE AT TABLETITANS.COM!\n  WHAT IF I'VE NEVER PLAYED D&D?\nNo problem! If you like high adventure, swords and sorcery, action, drama, comics, laughing and a whole lot of fun, then Table Titans is for you. It DOESN'T MATTER if you've played D&D. No... seriously, it doesn't matter, but don't be surprised if this comic makes you want to try it out. Whether you're a hardened RPG vet, a casual reader with a slight interest in D&D, or if you just love comics, Table Titans, like any roleplaying game, is about telling good stories.\nBUT I'M NOT IN THE UNITED STATES AND SHIPPING & CUSTOMS FEES ARE OUTRAGEOUS!\nFortunately for you, we've arranged for rewards to ship from various locations around the globe and we're covering the costs of any additional customs fees.

Back through Paypal here.\nMaybe it was some sort of bureaucratic oversight on the part of the divine penitentiary system? Maybe the waning health and advanced age of the Giant's High King caused his children to begin their machinations to seize his power? Perhaps they were awakened by the coming of an even greater threat? Whatever the reason, the Giants have returned! \nEver since we made our second Troll back in 2013 I've wanted to do a project that is all huge-sized characters. I've daydreamed for years about the kinds of shenanigans that a party of trolls, giants, and ents would get up to: What would their motivations be? Who would dare take on a balanced party of huge-class creatures? What kind of force for good (or evil) could they become?\nThis project is our chance to find out! We're going to make a bunch of giants and stuff so we (...and um you too I guess) can create a ton of awesome epic encounters and adventures!\nIn addition to making new huge-sized creatures, we'll also be offering our previously made huge-sized miniatures. You'll be able to get all of these oldies through this project (or on our website during this campaign while supplies last) for their original kickstarter prices! You'll also be able to get a 20% discount on everything else in our store during this kickstarter campaign by entering the coupon code GIANTKICK during the campaign!\nWe've already created 7 Huge Adventurers through our previous projects, and we are planning to make even more through this project, some of which Mike has already begun sculpting!\n    They are, for the most part, trolls, full of personality and charm, but not all huge creatures are so friendly. The ancient race of giants is one of majesty and might. For centuries beyond counting, they have ruled the mountaintops, aloof and apart from the petty races that squabble below. The more majestic of these giants are proportionally closer to humans, but are still much bigger than your average 28mm figure! They will be the same 65mm to the eyes that the trolls have been.\n  The huge-sized miniatures above will all be produced by this Kickstarter if we meet the base goal, cast in urethane resin, and will be available as choices for any of the reward levels that include giants.\n      Unlocked companion miniatures will automatically accompany one of the huge miniatures.\nExtra bases can be added for $2.00 each.\n    Companion miniatures unlocked will automatically accompany one of the huge miniatures.\nWhen we hit $29,000, the Modron Paladin will automatically accompany the Troll Mechanist. This morning, I didn't even know what a modron was! It turns out, they are pretty awesome!\n  When we hit $33,000, the Enting Sprout will automatically accompany the Treant Shaman. Who said there were no more entings! (It was Treebeard, he was wrong!)\n  We hit $35,000! The Sporeling will automatically accompany the Giant Barbarian. Once he's put the guards to sleep, he and the Barbarian will creep out into the underdark, his bio-luminescent head lighting their perilous way.\n  When we hit $37,000, the Rust Beast will automatically accompany the Dire Owl. Dark Sun players, you guys are probably safe. Everyone else: just throw a wizard at it!\n  We hit $38,500! The Kobold Bard will automatically accompany (No pun intended!) the Storm Giant. \n    It's difficult to chase those sheep down by yourself! Take this Labrador Retriever! We hit $40,000 so the Labrador will automatically accompany the Hill Giant Rustler on all raids. \n  When we hit $45,000 (Either during the funding period or afterward through Paypal donations) the Giant Children will be added to the Completionist Rewards. When that happens, they will also be available as a $15 add-on for the group of 3. They will be cast in pewter and the biggest of them will be about the size of our Half-Orcs. \nThanks!\nThe Stonehaven Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we are fairly familiar with the process of sculpting and casting miniatures by now, there is still some small risk that our project will be significantly delayed by factors beyond our control.

Now it's time to get together and summon a series of special dice for spell-casters! The Wizard Set is once again the classic 7-piece set of RPG dice (plus special Kickstarter bonuses - see below), and this time we are also going for fancy and fittingly magical looking materials. \nYou will be able to choose your colors and Level Up Packs pledged for after the campaign with a pledge manager we will send you. Check out the FAQ at the bottom of this page for more information.   \n         PLAY\n\n         Dice Specifications\n   \n3D prototypes\nPLAY\n\nNote: the 3D printing process leaves small artefacts on the models (visible in the video) that won't be present in the final production. \nPolyHero Dice are modelled and tested using 3D modelling software, then 3D printed for further testing. We don't claim the dice are as balanced as casino machined dice, but we design them using principles such as centre-of-mass and lines of symmetry, to make sure the dice are fully functional and randomized for general use. \nFrom Warrior to Wizard... what's new and why? \nWe are reducing the price per set, and once again offering growing discounts when backing for multiple sets. The Wizard Set won't be packed in a multi-purpose hard case like the Warrior Set (for Kickstarter or at retail). As cool as it is, the case adds a cost to producing the product that understandably many people might not see the value in. So the Wizard Set (and eventually the Warrior Set) will now be packed in a bag or clam shell. \nWe are using fancier, more expensive materials and ink for the dice, including pearlized, and transparent materials. \nWe are charging $4 shipping worldwide (proportionately decreasing as you back for more sets). We've decided it is a lot easier for us to manage our budget with the shipping costs upfront and scaling to the number of sets backed for.\nWe will deliver the dice to backers at least a month prior to retail or convention release. This was always the intent with the Warrior Set, but there were extenuating circumstances that meant the dice were available at GenCon while they were still on the way to some backers. Game Salute kindly air freighted the dice from the factory (for their booth at GenCon, and also for the Kickstarter backers). As a result Kickstarter backers got their dice two months earlier than if we'd had to sea freight them, but it meant that there was a small amount of overlap in where they were available first. The plan moving forward with this and future campaigns is that backers will always get their dice well before retail or convention goers.\nWe are adding a matching 2-sided spell book to every Wizard Set purchased as part of the Kickstarter (the spell books won't be in the retail version of the dice)! \nStretch Goals \nWE added...\nWe added the Spell Book as an \"instant stretch goal\". As soon as we hit the base funding goal it was added to every Wizard Set purchased (in a color matching the Wizard Set). The spell book is a special limited die that won't be available in the retail edition, but may down the track be available at conventions or as a promotion in limited quantities.\nWe unlocked 10 unique colors, including two Adventure Colors. \nWe're retooling and creating more moulds so we can offer of specific dice, such as d6 or d20. See Wizard Level Up Packs.\nWe have added the option to pledge for a special Wizard's Hat d20 at a discount price. \nWe unlocked a bonus Electrum and Alabaster spell book die to every Wizard Set and one for any Level Up Reward level pledge of $15 or higher (not including shipping).\nQuest Goals\nThe success of this campaign, your enthusiasm and your ideas, have us looking to future sets with a clearer purpose and confidence, and wanting to invest the momentum and funds raised in this campaign towards that vision and those future sets. A goal being to be able to work on more ideas and designs, and take a lot less time to produce and deliver them to you. \nWe think if we can design the dice with your feedback, make all the moulds, and get deep into the production sampling, all ahead of a campaign, then we could radically increase our capacity and turnaround for delivery, and go from 1 set a year, up to 2 or 3. It would also make for better campaigns as we would have all the moulds at the start and make Level Up Packs available immediately, then focus on different kinds of stretch goals. We'd essentially be able to start from deeper into the campaign and then build from there. \nSo we\u2019ve scoped out two \"Think Big\" stretch goals. Even if we don't hit these grand goals, the campaign has been a huge boost to the future of PolyHero Dice, and extra funds from the Wizard campaign will still be invested into future sets, but these \"PolyHero Quest Goals\" mark the levels of funding where we can officially and publicly set the listed expectations for the next set/s.\nPolyHero Dice Games\nLast campaign we created Knight Fight, a game to play with the Warrior Set (available from PolyHero.com). Once again we have our ideas to get the Wizards in the mix, though we aren't at the same stage we were with Knight Fight. We are now developing a game that we think could be pretty awesome, but it won't be ready for a little while!\n-\n\nThe Warrior Set\nDuring the Wizard Set campaign the Warrior Set (in the deluxe hard case) will be available from PolyHero.com. You of course won't need to wait for the Warrior Set as it is already made! Knight Fight is also available. If you want the Warrior Set sent to you with the Wizard Set, then see the FAQ below.\n        Credits\nPolyHero Dice are the result of a creative collaboration between brothers Dann and Greg May. We've worked together in the visual arts for more than 20 years, as graphic designers, artists and 3D animators. We've also played Dungeons and Dragons (and other RPGs) together from an early age, starting with the red boxed Basic Set. This project is a labour of love for us; to create imaginative, 3D-sculpted custom dice for a favourite hobby, and for the pure joy of holding and rolling them.\nDann May is a visual artist, animator and graphic designer. Since 2015 has been the resident art/creative director and artist at tabletop game publisher Game Salute, where he has worked on numerous board and card games including Nothing Personal, King's Forge, Legends of the American Frontier and Planetarium.\nGreg May is a professional 3D Animator and Modeller with over 20 years in the industry working on projects including children's television programs, medical animation and live event installations. He also freelances creating high end rendered images of board games, and created the art for the upcoming board game Planetarium.\nFor more information visit polyhero.com\n\nDice Maniacs' Club\nWe're members of the Dice Maniac's Club!

That's why we've completed all the 3D modelling up front and allowed until May 2017 to complete production and deliver the dice. Our goal is to deliver them as soon as possible, and ultimately we would like to be able to produce a new set every 6 months, but until we have proven that is possible, we won't presume to set a tighter target date.\n\nWe are also once again keeping this campaign very simple, with one set of designs in a growing variety of colors and ways to package them.\n\nWe'll as always provide you with updates at each major milestone of production and delivery.

Choose from any of our amazing Adventuring Parties. The goal here is simple: get the miniatures sculpted, cast, and distributed to all of you!

Dwarves were painted by James Wappel (who also made the scenic bases and took the photographs)\nWe want to make as many halflings and halfling-related stuff as we can stand.

And I can tell you right now - it's beautiful.\nBEHOLD!\nThe chest portion will be embroidered, and the clocktalk on the sleeve and lower back will be screen printed, black-on-black.\nClose up of embroidery\nSo a couple of things to note:\n1. Everyone has been asking me what hoodie \"type\" this will be made of, and I was told it would be the same as the Thanks Obama hoodie we sell on the store. Well, the designers decided to upgrade it to a more expensive type, but unfortunately we lose the thumbholes. So if you were dead set on the thumbholes, we understand if you have to change your pledge BUT...\n2. ... The upgrades to this hoodie are now have an athletic, water resistant, tight weave to it (water beads on it, rather than soaks it up). Although it is obviously a very cool and useful feature, the reason for it was more aesthetic - the sheen to the material was decided to be more thematically appropriate for Automata, and it really made the black-on-black design pop. For sizes 4x and above, it'll be the same design but with a slightly different hoodie blank (same color).\n3. If you have not purchased the hoodie yet, you still can via our add-on offer ($70 per hoodie for domestic, $75 for international). If you'd like to take advantage of the add-on offer, go to this page and click \"Manage\" on the right side. Add $70/75 per hoodie to that amount, and then when we send out the surveys, we'll ask you how many of the ADD-ON Hoodie you wanted. (Yes, you can add on as many hoodies and add-on pins as you'd like - we will sort it out at the survey process)\nAnd as with all the stuff here, this hoodie will NEVER be made or sold again outside of this kickstarter campaign.\nThank you everyone! We've got 6 days to go!!\n----\n7/28/2015: 2 Weeks Left! ANOTHER PIN DESIGN!\nWait, what do you mean another pin design? You only have one pin available on this campaign, right?  \nThat was true... UNTIL NOW!  \nWe're offering a Second, Completely Different and Unique pin design for those pledging at the PIN DESIGN tier or higher as an optional ADD-ON. If you'd like this new design, add $25 per Add-On pin (regardless if you are shipping internationally or domestically).  \nThis pin is DUAL LAYER, so the broken Carl mask will sit on top of the base level. This pin will NEVER be made or sold again, so not only is it exclusive for the next two weeks, but the quantity made will be limited to that actually ordered for this Kickstarter Campaign. The quantity made will be stamped on the back of the pin.  \nSo if you'd like to take advantage of the add-on offer, go to this page and click on \"Manage\" on the right side. You can change the amount at the top without changing the reward. So, for instance, you are currently at the $150 tier, there's a little box with your pledge amount in it (it says \"It's up to you. Any amount of $1 or more.\" to the right of it). Add $25 to that amount, and then when we send out the surveys, we'll ask you how many of the ADD-ON Pin you wanted.  \nAlso! If you added on the Hoodie already, you can stack that as well! No worries, we'll get it all sorted in the Post-Campaign Survey stage!  \nTwo weeks left and 10k to go! We should be able to close this out soon, and then it's stretchgoal territory! Thank you everyone!\n----\n7/22/2015: HOODIE ADD ON UPDATE!\nWe've been getting tons of emails and messages asking us to open up more hoodies... so the best way to do this without messing with the rarity of the pins is to offer it to you as an add-on at ANY LEVEL. What this means is if you want a hoodie (or an additional hoodie), INCREASE your pledge level by $70 for U.S. addresses and by $75 for International addresses, and we'll make sure you get the exclusive hoodie. (do it again if you want additional) When it comes time to issue out our surveys, we'll ask you if you pledged for an additional hoodie and what size you asked for etc.\nClick on \"Manage\" on the right side, you can change the amount at the top without changing the reward. So, for instance, you are currently at the $55 tier. There's a little box with $55 in it (it says \"It's up to you. Any amount of $1 or more.\" to the right of it) - you can change it there.\n----\nSix years ago, we released this comic.\nPage 1 to the original Automata series.\nSince then, it's spawned two additional mini-series (Blood & Oil and Silverside), a dedicated base of fans, and even interest from Hollywood. The goal from the beginning - with any of our side projects - is to find someone who loved it enough and could dedicate the time necessary to fully flesh out the Automata universe. That happened pretty quick: before we knew it, we were in talks with a number of different movie studios. To us, it became not a matter of if, but when, we'd be able to buy a ticket and watch a very, very large Carl and Detective Regal brooding on a movie screen.\nBut after spending four years trying to do things the \"Hollywood Way,\" we've learned one thing: It's really really hard to get a movie made. The negotiations, the moving parts, the politics\u2026 Even when we had a property optioned - another project called The New Kid - it's not really a guarantee that anything will ever happen. The words \"Period Piece\" and \"Sci Fi\" together in close proximity give that town the hives. We found ourselves right back where we started. \nBut, maybe that isn't such a bad thing. \nWe went back to the drawing board, and with the help of friend and filmmaker Van Alan, we laid out the most pragmatic plan for what it would take to make an Automata series ourselves. Locations visited, scripts written, test footage shot - after two years of work from Van and his team, it started to seem like something we might actually be able to pull off.\nMaking a live action mini-series is expensive, and maybe not a very good \"investment\" in the classic sense. An actual movie studio would have a \"portfolio\" of films where one or two hits covers the losses for the rest of their lineup. Well, THIS IS THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE. And it doesn't have to make money - it just has to pay for itself. Its only responsibilities are:\n1. Get made, and  \n2. Be cool \n ... We'll handle the second one, if you can handle the first. Sound good? \nTELL ME MORE\nTest Footage Wireframes\nThe series will tell an original Automata story over five webisodes, each episode roughly 10-12 minutes long. Van has been working closely with Tycho/Jerry Holkins (that's, um, me) on the script. I don't really want to spoil it in, like, the Kickstarter pitch, but...  \nRead at your own intense risk for spoilification:\nSam & Carl are hired by a wealthy businessman to spy on his wife. When she winds up dead, and an automaton goes missing, Sam & Carl find themselves wound up in an intricate plot of sex, intrigue, and deception. It will be rad. The end.\nLighting for Test Footage\nIf the project funds successfully, Van and his crew are going to get started on this IMMEDIATELY. They will begin casting the key roles, building sets, working on the VFX, etc. They're raring to go.\nThey'll \"shoot\" (movie term) before the end of the year, and those that back via the digital download reward will get to view it in the Summer of 2016, 3 months ahead of the worldwide release.\nTell me about Van and his crew!\nVAN ALAN : Van is a Seattle-based filmmaker originally from Houston, TX. He has directed numerous music videos for bands such as The Presidents of the United States of America, Better Than Ezra, and Copeland. He has written and directed four short films and has been selected as a participant in the Texas Filmmakers Showcase in 2009 and 2010. In 2010, Van moved to Seattle to work with Penny Arcade to produce and direct their reality web-series and became the go-to guy to capture PAX conventions and other video projects.\nWILL LUMMUS : Will is an independent film producer originally from Nacogdoches, TX. In 2009, he moved to Seattle and became integrated into the Seattle Independent Film Community, working as a production and location assistant and eventually location coordinating and producing. His recent production credits include films such as Touchy Feely, Laggies, You Can\u2019t Win, Captain Fantastic, and Ridley Scott\u2019s The Man In The High Castle.\nLACEY LEAVITT : Lacey is a Seattle-based producer. She has produced and co-produced many of the best Seattle indie films of the last five years including Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not Guaranteed (Aubrey Plaza, Mark Duplass, Jake Johnson), Lynn Shelton's Laggies (Keira Knightley, Sam Rockwell, Chloe Grace Moretz) Megan Griffiths' Lucky Them (Toni Collette, Thomas Haden Church, Johnny Depp), and Todd Rohal's The Catechism Cataclysm (Steve Little, Robert Longstreet). She's a Sundance Creative Producing Lab alum and also co-directed the roller derby documentary Blood on the Flat Track.\nCompositing for Test Footage\nThat's a really... interesting... funding goal.\nWe think so, too. After running two decent sized Kickstarter projects, we now know more about the tiny details of running them. We've seen how expensive rewards get, we've backed projects that failed, and we wondered if there wasn't a clearer way to handle it.\nIf you're interested in the nuts and bolts, business guy Robert Khoo put together this summary.\nYou\u2019ve probably noticed that the goal for this project is a weird number. $322,637.09 is an oddly specific figure, some might say. Well, let\u2019s break down that number to make sure you, as a backer, know what your money is actually going toward. \nLet\u2019s first start with this: $251,842.46. That\u2019s the ACTUAL cost of producing the series. The breakdown of this budget, put together by Van, are as follows. \nAutomata Webseries Production Budget\nYou may have heard that Van was able to secure funding from the State of Washington which reduced the budget by $46,000. So we can go ahead and deduct that amount right off the top from $251,842.46, which leaves us with $205,842.46 that we need to raise from backers via Kickstarter. \nBut wait! $205,842.46 doesn\u2019t match up with $322,637.09 we\u2019re asking for. Where did that extra money go? Well, two things. \n1. Based on our previous Kickstarter projects, we now know our average Reward Cost Rate is 27.7%. That means for every dollar you kick in, it actually costs us (on average) 27.7 cents to produce and fulfill the reward you asked for. This includes design, production, warehouse labor, and even the box and tape that is necessary to ship the thing. \n2. The Kickstarter Fee is 5%. The average processing fee is 3.5%. \nSince we know it\u2019ll cost us 27.7 cents for every dollar we raise AND we need to pay Kickstarter and CC companies their fees, we need to raise more than $205,842.46. In fact, after accounting for Rewards and Fees, you can see where we reach our actual goal of $322,637.09. \nThis makes more sense if we do it in reverse: \n$322,637.09 is what we\u2019re asking for. \nKickstarter and credit card fees knock off 8.5%. That leaves us with $295,212.94 \nTo fulfill the rewards of $322,637.09, it\u2019ll cost us 27.7% of that. That breaks down to $89,370.47. $295,212.94 less $89,370.47 is... <drum roll> $205,842.46. \nPLEDGE LEVELS!\nFull level descriptions found on right side of page!\nStretch Goals!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI would say the biggest risk we will run into are with budget overruns and unforeseen delays in productions.

Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our two Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2014-2015 longshoreman west coast work slow down that delayed all of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to buy it verses the cost to produce it. This event did not occur in either of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount of the model.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #110", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

I had skimmed through some of the books on the making of Star Trek and felt there was so much more to explore about the birth and evolution of Spock. And the timing seemed right, as the 50th anniversary of Star Trek: The Original Series was not that far away. Dad agreed that now was the right time, and that he was 100% committed to collaborating with me on this project. He also reminded me that we were (then) just days away from the 50th anniversary of the start of production on \u201cThe Cage,\u201d the original pilot for Star Trek in which Dad first appeared as Mr. Spock.\nPlease participate in my Kickstarter campaign and help me complete a project that was important to my dad and has become extremely important to me.\n\nThanks again for your time and consideration.\n\nLLAP,\n Who Is Involved With This Project?\nEarlier this year, my father and I reached out to 455 Films to help us produce this project. 455 Films is made up of producers David Zappone, Kevin Layne and Joseph Kornbrodt. Dad chose this company because he was familiar with the Star Trek related films they have produced with William Shatner and was impressed with their work. David, Kevin and Joseph are also very well versed in the Star Trek tradition, and have worked previously with all of the important players in the world of Star Trek. \nWith their background in production and my experience in directing over 45 hours of network television, I'm very confident that we're going to deliver an entertaining and enlightening film about the lives of Leonard Nimoy and Mr. Spock.\nIn addition, I'm excited to announce that Zachary Quinto has generously agreed to narrate the film about the famous Vulcan, a character he now knows quite well himself.\n So, What's Next?\nWe're only just beginning our campaign on Kickstarter, but we're not coming to the table unprepared. In addition to having already completed a considerable amount of research on this film, I have personally compiled a treasure trove of pictures of the Nimoy family and of Dad in his many roles before and after Mr. Spock. And, of course, we have some great pix of Spock as well.\nThe funding of this film through Kickstarter will enable us to continue with production -- which will mostly take the form of filming interviews of Dad\u2019s friends, colleagues and family members. It will also enable us to license the hundreds of film clips and still photographs of Mr. Spock as he has appeared on television and in feature films over the last fifty years. Funding will then buy us time in the editing room, where I will be poring over the film clips and photographs and never-before-seen home movies as well as Star Trek artifacts -- some of which have not seen the light of day for nearly fifty years! \nOnce the edit is complete, we can then start working with a composer for a score which will play alongside the prerecorded music -- which we will also have to license. (Can you imagine referring to Dad\u2019s recording career without hearing a few seconds of The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins? Unthinkable!) We also need funding for a sound editor and to pay for a final mix of all the elements.\nWhat is this film really about?\nThis film was originally conceived as a tribute to Mr. Spock to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the original series. Now, with Dad's passing on February 27th, the film will also explore the incredible career and artistry of Leonard Nimoy. But what has become increasingly apparent as I continue to work on this project is that it's also a personal journey. \nAlthough I had initially intended to take a somewhat detached, objective view of the subject matter, more and more people involved in this film have urged me to interject some of my own perspective on what it was like growing up with Mr. Spock in the house, and how Dad's new-found celebrity and meteoric career affected my life. \nHow can I get more involved with the project? \nSpread the word via social media! While the fundraising is a critical part part of our focus right now, we also want to engage the community in any way possible. Follow us on Facebook or Twitter, share our story on your own blog or social media (tag us at @LoveOfSpock!), and keep an eye out throughout our campaign for other messages of how to get involved.\nCheck out content with our hashtag #SpockDoc and #SpockStories and share your own!\nReward Fulfillment\u2026 Or, When Do I Get My Stuff?\nPlease note, most digital rewards will be fulfilled through our website, www.ForTheLoveOfSpock.com in a special \"Members Only\" section. Assuming that our goal is fulfilled, we'll be reaching out to everyone shortly after the end of the campaign with details about claiming your rewards.\nThe digital screening will be hosted here as well, through the magic of VHX.tv. While we won't know the premiere date(s) until much closer, we're hoping to have the film ready to go in early-to-mid 2016. Once it's ready to be released, you'll receive information with a specially generated link.

But we're confident that through YOUR support, we can accomplish it in the time allotted -- but now IT'S UP TO YOU! As stated above, our $600,000 goal will help us pay for the interview process and most of the elements we need to license for this film. After processing fees and mailing, we\u2019ll actually only net somewhere around $530,000. Enough to do what we promised to do?

We've worked together in the visual arts for more than 20 years, as graphic designers, artists and 3D animators. We've also played Dungeons and Dragons (and other RPGs) together from an early age, starting with the red boxed Basic Set (oh, and even before that a game Dann made up and tried to make Greg play). \nThis project is a labour of love for us; to create imaginative, 3D-sculpted custom dice for our favourite hobby, and for the pure joy of holding and rolling them. We are very motivated to run this Kickstarter well and get the product into more hot little hands than our own. We'd love you to consider the pledge levels and rewards to the right, and if you'd like to order more than 4 sets, or for other details see the FAQ at the bottom of this page.\nWe needed your help to produce the Warrior Set! And not only have you helped us do that, thanks to your support and stretch goals we've already sized up the dice, added Knight Fight: A PolyHero Dice Game as an extra reward and unlocked Vorpal Purple and Amber and Steel Grey with Molten Copper dice sets! You've also helped us add a Grey and Copper Knight card to every copy of Knight Fight! Over the last few hours of the campaign only two potentially miraculous stretch goals remain unlocked, two more additions to Knight Fight: a set of multi-player battle-royale cards and rules ($88,000) and 6 new magic items ($99,000).\n Rolling Prototypes, Production Samples and What's Next...\nPLAY\n\nAre These Dice Balanced, Sir?\nWe've worked to make these dice balanced, through using lines of symmetry and weight and number distribution -- through testing in both computer simulations, with 3D printed prototypes, and samples of the final dice -- and they work very well. But we certainly don't claim they are as accurate as casino machined dice. If you want a guarantee of high precision and statistical clarity while you lop off a Troglodyte's head then these dice aren't for you. But if you just like fun and different dice for whatever reason, and don't care if you roll an extra 20 every 1,000 rolls then we'd love to raise a flagon together and share our dice with you. \nWhen we reached $40,000 it made it possible to \"chunkify\" the dice (for every set and with no cost to backers). We think it will make the dice look and feel even more impressive and Warrior like. Check out the end of the Rolling Prototypes, Production Samples and What's Next... video (higher up on this page), and Update 2 for more details. The below figures are a good guide, but we'll be printing new prototypes to get the feel of the larger dice in hand before locking in the percentage increase of each specific die.\nA PolyHero's Journey\nWhen I, Dann, first played Dungeons and Dragons I can remember the exact moment I learned that I needed to roll a certain one of these strange but cool dice to \"do damage\". I was in a class room at lunch time and I was examining the strange pyramid of the 4-sided dice, trying to work out how the numbers worked on it. As I rolled that \"d4\", I'm sure I can remember my 12 year old self imagining using the dagger that dice represented against whatever monster my friend had pitted against us. It may be a false memory, but I'm sure I remember part of me wanting the dice to more \"be\" the weapon in some way. But how could a dice also be a weapon...? (Well, I mean, besides just chucking it at someone)\n[Insert spooky video wipe]\n...to 30 years later and my team mate in the creative department at Game Salute, David MacKenzie dreams up and produces Rocket Dice for his excellent new edition of Alien Frontiers. Greg and I worked for David on the 3D sculpts for the dice, and as we were working on them David had the idea of doing an RPG set of Rocket dice. I suggested to him that maybe we do the higher number dice as flying saucers. The idea of saucers didn't \"take off\", but time passed and I got to thinking about custom dice in terms of my own love of RPGs, and soon dreamed up the idea for the 20-sided shield dice. I took the idea to Greg and we began working on the other designs.\nWe worked together on the designs and 3D modelling for almost a year in gaps between our regular work. Settling on the final designs was a bit of a journey. The first decision was to build a set themed around a Fighter. We had and still have other designs for other characters, but a Warrior just seemed like the best place to start. \nOne of the biggest decisions was whether to make the sword a d6 or a d8! In D&D long swords traditionally do d8 damage, short swords d6. What clinched it for us is that a d6 is a much more widely used dice and we felt like a sword would be a more iconic d6 for that reason. It would allow the possibility of people using handfuls of swords as their d6 in a variety of fantasy games, that seemed cool. Of course, it doesn't really matter, they are fun whether they exactly match the weapon you are using them for... but as you do, we wonder these things. And we can always do d8, or d10 swords in the future if things go well. (Plans for sets of d6s are on the cards, but not as part of the funding goal for this campaign, see the FAQ at the bottom of this page).\nIt actually took us the longest to come up with an idea for the d10 and d10 percentile dice. I'd started thinking about the dice in terms of a possible game, and the idea that the more faces a dice had the more defensive it would be, that all made sense, we had a shield and a helmet at the top of the scale and a dagger at the lower end. But what weapon would go in the middle...? Then somehow we got onto the idea of Gauntlets, which seemed to fit the bill as a transition between attack and defence, but also because there needed to be two of them... Coming up with the idea was the easy part in the end. Trying to arrive at a design for the d10 dice and modelling them in 3D took longer than any other design. We restarted multiple times on the design and ended up with more of a leather armoured glove look to the gauntlet. It's fun that we even have a right and left hand. We decided to use a simple dot beneath one of the number sets so they could together be used as percentile dice. Just think of it like a decimal point, or full stop.\nThe Production Process & Progress\nWe live south of Melbourne, in Australia, but thankfully Dann also works with Game Salute, who have been able to help us out with setting up this campaign, sourcing a manufacturer for the dice and seeing to their distribution internationally after the campaign completes. The plan is that after delivering to the backers, the dice could go on to be sold at retail in partnership with Game Salute.\nGame Salute's experience with the manufacturing of Rocket Dice taught the company a lot, and we've been able to benefit from that experience. We were adamant that the manufacturing process be bedded down before we went to Kickstarter, and Game Salute agreed, and agreed to foot the bill to guarantee it. They sourced a new manufacturer and went ahead and paid for a full production mould for some of the dice to be cut, so we could test the designs all the way through to a first round of production samples ahead of the campaign -- so that we anticipate no issues with the molding and manufacturing process.\nAfter the campaign we'll continue to refine up the finish of the dice, and implement a slight size increase (thanks to a stretch goal)... and then it's on into production. We'll update you as that progresses.\nFREE International Shipping! (Yes, that means Australia too!)\nBecause our dice are mercifully small compared to a big box board game, we can cover the shipping cost for you to locations all over the world! (using www.ShipNaked.com). \nStretch Goals and Extras?\nWe've unlocked a lot of stretch goals (see the introduction above)!\nBecause we have been so careful in testing the designs and the manufacturing process, we won't be adding new dice designs to this campaign. We'd absolutely love to do more dice design, and have some great ideas bubbling away, but that will happen as part of a new campaign if this campaign does well, with newly tested designs and due preparation on our part. (If you have ideas for the future leave them in the comments!!)\nWe don't want to add in extras like dice bags. As super-cool as they would be, there are lots of awesome dice bags out there and we would be honored if you chose to buy a special dice bag to hold your Poly Hero Dice, that would awesome!! But by us not offering that sort of thing here, we can concentrate on the task at hand and not end up with delays in our attempt to become dice bag creators and merchants. Maybe one day, maybe if this thing takes off we can offer custom PolyHero Dice bags, but not this day. The main concern for us is we deliver on time.\nKnight Fight\nAs part of the design process Dann created a dice game -- Knight Fight --- with a set of 18 cards to use with 2 sets of PolyHero Warrior dice! We're now making it part of the campaign! Check out the update.\nIf there are other game designers out there that feel inspired and work up games using PolyHero Dice, the easiest way to let us know is via the Submissions page at Gamesalute.com. We'd love to hear your ideas!\nCredits\nHere we go for the weird credits section where it's just us... but just so you can see the split of work...\nConcept and Design: Dann and Greg May\n3D Modelling and Animation: Greg May\nStoryboarding, Art Direction and Graphic Design: Dann May\nProducer: Dann May\nDann May is a visual artist and took on the role of Chief Creative Officer at Game Salute in January 2015.

These take a long time to make. We started this project about a year ago.\n\nWe know that it will take time to get these dice done right. That's why we've done all the 3D modelling up front and paid for a test mold with the factory producing the dice. We have gone to the extent of having actual samples in hand before the campaign begins to be sure that the designs didn't encounter in any issues during the moulding process. \n\nThat's also why we're keeping this campaign simple, with just two different colored sets. Game Salute learned that lesson from the ballooning of options with Rocket Dice and we're dedicated to keeping it simple for this one. If this campaign does well, we can always look at doing more options in the future, but we want to focus on delivering the first sets first.\n\nWe're being realistic by setting a year timeline for production and delivery. Of course we hope it takes less time and if it does Ship Naked will ship the dice out to all backers as soon as they have them.\n\nWe'll provide you with updates at each major milestone of production and delivery.\n\nWe love your comments and feedback. We'll provide any changes inspired by your feedback in our updates. If you've got a question or comment, whether it's in person, by phone, via email, or on this project page, we appreciate it.\n\nGame Salute have seen that sometimes, after a campaign successfully funds and the thing being funded is actually being produced, life happens and a few people will want to cancel their pledge before the estimated delivery date. If that happens, just contact us and we'll be happy to make arrangements to process a refund to you.

Since then it has spread across the known world, a waking nightmare that takes hundreds of horrible forms. Ghosts howl in the night. Skinchangers lurk in the wilds. Fallen soldiers rise to slaughter the living. Entire cities fall to a Chant that turns all who hear it into mindless killers. We don\u2019t know why this is happening. We don\u2019t know how to stop it. All that we know with certainty is that we are fighting a war and we are losing. Over a third of the Empire has been lost to the Dread, and each day brings new horrors. In this dark time we have one hope: Phoenixes are returning. Every citizen knows tales of the Phoenixes, champions who can face death and return stronger than before. In the centuries following our brutal civil war the Phoenixes have become legends\u2026 and now you are one of them.\nPhoenix: Dawn Command is a card-based roleplaying game with a unique approach to character death. In Phoenix, players assume the role of supernaturally empowered champions bound together to defend a fantasy world under attack by threats that no mortal could withstand. These heroes face harsh odds every mission, and many won\u2019t survive. But death isn\u2019t the end of your character\u2019s story; it\u2019s the start of the next chapter. Phoenix is also a new fantasy setting, and you can learn more about the world of Phoenix here.\nCARD-DRIVEN ROLEPLAYING\nPhoenix is a story-driven roleplaying game that uses cards to resolve actions. Every player has a deck of cards that represent a character\u2019s abilities. To accomplish an action, a player needs to lay down a set of cards with a total value that equals or exceeds the difficulty of the task. A player can get an extra push by using a trait - a card that describes a unique aspect of a character. If the player can explain how that trait applies to the current challenge, the value of the card is increased. This encourages cinematic storytelling, driving players to describe an action beyond the simple numbers. In addition, each player has Sparks - a pool of mystical energy that can be used to boost the value of an action. This allows a character to succeed at a normally impossible task\u2026 but when that pool of energy is exhausted, the character dies. You can see a video example of this system here.\nWhile Phoenix has a gamemaster who drives the story and controls the challenges the characters face, the card-based system places a significant amount of narrative control in the hands of the players. Success isn\u2019t based on the roll of a die; it\u2019s a question of what a player is willing to sacrifice to make an action succeed. Because death isn\u2019t the end of the story, character survival isn\u2019t the most important part of a mission. Instead, the challenge is to make each death meaningful, and to achieve the objectives the Phoenixes are willing to lay down their lives for.\nThe Phoenix system is simple and flexible, and even someone who\u2019s never played a roleplaying game before can master it within thirty minutes. The story and setting of the game give players a clear purpose and reason to work together, and the mechanics of the game encourage teamwork. While the options provide depth of play for experienced gamers, it\u2019s very accessible to new players.\n DEATH MAKES YOU STRONGER\nIn Phoenix: Dawn Command, you don\u2019t gain power by killing others; you gain power by dying. After each death, you add additional cards to your deck and new abilities representing the lessons you learned from your previous life. However, there\u2019s a catch: you can only return seven times. So each death makes you stronger, but it also brings you closer to the end of your story. In addition, you don\u2019t return right away and you don\u2019t return in the place where you died. The fate of the world is in your hands and should you and your friends fall without completing your task, your mission will fail. Friends may be lost, regions may fall, and when you return you\u2019ll have to deal with the consequences of your failure. Because death isn\u2019t the end, the odds will often be stacked against the characters; to succeed, players must take risks and make sacrifices. \nWe'll provide more information about the setting of Phoenix in updates, or you can read Keith's updates on Phoenixes and the Story.\nWhat\u2019s In The Box?\nPhoenix: Dawn Command will include the following components.\n280 Tarot-sized cards, including Action cards, Lessons, School cards and Challenges.\nA softcover book (approximately 120 pages) containing the rules to the game, a guide to the fantasy setting, and a seven-mission story arc.\n32 Health tokens and approximately 70 Spark tokens.\nCondition tokens to track temporary effects.\nPlayer booklets will be provided as a free PDF download. These provide an overview of the setting and the rules, giving each player easy access to everything they need to know to get started.\nAll together, this is sufficient to support a gamemaster and a group of four players. The missions provide an initial story arc, and the manual provides all the information a gamemaster needs to develop new stories.\nAll materials shown in these images and the video are prototypes and may change in the final product.

The system has had over a year of testing with hundreds of playtesters. Approximately 90% of our art assets are complete and in hand. We have sourced manufacturing and fulfillment partners. The work that remains ahead of us involves finalizing the missions that will accompany the game and continuing to add depth to the game setting. \n\nThere are always things that can go wrong.

But whether it will be a time travel comedy or a serious drama is up to you.  That's because when I started working on this project and I had two great ideas of where I wanted it to go. \nCitizen George as a Serious Drama\nI had this idea I loved where Citizen George would be a straight drama in the vein of Citizen Kane.  It would be about the rise and fall of a man who is a hero to many in geekdom and villain to others, just as William Randolph Hearst was to many in an earlier age of media.\nThe Director in his earlier years (Photos by Phil Rose))\nCitizen George as a Time Travel Comedy\nBut at the same time, I also had an idea where Citizen George would be a sci-fi time travel comedy like Bill and Ted or Austin Powers.  In that story, The Director would time travel twenty years into the future and 1970's-Director would make the prequels instead of 1990's-Director.  Unlike future-Director, past-Director has not had decades of being surrounded by \"yes-people\" but he does have the added difficulty of missing out on twenty years of cultural change.  That version would be a lot lighter and more of a wish fulfillment fantasy but at the same time it too would also be a great way to explore how power effects people.  \nI was trying to decide which of those two versions I most wanted to make when the idea hit me; why not let the backers decide?  Kickstarter is all about letting the fans choose what they want to see.  So why not take that to the next level?  Why not let you decide if Citizen George is going to be a comedy or a drama?  So that is exactly what I am going to do.  \nSpace Rogue (Photos by Phil Rose)\nOn your right are rewards for Team Comedy as well as rewards for Team Drama. Whichever team ends up with the highest total dollar amount at the end of the Kickstarter, that is the team whose version will get made.  So, if at the end of this Kickstarter the total number of dollars from all Team Comedy rewards to the right is $75k and the total number of dollars from all Team Drama rewards to the right is $50k, then the entire $125k would be used to make Citizen George into the best darn comedy it could be.  And if the numbers were reversed (if it was 75k from Team Drama backers and $50k from Team Comedy backers) then the entire $125k would be used to make Citizen George into the best darn drama it could be.\nSpace Queen (Photos by Phil Rose)\nI want to make clear that regardless of which side wins, you will still receive the backing rewards from the level you pledge at.  Victory for one side does not affect the rewards themselves; not in the slightest.  The only thing it changes is what type of movie Citizen George ends up being made as; either as a comedy or as a drama.  And It won't just cover the Space Saga.  There will be very important scenes from other aspects of the Director's life, such as his popular game company named after him.  \nLike all Kickstarters you have the option of withdrawing your pledge any time before the end of the KS.  I will be continuously posting regular updates on how much each side has raised so if you decide that you only have an interest in one version, and it looks like the other side will win, you can always withdraw your pledge.  This Kickstarter will end at 11:59 PM (Pacific Time) on May the fourth.  If you want to check back on that day, then May the fourth be with you in your thoughts so that you can remember it as the day when this Kickstarter ends.  \nBut I promise you that no matter which version wins, you the fans will be getting a full length biographical film about a great Sci-Fi Director and his work that has touched us all.  It will have professional production values, a great script, fantastic acting, and the best special effects our budget allows.  \nPlease decide if you want Citizen George to be a comedy or a drama and select the appropriate reward to your right.  And if you want to make sure your team wins, please be sure to tell all your friends about it on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, or any blogs and forums your read.  \nThank you very much and I can\u2019t wait to give you a great film!\nPS.  See the trailer for my last film,Dark Dungeons, here.\nPSS.  Legally speaking, Citizen Kane was not a film about William Randolph Hearst.  And legally speaking, this film is not about anyone now living or dead.  In fact, the \"George\" in Citizen George doesn't even refer to the main character.

I will not rest until you are able to say the same about this project as well.\n\nIn partnership with Zombie Orpheus, the making of my last film, _Dark Dungeons_, was one of the greatest experiences of my life and I worked very hard to make sure all my backers got their rewards.\n\nNo matter which version you choose to get made, my team has the skills and the dedication necessary to do so. Most importantly we have performed well in the past and have impressed everyone from my backers to Wired magazine ( http://www.wired.com/2014/05/dark-dungeons-movie/ ). You can purchase my last film, funded from KS, here www.darkdungeonsthemovie.com and see what we are capable of. And keep in mind that we did that film with a budget much lower than that of _Citizen George_. \n\nWilson Large, of Dark Darkness fame ( http://www.darkdarkness.com/ ), did a great job of producing this video with a minuscule budget and is planned to be the producer of _Citizen George_ as well. \n\nNow, my last Kickstarter film was delivered nine months late. You deserve to know why. _Dark Dungeons_ was late because I ended up with twice the money and vastly more resources and allies than I thought I would. As such, the film grew in scope and as a result it naturally grew in the amount of time needed to make it. I had to choose between making a better movie and making a movie on time. And you should know that if the same choice is given to me with _Citizen George_, I will always choose to make a better movie. If that means delays to Citizen George then, while I don't like them, for me the most important thing is to make the best movie possible with the resources at hand. And that is what I will do. \n\nBut one thing I promise, I will insure that _Citizen George_ gets made no matter what. Making movies is the best job I have ever done in my life. It is the only job I have ever unconditionally loved. It is the only profession I have ever engaged in where I could not wait to wake up in the morning to face any difficulties with every last ounce of energy and intelligence I could bring to bear. I would do anything to keep making movies and I will ensure that you see every dime that _Citizen George_ raises up on screen in the best possible way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "JR Ralls\n4 created \u00b7 23 backed\nI'm JR Ralls the writer and executive producer of the previous Kickstarter film, Dark Dungeons ( www.darkdungeonsthemovie.com ).

Able to draw from innate magic, powerful fighting abilities, and honed skills, you alone are equipped to step from the shadows to fight the darkness. Each Agent will be assigned, or be able to craft, artifacts to aid you in your missions. These items are of lesser power than the Fae relics of the past; nevertheless, they are potent boons in The Glamour War.\nPlayers will tackle their missions on a variety of fronts. You may be sent to uncover information from a high ranking official at a gala, or to cleanse a battlefield from Kormil corruption. Or, perhaps, you will need to engage in rooftop battles to recover a Fae relic, or delve ancient ruins for secrets of the past. As an Agent in The Glamour War, you have to be ready for anything.\nShadowcraft: The Glamour War takes place in Arcadia, a land of inherent magic. Not the crude magic you might find in other realms, but the subtle, pervasive magic befitting the Lands of the Fae. This power has imbued the land and peoples of Arcadia, blurring lines between the physical and spiritual. Thus, though the Fae are now gone, their influence is still felt.\nThe Lost Ones, descendants of those kidnapped to Arcadia by the Fae, rule from the ancient Fae city of Lancastle. Manipulated and changed by the Fae, the Lost Ones became more suited for the life of servitude their new masters required of them. Forced to become more than mortal, they found the power to rise up and claim Arcadia for themselves. However, the expected peace was not found after the Fae had been expelled from the land.\nPhilosophical differences fractured the Lost Ones, resulting in civil war. The followers of Kormil, an unpopular philosophy that venerated the Fae, went into exile. Ten years ago, these Kormillians returned, at the head of a nightmarish horde. Their dark armies swept over the southern reaches of Arcadia, corrupting the very land beneath their feet before the Lost Ones could even mount a defense. After a brief but bloody struggle, the Lost Ones were able to bring the Kormillians to a stand-still. To this day, neither side is able to make any real gain in the war.\nThus, the war has shifted. Each side now seeks to subvert and undo its enemies through a secret war. Though peace seems to have come to Arcadia at last, The Glamour War rages on - hidden from view, but no less deadly.\nThe Core Book: This is everything you need to create characters and play the game. All reward tiers that get a copy of Shadowcraft: The Glamour War will receive a digital copy of the book, downloadable through DriveThruRPG.com. If you like the book, you will have the option to print and ship a copy at cost (you only pay the printing and shipping costs; see Fulfillment, below, for more details on how that works). The book will be laid out in full color with a 6.14 x 9.21 trim size, and will have an estimated page count between 200 and 250 pages.\nIf you want options to print additional copies of the core book, add +$15 to your pledge for each additional core book print option (maximum of 5 total core books per order).\nThe Missions Manual: This is perfect for the GM who wants to sit down and start running a game of Shadowcraft. It gives you 20 missions, in a story order that you can choose to follow or not. Each mission is outlined on two pages of the book, and includes quartermaster outfitting and villain write ups, where appropriate. As with the core book, the Missions Manual will be in digital format with the option to print (see the Fulfillment section, below).\nIf you want options to print additional copies of the Missions Manual, at cost, add +$10 to your pledge for each additional Missions Manual print option (maximum of 5 total Missions Manuals per order). Note: Only a GM will likely require a Missions Manual.\nThe Player's Guides: Since Shadowcraft: The Glamour War is a game about espionage, not everything in the game master's section is going to be appropriate for players to read, as it could ruin some of the fun knowing the forces and motivations behind the threats the GM intends to throw at the group. As such, the optional Player's Guide is the perfect book to hand off to players. It includes a setting primer taken from the core book that describes everything a shadow agent would know about Arcadia and the Kormillian threat, as well as all the rules to create a character. This is the same information from the core book, but with the rules for running the game and the game master's section removed.\nAll tiers that offer the Player's Guide will come with the option to print 4 copies.\nExclusive Mission: If you backed at a level that includes a Kickstarter exclusive mission, you will receive a mission that is exclusive to our Kickstarter backers. For more on missions, see the Mission Manual reward, above.\nLikeness Art: If you backed at a level that allows you to receive your likeness in the art, we will send you a digital copy of that art, plus the option to print, at cost, 2 copies of it as a tarot-sized card at DriveThruCards.com.\nRunning Games for You: If you backed at a tier that includes us running a game for you, one member of our team (chosen at random) will contact you via Google+ to set up a time where you and any of your friends (up to a total of 5 players) can jump in with pre-generated characters (either yours or ours) and run through a 2-3 hour session on Google Hangouts.\nWhat Does \"At Cost\" Mean?\nBasically, what we are doing in this Kickstarter is asking you to pay the profit of a physical copy (the cost of a PDF) in the Kickstarter. After we fulfill the PDF rewards, you will have the option to print a physical copy without paying us any additional profits (you only pay what it costs to print and ship the book). When we send out the Kickstarter surveys, we will ask you which print options you want. By default, you get a single print option of any book in your tier (or 4 print options of the Player's Guide, in tiers that feature it). Purchasing more copies of the same book gives you additional options to print the book at cost (essentially paying us the profits of those printed books here, and then deciding which quality of book you want to print later).\nFor more on print options, see the Fulfillment section, below.\nWe are using Drive Thru RPG to fulfill the all of the rewards for this Kickstarter. This means that anyone, at any tier, only pays us the cost of your DRM free (non-watermarked) digital rewards here. After checking out those digital rewards, if you decide that you want a print version, you can log on to DriveThruRPG.com and print out a copy of the book and only pay the cost for printing and shipping.\nIf you like it, print it for what it costs us to print it! If you don't, stick with the digital copy of everything. You could even mix and match, printing the core book but leaving any Player's Guides or Mission Manuals your reward tier may have as digital rewards to email to the players at your table.\nHere's why this is beneficial.\nThis gives you the maximum amount of control over your rewards, from start to finish. If you like the digital book, but are running short on funds, you can print a softcover in standard color. If you want to see every detail in the richest color possible, and protect your investment, you can print a hardcover in premium color. Either way, we don't see a dime. You paid us here through the Kickstarter, which covers our creative costs to make the book. \nWe will ask you for your printing preference when we send out the Kickstarter surveys.\nHow Much Are Prints Likely to Cost?\nWhile shipping is depending on your location, we can give you a price range that the prints will fall in (this is only a ballpark because the book is not finished yet and we don't know what the exact page range will be). Listed below are the print options we will be including for the book.\nSoftcover in standard color: $6.20 \u2013 $7.45\nHardcover in premium color: $24.30 \u2013 $28.80\nAgain, you will make this decision when we send out the Kickstarter surveys.\nA Note to International Backers\nDrive Thru RPG prints through Lightning Source (also known as Ingram). They have printers in the United Kingdom, Australia, and here in the United States. As such, international shipping is much cheaper than if we were to ship it from our warehouses locally. We've used Lightning Source to print our books through the Reroll Store, as well as natively through DriveThruRPG.com, with Jadepunk to great success.\n$12,500 is a lot of money. So, what do we need it for? Fortunately, because of the aforementioned method of fulfillment, we only have to worry about creative costs. Here's a breakdown.\nPaying our talented writers and editors is expected to cost us $4,100.\nAnd that's some very pretty art, so add an art budget of $5,875.\nFinally, we're going to need someone to put it all together. Layout costs are expected to be just under $1,150.\nThen we have our Kickstarter fees, which are are between 7% and 10% (we'll use the 10% to be safe), which is $1,112.50.\nThat's a total of $12,237.50, which we're rounding up to $12,500 for a nice, clean number.\nOur Stretch Goals", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince we are handling fulfillment through Drive Thru RPG, there is no danger that we will not be able to fulfill due to unexpected shipping or printing costs.\n\nThe only real risk will be on our side, post-Kickstarter. If we just hit our funding goal, we will be able to cover all creative costs and get our backers the products, but we may not have enough to launch a large print run and expand our distribution channels. All profits from this Kickstarter are dedicated to increasing the reach of Shadowcraft.

Be it a shadow in the mists, a form in the tree line or a shape in the night the mind creates monsters and creatures to explain them. These explanations lead to stories, stories lead to songs and songs become legends. These monsters of legend take on the shape of the fears of the people that tell the stories. The Greco-Romans tell stories of misshaped cannibalistic demigods, the people of northern Europe have sagas of giants that live in the ice and dwarfs that live in the mountains and in the Far East there are tails of club wielding demons and dragons that swim through the air like a fish moves through water. The native cultures of the Americas and the islands of the Pacific also have these monsters that have been formed by fear, but with few gods, creatures of hope and courage took shape to bring balance to the world.\nIn the realms of games and models, the monsters and spirits of Europe, Egypt, and the growing popularity of Asian Culture has led to these subjects being well covered by several model companies. Paymaster Games is addressing the lack of Native American and Polynesian models on the market place with our Going Native line of models and games, this includes the spirits and monsters of their myths and legends.\nAbout the Project\nThe Spirit Beasts for the Going Native line of models are gaming miniatures set in the 28mm scale. These models will be cast in either white metal and/or high quality resin (depending on the model) by the brilliant casters at Valiant Enterprises Limited. All of the models will be supplied with a new style plastic base that will be appropriate for the size of the model \u2013 30mm base for small models, 40mm base for medium models and 50mm base for the largest models.\nHere is a scale chart that will help you determine the true size of the different New World Monsters and beasts\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107285147/Spirit%20Beast%20Designs/Spirit%20Beast%20Scale%20Chart.pdf\n25% Discount off Retail Price\nSince many of the models featured in this Kickstarter Campaign already have pre-production models (Greens) and/ or molds, Paymaster Games can offer a fair discount to all of the products we are bringing to this campaign.\nFree limited edition Ai Apaec the Decapitator model\nAt certain pledge levels, Paymaster Games is offering the mad god of the Moche people, Ai Apaec the Decapitator, as a free Kickstarter Exclusive model to certain pledge levels.

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

Lovecraft's mind.\nEirhavir\nEirhavir is a delicate, slender font more than suitable for magic texts, elvish, or other mystical communiques.\nGuldroun\nGuldroun is a solid, engraved-feeling font that smacks of ancient greek inscriptions on marble pediments.\n\nAkahake\nAkahake is a swirling, brushy font useful for pseudo-asian cultures and other groups that use brush and ink for their writing systems.\n\nFont Details\nThe fonts will be offered in OTF, TTF, and WOFF, just to make sure you get what you need.\n\nEach of the five base fonts will have English and non-English characters for you to use.\n\nStretch Goals\nNote: Stretch Goal fonts will be added to every \"All Fonts\" reward level automatically.\n$500 - Base Goal: Ruvahl, Noxzuat, Eirhavir, Guldroun, and Akahake.\n$1000 - Bonus Font: Aluminite, a Sci-Fi Font\n$1500 - Bonus Font: Sigil, a DIY personal sigil-making font\n$2000 - Bonus Font: Urosial, a voice-marked, phonetically organized conlang font\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't my first font rodeo, but there may be some challenge to be found in making sure that the english letters mesh and match well with the made-up glyphs.

No matter how good your phone's camera is, its ability to focus on close-up objects is limited.  With Easy-Macro, you can get even closer to capture the details you've been missing.  No cropping or software tricks will give you the super sharp detail that Easy-Macro's optical magnification offers.\nGet super close with Easy-Macro...\n...for amazing photos like this!\n Why We're The Best\nWhat exactly distinguishes Easy-Macro from other smartphone lenses?

This is where Easy-Macro's unique ability to be kept in your wallet comes in.  When that opportunity comes along, you'll be ready.  \nOne of the earliest stories we heard from a customer came from an optometrist.  A patient had come in for an exam and needed a detailed photo of their eye taken for their medical record.  The doctor's fancy camera recently broke and he was preparing to ask the client to come back in a few weeks.  He then remembered the awesome new Easy-Macro lens he had just purchased.  He produced his Easy-Macro and captured a photo of the patient's eye in just seconds, saving the client from the hassle of returning to the office.  Stories like this are a huge reason why my team and I have continued to work hard to make Easy-Macro the best, most convenient macro lens on the market.\nHere are a few more ways our customers are using their Easy-Macros:\nTake incredible up-close photos of everyday objects\nShow kids the tiny details in the world around them\nTeach up-close photography in schools\nRecord plants and insects for ecological field studies\nKeep records of dermatological concerns\nShow of their amazing manicure art\nPhotograph fine details in jewelry and crafts\nInspect electronics\nThe uses for Easy-Macro are only limited by your imagination!

It has this precious sense of wonder to it that brought me back to the early 1980\u2019s when I first discovered the artwork of the Fab Four of TSR I mentioned above.Stephanie is a big fan of pewter fantasy miniatures and has been collecting them since she was young.So she was thrilled when I approached her about creating a range of miniatures based on her artwork. She has been involved in the creative process with us every step of the way on these miniatures. Stephanie and I are happy to present to you what we hope is the start of a wonderful new Dark Sword miniature range that we need your help on launching.\nPatrick Keith has sculpted up the wonderful new miniatures for this range. Patrick has a proven track record with Dark Sword Miniatures, Reaper Miniatures and his own company Bombshell Miniatures.\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Dark Sword Miniatures and the style of our gaming scale miniatures (what would be referred to as 28mm Heroic Scale from many companies), you can check us out on our Web site at: www.DarkSwordMiniatures.com You can also scroll down the page to some gallery pictures of a small sampling of the miniatures we have released over the past 12+ years. Please note - these are painted studio model examples \u2013 all of our miniatures come in bare pewter or resin and will require minor assembly. You the hobbyist will get the pleasure of assembling and painting our miniatures in whatever color schemes you wish to see them in. It is a wonderful hobby indeed..\nDark Sword has already run and fully delivered on two Kickstarter projects we ran back in July/August 2013 and February/March 2014. We aim to once again exceed expectations on delivery of this project both on the quality of our miniatures and speed of delivery for our backer rewards. Like our last Kickstarter projects, we have a very simple campaign backer structure you can see over to your right. Early Bird Core Set and Core Set Backers will be rewarded for their support with special Kickstarter pricing. Other perks will include stretch goals that can be unlocked along the way for more free bonus miniatures added into the core set and access to other cool add-ons after the initial funding goal is exceeded. Once again, we already have the core set fully sculpted and have been running test castings of these miniatures to ensure everything is ready to crank into high gear on the production front once we get underway. Everything is cast in lead-free pewter. We aim to have backer rewards delivered very quickly after this campaign is finished so people can enjoy these amazing miniatures.\nBelow is a small sampling of our existing George R.R. Martin Masterworks Pewter Miniature range from the Song of Ice and Fire Book Series that inspired the hit HBO show Game of Thrones. These miniatures were created working closely with GRRM himself from how he envisioned the characters from the books in his mind - they are not from the HBO series. Please note - these are painted studio models - all of our miniatures come in bare pewter or bare resin and require minor assembly and of course painting.\nBelow is a small sampling of our Elmore Masterworks Pewter Miniature range. Please note - these are painted studio models - all of our miniatures come in bare pewter or bare resin and require minor assembly and of course painting.\nBelow is a small sampling of our Visions in Fantasy Pewter Miniature range. Please note - these are painted studio models - all of our miniatures come in bare pewter or bare resin and require minor assembly and of course painting.\nBelow is a small sampling of our Visions in Fantasy Anthropomorphic Animal (I call them critters) Pewter Miniature range. Please note - these are painted studio models - all of our miniatures come in bare pewter or bare resin and require minor assembly and of course painting.\nWe have included the above galleries of images to showcase a small sampling of what Dark Sword Miniatures has delivered over the past 12+ years as we approach 600 miniatures produced. You can see for yourself the quality and care we put into every aspect of our small boutique miniature company.  You can check out our Web site at: www.DarkSwordMiniatures.com to see more examples of what we have done and also read customer testimonials about the quality of our miniature ranges and the speed of our shipments all over the world. I bring these things up to call attention to our proven track record of delivering on projects in a consistent methodical manner.\nSome folks asked for size comparison pictures next to Reaper Miniatures during our last Kickstarter project. So I have taken some pictures (forgive the rough lighting here as it was simply sun coming in the window for our light source) of some of our new and existing GRRM miniatures next to some Reaper Bones and Reaper Metal minis.\nMale Miniature Sizes Comparison between Dark Sword Miniatures and Reaper Miniatures\nPlease keep in mind that GRRM goes to great lengths to differentiate and describe his characters in regards to their heights and overall sizes/shapes. You have the extremes from Tyrion up to Ser Gregor \"The Mountain That Rides\" and a good number of very tall strong men in between like Jaime Lannister, The Black Fish and the Old Bear. Tom Meier and Jeff Grace go into exacting detail to get this across on very small miniatures. Even differences between Dany and Sansa compared to the much taller Cersei or Melisandre are evident in these minis.\nFemale Miniatures Size Comparision Between Dark Sword Miniatures and Reaper Miniatures\nThank you very much for checking out our Kickstarter Project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we face is getting the backer rewards shipped in a timely and affordable fashion. I want to exceed expectations on this front once again like we did on our first two Kickstarter projects. So to once again help support this goal, we have already completed sculpting and initial master molding on the core set of miniatures. We have also performed test castings to ensure everything is dialed in from a pewter quality perspective. We have already had our pewter miniature caster set aside casting time and packing time so we can quickly get a head start on production as this campaign is underway. Just like with our first two Kickstarter projects, we will keep our backers in the loop with frequent updates throughout the run of this new Kickstarter project. All of our production and packing/shipping will take place in/from the Midwest USA.\n\nMany Kickstarter campaigns also run into shipping issues \u2013 especially international shipping issues. We are in our 12th year of business and have shipped orders out all over the world in the past 12+ years. We also completed and fully delivered on our first two Kickstarter projects. International shipping is expensive and this large release will be no exception. Dark Sword Miniatures has built a reputation of top notch quality and dependability over the years in regards to both our miniatures and our shipping turn times. And we aim to build upon that reputation once again with this new Kickstarter.\n\nAnother challenge many Kickstarters face is sorting the surveys after the project completes. Just like our last two Kickstarter projects, we have purposely built our project with simplified backer levels in order to simplify surveys so they are easy to complete and return quickly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "Final 48 hours on the new Stephanie Law Masterworks Kickstarter Project!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nI wanted to drop you all a quick note and let you know that our new Stephanie Law Masterworks Kickstarter project is down to our final 48 hour push.

FINAL ADD-ON REWARDS IN UPDATE 26: For our final 24 hours, we've added limited edition DODOcases, Picnic Blankets, downloadable episodes of the original series and a live online event with Donald Glover & LeVar... from a boat!\n   Jun 27 - MORE HUGE NEWS IN UPDATE 22: We've entered the Top 5 Kickstarter Projects... and the other four (Pebble, OUYA, Pono, Veronica Mars) have ALL offered special new rewards to help us get into more schools! Read more now!\nImportant updates, in case you missed them:\nSTRETCH GOALS #1: What we can do if we reach $5,000,000!\nT-SHIRT DESIGNS: Three limited-edition designs to choose from! \nADD-ON REWARDS: Instructions for adding more rewards!\nORIGINAL DVDs: Now available as reward add-ons!\nHi. LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us. And if you do, you'll be hearing from several of us throughout the campaign, and after that, in our backer updates.

WITH SWORDS.\nAn idea so overdue for production, it\u2019s ridiculous that you aren't already battling in a sun-dappled field of fresh buckwheat.\nWith Sabertron, swordsmen & swordswomen will be able to have sword fights with swords that keep score electronically, without any additional equipment. A series of LED strips integrated into the front and back of the handle keep track of player health. A sword-to-sword hit doesn't decrement health. A hit to the body of an opponent results in a loss of health until a fighter wins the duel.\nThis is accomplished through extraordinarily complicated scientific engineering type stuff. For more on that, read the section labeled \u2018extraordinarily complicated scientific engineering type stuff.\u2019\n$200,000 STRETCH GOAL - SHEATHS\nWe\u2019re halfway through our campaign, Internet. And if we reach our new stretch goal of $200,000, every sword-level backer will receive the ultimate in foam sword fighting apparel.\nSabertron Sheaths.\nYou heard right. A sheath for every sword. \nSo get the word out, and help us hit $200,000!\nLeave no Sabertron unsheathed, fellow foam sword enthusiasts!\n#SHEATH\n$100,000 STRETCH GOAL - BONUS BLADES (REACHED)\nWe did it. We reached $100,000! Every sword-level backer will now get a bonus replaceable foam blade in their choice of color (red, green, blue, or Medieval steel-grey). If you're a Grandmaster or Blackout level backer, you'll have the choice of a bonus foam color blade or a bonus neutral blade for dynamic color changes.\n\nMEDIEVAL REVEALED\n\nBehold, video of the Sabertron Medieval Sword edition as first revealed by Geek.com.\n\n\nFIVE WAYS TO SLAY  \nSabertron swords feature five types of gameplay.  \nONE HIT TO WIN IT\nSelf explanatory. Land one successful body hit, and you win.  \nCOUNTDOWN\nLand three hits to win.  \nMETERED DAMAGE\nThe stronger the blow, the more damage your opponent takes.  \nETERNAL STRUGGLE\nIdentical to Countdown, only you can earn health back over the passage of time, or by blocking several blows. \nHOPELESS\nThe name says it all. Identical to Eternal Struggle, only you can earn health back more quickly, and with even fewer blocks. Also, the lower your health gets, the less damage you'll take. \n LARP LIKE YOU\u2019VE ALWAYS WANTED TO LARP\nWhile the current swords support one-on-one duels, Sabertronic technology will soon be implemented in multiplayer based games. Health meters worn on the chest and back are scheduled to be available in late 2014, allowing anyone to join the fray in multiplayer Melee Mode. Additional equipment like active shields, helmets, and body armor are right around the corner. Those of you in the LARPing community are doubtlessly blinking back tears of joy.\nEXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED SCIENTIFIC ENGINEERING TYPE STUFF\nSabertron employs an accelerometer to detect when the sword has impacted another object. Wireless communication allows the swords to distinguish between the impact of another sword, versus another player. It\u2019s similar to the technology inside your smart phone. Only, inside a foam sword. Which is better than a smart phone. Because it's a sword.\nLED light strips on the front and back of the handle indicate a player\u2019s health. Each valid hit decrements health, and the first player to run out of health loses. An LCD touchscreen in the handle is included with the Grandmaster and Blackout editions.\nFORGED FROM NEARLY INDESTRUCTIBLE MATERIALS \nSabertron swords utilize a nearly indestructible core of ultra-durable polycarbonate plastic and tough, easily replaceable foam blades. These are extremely high-quality products. They\u2019ll stand up to as many fights as you\u2019re up for, all while weighing less than one pound.\n   REWARDS\nThree tiers of Sabertron Foam Swords are available to backers, all of which will be delivered this year in time for the holidays.\nTHE SABERTRON APPRENTICE SERIES\nAvailable in Medieval and Lightsword configurations, Apprentice-level Sabertron swords feature everything you need to start battling. Both models come with five game modes and an integrated health meter. With the Lightsword, you can choose between red, green, and blue foam blades (these are very similar to the swords seen in our video). With the Medieval Sword, a steel-grey foam blade is paired with a period-appropriate handle, pommel, and grip.\nTHE SABERTRON MASTER SERIES\nA step above the Apprentice Series. Lightswords in the Master Series feature illuminating blades in your choice of color (red, green, or blue) and a rechargeable battery, while Medieval Swords come with a steel-grey foam illuminating blade, wrapped grip, metallic-finish pommel & handle, and a rechargeable battery. Master models also include the five game modes and integrated health meter of the Apprentice level swords.\nTHE SABERTRON GRANDMASTER SERIES\nThe pinnacle of foam combat. Both models in the Grandmaster Series feature an LCD touchscreen and your own name inscribed on the handle. Swords in this tier utilize Bluetooth connectivity to communicate with a smartphone app, allowing you to track your fighting stats over time and update with new game modes as they're developed. Grandmaster models come with a neutral illuminating blade enabling dynamic color changes (controlled via the LCD touchscreen) plus an additional blade in your choice of color (red, green, or blue). Grandmaster models also come with all of the features of the Master level swords, including a rechargeable battery.\nBLACKOUT COLLECTOR'S EDITION SABERTRON SET\nThe evil twin of the Grandmaster Series. It's got a black handle with low-key accents and a special purple color profile for the health meter and illuminated blade, intended to emulate a black light. Each sword is individually numbered with a certificate of authenticity only available to backers at this Kickstarter reward level. That's in addition to everything featured in the Grandmaster Series. Be afraid.\nSABERTRON ADD-ON PAIRS\nAdd $139 to your MASTER QUAD PACK PLEDGE to add an additional pair of Sabertron Master swords in Lightsword or Medieval styles. Or $278 for two additional pairs, etc. (not available for shipments outside the US)\nAdd $199 to your GRANSMASTER QUAD PACK PLEDGE to add an additional pair of Sabertron Grandmaster swords in Lightsword or Medieval styles.

If Sabertron were a movie, these 16 years would be the inspirational training sequence wherein David discovers and masters the technology behind wireless electronic swordplay. \nThe idea to create Sabertron arose out of a simple desire to get his kids off the couch. He figured he could build something as fun as a video game and make it infinitely more active.  \nWith LevelUp Inc., David aims to bring interactive gaming into the real world. Products like Sabertron are only the beginning. Ultimately, LevelUp will offer a full line of connected games and experiences \u2013 none of which require you to stare at a screen for hours on end.\nTim Reichard is an electrical engineer with specialized experience in design validation and test automation. He is a fierce practitioner of the controversial Screaming Lotus style of sword fighting.\nJoe Mandy is a computer engineer with over 10 years of experience testing highly complex computer assemblies for manufacturing facilities. He is also pursuing an MBA in Business Management. His additional skills include stabbing, parrying, and the overhead-torso-smash.\nSABERTRON CALENDAR\nLook for the Sabertron team at the following events.

This campaign is now closed. \"To order a March of the Ants or other Weird City Games merchandise, go to weirdcitygames.com/shop\n\"This is a game of its own 'type.' Fully satisfying thematic conflict driven Euro \u2013 I love it.\" -Undead Viking\n\"March of the Ants is a great game. It fires on all cylinders and should appeal to a wide audience.\" -Geek Insight from gfbrobot.com\n\"It\u2019s pretty much exactly what you\u2019d expect and want from a game called March of the Ants.\" -GeekDad.com Review.\nAs spring dawns the great thaw begins. Deep beneath the lush meadow grasses the queen stirs in her nest and the colony comes to life. Soldiers venture forth, battling centipedes while clashing with opposing colonies for territory. Workers dig an ever-expanding network of tunnels in their tireless search for food. The first larvae hatch and it is clear this generation will be different: the young colonies rapidly evolve into a multitude of new forms. The ants march out to claim the meadow as their own.\nIn March of the Ants, you create the shared meadow board by sending your ants to explore it, revealing and strategically placing twenty unique hexes like Fern, Pebble, and Nest of Centipedes. Each hex contains vital resources as well as an underground network of tunnels that connect you to your friends\u2026and your enemies.\nPopulate new territory by breeding larvae and marching your ants onto collection sites. Will you engage competing colonies in battle, seeking to claim the land for yourself? Or will you establish peaceful, symbiotic relationships and share the spoils? Fortunately for you, there are cards that support and reward a wide variety of strategies. Collecting and managing the colony's resources in your nest is the first step in your bid for meadow dominance.\nMid-way through a four player game (prototype components).\nForage for Event Cards like Strange Appetite, Cold Snap, and Fungal Outbreak to impact the entire board \u2013 or just one unlucky opponent. What might you find as you dig through the deck of fifty-four unique cards?\n Mutate your colony with special evolution cards like the Trap Jaw head, Weaver thorax, and Leaf Cutter abdomen. What weird and wondrous path will your colony\u2019s evolution take: advanced Workers, fearsome Soldiers, or a fertile Queen? Each evolution helps forge your colony's destiny, enhancing your ants' capabilities while shaping your strategy.\nEmerge triumphant by scoring Colony Points as your ants explore and control the Meadow. Search for Colony Goals like Epic Stores, Followers of the Eyeless, and Extensive Tunnels to plan your route to victory.\nFeaturing beautiful original art and illustrations, March of the Ants is a fun, dynamic, and interactive board game that takes strategy underground\u2026literally! \n1 Great Tunnel center tile\n20 Meadow Hex tiles\n4 player nest mats\n144 larvae/ant tokens (wooden cubes)\n54 Ant Cards\n12 page full color rulebook\n4 player aids\n1 wooden 1st player marker\n1 round marker token\n1 Colony Score Track\n30 food tokens (wooden discs)\n8 centipede/wormhole tokens\nNote: The Custom Wood Round Marker, Centimeeples and Blank Card Stretch Goals will not be included in the base game of March of the Ants sold at retail. This makes them a great, non-exclusive perk for backing the game on Kickstarter. We are working to keep the retail price of the game as affordable as possible, which is why these wooden components will not be included in the retail version of the game.\n\"March of the Ants is a wonderful resource management game with a layer of direct competition and area control...it has great thematic elements, aggressive play, direct conflict, and other aspects that really make the game come alive and feel highly interactive.\"- Geek Insight Review on Giant Fire Breathing Robot\n\nUndead Viking Video Review:\n\"I really like the way that when you select an action in the Worker phase, the other players get a secondary action. It keeps everyone in the game even when it\u2019s not their turn. Another thing I like is that there are multiple paths to victory. Just because you manage to put a lot of ants out on the board doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to win.\" Geekdad.com review by Jonathan H. Liu\n\"March of the Ants is a great mix of resource management, exploration, area control, and card play. It really hits a sweet spot with lots of interesting decisions packed into a short period of time, and it really manages to be complex without being complicated. Overall, March of the Ants is a rich and rewarding experience. After back-to-back plays I still want more!\" - James Brady, Owner of Cloud Cap Games\n\"I was lucky enough to play this game at Gamestorm this year in Vancouver, WA. While March of the Ants is still in its final developmental stage, it already offers unusually tight gameplay and dynamic variability in the choices available to the players. Interesting tile placement exploration blends well with a multi-use card system that allows you to evolve, trigger events or receive battle bonuses. It is all enhanced by great art throughout. This is the increasingly rare game that's actually worthy of your Kickstarter dollars, and then some!\" - Rob Faulconer, BGG\nInspired by diverse mechanics from Race for the Galaxy, Twilight Imperium and Eclipse, March of the Ants offers dynamic player interaction and abundant thematic flavor, challenging each player to create a thriving ant colony through a variety of strategies from aggressive expansion to dedicated evolution to peaceful coexistence and symbiosis.\nEach round is divided into three phases: Worker, Soldier, Queen. \nDuring the Worker Phase your ants will perform the various actions of Explore, Forage, and March as well as playing Event, Evolution, and Colony Goal cards. \nAll actions have a secondary action that the other players get to perform, so every player is continuously active and engaged during the game! \nIn the Soldier Phase ant battle is resolved in all Meadow Hexes that are contested. Combat is light and fast, featuring a simultaneous reveal mechanic that adds dramatic tension to each ant battle. \nAnt battle is an important part of March of the Ants but is not the focus of the game; aggression can complement some strategies nicely but might also leave you spread thin and defenseless! \nDuring the Queen Phase all resources are collected and you must feed all of your ants in the Meadow. The queen also gives you a choice of producing food or larvae through her Royal Decree, balancing your economy as you plan your next turn. \nEvolutions: For your ants to rise above all the others you must evolve. By adding new evolutions to your head, thorax or abdomen thousands of unique ant species can be discovered, helping to shape your strategy and path to victory. \nSet-up takes less than 5 minutes! With one deck of cards, multi-purpose egg/larvae/ant tokens and interlocking modular hex tiles, our game's elegant design fosters immersive, strategic gameplay without feeling overwhelming or stressful. All with a total play time of about an hour and fifteen minutes.\nMarch of the Ants Playthrough Video Round One:\n For a continuation of this game see the videos at the bottom of the project page.\nDraft Rules (plain text)\nDraft Rules (text and diagrams)\nPledge at the Marching Ant level or higher and you will receive the game before it is available at retail and at $10 below expected MSRP.\nWe offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you are not completely satisfied with the game return it to us with 30 days of receiving it and we will give you a complete refund.\nYour Support is Essential: We have done all of the work designing and creating original art for this game and need your help to make it a reality.\nAwesome Stretch Goals: By pledging now for $35 or more you are eligible for any and all Kickstarter stretch goals.\nMarch of the Ants features elegant design that has gone through dozens of drafts and revisions through discussion and play testing. We have created a massive cache of amazing original art to match the theme and feel of the game. The high-quality components are intuitive and functional. March of the Ants is already a great game; we are confident it can become even better if we all spread the word, rally the board gaming community, and exceed our basic funding goal.\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #1 $22,500: This amount of funding will add a mini-expansion of another social insect to the world of the ants. This will provide 6 additional cards featuring head, thorax and abdomen evolutions of the new social insect, two Event cards that enhance that insect\u2019s theme, and a Colony Goal that matches that insect's approach to victory.\nBest of all, you, the backers, will select which social insect will be the first mini-expansion for March of the Ants. Will it be Bees, Spiders or Beetles?\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #2 $25,000: Upgraded Card Quality - When this stretch goal is reached we will upgrade all of the Ant cards to 320gsm black core.

Start the game with variable player powers based on primitive evolutions!\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #4 $33,000 - Custom Wood Round Marker. This stretch goal will upgrade the chipboard round marker to a custom wood shape decided by the backers. Note: This stretch goal will not be included in the base retail version of March of the Ants.\n Social Stretch Goal #1 500 likes on Weird City Games Facebook Page: When this goal is reached we will add four full color pages to our rulebook. This will allow us to include information on the ant species that inspired the evolutions as well as information on specific card interactions.\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #5 36,000 - New Evolutions. Backers choose and nominate species to be used as inspiration for three new cards, a head, a thorax and an abdomen.\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #6 $40,000 - Centimeeples!This stretch goal will unlock four custom wood cut Centimeeple shapes will be included in the game, dramatically bringing the ants greatest threat to life. Centipedes are the main pest that ants must deal with in the Meadow and we are excited to include this upgrade in the game. Note: This stretch goal will not be included in the base retail version of March of the Ants.\n\nUnlocked Stretch Goal #7 $45,000 - At this level we will increase the box thickness from 1.5 mm to a very sturdy 2 mm chipboard.

This will be a wooden disc with a custom screen printed design.We have a couple ideas for the design but if you think you have a great idea please mention it in the comments. Note: This stretch goal will not be included in the base retail version of March of the Ants.\nStretch Goal #10 $60,000 - 5 Player Expansion. When we reach this level we will add components to enable a fifth player to march into the meadow. We are very excited that this game will be playable with larger and more diverse groups.\nStretch Goal #11 $65,000 - Mimic Ants - the imposters, copycats and doppelgangers of the ant world will be added in the form of three new evolutions, allowing players to interact and effect the other nests ant evolutions.\nStretch Goal #12 $70,000 - Beyond the Meadow - When this stretch goal is reached we will add three new specialty hexes to March of the Ants including the most dangerous and feared Ant Lion Lair.\nThis project would not be possible without all of you, our wonderful backers.

I started this campaign in order to kickstart my new miniatures company, called Creature Caster. I am rewarding my backers with discounted prices, beautiful models, bundle deals, free gifts, plus some really special Kickstarter exclusive parts for your models.\nMy professional experience includes sculpting for film and television. I have freelance sculpted dozens of wargame miniatures over the past 6 years. Upon finishing school I have become experienced in modern tools such as CG modelling and 3D printing.\nI am also the original founder and sculptor for Ultraforge Miniatures, a small and successful miniatures company. This gained me valuable experience in the fields of manufacturing, retail and fulfilment.\nCreature Caster miniatures are large, detailed resin-cast models. They are very well suited for painting, war gaming and display.\nMy style is grounded in realism, with a strong emphasis on anatomy and balance. I prefer my sculptures to have a clear silhouette, a balanced hierarchy-of-shape, and look great from every angle.\nThe surface detail is carefully designed to look great when painted by a beginner, after a simple basecoat, ink and drybrush.\nQuality printing and casting is absolutely essential. I have the experience, knowledge and passion to make Creature Caster the Cadillac of model kits. \nIn order to bring a CG sculpture into reality I require 3D printing. I am experienced in sourcing out 3D printing that is normally reserved for dental and jewellery applications. This specialized process can create a print which is completely free of any build evidence such as graininess or stepping.\nOur final 3D prints become the mold masters, which are then hand-cast in a solid grey resin. This material beautifully locks in every detail, while adding durability and a nice weight.\nMy models are carefully designed, very detailed... and big! Creature Caster makes huge models while maintaining playability and cohesiveness with the other units on the battlefield. \n\nThese are the kinds of models that turn heads from across the room and have people asking \"what is that?\"\nI always stand my models on a small footprint. Demons are 50 x 50mm, dragons are 50mm x 75mm. The models are very well balanced, with their weight evenly distributed throughout the length of the model. This makes them very stable and playable on the tabletop.\n The 28mm figure pictured above is from Arcane Factories, an emerging company that makes beautiful miniatures. Click here to visit their Facebook page.\nEach model is still a work in progress and is subject to change. After the campaign is complete, there will be a final phase of sculpting to apply fan feedback and to further hone these models.\nClick on the pictures below to visit creaturecaster.com, where you will find even more pictures, 360 turnarounds of the CG models, and detailed descriptions on the design of each creature.\n The Treewalker is the first of the Creature Caster walkers. In the future we able to add the Swampwalker, Stonewalker, Steelwalker, Bonewalker, Steamwalker, etc. She will be in a standing pose. I am still developing the final pose and need to choose between a few options for her Kickstarter exclusive parts, so get involved in the conversation in the comments section, on the forums and on our Facebook page.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            The challenge with Spider Demon was to create a creature with the appearance of an elf goddess who fell into darkness. Her design is inspired by the biomechanical renderings of HR Giger. Spider Demon is a balancing act between monster and maiden, with her skin transitioning from hard to soft. While these juxtapositions make for a very dynamic sculpt, it was the choice to subtly blend these elements and introduce grace into the model that finally brought her to life.\nThe Spider Demon is evolving into a beautiful beast. Her mouth in the video above has been re-sculpted into a more sly expression. This was prompted by fan interaction, and was documented in this Youtube vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBkonmC3q8E \n Inspired by the song \"Angel of Death\", here is the Plague Angel. This is another attempt at using a new silhouette with the classic plague theme. This model also makes use of one of the pre-campaign speedsculpt busts. This model represents a lot of anatomy knowledge with this plague ridden physique. It is actually a lot of fun to sculpt this stuff and the Plague Angel is a joy to work on. We feel this model will absolutely steal the show when on the tabletop. \nI am very pleased to introduce Mr.Maggot to the campaign. This was a model that was developed in the pre campaign in an effort to provide a unique silhouette to the plague theme. This pole scythe is a living weapon, with a luminous beacon on the end, similar to what you might find on an angler fish. This helps lure mortals which are food for the ever ravenous hive. \n\nThis model is a work in progress and is subject to minor changes.\n                                                                                                                                                                                             Warrior Demon is our take on the \"big angry demon\" archetype, but we wanted to develop something unique. We knew that he would be a berserker, wearing no metal armor. His \"demorganic\" (demon + organic) armor instead grows from the inside out, protruding through his skin from his calcified and warped skeleton. These armored areas take on the shapes of skulls, which are all of them tortured and twisted together. He attacks with his bone sword/axe hybrid. This demon looks great both with and without his wings, and his kit provides the pieces for you to choose either option\n                                                                                                                                                                                             The challenge we had with Pincer Demon was to create a creature with four arms, and then to legitimize his anatomy with a musculature that is as closely grounded in reality as we could achieve. To add to this challenge, we decided to put him in a very dynamic and asymmetrical pose, in order to add energy and agility to this complicated physique. Finally, he had to look good from every angle, as well as having a balanced weight. Pincer Demon proved to be an immense design challenge. We are very satisfied with the results and we are proud to share them with you.\n                                                                                                                                                                                             Vulture Demon's nature is that of constant turmoil and anguish. To represent this, his skin crawls with an ever changing collection of eyes, scales, teeth and horns. His skin tears and stretches open to show further layers of torn and stretched skin. These elements could cause a miniature to appear cluttered and unfocused. We went to great lengths to make sure that Vulture Demon's anatomy and silhouette was strong enough to hold all of these elements together. To juxtapose this war that rages across his skin, Vulture Demon's expression is that of careful calculation.\n\nThe Vulture Demon just recently got an overhaul on his wings. Each feather is now extremely detailed. You can see these changes on the Vulture Demon's most recent renders on creaturecaster.com\n                                                                                                                                                                                             The challenge we set out for ourselves with Emperor Dragon was twofold. First, we wanted to create the biggest dragon that we could fit onto a 50mm by 75mm footprint and have him perfectly balanced and playable as a wargame miniature. His heavy rock base provides the perfect counterweight to keep the miniature stable on the battlefield. Second, we wanted to make the character of Emperor Dragon that of the most ancient and venerable of dragons. His expression and scale texture is unique to a creature who has existed through many winters and many wars.\n\nEmperor Dragon comes with a howdah, allowing you to use your own miniatures to represent the rider, and also comes with a saddle if you prefer to model your dragon riders in a seated position. The countersunk recess on his back is 20mm by 20mm.\n                                                                                                                                                                                             In terms of age, we wanted Mountain Dragon to feel like a younger and more sinister dragon than Emperor Dragon. He is the more impulsive and ambitious of the two. We wanted Mountain Dragon to slither over his perch in a way that felt malevolent and sneaky. We set about the ambitious task to make his scales extremely detailed and lifelike. The frequency and size of his scales are based on a great deal of research, and we are glad to share the results of our hard work.\n\nMountain Dragon comes with a howdah, allowing you to use your own miniatures to represent the rider, and also comes with a saddle if you prefer to model your dragon riders in a seated position. The countersunk recess on his back is 20mm by 20mm.\n  The Zombie Dragon is an absolute playground of undead textures! Still to come are the Zombie Dragon Kickstarter exclusive parts, so stay tuned for those.  \nZombie Dragon comes with a howdah, allowing you to use your own miniatures to represent the rider, and also comes with a saddle if you prefer to model your dragon riders in a seated position. The countersunk recess on his back is 20mm by 20mm.\nEveryone knows that we love to sculpt both demons and dragons. The Possessed Dragon allows us the chance to combine these two themes in one model. We get a chance to include some warped skin that is featured on models like the Vulture Demon. We also get to use the size and epic stature of the Emperor Dragon. This model is both nightmare-fuel and dream-come-true :)\nThe Possessed Dragon comes with a howdah, allowing you to use your own miniatures to represent the rider, and also comes with a saddle if you prefer to model your dragon riders in a seated position. \nIt is important to note that the countersunk recess on the Possessed Dragon's back is 25mm by 25mm. On the other dragons this recess is 20mm by 20mm. The 25mm size was brought about from asking our focus group what the optimal size would be, and we chose to respect the consensus opinion. \nA small company often must use their own starting capital to develop a new miniature and bring it to market, and then use the profits from that miniature to fund the development of the next. This is a slow process, and it is one of the main drawbacks of being a small company.\nKickstarter crowd funding will allow Creature Caster to bring an entire catalog of miniatures to market at once. I can then offer a wider variety of models in a shorter amount of time. I can also offer bundled shipping due to the customer being able to select and order several models at once.\nFollowing in the footsteps of the most successful Kickstarters over the last 2 years, we will use a post-campaign pledge manager in order to give you a fair and accurate shipping quote. On top of this, we will be stocking multiple global warehouses, ensuring even greater savings on your shipping.\nAfter the campaign is complete, and some time has passes to review and process each payment, we will send you a link to our PLEDGE MANAGER. You can let us know what you have pledged towards and where you would like your package shipped. \nOnce the models are finished being made we will then stock the warehouse closest to you. You will then receive a bill asking for the amount needed to ship your models the remaining distance to your point of delivery. This method saves you money, and will never have you paying an inflated or padded shipping cost. \n\n\nOur fulfilment service allows us to ship from hubs in key places all around the world. We should even be able to have you avoid playing the European VAT, among other inflated shipping and duty charges. You are not paying for a ship that starts on other side of the world. You are paying for a ship that embarks as close to you as possible.\nI understand that there might be a fear due to the uncertainly of knowing your exact shipping charge before making a pledge. You can have confidence knowing that we will make every possible effort to make sure that your shipping fee is fair and reasonable, so pledge with confidence.\nFor my Australian brothers and sisters: We promise to do everything within our power to make your shipping fair and less painful for you. We are looking into warehouses and distribution in Australia. We will keep you informed thru the entire post-campaign up until we ship. \nOnce we get all of our models cast and boxed in the workshop, we will be able to give you a much better idea of the weight involved with the shipment, and this will help when determining the shipping fee you can expect to pay.

The convention center was newly renovated last year.  Downtown Waco welcomes all of us geek, nerds, and gamer dorks with open arms once again.  \n\nYou can see the Waco Convention Center in all it's glory here:\n\nhttp://www.wacocc.com/\n\nThe best part about Waco though is the low cost of entertainment around the area.  OK, that's only one thing.  We've got tons of benefits such as lots of space, convenient location, lots of eating and shopping within two blocks of WaCon...oh, and the best part is that parking is F-R-E-E!  And if you're flying in, Waco has a pretty nice airport too.\n\nIt's also a reasonable drive from most major cities in in the region: Dallas (1.5 hours), Austin (1.5 hours), San Antonio (3), Houston (3), Abilene (3), Lubbock (6), Oklahoma City (4), Tulsa (6), Little Rock (6), New Orleans (8), and Shreveport (4). \n\nJust like last year we'll have some local sponsors as well as national ones.  All contributing to goody bags, prizes, and volunteer rewards.\n\nThough, before going any further we do want to talk about something:\nWe want to address last year's dice issue and apologize.  This year, we got on this early and already have a plan in place for the dice pricing and printing.  Shouldn't be an issue this time around.  \n\n\nOK, with that aside, hop over and take a quick look at our website.  It got a nice new look for this year:  www.wacogamecon.com \nIn other fun news, we're adding 4,000 sq. ft. of space to WaCon.  This gives us some versatility in adding a few events and allows us to be more creative with our event space.  This should be something everyone can appreciate.\n\nWe'll have a large Magic the Gathering cash tournament, a large Warmachine/Hordes event, a Warhammer 40K Golden Throne tournament, tons of card gaming, tons of board game events along with a dedicated board game room, dealers area, lots of demos, special guests, and something else fun we'll mention later.\nThe VIP room was an experiment that went over pretty well last year.  We learned a major thing though.  It was nice having the room out of the way to get some peace and relax.  Unfortunately, it lead to an \"out of sight, out of mind\" thing for a few people.  \n\nTo fix this issue, part of our new space is going to be used for the new VIP area.  We should also have some neat new features for the VIP folks to enjoy during their downtime.  In addition to the snacks and drinks that will be available to VIP'ers for free all weekend, we're going to have some catering brought in for Friday night.  We want to keep adding value to our VIP packages.\nWhile we're on the topic of new space, we should let you guys in on a few other neat things.  We're going to have a few guest speakers this year.  We didn't have any last year, because we wanted all of the locals to experience lots of hands on activities for their first event.  This year, we're making the leap to start adding other features.  We should have at least three, but we're still in discussions with several.  Details will be announced as they are confirmed.\n\nThere's going to be an expanded dealers hall.  Our expected number of vendors should be 20-22.  We'll also have a separate area for promotional and information booths and will have a nice large space for those groups as well. \n\nWe did get some artists confirmed already though:\nrk post\nClint Cearly\nGalen Ihlenfeldt\nAll three of these artists have some amazing work.  Click through to their pages to see what they have to offer.\n\nrk post and Clint Cearly have both agreed to supply some unique art pieces to everyone that attends the dinner with the guests this year.  And in an act of amazing graciousness, Cearly will also be providing a piece of art for one of our charity auctions.\n I'm sure most of you reading this already know what Munchkin is.  Well, I can let you know that we have already secured some special Munchkin items that will likely only be available at conventions this year.  We're also in discussions with Steve Jackson games about making a WaCon exclusive item :)\n\nI'm sure you're wondering what all types of gaming we'll have.  Well, the answer is nearly everything tabletop.  Last year we had demos or tournaments for over 50 products.  Our events will include, but are not limited to:\n\nCCGs: Magic, YuGiOh, Cardfight Vanguard, My Little Pony, Pokemon\n\nMiniatures: Star Wars X-Wing, Star Trek Attack Wing, D&D Attack Wing, Warhammer 40K, Warmachine/Hordes, Heroclix\n\nRoleplaying Games: D&D Next, D&D 3E, Pathfinder, Shadowrun, Star Wars Edge of the Empire, Warhammer 40K RPG\n\nBoard Games: TONS of everything, including a free board game library to check out and use.\nThere was a fun idea thrown around a couple of months ago that we're following up on.  We're going to have a \"Play-And-Win\" section added to our board game area.  We will have a special section of games that when you play them during the weekend, your name will go into a drawing to win it.  We're hoping this develops into a neat way for smaller publishers to get their item in front of people and get exposure for new products.\n\nAnd that fun thing we mentioned a little while ago...this year we're adding in some cosplay flavor to WaCon.  Why not?  We're only a few days before Halloween this year.  What better time to do some costuming.  \n\nWe're going to have a full on costume contest.  We'll be using the onsite auditorium.  There will be a celebrity judge.  And you yourself can have a crack and being a judge.  Be sure to get your best costume on to walk the stage and win some prizes.  \n\n\nWe'll have a full slate of events and presentations like we did last year.  And the auctions will be even bigger and better.  Our charity auctions will benefit a local no-kill animal shelter and a local food pantry. \n\nWe're going bigger and better this year and giving our attendees even more for their money.  We want to see attendance grow as well as it can, while keeping our focus on fun, interactivity, and enjoyment.\n\n\nFollow us on Facebook at:  www.facebook.com/wacogamecon\n\nYou can also keep up with details on our website at www.wacogamecon.com\n\n\nSTRETCH GOALS!!!  \n***@ $7,900 - We're giving away a game a week to someone at the GAMER level or higher.

Additionally, the winner of our costume contest will get a feature and interview on their website.\n***UPDATE*** 3/17/14\nDanielle \"Hellgirl\" Lingo will be a guest at the show.  She'll also be giving a presentation on beginning tips for good cosplay.\nDanielle Lingo will be making an appearance and giving a speech on cosplay for beginners.

Then we got hit with a double whammy.  We had some guest scheduling issues and cancellations.  Then we got approval to move our store, The Game Closet, into what is now our new 8,000 sq. ft location.  \n\nWe've spent the past three weeks sending emails, making phone calls, meeting with the convention center, and working on the website to get everything back on track.  And to answer all the messages, YES, WaCon 2015 is still happening.\n\nThis year's dates are October 23rd-25th.\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, we've made some changes that our attendees should really enjoy.\n\nFor starters, all the convention events will be on the same floor.  This year, we've got all of WaCon happening on the upper floor of the Waco Convention Center.  This is better for staffing.  It's more convenient for the attendees.  It's better for our vendors. \n\nWe're adding more programming in our panels.  We were pretty surprised at how well the the cosplay panels were received last year and we've added more this year.  We're also going to have some on game design and production.  We're going to try and cover a larger variety of game industry topics since so many people are trying to create and publish products these days.\n\nThe cosplay contest will be better presented, even more streamlined, and have more chances for photo ops.  We're really happy with how things will be setup this year. \n\nWe're working with more groups and companies to have more game demos this year.  Attendees should also get the chance to try more new games as well as play more games with some of the designers and creators that will be attending this year. \n\nWe're hashing out details for a Geek Game Show which should be loads of fun and we'll also have a Nerdcore Stand Up Comedy Show.  \n\nOur goal has always been to try and offer a few unique items and events at WaCon that attendees can't really participate in normally to make it worth the trip.  We believe we've stepped up and made that happen this year.  Hopefully you all agree as well.\n\n\n\n\nWe won't have our new website go live for a few days still, but we figured we'd let those of you that have been supporting us get some early details and first dibs at signing up.  \n\nThis year attendees will save on each package by signing up early versus signing up at the door.  We also have a limited number of VIP tickets as well as Dinner With the Guest tickets.  We feel that it's only right to let those that have supported us in the past get first shot at signing up.  \n\nThe official website with full event details and such will still be at:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "A personal project we're requesting help with...", "update_content": "I hope that this update isn't found to be too intrusive.

It's a tabletop card game that's non-collectible. Everything is in one box."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Wrap-up and looking toward next year....", "update_content": "First, let me start by thanking EVERYONE that participated and that helped make WaCon possible.  Now that we've got convention events under our belt, we've got a better overall handle on things and have some great plans for the future.\n\nLet's start with the bad things...\n\nAttendance was up, but by only a small margin.  Only 3%.  This should be good I suppose, but we spent much more on promotion and advertising this year.  We even had commercials running.  This however was related to the fact that a large percentage of the attendees were from out of the area.  Many people traveled to WaCon this year, which is great.  \n\nWhat's been told to us though, is that due to another local event that scheduled well after us and presented a couple week prior to us, many locals were strapped for cash and/or time.  Even though it was a comic convention is did beat us up a bit.  Fortunately, from what we're hearing next year, this situation won't be happening again, so we expect to see the growth increase to a more expected level.\n\nOur layout is also nowhere near the functionality that we wanted.  We spread things over a little more space this year and it was both good and bad.  But we don't want people to have to traverse such large distances to experience everything going on in the future.  It will also make events easier to locate and make it easier to handle announcements.\n\nWe also had three dealers no call/no show on us.  That was a bit unfortunate.  It was mostly bothersome because we turned a couple of dealers away once we were full.  We also tried hard to keep dealer diversity so everyone benefits.  When someone doesn't show that leaves a void in the offerings for attendees.  This is a situation we're addressing pretty heavily.   \n\n\nEven though there were some issues, we did have a LOT of positive takeaways from this year.  Let me start by saying that everyone, especially our judges, were impressed with everyone that participated in the cosplay contest.  For a bunch of first timers, the costumes were very well done.  We also had many more participants than we anticipated.  All of the cosplay panels were also well attended.  We're exploring expanding that bit of programming next year.\n\nWe've also been in contact with the Waco Convention Center about using an entirely different layout for next year.  It will be more beneficial for the attendees, for the staff, and for the dealers.  We've got three layouts we're looking into, but will finalize one once a few more details start getting hammered out for next year (mostly events and guest selection).  \n\nWe saw people using all of the various upgrades in the VIP room this year, which was nice.  We also got many kudos on the food selection.  We will be doing follow up discussions about our lack of security on the VIP area.  That's a privilege that was purchased by a few select attendees and we had some people abuse it.  Rest assured that will not be happening next year.  We want it to stay nice, available, and worthwhile to those that spend a little more helping us put on a good event.  \n\nThe overall schedule of events worked well.  We had things spread out over the event pretty well, so people got to participate in most of what they wanted.  The only issue we had is that we had a HUGE increase of roleplayers this year that was a bit more than expected.  Even with more game masters running events we were a touch light on seats for players.  This is a good problem to have.  We'll definitely be doing more for roleplayers going forward with it being such a rising section.  \n\nWe're already talking to several guests for next year.  A few of them have verbally committed.  One of the really good ones, that I can't spoil yet, is awaiting his (oops, partial spoiler, it's a guy) official schedule.  It sounds he has a new project coming and he won't know his commitments until around February.  Hopefully by then we can't get the word out.\n\nWe're debating doing another Kickstarter campaign or not for year three.  We'll only do it if we think we need help with the early costs.  That would largely be due to any new venue costs, possible staffing/security (depending on new layout), and cost of the potential guests.  Most of the regular costs, we're pretty sure we have a handle on and they aren't a big deal at this point.  If we do one for WaCon 3, the funding goal will be much lower as the requirements won't be nearly as hefty. \n\nNow that we're a bit more established, we're able to get into more discussions with manufacturers for more company sponsored events.  We're looking forward to adding some cool things to next year's lineup.

They cover the speakers and redirect the sound to the front.  Thereby, you get an increase in 10dB loudness and clearer sound when listening to music or watching movies.\nWhen the Surface first came out, the max sound level was very low. Many people complained about it, and Microsoft updated the Surfaces to make them louder, but not much. Ears make up for the fact that the speakers on the Surface are not facing you. They work by simply redirecting the sound without using a power source.\nEars close up\nEars are small, lightweight, and won\u2019t interfere with use of the Surface. If you bump or move the Surface, or even hold it upside down; they won't fall off.  You can put them in your pocket or put them in your Surface\u2019s bag as they take little room. They are a convenient way to increase the sound of your Surface.\nHow does it Work?\nIt is pretty simple. When you slip the Ears over the top corners of the Surface, the sound goes through the little holes.  Ears then redirect the sound towards you; without Ears the sound is directed to the back. This gives you a higher volume effect without further effort.  Ears also gives the people around you a quieter enviroment.  For example, in a cubicle at the office, your co-workers in front and to the side of you no longer have the speakers facing in their direction.  Ears directs the sound to the front.\nEars sound direction\n  Ears with Packaging\nThe Story\nI live in China, where I run, a small quality control company helping small to mid-size western companies with quality control and sourcing in China. My laptop was starting to die. I had only one month left before I would return to Michigan for Christmas. Thankfully it made it! (Computers and products are very expensive in China.) I started to look for a new computer and found the Surface RT. It was perfect; light weight for the long travel to jobs, long battery life for the train rides across China and it including Microsoft suite for free.\nBack of Ears Packaging\nIn China, if I have spare time, I often watch movies, or listen to music. I soon found out that the volume of the Surface\u2019s speakers left much to desire. Plus, the noise and constant honking of Chinese traffic makes it even harder to hear. An air conditioning unit running doesn\u2019t help. I don\u2019t like to wear earphones, as they hurt after a while, and big ones take too much space while traveling. I looked at the design of the speakers and noticed that they pointed to the back and away from the user when s/he faces the screen.\nEars for Surface Pro/Pro 2\nI thought, how easy it would be just to slide a couple silicone pieces over the edges where the speakers are, and redirect the sound towards the user. After a few design sketches Paul DeWys of DeWys Industrial Design made 3D renderings for me.  I met Paul through a mutual business friend. He and his brother Ben have been helping me in my project by designing Ears from the rough paper drawings I had. I since have made working prototypes that fit both the Surface RT and Pro.\nThe result was an increase of up to 10db in volume!\nEars with db reader\n  Without Ears\n  Original Drawing\n  First Prototype\n  Redesign of Ears\n  Second Prototype\n  Testing Second Prototype\nThe Ears\nThe Ears are made out of silicone.  This makes them indestructible.  You can spill your beverage on them (remove them from Surface first), drop them off a building, fold them, stack books on them.  They will hold their shape and they are easy to clean.  The silicone material also provides a nice grip to stay on the Surface without falling off.  They come in all the Microsoft Surface keyboard colors.  Even a limited edition Kickstarter green!  Please see the Dropbox link for a close up of all the colors: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ix3z3gmajxmiyjb/PDghBTAcuz\nEars come in all the Microsoft Surface keyboard colors!\n  Kickstarter Ear!\n  Ears on the Surface Pro\n  Surface Pro/Pro 2 on the left, Surface RT/2 on the right\n  Surface Pro/Pro 2 on the left, Surface RT/2 on the right. Notice the different position and size of the speaker holes to accommodate the different position of speakers on the Surface RT and Pro.\nWhere do We Stand\nAt this point, we have working silicone Ears that fit the Surface RT/2 and Pro/2. I have packaging made and finalized. We have a Third Party Licensing Agreement with Microsoft to use their \u201cDesigned for Surface\u201d logo on our packaging.\nAfter a long selection process, I have selected a Chinese manufacturer for both the silicone product and plastic packaging. I have visited, and talked to them, confirmed their production capabilities and legitimate business documents. They have made samples of Ears that I have tested; they work and fit perfectly.\nMe and the silicone factory manager\nThe next step is to produce the tools, buy the silicone, and start production. This is where I need your help. I can\u2019t do this without you.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nAfter successfully funded, I will immediately hire a Chinese lawyer to write up an enforceable Chinese contract with my selected manufacturers. Once signed and stamped by the manufacturer, I will give my ok to make the tooling and start production. I will conduct my own quality control to ensure that everything is as intended; color, fit and material. During the first production run, we will produce enough Ears for all of our backers, and depending on the funds, a small amount extra to keep the ball rolling for future orders.\nBefore shipment, I will conduct a final quality control audit to make sure that everything is correct. The Ears will be shipped to our warehouse in Holland, Michigan, where they are sorted and shipped via USPS to our backers.\nAllocation of Funds\n$275 to Kickstarter\n$275 to Amazon\n$3,006 molds and production for backers\n$2178.50 Shipping (This includes shipping from China and domestic shipping to individual backers)\nAllocation of Funds\nMeet the Team\nBrandon Schaap\nBrandon Schaap \u2013 I am from Holland, Michigan. After completing my Bachelors in International Business at Davenport University, I moved to China to study Chinese. I have been living in China for four years now. Two years ago, I started a small import/export company, which now focuses on quality control.\nI love to invent and think of new ideas and products that make our lives easier. Since childhood, I always was fascinated by taking things apart, seeing how they work, and building/fixing things. I like to make my own fixes for life\u2019s little nuisances.\nPaul and Ben DeWys of DeWys Industrial Design\nPaul and Ben DeWys \u2013 Paul DeWys of DeWys Industrial Design and his brother Ben have been helping me design this project. Paul has been in manufacturing since he was 15, and even interned at Bosch in China. Ben is a very talented industrial designer, who has contributed a lot of the actual foot work, trying to decipher my chicken scratches that I call design drawings.\nI met Paul through a very successful business friend in Michigan who said we ought to meet each other because we both are young entrepreneurs and like to shoot guns. Working with Paul and Ben has been great. Paul really has helped me to learn a lot about design engineering and building a company in general. He has been at the beginning of building my company; I take a lot of advice from him.\nJerry Zhang\nJerry Zhang - I meet Jerry in Shenzhen when I was looking for a video producer.  Since he has a Surface tablet as well, he was excited about Ears.  As someone with his own Kickstarter ideas, he worked with me on this project, created the video, and peovided great support and feedback.\nProject Timeline\nTimeline - expect delivery of Ears beginning-mid June.\nFAQ\nDo you ship internationally?\nYes, we will ship internationally. Of course, it might take a little longer depending on your laws and customs. The additional price for shipping internationally is $2. Please know your laws and customs before ordering. You are responsible for any duties and customs.\nThe Surface and Surface 2 are difference size\u2026\nYes, technically the Surface 2 is .4mm smaller. I own the Surface RT, the original. So I was unable to show the nicely fitted Ear on the Surface 2 or Surface Pro/2 on the video. If you look closely at the video you will notice the edges of the Ear is bulging out a little, just a little. This is because Ears was designed for the Surface 2 as I think the sales are better. The performance is the same, the speakers are in the same position.\nAm I missing anything?\nThank you! \u8c22\u8c22\u60a8\uff01", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause of the low complexity of this product, I don\u2019t see major risks. There is always some risk that the Chinese factory has delays, because of quality, shipping or whatever is the issue of the week that the factory comes up with. This is the benefit of living in China. I can speak a little Chinese and I know what to look for to protect against the common risks. But nothing is 100%.\n\nIn China, a lot of manufactures will create perfect samples and request fair payment for production of your anticipated quality. Then, when actual production starts, they will make lower quality products only to pocket the extra. This risk has been mitigated by hiring Chinese lawyers to sign a NNN and OEM contract with the factory. This way they are bounded by Chinese law to do what our contract says. Contrary to popular believe, contracts in China are NOT toilet paper. I see little risk there.\n\nColor is my biggest risk. Since silicone has to be mixed by hand, in smaller factories, and checked by eye to get the correct color, there is a good chance that the color will be shades off. This risk I have addressed seriously by signing OEM contracts that state the production must stop, if the quality control audit does not pass, and the produced Ears must be destroyed and recycled. All to the expense of the factory. During production, quality audits will be performed in order to detect any problems early on.\n\nThis has also happened, when I ordered samples from the factory. I gave them the correct pantone colors that I receive from Microsoft and Kickstarter. They sent me the wrong shades of the colors. They have since corrected the color and sent me new samples.\n\nIn addition, the factory and I will split, pairs of matching Ears for reference that have been approved by me beforehand. Since the Ears come in pairs, I will take a correct color pair, keep one and give one to the factory. We will both sign off on these samples. This gives them an honest chance to do the job correctly, and without leaving them blind while I demand them to perform. But it also protects me from corruption and human error.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "General Announcements and Wholesale", "update_content": "Good morning everyone,\nI just have some general announcements.\nSome people have come to me asking me if they can help me in any way to pay for the higher shipping costs that I incurred during the Kickstarter campaign.

As Bombshell Miniatures we successfully completed three Kickstarter campaigns and with each one we've improved our production capabilities, fulfillment process and on-time rate. Our most recent project helped us streamline backer reward selection and made international shipping more economical for our friends abroad.\n\nEven with all our previous experience we are still a small company dependent on a few people to do a lot of work. We know backers expect to be treated fairly and receive their rewards in a timely manner, so on-time fulfillment and backer satisfaction has been and always will be our top priority. That's why we decided early on to have the core set miniatures sculpted and ready to go to mold as soon as the project completes. In addition, we're providing a preview copy of the rules during the campaign so everyone can get a feel for game play in the Counterblast universe. In short, we want you to know exactly what you'll be getting from us as a backer of this project and that we are very serious about making Counterblast happen.\n\nDespite our best efforts the unexpected can occur. We are dependent on outside manufacturers to produce our products and delays can sometimes happen. Fortunately, we have established good working relationships with our main suppliers and do not anticipate any delays.\n\nOne of our goals is to attend GenCon this year with brand new Counterblast product in hand. That's why our \"Early Bird\" levels are not at a discounted price, but at an earlier fulfillment target. We didn't want to risk being victims of too much success and letting some of or backers down if we went to GenCon before sending out everyone's rewards. We feel we can get rewards in the hands of a limited number of people before GenCon and to everyone else soon after.\n\nThe last risk has to do with our reward levels and stretch goals. As a small company we do not have the same efficiencies and production capabilities as larger organizations that frequently use Kickstarter as a means to launch new products. We're trying to get Airlock off the ground which means money is tight and our margin razor thin. We've tried to come up with creative offerings that we hope backers will find intriguing and enticing enough to trust us with their hard earned money.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "The Revised Scout Ship Kickstarter is now LIVE!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Counterblast 2nd Edition Preorder", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "PreOrder Counterblast in 1 Week!", "update_content": "PreOrders begin 25 May 2017"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "Counterblast 2nd Edition Coming Soon!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Counterblast News", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "COUNTERBLAST DLX Beta v1.5 Rules Update", "update_content": " You can download the free COUNTERBLAST DLX Beta v1.5 rules PDF here."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "COUNTERBLAST Heavy Support", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Vote for COUNTERBLAST for a chance to WIN!", "update_content": "Thanks for a great 2014 and making COUNTERBLAST a reality!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Fulfillment Update 7", "update_content": "Good news for our Backers in the UK an EU!

I'm Jim Rodda, better known to the assorted scallywags, rapscallions, and ne'er-do-wells of the hobbyist 3D printing community as Zheng3.\nMy minor maker claim to fame is Seej, the Open Source tabletop war game based around 3D printing, but with this Kickstarter I'm trying something a little different.\nI'm making Barbie-compatible 3D printed medieval armor.\nIt's important to note that I'm not now and never have been associated with Mattel, undisputed masters of Barbie and all her associated trademarks. I'm just some dude cranking out 3d models in his basement.\nBarbie has had many occupations over her long and storied career. Astronaut, veterinarian, pinup, and princess more times than I can count. She has not, to my knowledge, cosplayed as Brienne of Tarth until now.\nThe field plate armor depicted in the photos and video above is a nice-enough prototype, good enough for patrolling the battlements at Stonemist Castle. But wearing it to a meeting of the Kingsguard? To the Council of Elrond? To prom? Honestly.\nA fully funded Kickstarter will enable me to design and produce the next iteration of the prototype armor, a favolosa e bellissima ensemble that befits a lady of Barbie's high station.\nPermit me to be crystal clear about two things:\n1. My goal is primarily to distribute digital files for this armor; I'm happy to print rewards for backers but would prefer not to run a factory in the long term.\n2. GIF is pronounced with a hard G, no matter what Steve Wilhite says.\nThe funding will cover the biodegradable plastic used to print the armor, replacement printer parts, and, most importantly, the time needed to design a highly detailed suit of armor, with all the engraving, ensorcelling, and enamelling Barbie's parade panoply deserves.\n\nAnd test prints. Zounds, will there be test prints.\nThe armor will be distributed under a Creative Commons License. In a nutshell, you'll be able to modify, redistribute, and even sell the digital files and their derivatives as long as you credit the original designer. That's me.\n\nAlso note that I'm not selling Barbie dolls; if you want to use this armor you'll have to buy a Barbie Fashionistas Doll first.\nIf you've already got a 3D printer and know a doll that needs arming, head on over to The Forge and download a copy of the Athena Makeover Kit:\nThe spear and aegis should fit most dolls, although the winged boots are designed specifically for Barbie's feet.\n\nWhile you're poking around The Forge, feel free to download a 3D squirrel or two. Be careful, some of them are armed.\nDesign and Protoyping\nThe inspiration for this armor came, indirectly, from my four-year-old niece. I wanted to print something unique for her next birthday, and so decided to design and engineer a pair of My Little Pony-compatible glitter cannons. (Note to self: next Kickstarter should involve My Little Pony-compatible glitter cannons.)\n\nBut! Moving parts and springs can be tough to do at this level of 3D printing, and after a few test prints I became frustrated and fell back on my usual method for generating new ideas: drinking three lattes and taking a hot shower.\n\nMidway through my fourth latte, the idea to create 3D printed armor for Barbie sprang from my head, fully formed. Highly caffeinated and towel-clad I dashed over to the laptop and ordered a Fashionistas doll.\nThe design process is straightforward: photograph the doll from multiple angles and then use the photos as reference images in Maya, my 3D modelling package of choice.\nThe next step is printing a low-resolution test piece to see if it's a good fit on the doll. I'm doing all my prints on a Makerbot Replicator1, which has proven itself to be a reliable, if no longer bleeding-edge 3D printer.\n(How about we all just let that last sentence sink in for a minute and realize we live in The Future?)\nFinally, after many iterations and tweaks, print the piece at high resolution and call it good. Lather, rinse, repeat.\nBarbie takes her fashion seriously, so it's important to get the fit just right. Here's our favorite model amid a pile of not-quite-snug-enough or just-a-bit-too-loose prototypes. Note the boot model in the lower left.\nFunding Goal Reached, Stretch Goal Announced!\nUPDATE! 3/28/14 \nA huge thank you to all of Faire Play's backers! We've reached our initial funding goal with two weeks to go. I've been inspired by your generosity, and so I've created the Faire Play Recurve Bow as a digital token of gratitude for you all.\nYou can download the STL files for the bow from The Forge.\n\nStretch goal! If we can raise another $1000, I'll glamourize the bow and make it available on Shapeways so that anyone can make Babs deadly at a distance with a couple of clicks.\nThe Aegis Pendant\nUPDATE! 3/20/2014\nBowing to popular demand I've introduced a new backer reward, the Aegis Pendant. It'll be 3D printed in your choice of metals: Antique Bronze Steel, Polished Gray Steel, or Polished Gold Steel. Thanks Shapeways!\n\nDidja know you can 3D print in metal? Wowzers.\nBackers at the $65 level will also receive the digital files for both suits of armor *and* the digital files for the Athena makeover kit. \n\nUPDATE: A metal proof of the pendant has arrived from Shapeways! Here's what it looks like in polished grey steel.\nProduction and Fulfillment Plan\nStep 1: Model the parade armor and print prototypes.  April/May 2014\nI expect this process to take approximately two months. I'll embellish the 3D model I've already created, adding every rivet, flourish, and bevel required to create a truly elegant suit of parade armor. I'll be test-printing prototypes and publicly documenting the process at Zheng3.com.\nThose backers awake at around 5AM CST will be able to watch me work in quasi-realtime by gazing into the Scrying Pool at Zheng3.com.\nStep 2: Print Athena Makeover Kit awards. April through August 2014\nMy 3D printer will dutifully churn out Makeover kits while I'm busy detailing the parade armor. At a rate of two kits a day I should have plenty printed by the time I need to deliver them to my backers. Then it's just a matter of boxing them up and shipping them out.\nStep 3: Print parade armor for backers. June/July 2014\nMy experiments have shown that I can print roughly one suit of field plate in a day, though I expect the detail on the parade suits to require a little more time. I've intentionally limited the number of reward suits I'm shipping to a total of thirty, so we're looking at somewhere around a month and a half to get them all printed.\nStep 4: Design custom shields for top-tier backers. July 2014\nI'll be doing this step concurrent with Steps 2 and 3; while the printer is burbling away I'll be locked in my office with Illustrator, Photoshop, Maya, Science Friday podcasts, and three pounds of chocolate-covered espresso beans.\n\nStep 5: Deliver the goods, digital and physical. July and August 2014\n\nDigital rewards will be shipped first: a .ZIP file of the armor should still be small enough to fit in an email attachment.\n\nI'm anticipating a few days of parcel stuffing and label-affixing before the physical rewards can ship. I'll be investigating shipping options throughout the production period.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm quite confident in the printability of the field plate armor; I've printed every piece at least a dozen times already. \n\nThe parade armor has filigrees, engravings, gewgaws, gubbinses, and assorted skeuomorphisms that will need to be designed so they can be printed with a minimum of fuss, but shouldn't affect the stability of the print.\n\nHouse of Cards isn't releasing Season 3 until well after the Kickstarter is scheduled to finish, so that's eliminated as a potential source of delay.\n\nBy Grabthar's hammer, I can do this.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "Oye!

I've played in many tabletop games, and there is a stark difference in the player engagement when the GM has complex challenges for them to overcome.\nThis is not a computer program that is going to generate a dungeon, but rather a set of \"modules\" (effectively puzzle pieces) that a GM can mix and match to create an awesome adventure. They will not be system, level, or setting specific so that any GM can use them.\nThese modules will be put together by me, and by other tabletop veterans in order to aim for high quality.  All module suggestions will go through me (rather than letting users edit directly) in order to make sure everything stays in a specific order.  Those who help supply modules will be noted on that module's page if they desire.\nAt launch, Dungeon Share will provide the following modules (the terms I choose to use do not reflect a single type of tabletop RPG, although they arguably align most with D&D):\nChallenges:  These modules are plot developments that characters must overcome.  They are the most overarching of the modules provided, and will often include smaller modules within them.  Challenges are an important resource for new GMs because they help prevent a GM from railroading his or her players.  The challenges on Dungeon Share will include a bunch of examples of possible routes for the players to take so that the GM can prepare for these possibilities beforehand (and maybe even give the players hints towards interesting routes).\nPuzzles:  These modules are much smaller pieces of a game, and have the purpose of making the players think critically.  Unlike Challenges that focus on creative thinking, Puzzles force players to solve the situation in a very particular way.  New GMs will obviously find a great selection, but even veteran GMs will love finding puzzles that their equally veteran players have not seen yet (in fact, this very struggle is what led me to want to kick-start the site).  Puzzles work great is a classic dungeon crawl as a basic obstacle.\nEncounters:  These modules revolve around how to make combat more interesting.  Some of my most tragic games have dragged on because every round of combat consisted of \"I swing my sword at enemy A again\".  Players need to have awe-inspiring battles if you want them to be truly engaged in a campaign.  These modules will provide good settings for battles, recommended enemy types for the setting, and subtle clues to give your players to promote creative fighting.\nCreatures:  Closely related to encounters, these modules make sure that your players don't spend hours fighting legions of goblins that do nothing but swing basic weapons every round.  To engage players, you want enemies with powerful tactics that force them to be equally strategic.  These modules will provide interesting creatures, fun and engaging combinations, and ways to combine seemingly different creatures into the same plot.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI love everything about Kickstarter and truly think it should be the future of investing.  It builds more than capital, it builds a community of people who are willing to go the extra distance for their hobby. I personally believe that if this site is going to succeed, it needs the support of the tabletop playing community. In short, Dungeon Share requires a community to continue growing, and crowd-funding is the perfect way to find it. \nStretch Goals:\nUsually stretch goals are based on how much money a person is able to get to their kick-starter.  However, in the case of Dungeon Share, I don't care that much about how much money I raise.  Instead, we are going to have stretch goals based on how much interest there is in the site (based on the number of \"Likes\" on www.facebook.com/dungeonshare).  I would rather you donate $5 and try your best to get a few friends interested than to just donate $50 and not tell anyone about it.\nWith that being said, any money over the $160 will be put to improving the site, finding more modules to generalize, buying ads to expand the user-base, or maybe even commissioning pictures for some of the modules to help players visualize certain situations (also a great way to give work to young artists).\n100 Likes => NPC Section Added\nIf I have 100 people interested in Dungeon Share , I will add a section about (non-enemy) NPCs.  This will help GMs make dynamic and interesting characters for players to interact with.\n150 Likes => Traps Section Added\nOnce we reach 150 likes, I'll add on a trap section to keep every adventurer on their toes and give new GMs a long list of fun ideas.\n250 Likes => Items Section Added\nWith 250 people interested, I'll create an additional section where creative item ideas can be compiled.  This will allow GMs to make items that do more than just buff stats of their players, but actually add to the fun and interactivity of the game.\nMore goals to come.\nThank you for considering my project, and I hope to see your support!  If you want to get started early and submit module ideas, email us at dungeonsharesubmit@gmail.com and your name will be featured on whatever module you help create.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy nightmare situation would be either me getting terribly injured and leaving everyone waiting. I also do not have extensive knowledge in website creation, so someone hacking the page could be a potential risk. Fortunately, there will be no financially valuable information stored on the website at any time, so this is a minimal risk.\n\nOutside of those unlikely disasters, the biggest risk is not having enough support to keep Dungeon Share growing. If it doesn't grow, less people will use the website, which will result in less ad income, which could potentially stop the site from running. This is where I come in; I've run a healthy number of tabletop campaigns (some physically with friends, some online with complete strangers), and I will put every ounce of my creative juice into this site to get it up and running.

There is another Kickstarter that I think any GM should look into.  Describing combat in continually interesting ways is something even the most veteran GM can struggle with.

The site gets about 25 hits a day, so the good news is that people are actually using it.\n\nI've come to doubt the legitimacy of using Kickstarter funds to hold any sort of raffle, so I've decided to make use of some of my own gift cards I've yet to use to get the flow of ideas started.

Once this supply is depleted, only rolling critical misses will restore them.  So, how do you protect your supplies of 20s from being stolen by so called 'friends'?  The Cryptex Dice Vault is your solution.  With this attractive cylinder, your dice will be safe and secure!\nA cryptex is a form of combination lock and safe all in one.  Only when all of the reels are aligned to the correct positions can the the two cylinders be separated, giving access to the contents hidden within.\nCryptex Dice Vault Prototype\nThis Cryptex is perfectly sized to hold a standard 7 set of polyhedral for D&D or other similar game systems.  Made of real hardwood, inlayed with contrasting colors and stamped with numbers.  Featuring 5 reels of numbers, the CDV has 100,000 possible combinations.\nDark World - Holds Ten D10\nFor those of you who enjoy games from the World of Darkness or other D10 based systems, we have the Dark World CDV, a longer version that can handle a full set of ten D10s.\nPride - Same size as the Dark World\nThe Pride features 7 reels just like the Dark World, but instead of numbers, it features the seven colors of the rainbow.  Due to the need to be painted, the Pride is not available in hardwood.\nThe Pride will keep your secrets...at least some of them.\nDa Vinci\nAnd finally there's the largest of the vaults, the Da Vinci.  Unlike the others, which feature just the numbers 0-9, the Da Vinci features larger reels with the full A-Z alphabet.  The Da Vinci has a similar length as the basic CDV, but a larger internal cross section.\nMatching Case\nEach of the vaults is available alone, or with a custom fitted box of matching wood.\nCDV in case\n\nEach of the dice vaults is available in your choice of three different woods, elm, walnut, and purpleheart.\nElm\nWalnut\nPurpleheart\nPadauk\nSummary of Pledge Levels\nCryptex Dice Vault\n$50   - Elm CDV\n$70   - Elm CDV with box\n$60   - Walnut CDV\n$80   - Walnut CDV with box\n$70   - Purpleheart CDV\n$100 - Purpleheart CDV with box\n$70   - Padauk CDV\n$100 - Padauk CDV with Box\nDark World Dice Vault\n$60   - Elm\n$80   - Elm with box\n$70   - Walnut\n$90   - Walnut with box\n$80   - Purpleheart\n$110 - Purpleheart with box\n$80   - Padauk\n$110 - Padauk with Box\nDa Vinci Dice Vault\n$90 - Elm\n$110 - Elm with box\n$100 - Walnut\n$125 - Walnut with box\n$125 - Purpleheart\n$150 - Purpleheart with box\n$125 - Padauk\n$150 - Padauk with box\nPride Dice Vault\n$40 - Pride CDV\n$55 - Pride CDV with white box\n$60 - Pride CDV with elm box\nSo, why Kickstarter?

The increased prices are due to the high cost of international shipping costs.  Please note that the buyer is responsible for any customs fees that may occur, so please take this into account before pledging.\n\nShipping to the USA\nIf you are located in the USA and want to pledge, do not select any option marked \"INTERNATIONAL\".  These reward levels have international shipping costs built in, and cannot be refunded.  If you make a mistake, you can change your pledge level before the Kickstart ends.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan the combination be changed?\nThe combination cannot be changed after manufacturing. I plan to create a survey upon completion of the Kickstarter that will allow pledgers to specify the combination of their choice, but that combination can't be changed after that point.\nWill you ship internationally?\nYes, due to popular demand, I have added an international option.  The higher cost of international shipping is included in the pledge level.  However, any customs fees are the responsibility of the receiver.\nWhat if I want more than one?\nIncrease your pledge by the appropriate amount and indicate what the additional portion is for.

These miniatures are created working closely with George himself from how he envisioned the characters from the books in his mind - they are not from the HBO series.

It is a wonderful hobby indeed..\nDark Sword has already run and fully delivered on a Kickstarter we ran back in July/August 2013. We aim to once again exceed expectations on delivery of this project both on the quality of our miniatures and speed of delivery for our backer rewards. Like our last Kickstarter project, we have a very simple campaign backer structure you can see over to your right. Early Bird and Westeros Backers will be rewarded for their support with special Kickstarter pricing that includes shipping in the USA and extra perks like a signed and numbered certificate of authenticity from George R.R. Martin, Tom Meier and Jim Ludwig. Other perks will include stretch goals that can be unlocked along the way for more free bonus miniatures added into the core set and access to other cool add-ons after the initial funding goal is exceeded. Our first free bonus miniature stretch goal is already unveiled - the man himself at his Westeros writing desk. Please note - International shipping is very expensive so our friends outside of the USA will have a nominal shipping charge applied to their pledge \u2013 this simply helps defray our shipping costs overseas \u2013 Dark Sword is not profiting off of shipping costs.\nAs you can see from the introduction video and pictures of the miniatures above, we already have the core set fully sculpted and have been running test castings of these miniatures to ensure everything is ready to crank into high gear on the production front once we get underway. Everything is cast in lead-free pewter. We aim to have backer rewards delivered very quickly after this campaign is finished so people can enjoy these amazing miniatures.\nBelow is a small sampling of our existing George R.R. Martin Masterworks Pewter Miniature range from the Song of Ice and Fire Book Series that inspired the hit HBO show Game of Thrones.

You have the extremes from Tyrion up to Ser Gregor \"The Mountain That Rides\" and a good number of very tall strong men in between like Jaime Lannister, The Black Fish and the Old Bear. Tom Meier and Jeff Grace go into exacting detail to get this across on very small miniatures. Even differences between Dany and Sansa compared to the much taller Cersei or Melisandre are evident in these minis.\nThank you very much for checking out our Kickstarter Project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we face is getting the backer rewards shipped in a timely and affordable fashion. I want to exceed expectations on this front once again like we did on our first Kickstarter with the Elmore Dragon Special Edition Diorama Set. So to once again help support this goal, we have already completed sculpting and initial molding on the core set of miniatures. We have also performed test castings to ensure everything is dialed in from a pewter quality perspective. We have already had our pewter miniature caster set aside casting time and packing time so we can quickly get a head start on production as this campaign is underway. Just like with our first Kickstarter, we will keep our backers in the loop with frequent updates throughout the run of this new Kickstarter project. All of our production and packing/shipping will take place in/from the Midwest USA.\n\nMany Kickstarter campaigns also run into shipping issues \u2013 especially international shipping issues. We are in our 12th year of business and have shipped orders out all over the world in the past 12 years. We also completed and fully delivered on our first Kickstarter in August 2013. International shipping is expensive and this large release will be no exception. Dark Sword Miniatures has built a reputation of top notch quality and dependability over the years in regards to both our miniatures and our shipping turn times. And we aim to build upon that reputation once again with this new Kickstarter. \n\nAnother challenge many Kickstarters face is sorting the surveys after the project completes. Just like our last Kickstarter, we have purposely built our project with simplified backer levels in order to simplify surveys so they are easy to complete and return quickly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "18 New GRRM Masterworks Releases on Dark Sword Site!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nI wanted to let you all know that I just posted up 18 brand new GRRM Masterworks releases on the Dark Sword site inside of our 15th Anniversary Special Bundle of 23 brand new minis.\n\nLots of awesome new characters to check out along with new versions of Jon Snow and Cersei Lannister.

Please read this before finalizing your pledge.\n\nBUY 4 GET 1 FREE PROGRAM\nMany of you are asking about the Buy 4 get 1 free offer. In a nutshell, it works as follows:\nChoose your 5 cases: They can be of any wood, of any style, of any size.\nDetermine which is your free case: Your free case must be of a domestic wood (oak, poplar, cedar, maple, cherry, black walnut, or curly maple). The free case can be the 2nd most expensive case you are getting (if you are getting 3 bloodwood, a maple and an oak, the Maple case is free since it is a domestic wood that is not the most expensive.)\nUse the pledge calculator to determine your pledge: Click on the link below and put in your four cases that you will be paying for. At the end of the project I'll send you a survey where you can give me details on all your cases\nDo you have to pay for epoxy or engraving upgrades on the free case? If you are getting epoxy finishes or engraving on the boxes you pay for, you do not need to pay for this upgrade on your free case. If you want your free case to have upgrades that your other cases do not have, then yes, you will have to pay for those upgrades.\nPledge the correct amount in an appropriate tier: you can either pledge in the buy 4 get one free tier, or in a tier of an appropriate hardwood. It won't matter in the end. I'll be in contact with your at the end of the project to get details.\nTell your friends: quickly. This project ends in just a few hours. At the end of the project, when I start selling these on a retail basis, most prices will probably go up. Now is the time to get these at a great price.\n\nContact links\nGo to my Facebook Page\n**Please scroll to the bottom to see UNLOCK information! The project will start with one bonus already unlocked!**\n**Please click here to go to the Pledge Calculator**\nDirections:\n1. download the google doc as an excel spreadsheet\n2. fill out the form\n3. pledge the amount listed on the TOTAL column at the pledge level of the highest tier for which you qualify.\nI am now part of the Kicking it Forward program. 5% of my profits will be pledged to other kickstarter projects. For more info, please see this website: http://kickingitforward.org\nYOU ASKED FOR IT, NOW YOU GET IT!\nIn the above pictures, you can see the comparative size of the PRIEST line of cases. It measures 8\" x 12\" and can hold up to 3x the number of figures as the ROGUE case can. at 8\" x 12\", it is still smaller than most laptop computers, so it is transportable without being too bulky.\nThe padding pictured is the standard sea-foam green offered at the local craft store. This is the only color that was available to me to make this prototype. When the product ships, it will come with charcoal grey padding. This is the only color I can buy at wholesale pricing. (Believe me, I've looked for other colors. I originally wanted to offer red/blue/green/etc.)\nDue to the construction method (milling from a single piece of wood), this case can only be made from wood that I can get in boards at least 9\" wide. This will mean that at least in this offering, I will have to limit the boxes to the woods that I know I can get in that thickness. If you must have the box in \"xyz\" wood, drop me a line and I'll confirm whether I can get that type of wood. There would probably be a minimum order of 3 boxes in that case so that I know I'm going to be able to cover the cost of the boards.\nWhich brings us to the issue of pricing. The PRIEST has more than twice the surface area as the ROGUE and will take considerably longer to mill, do artwork on, and will take twice the amount of poly/epoxy to finish. The PRIEST cases will hold 3x the number of minis that the ROGUE line does. Yet, despite all that, I am offering the PRIEST at a price which will give you more bang for the buck. The pricing for the standard (no artwork, polyurethane finish) unit is:\nPRIEST ACOLYTE:     Red Oak 8x12 case  $40\nPRIEST ADEPT:     Poplar 8x12 case   $40\nPRIEST CURATE:    Maple 8x12 case    $45\nPRIEST PERFECT:   Cherry 8x12 case   $50\nPRIEST CANON:     Curly Maple 8x12 case: $55 \nPRIEST PATRIARCH: Purpleheart 8x12 case: $60\nPRIEST CARDINAL: Brazilian Cherry 8x12 case: $60\nPRIEST BISHOP: Bloodwood 8x12 case: $85\nPRIEST ZEBRAWOOD: Zebrawood 8x12 case: $90\nArtwork and finish upgrades are available with these, just as with the rogue cases. Rather than do a \"plus\" and \"Deluxe\" level as I did with the ROGUE cases, I decided just to keep the above tiers. Artwork and Epoxy will be handled as an add-on.\nIf you want artwork (Celtic Shield, Sword and Shield, Doomed Princess line art, or Doomed Princess engraving), it will cost an additional $10. If you want an epoxy finish upgrade (this includes inlay if applicable), add an additional $20 to your pledge.\nExample: if you want a PRIEST ADEPT (Poplar) with Celtic Shield with Garnet Red inlay and epoxy finish, you would pledge $70 for one case ($40 for the case + $10 for the artwork + $20 for the epoxy)\nFinally, since I know someone will ask the question: Does the \"buy 4 get 1 free\" deal apply to the PRIEST line of cases? \nThe answer is \"yes\", under the same restrictions as before. Your free case will need to be equal to or less in value than the most expensive case that you paid for and be made from a DOMESTIC wood. If your most expensive case is $40, then your free case cannot exceed a value of $40. And yes, you can mix and match ROGUE  and PRIEST cases to get your free case. Please figure up your total pledge and pledge that amount in the \"buy four get one free\" reward tier.\nthanks to everyone for helping me make this project a success!\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIntroducing the Rogue line of miniature cases\nThe Rogue line of cases are small transport cases for about 10 human-sized 28mm miniatures. They are made from hardwoods selected for their beauty and grain pattern and measure 5\" x 8\". Both the top and the bottom of the boxes have 1/2\" foam padding providing a tight fit for your miniatures.\nI've always enjoyed playing games. I started playing D&D back in the late 70s, played through high school and college, and now play games with my kids. I recently backed one of the Reaper projects and ended up pledging enough for somewhere around 200 miniatures. While I wait (impatiently) for these miniatures, I started thinking about how I would store them. My old D&D figures (of which I still have some) have sat in their old boxes, getting batted around, slowly losing paint and wearing down over the years because of the cut-outs in the foam that allow the figures to bounce around every time I pick up the box. Using my woodworking skills, I decided to build a box that would keep the miniatures secure and be a work of art that in itselfwould enhance the gaming experience.\nWhat makes the Rogue special?\nFirst and foremost, Rogue cases are made from very high quality pieces of wood. I do not use plywood or mdf, laser-cut pieces out for the customer to assemble, and call it a quality box. The top half of the box and the bottom half of the box are milled from a single piece of hardwood. What does this mean to you? It means there are no joints that can break over time. There are no weak points that may loosen with use. It is a solid piece of wood that captures all the beauty of natural hardwood.\nSecond, I use quality hinges and clasps for the boxes. I want these boxes to look good and last for a long time. I want, when you open the box at your next gaming session, for your friends to see that you take the game seriously enough to protect your miniatures.\nLastly, I give you the option of original art being laser engraved on your box. In this Kickstarter project, I am going to offer the Rogue boxes in your choice of 4 patterns: Normal, Celtic Shield, Sword and Shield, and Doomed Princess. These patterns and drawings are the creation of my daughter, a fellow gamer and aspiring artist.\nWhat woods can I choose from?\nI am initially offering these boxes in various Appalachian hardwoods. You can choose from poplar, red oak, cherry, hard maple, aromatic cedar (yes, not a hardwood), black walnut, and curly maple. \nOnce the initial goal has been reached, I will start unlocking other types of wood. Exotic woods are highly popular right now and I do have a source for many of these woods. As each new goal is reached, a new wood will be unlocked.\n What Add-ons are available?\nAs I wrote earlier, there are four different versions of each wood case. The first is the plain wood that is pictured above. This is simply the case with a high gloss finish. It will show the natural beauty of the wood, and you get this with your minimum pledge.\nBut if you wish to add a decoration to your case, you can do so by pledging in the appropriate \"plus\" category. You can choose which decoration you want: \"Celtic Shield\" or \"Sword and Shield.\" These decorations will be laser engraved onto the top of the case and then sealed with a high gloss finish. Below are examples of each type of engraving. Please note that the engraving shows up better in some woods than in others.\n  *NOTE: wood used for the Apprentice boxes will not be made from boards that have knots in them like the one pictured above. This was one of my first prototypes and I was using scrap wood. The boxes will be made from wood that is clear or has minimal knots.\nIf you want your case to really shine you can get your box engraved and a colorful inlay added. I use a tinted 2 part epoxy as inlay material for the decorations that will harden and permanently adhere to the design. The top is then treated with a thick clear coat similar to what is used on bar tops. This epoxy finish is the equivalent of about 50 coats of polyurethane finish. \nColors available for this are Metallic Black, Sapphire Blue, Garnet Red, Pearl White, and Metallic Copper.\nYou can select these options simply by choosing the appropriate Deluxe tier on the right.\n A few notes on the images above:\nI was trying different methods to add color to the designs. In a few of them, I had to sand too much to get rid of excess material. The result was that the walnut, red oak and cedar examples had virtually no surface difference between the design and the surrounding wood. This is why the colored material does not look consistent. The cherry and polar pieces were the last two I did and there was minimal waste and sanding, thus a better looking finish. Now that I have the technique down, I fully expect results for all woods to be consistent with the cherry and poplar examples. Regardless, I will not allow an item to be shipped that I personally would not be proud to display as my own. \nI am also posting two pictures here that attempt to show the mirror-like surface of an epoxy finish. While these are \"bad pictures,\" they show how polished the surface looks.\nAlso available in the Deluxe tier, I am offering an original piece of art laser engraved on your case. This laser art CANNOT be inlaid, but is sealed with the epoxy finish giving it a mirror-like surface. The artwork being offered is titled \"Doomed Princess.\" These are also part of the \"Deluxe\" tiers. At the end of the project, I will send a form to everyone where you can specify if you want \"Doomed Princess\" or if you want one of the other designs. Remember, there is no color inlay available with this. In my opinion, the best wood that shows the illustration is Maple, although poplar, oak, and cherry are good as well. I would not recommend doing this drawing with black walnut or other dark woods.\nDoomed Princess with Glare\n*NOTE: Sometimes it is difficult to show in a picture the mirror-like surface of an epoxy coating. The above picture was taken with a light source purposely shining on it to give you an idea of how reflective this surface can be.\nFinally, due to requests from users who have previewed this project, I am going to offer an opportunity to laser inscribe YOUR original artwork onto a box. You must provide me with a high resolution scan of original art (not copyrighted) that I will laser engrave on any Rogue case.\nI have to stress that this MUST be either original artwork, or work that you personally hold the copyright to. My primary job is in publishing and know first hand the pitfalls of copyright violation. Before I begin work on the project you will be required to sign a permissions release form that will, in essence, cover my bases if there is a copyright violation.\nI've been trying to think of a fair way of handling this. I originally had set up a tier where the original artwork box would cost $100 and thereafter it would be less expensive to have this done. After talking with a friend today, I decided to change this a little. Instead of having the high price on the initial case, I am going to treat original artwork as an add-on feature.\nIf you want to have your own art (be it a drawing or line art) featured on your case, you would pledge at the level at which you would normally, but then you would need to pledge an additional $25 as an add-on price. This cost will cover the added time and (likely) test run of the piece of art. This $25 setup fee is a one time add-on. So, if you wanted 3 cases at the Magsman Deluxe level with your custom artwork, the final price would be $175 ($50 each for the Magsman Deluxe plus a $25 setup fee)\nMultiple case purchase\nIf you are interested in multiple cases, select the level to the right for the proper case, and then add in the extra add-ons for additional cases. For example, if you are interested in 2 walnut cases with Metallic Copper Celtic shields and one red oak with the Celtic shield engraved (no epoxy), you would pledge at the Sharper Deluxe level for $115 (2 Sharper Deluxe for $45 each plus 1 Apprentice Plus for $25).\nAlso note that I'm starting the project with one free unlock! Pledge enough for 4 cases, and get the 5th for free! So go ahead and get those two extra cases with your pledge!\nIMPORTANT: if you want to pledge for 4 cases and get the 5th on for free, please pledge at the $1 BUY FOUR GET 1 FREE level. This will make the post-project system easier to implement. If you pledge for 5 items at a different level, the check-out cart will not know how to figure your free box.\nNOTE: If you pledge enough for the \"buy 4 get 1 free\", the free case cannot be an exotic wood. The materials cost is just too high for the free case to be an exotic.\nWhat are the funds being raised for?\nFunds will be used for purchasing wood and hardware in quantity enough for wholesale pricing, paying for the laser work to be done (or the purchasing of a laser engraver if the project does well enough), and upgrading a room of my workshop into a dedicated finishing room. The finish of the boxes is perhaps the most important, yet frequently the most overlooked, part of a wood project. I use a high gloss lacquer or polyurethane for finishing most of my wood projects and without a clean room for finishing, dust particles can mar an otherwise beautiful project. I want the Rogue to have a finish that captures all the beauty of the wood; and to do that I need a room separate from the one where I make the box.\n Unlock information:\n1. Multiple Box Unlock: If you pledge enough for 5 boxes, you get a discount equal to the average pledge per case. For example, if you pledge so you would receive 2 Cutpurse cases (Maple), 1 cutpurse plus (maple with design), and 2 Magsman Deluxe (Curly Maple with epoxy), the normal pledge amount would be $180, but this would be discounted $36 for a total pledge amount of $144. Pledge calculator is here\nPLEASE NOTE: THE FREE CASE CANNOT BE AN EXOTIC WOOD! THE MATERIALS COST IS JUST TOO HIGH FOR ME TO DO THIS. Thank you for understanding.\n2. *UNLOCKED*: Purpleheart unlock at $1,500: When $1,500 in pledges is reached, purpleheart wood will be unlocked. This is a wood found in Central or South American rainforests with a rich purple heartwood. It is naturally extremely dense and water resistant.\n 3. UNLOCKED!! Brazillian Cherry: At $2,500, Brazillian cherry will be unlocked. Brazilian cherry is a common Caribbean and South American. It is frequently used in flooring, and it is also a popular wood for furniture. It is dark brown/red in color.\n4.  UNLOCK: My facebook page has a meager number of likes. Help me get to 50 friends and you can choose between Felt backing (so you can use your box as a dice tray) or the foam padding so you can use it for miniatures.\n5. UNLOCKED!!!! Doomed Princess line art UNLOCK: Get \"Doomed Princess\" as line art so it can be colorized with epoxy. This can be chosen for any \"plus\" or \"Deluxe\" level pledge.\n 6. UNLOCK!! At $3,000 Paduak wood is unlocked. Padauk is an African hardwood with a brown-red color. It is very hard and very stable (resistant to warp due to moisture changes).\n 7 UNLOCKED!!!: At $4,000 Bloodwood is unlocked. Bloodwood is a South American hardwood that has a bloody-red color. It is extremely dense and durable.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMost of the risks in a project like this is what happens if the project is TOO successful. I can make a fair number of boxes at a time, and my equipment is reliable enough, that I don't have a lot of worry about being able to manufacture any reasonable amount of orders. But everyone on Kickstarter has seen the projects that just go viral and suddenly a small business has more orders than it normally sees in a year.\n\nI hope that this is a problem I have, yet I don't want the success of the Rogue to mean the delay in shipping of everyone's orders. By watching other projects, I plan to institute a limit to each tier of support so I can ship in waves. This limit will not mean that I will stop producing that particular type of wood, but rather that the shipments will be designated to occur later than the original shipment date. So, a Wave 1 shipment date will be in May. If I need a Wave 2 shipment, it will be scheduled for one month later, giving me sufficient time to process and construct the cases. Further waves will be scheduled according to my projections on when I believe I can complete the orders.\n\nDepending upon the success of the project, I may also use an online form creation program which will allows me to contact each sponsor in order for them to fill out a form telling me precisely what type of wood, what designs, what color accent or type of finish they desire. In this way, I can ensure that each supporter receives the box they want with the appropriate finish.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #90", "update_userinfo": "These will be perfect for your 5E game.

To be kept up to date on songs, the album, and our live shows around the country, subscribe to our e-mail list! \nThank you for unlocking all these stretch goals!\nFuture stretch goals:\nThere are more details about all of these goals below!\nHi, we\u2019re the Doubleclicks, and we write songs about things like dinosaurs, Dungeons & Dragons, love, books, and cats. We also have a cello, and we\u2019re sisters. You may know us from performing at conventions around the country, from many songs and collaborations (including the theme song for Cards Against Humanity), or from our big geek girl pride music video that came out last year, \"Nothing to Prove,\" full of amazing geek girls and some of our nerdy friends.\nWe want to make a new album this year called \u201cDimetrodon\u201d, featuring songs we've written over the past year, with studio-quality production and full-band arrangements. We also want to bring back our \u201cWeekly Song Wednesday\u201d music video project this summer. And to do these things, we need help!\nWe've got some rewards, many of which are exclusive to backers of this Kickstarter! We have t-shirts, dice, copies of the new CD, tote bags, custom songs (and mini meowing-themed-ringtone-songs), and even the opportunity to be immortalized in an art poster that is included with every CD! But even if you can only donate a little, you'll be contributing to our ability to make more and greater things, and we appreciate it!! \nThe more money we get, the more exciting things we can produce this year.  We have plenty of ideas on how to turn money in to FUN(ny). Funny? Yes. So take a look at the project, and please share it with your friends\u2014we can't do it without you! We are extremely thankful that you let us make music for you, and we want to do it forever. FOREVER. \n The Dimetrodon Album\nDimetrodon will be our 3rd full-length album and the second with a \"full band studio sound.\" We want to do this one bigger and better than any album we've done before. We'll be working with pros on the arrangement, mixing and production, including musician, comedian, producer and awesome human being Mike Phirman.\nMost of the songs on the Dimetrodon album will be our favorite compositions from 2013's Weekly Song Wednesday project, cleaned up, re-organized and arranged for a full-band sound. There will also be a couple brand-new songs on the album as well as some revivals from the Doubleclicks archives. \n\nWeekly Song Wednesday (unlocked!)\nThis is how WSW (Weekly Song Wednesday) works: we write a song, we film a video for that song, and we release these videos once a week on Wednesdays for some number of weeks. WSW is a songwriting exercise, a YouTube project, and a really, really fun way for us to make music and share it. Unfortunately, by itself WSW really doesn't break even, and without crowdfunding we just can't put the time and resources into the project to make songs and videos of the quality that we imagine in our brains. This year, we did Weekly Song Wednesday for 14 weeks, from September through December, and it was really fun. Dimetrodon was one of our favorite songs and videos from that project, check it out:\n \nIf we meet our initial Kickstarter goal, then, in addition to producing the album Dimetrodon, we will launch a new Weekly Song Wednesday project this spring/summer with new songs and videos that we can spend much, much more time on than we could last year. These videos could include good cameras, other people to hold the cameras (crazy, right?), props, costumes, and much more time spent on rehearsal, editing and doing lots of takes. Thanks to your generous backing, Weekly Song Wednesday will now be 10 weeks long instead of our original 5-week goal!\n-\n Monthly Song Monday (unlocked!)\nWe can't do Weekly Song Wednesday all year long: we need to tour, and sleep sometimes, and take breaks to recharge our songwriting muscles. However, we do want to keep releasing things, so at the $35,000 stretch goal, we will unlock a Monthly Song Monday project where we release a new song and video every month (on a monday). This will happen for 12 months, but we will pause this project during the months during which Weekly Song Wednesday is happening and re-start afterwards\u2014so this project will last for longer than a year.\n  Monthly Live-Streamed Internet Show (unlocked!)\nIn Portland, we produce a show called #NerdNightOut in which we fly in our favorite performers from around the country and do an awesome variety show. It happens every few months, but only locally. We'd love to put on a show with our friends and favorite performers everywhere in the world, but we can't. Or can we? If we unlock the $42,000 stretch goal, we will do a monthly live-streamed show (from March 2014 to December 2014). It will be part concert, part chat and part Q&A. We'll also invite our friends to be guests sometimes, so you can hear other people's songs and stories! It will be an Internet-wide Nerd Night \"In\"! (We're still working on that title). \n-\nMore awesome stretch goals UNLOCKED\nThe Doubleclicks coloring and activity book: UNLOCKED\nIf we reach this $55,000 stretch goal, we\u2019ll make a short Doubleclicks-themed coloring book with help from talented artists! It\u2019ll be a free PDF download for all backers who have selected a reward at level $12 and above, and will feature art by Molly Lewis (singer/songwriter/doodle genius), Ash Vickers (MegaCynics), John Kovalic (of Munchkin, Dork Tower & much more) and Lar DeSouza. There will also be activities included a Mad Lib by author John Scalzi! Here's a sample set of pages by the amazing Molly Lewis:\n\n\nAnimated music video: UNLOCKED!\nOur very first video was an animated one, created by the amazing Brad Jonas for our Dungeons & Dragons song. Since then we have wanted to create more, but we just haven't had the resources... until now? At $65,000 one of our videos for Monthly Song Monday videos will be ANIMATED, and it will likely be ADORABLE. Our animator is OnlyLeigh, animator, artist and creator of the excellent webseries FanGirls. Her showreel gives a good idea of how fantastic the video will be: \n\n\nKid's EP: UNLOCKED!\nAt $75,000, we will write and record a 5-song kids EP (for grown-ups, too) including songs about: science, history, and strong female characters, to be released in 2015. \n\nThere are many many people in the world more qualified to talk about gender issues than we are, but here\u2019s what I know: when I was a kid, in school and church and books, most to all of the heroes I saw were men. Media taught us that boys went off and had adventures and became doctors and scientists, and girls should find themselves a cool man who was a doctor or a scientist, and attract him by wearing uncomfortable dresses and losing weight. We want to make songs that tell a different story. Our goal with the songs on the new EP will be to teach you about things and people you don\u2019t usually learn about. People like Grace Hopper: a computer scientist who basically invented the compiler and, according to legend, discovered the first computer bug (it was an actual bug.) Grace & other awesome people will be featured on this EP, if it's funded. \nStretch Goal Freeeeeebiiiird!: UNLOCKED!\nWe can think of no better way to show our appreciation than to succumb to popular demand at the risk of our own sanity: we will cover Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Freebird\" and make a video for you, and we will make it fun for ourselves and you. A download of our cover will be available in the 2014 song vault. \n\nCurrent Stretch Goal: $80,000 - UNLOCKED!\nThank you all for backing us like crazy!! Even now, your donations are going to help us level-up our music and videos all year. For a final bit of appreciation, we're gonna make you buttons! If we are mailing you anything: a CD, dice, or anything bigger, we will also send you a cool SHINY BUTTON with art by SOMEONE GREAT to show that you are an awesome Kickstarter backer.\nThe Dimetrodon CD physical package is very exciting for us: we are hiring amazing artist Kris Straub (who makes Broodhollow and Chainsawsuit), of whom we are huge fans, to make the album cover. Here's what his art style looks like:\n-\nThe cover art for the Dimetrodon album will be made by Kris Straub!\nThe physical CD will also include a pull-out mini-poster created by Lar DeSouza, artist of the webcomics Least I Could Do and Looking for Group. If you back at the \"Immortalization\" level, a caricature of you (based on one reference photo you provide) will appear in this poster with us!\n\nWe are creating three new Doubleclicks custom six-sided dice for this Kickstarter featuring images inspired by this album: a Dimetrodon, a cat, and an image of us, the Doubleclicks! These are designed by the amazing Brian Tatosky!\n\n\nThe 2014 Song Vault is a website where all the songs we write for weekly song wednesday and some other songwriting projects in 2014 will be available for download to backers who unlock it (at the Dimetrodon level and above). You may also find some demos, rarities, and other little ditties we think you'll find fun in this vault. \n\nT-Shirts and tote bags will feature a Doubleclicks design which is ONLY available through this Kickstarter! The art will be created by webcomic artist Abby Howard of Junior Scientist Power Hour and The Last Halloween! \nT-shirts will be available in adult sizes from S-3XL in a Gildan Unisex Ultra Cotton Tee (sizing) and S-2XL in a \"Ladies\" Bella Favorite Tee (sizing). Totes will be these jumbo eco-conscious numbers (take a look!). If you select the T-shirt and Tote level or add a T-shirt or tote onto another level for $35 additional, you will be able to choose any size of t-shirt, OR a tote instead, in a survey that we send out after this Kickstarter is over.\n\n  NEW: Dimetrodon Plush!\nIt's a little baby Dimetrodon plush!!!! This new, special, very exclusive, very cute plush was designed for this Kickstarter and will be individually made just for you by crafting genius Tally Heilke. The fleece Dimetrodon is approx. 17 inches long and soft and friendly. It may or may not eat sharks.\nDimetrodon and \u201cRawr, Velociraptor\u201d KNITTED HATS! A local here in Portland, Cathy of Frivolite Handcrafts, has created a knitting design for \u201ctoque\u201d-style hats with Dimetrodons and Velociraptors on them, and she will be making a set of them for this Kickstarter! You will be able to select size and style. \nDoubleclicks Dice Bags!\nThere are two different kinds of Doubleclicks dice bags! The first are made by Katrina Keller, made in your choice of Dimetrodon or Velociraptor, with or without \u201cThe Doubleclicks\u201d text. Yes, those are all adorable little pieces of fabric, painstakingly cut out and assembled.\nThe second kind of dice bags are gamer-tested, gamer-designed, gamer-approved flat-bottom bag from GeekyLyndsay of Dragon Chow Dice Bags. The one you order will have a Doubleclicks design, but the photos below show you what Dragon Chow bags look like.\n\nFor \"Kitty Ditty Ringtone\" and \"A Song For You\" awards: We are excited to write you a song, but we've got some rules. Subject matter can't be pornographic, illegal or offensive (to us.) We will have final subject-matter approval, but we will do our best to make sure you're happy with it, too. We retain rights to the songs and performances, but you can use them in whatever non-commercial context you'd like. If you have something very specific in mind, feel free to e-mail or tweet us before backing so we know for sure that we can give you what you're looking for.\n\nCircuit Bent Cat Keyboard: This reward is a custom-modified toy cat-shaped keyboard. It will be messed up just for you by our friend (musician, computer geek and electronics-tinkerer) using circuit bending. As a result, it will have a 1/4\" audio jack to be plugged in for recording and performance, and, when put into \"freak out\" mode, will make cool distortion-y noises to your command. You can read more in our Kickstarter Update about the keyboards. \n\nGame Night: If you back at this level, you'll get one spot at the gaming table with us for a 4-hour session of D&D! We'll do what works best for you: either a Google Hangout or an in-person game night in Portland. The game will be DM'd by our friend Justin Turner of gaming podcast GoingLast.net. \n\nHelpful Chart for \"who gets what\" in rewards:\nAdd-Ons\nDo you want some extra merch that's not included in a specific reward level? If you back at $25 or above, you can add on an item from the list below.

The War of Metal and Bone. Will you dine with the gods in Valhalla, or dance with the dishonored dead? Choose your fate.\nBACKERS - FIND THE KICKSTARTER PREVIEW OF THE RULES HERE\nIn the summer of 2013, I ran the Kickstarter for Iron Edda: Sveidsdottir, the inclusive story of Sigrid, the Valkyrie-blooded Bonebonded warrior. Sviedsdottir was my chance to write a story in the world of Iron Edda. Now it's time for you to tell your own stories.\nBuilt with Fate Core\u2122, War of Metal and Bone lets you tell the stories of brave warriors, Jarls, Bonebonded giants, and their defense of their holdfasts.\nIn addition to the awesomeness that is Fate Core\u2122, War of Metal and Bone adds some exciting features:\nBe whomever you want: Bonebonded or seer, thrall or Jarl, War of Metal and Bone is designed to let everyone play side-by-side using the same excellent Fate mechanics.\nCreate your own holdfast and add to the world. Every campaign begins with the creation of your own unique holdfast. Every session will see you adding to the map you've made. This is your world and you get to see how it changes.\nForm bonds with your party members, celebrate your warrior clan, and honor your history with your own sacred item.\nThe war with the dwarves and their constructs rages across Midgard. What role will you play?\nThe Book\nThe book for War of Metal and Bone will clock in at around 22,000 words. With art and layout, that should be anywhere from 120-140 pages at 6x9 folio size. The PDF will be full-color, while the softcover book will be in black & white.\nThe book includes everything that you need to build your part of the setting, and create characters. There is an extensive section on the world of Midgard, as well as a section for GMs. Additionally, the core book will contain three adventures, one each written by Quinn Murphy, Lillian Cohen-Moore, and Ryan Macklin.\nAny backer at any level gets access to a preview, pre-edited version of the game text. Please look at it, play it, and give feedback on it. With your help, this game will become the best that it can be. \nThe World\nA diverse and inclusive setting that strives to make it so anyone who sits down at the game table will find a place for themselves.\nMidgard and the lands that surround it are based loosely on our own world. The lands of Midgard reference Viking culture and Norse myth, but with fantasy twists that make it unique. The lands around Midgard are cultural analogues to the cultures that Vikings interacted with: Rome, the Celts, Eastern Native Americans, and Arabia. The inclusion of those cultures helps emphasize the diversity of the setting that is so important to me.\nEach of the these cultures is explored in the core book from the viewpoint of the people of Midgard. As stretch goals get unlocked, there will be additional books that focus on the lands that surround Midgard, giving you a look into those cultures in greater detail.\nA Place for Everyone\nThe setting of the game is one wherein I want any gamer of any background, age, gender, ability, culture, or sexual orientation to be able to find a place for themselves. The art features peoples of different backgrounds and body types, all positioned as residents of Midgard. No matter who you are, I want you to feel comfortable playing in the world War of Metal and Bone.\nWant to See it in Action?\nAbout Me\nMy name is Tracy Barnett,and I run Sand & Steam Productions. This is my fourth Kickstarter, and my third game project. My first game, School Daze, won a Judges' Spotlight ENnie in 2013.\nI believe in openness and transparency. If you back this Kickstarter at any level, you'll get access to the first draft of the game text. The same is true for any stretch goals that get unlocked: all of them will have early previews as soon as the authors being work on them. I'm always open to feedback and having more people look at and work with the text helps make the game stronger.\nThe funds for this project will go to the editing and publishing of the Fate version of Iron Edda. Here's a breakdown:\nLayout: 1500\nEditing: 750-1000\nVideo: 500\nVideo Art: 500\nKS Art: 400\nWords: 1250\nArt: 1000\nJess Banks Mythology Primer: 250\nEditing Jess: 200\nI've got an amazing team working on this project. John Adamus is the editor and has decades of editing experience. He's responsible for editing the shiny words many wonderful projects, both RPG and fiction. Tiara Lynn Agresta has done layout for Smallville, among others. She knows how to make words and images beautiful and accessible. \nLance MacCarty did the art for the video and will provide the art for the book as well. Additional art is being provided by Theo Evans. Claudia Cangini provided the art for the cover.\nAll of the header graphics, the infographics, and the Iron Edda logo have been provided by Brian Patterson of d20Monkey.com. Without his work, this campaign would not look half as good as it currently does.\nThe Rewards\n This one gets you in the door. A digital, full-color copy of the War of Metal and Bone PDF. And as more stretch goals are unlocked, they'll be added to this tier for no additional cost!\n It may seem odd to have the International tier lower than the Domestic tier, but hear me out: I'm using DriveThruRPG to do the printing of the books. And DTRPG has printing facilities in England. Those who back at this tier get a code to buy the book from DTRPG at cost, meaning those backers will pay for the shipping themselves. This works out to roughly the same cost as the Domestic tier where I do the shipping. A better value for everyone!\n Here's where I order and ship the book to you. You also get the PDF and all digital stretch goals. This is for backers in the US only. If you're an International backer, you need the International tier, above.\n For this tier, you get a special, limited-edition full-color, signed hardcover of the core book. The PDF and all digital stretch goal are, of course, included. These will only be produced as part of this this Kickstarter!\nGame stores are a hugely important part of our hobby. They advocate for the hobby, get games in front of people that might not otherwise see them, and provide us a space in which we can game. This tier lets retailers buy copies of the game to re-sell at a decent margin. Thank you for all you do.\n Want to game with me? Back at this level and I'll come to you anywhere in the continental United States. I'll run a session for you and your group, and  you get full-color, hardback print editions of every book that gets unlocked. Pretty sweet. \n This is the same deal as the Midgard tier, but I'll fly anywhere in the world to fulfill it. Get an amazing book, and get to game with the creator!\nNow You Can Get Sveidsdottir as an Add-On!  \n$15 US gets you a code to buy the book at-cost from DriveThruFiction, you pay shipping. You also get the digital versions of the book (PDF, ePUB, and MOBI).  \nThis is just like getting War of Metal and Bone for International backers, but extends it to everyone. Once this Kickstarter ends, I'll get your info in the survey and you'll tell me what add-ons you selected. Sveidsdottir is on track to be published in June of 2014. If you want to get it, this is your chance!\nStretch Goals as Add-ons!\nEveryone above Thrall gets the PDFs of all the stretch goals as they're unlocked. If you want print copies, here's how it works:\nInternational Spearbearer:  Add $20 (per book, if more unlock).\nDomestic Spearbearer: Add $30 (per book, if more unlock)\nBonebonded Warrior: Add $70 (per book, if more unlock)\nMerchant Trader: You can split your 10 books into groups of 5 if you wish, getting five of one book and five of another. And additional $150 needed, per 10 books.\nThis Kickstarter has some fantastic stretch goals lined up: Different systems in which to play the game, and more setting material for you to use!\nEach stretch goal is a new book, system or setting, that clocks in at 22k words - the same length as War of Metal and Bone.\nWith the system goals I'm doing things a little differently. Every system has certain things that make it standout and come alive. To give you the best Iron Edda can offer, I'm empowering each developer to give their own take on Iron Edda via the system they're using. This means every stretch goal isn't just a new part of Iron Edda, but a completely unique game experience every time a system stretch goal is hit.\nFor the setting books, the authors are empowered to give you the details of different cultures in the world from the perspective of people from those cultures.

By using a sophisticated parts system and web UI, we're bringing the flexibility, ease, and control of a robust video game character creator to the tabletop. \nAs we add new parts, the number of potential combinations will grow exponentially! We can't wait to see what people create!\nChoose your race, your gender, your build, and your facial expression. Select and swap individual armor pieces, weapons, adventuring equipment, hairstyles, and faces. Choose your pose and watch all of the dynamically rigged parts and attributes conform to fit your selection. Choose the scale of your mini, and even the material it's printed in. We're bringing a high-tech update to a classic analog hobby and giving you the opportunity to breathe your vision and creativity into your miniature.\nYour equipment selections are dynamically rigged to conform to your choice in pose and character. These three 30mm scale minis have the same equipment but are in different poses. Click for video!\nAnd a close-up. 3D printing allows us to capture incredibly fine detail, even at 30mm scale, like the engraving on the chest piece.\nWhether you want to create stranger fare (good luck finding a dual-wielding halfling barbarian mini), capture key details (no one should be forced to make compromises on their dwarf\u2019s beard style), or simply have more say in your mini than just the paint job, Hero Forge is for you! \nWe've built a team uniquely qualified to bring this project to life. We invite you to get to know us:\nThere are many advantages to using 3D printing and digital models over the more traditional injection mold and sculpting techniques. Printing from digital models means we can easily scale our models up or down. Want 6 inch display versions of your party to immortalize their heroic deeds? Can do. Playing a niche tabletop game that uses a larger or smaller scale? No problem. And that's not all: our character builder will let you save high resolution screenshots of your model for your character sheet and overhead views for your favorite virtual tabletop program. You can even save your mini and edit it later so it can grow and change as your character does!\nPrint on demand means you're not limited to what big companies think have the broadest appeal, and we don't have to exclude poses, equipment, or designs simply because they can't be made with injection molds. This means more freedom for you. Interior or recessed detail, which is notoriously difficult for injection molds, is easy with 3D printing. We can also offers certain novel options like printing segmented chains or swinging lanterns with articulated parts, no assembly required.\nSomething as simple as a mini with swords crossed in front of him would be impossible with injection molds.\nWe believe that this is the next step in miniatures and a fantastic application of new, exciting technologies. We'd love to be another example that tabletop gaming is alive, well, and just getting started!\n3D printed plastics are easy to paint, too! Here are a few minis we designed, 3D printed, and painted ourselves. Click for video!\n                                                                                               We've come as far as we can on our own, but it is your support that will allow us to see this project through. Backing will go towards turning our concept art into one of the coolest, most diverse digital armories on the internet, and further developing/polishing our web UI to provide the smoothest experience possible. We can't wait to start our next campaign where every player is using a custom, bespoke mini that they designed themselves. We invite you to help make that happen!\nWe need the funding and support of backers to help us turn our library of concept art into a library of fully rigged, 3D parts. Backer's funding will also go towards developing our web UI so we can give you unparalleled flexibility and control while building your character. With a wide range of 3D parts and a perfected web app, users will have the tools to build truly unique, distinctive, interesting minis.\nAdditionally, Kickstarter offers the ability to go beyond basic funding, to reach exciting stretch goals so we can implement some of our big plans even earlier! In short, the more funding we receive, the more we can offer at launch!\nBeyond giving us the ability to fully fund this project, Kickstarter lets us connect with you. Many of our limited reward tiers offer you the opportunity to make your voice heard, working with our artists and modelers to make armor, weapons, items, and poses YOU want to see included. We wanted to give the community a voice in our product\u2019s creation, and Kickstarter seemed like the perfect way to do that.\nOur concept artists have earned their stripes in the tabletop and video game industries, and they know what makes a character truly exciting. We can't wait to see what they come up with next! Here are some of the designs they've turned out already.\nBy breaking all of our armor down into multiple parts we can generate an incredible amount of variety. Even with the limited pool of parts and poses we have now, our in-depth parts system can generate millions of variations, each with subtle differences. But that isn't enough for us.\nWe want enough variety that one could randomize our parts for years and still never arrive at the same mini! To that end, we are focusing on designing armor sets that have distinctive motifs, themes, and profiles, that will really come to life when you log in and combine the parts in exciting ways to create a truly unique look, distinctive to your character.\nArmor pieces will automatically fit your race, gender, and pose!\nWe've highlighted the customizability of our armor, but we aren't neglecting weapons and adventuring equipment either. Not only do we want everyone to be able select exactly the weapons they have listed on their character sheet, but to also be able to choose from multiple motifs, looks, and styles. When your character upgrades from a regular long sword to a masterfully crafted +3 long sword we want you to be able to have that reflected in your miniature. Hero Forge will make that a simple proposition.\nWith our initial funding goal, we'll be starting with fantasy-themed figures with an eye on expanding. Sci-fi, steampunk, cyberpunk, Victorian era, historical military outfits and weaponry, pulp, western, superheroes--the possibilities are endless, and some may even be revealed as stretch goals. Our in-depth parts system makes mixing and matching genres easy! As new parts are released you will be able to add a robotic arm to your knight, or give your cowboy a samurai sword. \nAfter setting aside the manufacturing costs of our physical rewards, the majority of the funding will go towards building 3D models and finishing the development of our web UI. When we reach base funding, we plan to have five races available at launch: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, and Half-Orc, and we will expand over time! With a successful funding campaign from Kickstarter we aim to have our full-featured mini-builder off the ground this year with new batches of parts hot on the heels of release.\nOur initial five fantasy races, with more coming as our first stretch goal!\nIf we exceed our base funding goal, we will have more resources to produce more parts and features faster. For example, here are a couple features we hope to add. You can help us add them sooner by helping us meet our stretch goals!\nWe've got many other big things in mind, including more genres, nudity options, color, wings/horns/tails, multi-figure poses, and more!\nMeet our All-Star team:\nBuilding the right team takes careful planning, an eye for talent, and a guiding passion. Joshua Bennett is that jack-of-all-trades. Having worked as a freelance artist, writer, editor, and project coordinator from L.A. to Hong Kong, he has been embedded in the tabletop RPG community for years. His work has appeared in Wayfinder Magazine, on paizo.com, and in dozens of online shops and indie RPG releases.\nCreating a character customizing UI is a complex endeavor. There are website limitations to work within, quality and quantity of art to consider, not to mention making sure that all parts are compatible with each other. As Technical Art Director for the video game studio Naughty Dog, Teagan Morrison has been dealing with digital resource management and character customizers for critically acclaimed games like the Uncharted series for years.\nThe fantasy genre is rich with traditions, tropes, and distinctive styles. Freelance artist Nicole Cardiff lives and breathes fantasy art and provides an insider\u2019s understanding of what people want when it comes to their fantastic heroes. Her work has appeared in Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition materials and the reboot of Tomb of Horrors, in Warhammer, Call of Cthulhu, and Game of Thrones cards for Fantasy Flight Games, and on the covers of fantasy novels.\nCreating designs that are iconic and integrate well into a parts system is no easy task, but expert concept artist Molly Maloney is uniquely suited for it. Currently working as a concept artist for Telltale Games, Molly is skilled at creating gorgeous concept art with an eye on its future digitalization.\nModeling characters for miniature, 3D printing, and a parts system requires a number of considerations that would make some 3D artists balk. With a masterful understanding of proportion, and a keen understanding of the medium, Margaret Dost is the perfect artist for the job. An expert 3D modeler who has worked on everything from blockbuster films like Pacific Rim, videogames like Mortal Kombat vs. DC, commercials, and cinematics, Margaret has the skills to guide our transition from concept art to 3D models.\nWith Hero Forge, customization is king. This is built on a complex and in-depth part system which requires extremely clever, dynamic rigging, and a balance between creativity, efficiency, and a keen artistic eye. Beverly Sage excels at all of these things and has earned her stripes working as a freelance rigger and technical artist in the videogame industry on games like The Last of Us. She currently works for Nickelodeon Animation Studios as a technical character artist.\nMaking a part system that just works, plug-in free, in your web browser involves a lot of pipeline challenges, as does getting a customized 3D model into a data format that can then be 3D printed. David Lenna has been dealing with pipeline as South Park studio's Chief Technical Officer for years and is uniquely equipped to make the right decisions.\nAll that to say: We have an amazing team with passion, big ideas, and the technical chops and experience to back it up. We can't wait to make Hero Forge a reality!\nThere are technologies available now that would have made this project impossible even a year ago, and further improvements in this already groundbreaking tech are right around the corner.\n3D printing\nWhile injection mold minis are not likely to see any revolutions in their production process any time soon, 3D printing is evolving at a blistering pace. While current printing technology allows us to capture detail comparable to current minis, our character and object models are sculpted at remarkably high detail, so you can look forward to fidelity improving as printing technology does!\nWe've chosen to use Shapeways for our 3D printing needs. They recently released a developer API which allows small businesses, independent sculptors, and start-ups like us to take advantage of the latest in commercial 3D printing technology. By using the Shapeways developer API, we can evolve and grow as new materials and printing options are added.  As new features like color printing or improved materials are released, upgrading will be easy. This frees us to focus on what we're really excited about: making high-quality models. We're happy to have manufacturing handled by one of the leading names in the 3D printing industry.\nAt the moment, there are two main materials that we are interested in releasing at launch. The first is an 'ultra-detail plastic' material which is slightly translucent (before priming), highly detailed, and is fantastic for painting--very suitable as a high quality display piece. The majority of the miniatures we show here are printed in this material. The second is a lower cost, albeit lower detail material which is very durable and flexible. This 'strong plastic' It is opaque white, and has a rougher finish that makes it less suitable for painting. As in all other aspects of Hero Forge, We wanted to offer users as many choices as possible, so a cheaper, but still entirely customizable option just made sense. Note that the \"patron\" and \"novice party\" tiers are both available only in the latter 'strong plastic' material. Keep in mind that, by the time we launch, there may be exciting new material options available!\nWebGL\nWebGL, the new web standard for 3D, allows video game-quality graphics right in your web browser. This has allowed us to build an interactive 3D interface that lets you easily and quickly design miniatures without downloading plugins. See beautiful, interactive models as you design, pose, and build them. Gone are the days of browsing low-rez photo galleries or rooting through poorly stocked shelves. You'll be able to see your mini in crisp 3D long before it arrives in your hands. \nWebGL also allows us to add fun, free features that we believe people will enjoy: whether you're buying our minis or not, you will be able to export high resolution screenshots of your unique character. Use it for your character sheet, as a keepsake, or for a 'wanted sign' player handout. Export an overhead views for your favorite virtual tabletop program. Save a character to edit later, or get a head start designing your next one. Here is a video highlighting some of the features that we will be including!\nWe believe our WebGL character builder will be a fun and amazingly useful tool. We just can't stop thinking of new uses for this technology, and we're sure you'll have some great ideas too! \nPledge tiers $20 and up may add individual miniatures and statuettes to their order!\nClick for instructions!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n---While we want to offer as many options as possible, we also want to ensure that we have the absolute best base product we can before sticking baseball cards in the spokes and painting flames on it. Some of the more ambitious customization options may have to be prioritized or wait for things like print technology to catch up.\n\n----3D printing tech is rapidly improving, but just as the injection mold production process has its challenges and problems (flash or mold lines, limited shapes, etc.) so does 3D printing. Current print technology still has some disadvantages that it is working to address. For example, the strong material is not especially detailed, and the detailed material is not very strong. Another example: we've pointed out that the sandpapery texture of the 'strong plastic' material is not especially suitable for painting (paint sticks just fine, it just is harder to layer on). And the ultra-detail plastic is not as durable as most plastic miniatures. Much like a resin model or miniature, if you drop one from high up, it very well may break.\n\n---The ultra detail material can also come with some visual artifacts in the plastic's consistency. This is different than the \"stair-stepping\" effect of earlier 3D printing. In most cases it is a primarily a visual quirk rather than a physical one--and will be undetectable once a figure is sprayed with primer.\n\nOf course, these are challenges that are actively being researched and addressed. We are especially excited about new material offerings that are stronger, more detailed, and even allow for fine color application. These are advances we hope, and expect, to see in the very near future.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Your Alpha Access to Color Tools and \u201cSuper Backer\u201d Rewards", "update_content": "Hello again, Hero Forge Fans!

We will therefore try our best to make it a reality. Also I should note that we still plan to release the 30 minute version for free online. We haven't been able to figure out all the details regarding the rewards for the feature, but we get back with more info in just a couple of days.\nUPDATE #2\nIf we manage to reach $750,000 we will have a special screening in your city, with a meet and greet afterwards!\nGo to www.kungfury.net to submit your city, vote and spread the word! The two (2) cities with the most votes will get the special screening! The voting will end once the campaign is finished, so hurry up!\nTickets to the event is sold separately. The screening will take place after the Kung Fury release. \nUPDATE #1\nSorry for being unclear regarding shipping and the rewards. You won't have to pay for shipping, regardless of where in the world you are! All of the rewards from $20 and above will include the digital download, sneak peak and access to the production diary, Unfortunately we can't edit the description for the rewards. \n--\nKUNG FURY is an over-the-top action comedy written and directed by David Sandberg. The movie features: arcade-robots, dinosaurs, nazis, vikings, norse gods, mutants and a super kung fu-cop called Kung Fury, all wrapped up in an 80s style action packed adventure. \nDuring an unfortunate series of events a friend of Kung Fury is assasinated by the most dangerous kung fu master criminal of all time; Adolf Hitler, a.k.a Kung F\u00fchrer. Kung Fury decides to travel back in time, to Nazi Germany, in order to kill Hitler and end the Nazi empire once and for all. Kung Fury is a visually spectacular action comedy that has it's foundation in 80s cop movies.\nWhen I started this project over a year ago I was driven by a strong will, love for the 80s and action movies to create a unique movie that the world has never seen, which has taken to a finished trailer and enough material to create a 30 minute long film. This with help of friends and giddy days. This movie has been made on a very limited budget. At the beginning of this project I took $5000 of my own money and just started shooting whenever I and my friends had time. \nKung Fury takes place in a variety of exotic locations; 1980s Miami, Asgard and Germany in the 1940s, to name a few. With a limited budget to work with, we had to solve this by shooting most of the scenes against a greenscreen backdrop. \nShooting on greenscreen means that we have to recreate these environments digitally instead. The advantage of shooting on greenscreen is that it doesn't require expensive sets or locations to shoot, it is very simple and only requires a small crew, which helped a lot in keeping the costs down. However, once you're done shooting a movie like this, there's a massive post-production phase that requires a lot of time and effort by talented visual effects artists.\nWhen I started this project I knew that I had the skillset required to make a movie like this, since I have a background in visual effects. Now I need the manpower to finish it.\nHence kickstarter and the wish for you to get involved in this project, where all my dedication remains and where my goal is to finish this movie and share it with the world. \nWith the kickstarter funding we'll hire a team of 7 visual effects artists who will work closely with David Sandberg on the post-production for a period of 6 months to complete the film. Pretty much every shot in this film requieres some form of visual effects treatment so there's a lot of work to be done. Apart from creating all the environments digitally, there's a lot of CG animated characters such as dinosaurs and robots that requires talented people and lots of time. To hire these artists we need to be able to pay them a decent salary. Money will also go to hire an exceptional artist to create the artwork for the movie poster. It will have that classic, illustrated 80s style that you rarely see anymore. Costs will also go to the rewards, such as printing costs for posters and stickers, t-shirts, blu-rays etc.\nWe're open to all the help we can get, so if you're a 3D artist, 3D animator, visual effects artist, compositor, or if you feel like contribute to this movie in any way not mentioned here, please contact us at: laserunicorns@gmail.com\nNo man should be left empty handed, so we've put together packages of exclusive rewards for each donator, all from t-shirts and posters to the soundtrack by Mitch murder and Lost years. Find more about the rewards on the panel to the right.\nIf this kickstarter campain is successful, we will release this 30 minute film online, for free. We want everybody to be able to watch and enjoy this film. It is our dream to be able to expand this into a full feature film. And if we were to exceed our kickstarter goal that something we want to look into.\nThis film was shot entirely on the Canon 5d, with the exception of the slow-mo scenes which were shot with the Sony FS700.\n CAST & CREW\nDavid Sandberg has worked closely with the production company Lampray (www.lampray.se) from the start. The company is run by Linus Andersson and Martin G\u00e4rdemalm.\nRecently the production company Salmon Fox (www.salmonfox.com) got onboard with the project. With the Academy Award nominated producer Mathias Fjellstr\u00f6m. David and Mathias share a love for the 80s and that will reflect in the final film.\nBecause this film has been shot on the span of over a year, there's been a number of talented cinematographers involved. They are:\nMartin G\u00e4rdemalm, Linus Andersson, Jonas Ernhill, Mattias Andersson (www.anderssonmattias.com) and aerial cinematography by Henning Sandstr\u00f6m (www.vimeo.com/henning). \nStarring: David Sandberg as \"Kung Fury\", Joanna H\u00e4ggblom as \"Viking Babe\", Leopold Nilsson as \"Hacker Man\", Andreas Cahling as \"Thor\" and Per-Henrik Arvidius as \"Chief\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKUNG FURY is a very ambitious project to say the least. The good news is that we've already shot most of the film, so that eliminates a degree of worry right away. There's so many man-hours that has went into creating this, that it is just not an option to give up at this point. It is currently the funding that is holding us back and finding money for a movie is hard, especially for a crazy project like this.

So please jump in now if you haven't yet, because it would break our hearts to see you live with that kind of regret.\nTHUMBNAIL SUMMARY OF UNLOCKED GOALS\nBALL PIT album of original songs, plus album art\nEXTRA BALLS album of cover song collaborations\n2 music videos for 2 of our brand-new songs\nRPG Soundboard App\nThe KS-exclusive and star-studded PaulandStormonomicon story and art anthology\nAnimated holiday special to be created in collaboration with Mike and Matt Chapman (The Brothers Chaps of homestarruner.com)\n(Holy crap!)\nWHO THE HECK ARE WE?\nWe are Paul and Storm, a comedy-music duo who've been writing and performing music together (and prior to that, as half of a cappella group Da Vinci's Notebook) for nearly 20 years. We perform across the US and internationally, and at numerous cons (such as PAX, PAX East, DragonCon and Emerald City ComicCon). We're co-founders of w00tstock (along with Wil Wheaton and Adam Savage), and we co-produce the annual Jonathan Coulton fan cruise JoCo Cruise Crazy. \nYou also might have seen our George R.R. Martin-themed music video, \"Write Like the Wind\":\nWe've independently recorded and released four albums as Paul and Storm; and in early 2013, we co-created, starred in, and wrote the songs for the musical webseries LearningTown for the Geek & Sundry YouTube channel.\nWHAT THE HECK ARE WE DOING?\nWe're nearly finished recording our fifth full-length album, Ball Pit; but rather than just finish it off and release it the way we usually do, we wanted to do...something more. With your help, we can make a spectacle of the release, and surround it with other, related cool projects to help make a real splash and hopefully garner some extra attention to the new release. Cool projects like professionally-produced music videos. Like a bonus EP with cover songs and collaborations. Like an RPG soundboard app. Maybe even an animated holiday special, a live concert video, or a video project of us going on tour in an ice-cream-and-guacamole truck. YES, AN ICE CREAM TRUCK. WITH GUACAMOLE.\nWe'd love to just go ahead and make all of these projects happen on our own; we've been thinking about several of them for quite some time. But the truth is that we're independent musicians with limited resources. With your support and funding, however, we can make every one of them a reality, which excites us beyond measure.\nTL;DR The more we raise, the more shenanigans and monkeyshines we'll be able to bring you as part of the Ball Pit rollout. Thusly...\nSee? But we're not just here to show you sophisticated graphs. Here are the specifics:\nBall Pit is mostly recorded, but the big cash costs occur when it's time to assemble it into a CD. So there's that. But more importantly, we want to make a whole bunch of Ball Pit-related stuff. So at our main goal, here's where the money will be going:\n1. Finishing Off Ball Pit\nFinal mixing, mastering, packaging, and physical production of Ball Pit. This includes funds paid to guest musicians, producers, and visual artists who help make the project sound and look great. Also, a modest amount for our own time and effort.\n2. Music Video for \"This Song\"\nWe want to make a kick-buttocks music video for \"This Song\", our most viral-worthy tune since \"Write Like the Wind (George R.R. Martin)\". Here's a sneak audio-peek of a couple excerpts from the song demo:\n(Bear in mind the final version will be EVEN MORE EPIC)\n\"This Song\" needs a video, but it needs one done right. As in, not recorded and edited on our smartphones. Even on a \"shoestring\" budget, a GOOD music video with a professional crew can cost quite a lot. (As in, low five-figures) We want to bring in people to help make it Not Suck At All\u2014specifically, director Sean Becker and producer Kim Evey (who both worked on LearningTown and The Guild)\u2014to lead a crew to make a music video worthy of your efforts to fund it.\n 3. Extra Balls Cover Songs EP\nOur main goal will fund a 5-song EP called Extra Balls, featuring cover songs recorded with a few of our musician friends (Jonathan Coulton, The Doubleclicks, Parry Gripp, Mike Phirman, and Sara Watkins), to be made available as a digital download.\n4. Ten New RPG Songlets\nA little while ago, we recorded a number of short songs (\"songlets,\" if you will) designed to be used while playing RPGs. They were very well received, and a couple of them will be included on Ball Pit. We want to make more of them; so when we reach our main goal, we'll record and (separately) release 10 more. Additional funding will mean writing and releasing additional RPG songlets, and potentially an RPG soundboard app if things go really well. (More on that later...)\n5. Kickstarter and Amazon Payments Fees\nThese account for 7-10% of every dollar we collect. Gotta pay The Man!\nAbout the new Ball Pit album\nIn addition to popular songs that haven't appeared on any album (like \"Write Like the Wind (George R. R. Martin)\" and \"Thanksgiving\") and a couple of the original RPG songlets, we have a bunch of brand new original songs that aren't yet available anywhere. And as a backer, you'll get these new songs FIRST, before the rest of the world has access.\nBONUS: The amazing and talented Randall Munroe (xkcd.com) has done the cover art. (!!!)\nDepending on your preference and reward level, you can receive Ball Pit as a physical CD, a download with pdf files of the album art and credits, or on a limited-edition USB flash drive. \nSo that's pretty great right there. But we want to go BIGGER and DO MORE STUFF. So if we exceed our goal, here's a look at what we're gonna do:\nHere comes the science...\nUPDATE 12/10/13: $80k reached! The book is officially happening!\nThe PaulandStormonomicon will be an anthology of very short stories and illustrations based on and/or inspired by Paul and Storm and their songs.\nThe PaulandStormonomicon will include contributions from the following authors:\nJames S. A. Corey (The Expanse series)\nGreg \"Storm\" DiCostanzo\nLev Grossman (The Magicians; The Magician King)\nMary Robinette Kowal (Shades of Milk and Honey; Without a Summer)\nSeanan McGuire (Blackout; Rosemary and Rue)\nMikey Neumann (Vena Cava; The Ending: An Apocalypse Part 1)\nPatrick Rothfuss (The Name of the Wind; The Wise Man's Fear)\nJohn Scalzi (Old Man's War series; Redshirts)\nScott Sigler (Infection Trilogy; Nocturnal)\n...and will include illustrations by:\nBill Amend (FoxTrot)\nJoel Hodgson (MST3k; Cinematic Titanic)\nScott Johnson (My Extra Life)\nMary Robinette Kowal (yup; an illustration too!)\nLen Peralta (Geek A Week)\nKatie Rice (Camp Weedonwatcha; Penny Arcade's Strip Search)\nKris Straub (Chainsawsuit, Broodhollow)\nZach Weiner (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal)\nAnnie Wu (Venture Bros.; Batgirl)\nWil Wheaton\nand Neil Gaiman\nAnd the cover will be designed by Emily and Matt Fitzpatrick, the cross-stitching wizards behind Steotch.\nWe're hoping to add a few more names to the above lists before we're through. Watch this space...\nThe PaulandStormonomicon will become available in both paperback and ebook form (specific formats TBD; but we promise to try to make it available for all major ebook readers); it'll be available as an add-on ($10 digital version; $15 US /$18 INTL paperback; $20 US / $23 INTL P&S-signed paperback), and/or included in some higher Reward levels.\nThis collection of brand new works from all these great creators will ONLY be available to our Kickstarter backers\u2014once the campaign\u2019s done, this book will disappear back into the \u00c6ther. So act now!\nUPDATED 12/13/13: The Animated Holiday Special, co-created by, co-starring and animated by Homestarrunner.com's Mike and Matt Chapman, and co-written by us, the Brothers Chaps, and LearningTown head writer Josh Cagan, has been FUNDED!\nOur Kickstarter backers will be able to see and hear it before anyone else.\nYes! For years fans have asked us \"When are you going to do a song with [Person X]\", or suggested that \"You should totally do a cover of [Song Y]\". And you know what? We love Person X and Song Y, but it's never seemed quite right to do those things on our \"normal\" comedy albums. And even if we did, the logistics of coordinating such collaborations can be intimidating.\nWell, darnit, the time has come to stop dawdling and start making it happen. And so, with crowdfunding's help, Extra Balls will be born.\nUPDATE 12/02/13: New collaborators announced: MC Frontalot, Hank Green and John Scalzi! Current full list of Extra Balls collaborators:\nJim Boggia\nMarian Call\nChris Collingwood\nJonathan Coulton\nThe Doubleclicks\nMC Frontalot\nHank Green\nParry Gripp\nMolly Lewis\nMike Phirman\nJohn Roderick\nJohn Scalzi\nSara Watkins\nadditional collaborators TBA\nThe Extra Balls CD is now also available as an Add-On item to existing pledges, and comes free with the ALL-IN BUNDLE (and all higher rewards which receive the ALL-IN BUNDLE items).\nAs described above, we've previously recorded a few short \"songlets\" designed to be used while playing RPGs. Songs such as \"Critical Hit\" (Warning: NSFW!):\n ...and \"Don't Blow the Daily\" (NSFW)...\nThese have been very well-received, so we want to make more of them. We'll make 10 more upon reaching our main goal, and then more at the $30,000, $35,000, $40,000, $45,000 and $55,000 levels.\nAnd if we reach $65,000, we'll compile all these songlets into a smartphone app you can use in your own gaming sessions, or to just play on a whim wherever you go. (Like the library. Or jury duty. Or a funeral.)\nIt's something we've wanted to make for years, but we got sticker shock when we first saw what quality app development costs. But your funding will enable us to bring in professional developers and artists (who we already have lined up) to make this app as cool, efficient, beautiful and awesome as possible. If funded, the RPG app will be made available as an add-on reward to our Kickstarter campaign.\nBeyond the $65,000 threshold, the more funding we receive, the more songlets, taunts, sound effects, and features we'll add to the app. \nActual app will look way more awesome.\nUPDATE: UNLOCKED! App will have at least 75 sounds, and will be available for iOS and Android.\nThe reality these days is that if your song doesn't have a great video, it's just not gonna go very far. And we know lots of experienced, talented people who do exactly that sort of thing\u2014and with your help we'll be able to pay them to help us put together some more high-quality righteous videos. If funding is crazy-go-nuts, we might even produce videos for some of our pre-Ball Pit fan favorites.\nUPDATE 11/19/13: Thanks to your generosity, we have secured funding for a second music video. Watch the Updates for forthcoming information about that second song and video. \nAs noted above, our cover art for Ball Pit will be done by xkcd's Randall Munroe. But we know quite a few great artists; so we thought, why limit ourselves to just one cover?\nSo a number of stretch goals will unlock alternate Ball Pit cover art created by some of our talented friends:\n$35,000 - Adam Koford (HOBOTOPIA)\n$40,000 - John Kovalic (Dork Tower)\n$55,000 - Ethan Nicolle (AXE COP)\nUPDATE 11/19/13: All three Alternate Cover Art stretch goals have been unlocked! Poster versions of all cover art options are now available as Add-Ons (see chart below for full pricing information). All Ball Pit posters are now included for free in the ALL-IN BUNDLE reward and above (all rewards of $130 and up).\nYES! P&S go on tour in an ice cream truck, document it on video, and make something awesome with it!\nUPDATED 12/09/13: Stretch goal revised to $265,000! Also, Mediocrefilms' Greg Benson will be along both on-camera and behind the scenes to help document the trip and edit it into episodes. \nWhen it comes right down to it, we're not really in the music business. Our true value to society is in doing idiotic things that make other people laugh, smile, or generally feel good, and it just happens that music is our primary means of accomplishing that end.\nSo we have a dream for a Ball Pit tour that combines three of our loves: music, live performance, and FOOD. And if we reach the ludicrous stretch goal of $265,000, we will procure an ice cream truck, take it out on tour, give away ice cream and guacamole, do various good and/or ridiculous deeds (tbd), and document the whole adventure with a professional film crew.\nDo we expect to reach this goal? No. But if you don't dream big, chances are you won't go on tour in an ice cream (and guacamole) truck.\nFull reward details are of course in the right-hand sidebar; but below is a basic summary chart of the items contained in the different rewards, so you know exactly what stuff is included in each package (not counting the reward-specific \"special\" stuff, like the doodles, song review and such):\n*For the CRAPPY ANIMATION and BAND FOR HIRE rewards, subject matter must be non-commercial, and may not contain pornography, excessive profanity, hate speech, illegal or creepy stuff. P&S retain final subject matter approval, but will work with you to make sure we're all happy with the final product. P&S will retain all publishing rights, but you'll be free to use it in any non-commercial setting that you like.\nADD-ONS\nBelow is the list of currently-available add-ons for all reward levels (excluding HEARTY THANKS and HEARTIER THANKS). Please note that some rewards may already include one or more of these items:\nMore add-ons may be opened up at additional funding levels, so watch this space as the campaign progresses!\nTo add any of these items to your existing pledge, click on the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button, increase your pledge by the amount(s) listed above (for example, to add both the T-shirt and USB Drive, add $110 for US orders, $123 for international orders), select \"Continue to Next Step\" and confirm your new pledge. Once the campaign is over, we'll contact you to find out which item(s) your additional pledge was for.\nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\nThe question often gets asked of Kickstarters (especially successful ones): \"Where exactly does the money all go?\" When this is over, will we be diving into piles of cash, all Scrooge McDuck-like?\nAnd so we present the chart below, which is a breakdown of where the funds we've collected up to the $65k stretch goal level will go, based on our current best possible budget estimates. (The amount actually going directly to us is the highlighted, sexy gray section.)\nWhile the percentages will vary somewhat if/when we collect more funds, we expect them to stay reasonably close to what's in this graph.\nWE LOVE TALKING ABOUT OUR KICKSTARTER\nBelow is a list of podcasts and interviews with us discussing Ball Pit and the Kickstarter campaign.

So we feel pretty confident that we'll deliver on everything in our Kickstarter, including (especially?) the crazier elements. In the unlikely event that we actually raise $350,000, do we know exactly where we'd get an ice cream truck? No. But we have a good track record for figuring out those sorts of things.\n\nThat said, we're just two people made of flesh and blood, and are subject to the same cataclysms as other carbon-based lifeforms, as are our collaborators. It's also possible that unforeseen obstacles may hinder delivery of some of the project elements. We can't imagine what, but such is the nature of the unforeseen.\n\nBut at the heart of it all, we hope that this entire process will bring you great joy, and that the resultant output of content will bring us wider renown, thereby increasing your satisfaction in supporting us before Everybody Else got in on the act.

We just need your help to put it in motion!\nTHE COLLECTION\nEach piece in our first collection is a replica of the original skull and can be worn as a pendant (18\" chain included) or displayed on a base. The display base is made of white birch wood with a beautiful walnut stain, lacquered for protection. The display base is optional and not included with every reward tier.\nThe pieces retain incredible detail to let you appreciate the animal\u2019s teeth, antlers, cranial structure, etc. As a result, when you\u2019re wearing a Fire & Bone piece, you are able to carry the spirit of the animal around with you. It\u2019s an ancient fascination updated for the modern collector. \nSee updates for more information!\nTHE PROCESS\n 3D Scanning & Miniaturization\nOur process begins by digitally scanning real animal skulls. We work with a company that uses a proprietary 3D scanning process to digitally capture animal skulls in very high detail. We are thrilled with the level of detail we get from this method, which we haven't been able to achieve with consumer-level 3D scanners.\nWe scale the piece down to a size suitable for jewelry. Because we do this digitally and not manually, we retain an unprecedented amount of detail from the original skull.\n3D Printing and Metal Casting\nTo make the final pieces, we first use a 3D printer to reproduce the miniature model. We print this out in wax with a professional level 3D printer.\nWith our high resolution wax model we make a master mold which allows us to cast the skulls in any metal using traditional lost-wax casting. For our Kickstarter, we are offering casts in white bronze, yellow bronze, silver, or gold.\nWe've partnered with two family-owned foundries in the U.S. with decades of experience producing large production runs of small delicate pieces.\nThe response from the Kickstarter community has been overwhelming so far! All of the tiers below now have an estimated delivery date of March for all NEW pledges. This does not affect any of our backers who selected a reward for estimated February delivery.\nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP\nWe\u2019ll be using this money to complete our first large production run and to fulfill all Kickstarter orders.\nMost importantly we\u2019ll be able to locate, acquire, and scan more skulls. Our goal is to build specimen collections e.g. Early Hominids, Big Cats of North America, Dinosaurs of the Cretaceous, etc.\nPendants are just the first step! A successful campaign will allow us to prototype and produce a wider range of products including rings, earrings, men\u2019s accessories, such as cufflinks, and more.\nIt will also allow us to build an online store-front and launch a campaign to bring Fire & Bone to Natural History and Science Museum gift shops all over the world.\nHere's what some fine people are saying about Fire & Bone:\nAdafruit\nCNET Australia\nGeekMom\nio9", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know there can be production challenges associated with any manufacturing project (delays, equipment failure, etc.), so we have built relationships with two separate foundries to fulfill orders. We have contingency plans in other locations, just in case.\n\nAnother unique challenge for us is that molds wear out over time. We have a lot of experience in jewelry design and metal casting, and we know how to plan for this.\n\nAs many people have discovered, 3D scanning, design, and printing all require expertise. We are veteran users of these technologies and have worked in many high-stress situations to develop great products.

He is assisted by Dylan Owen, who is also in charge of product design and is assisting with creative writing. Anthony Greentree will provide the art and graphics, bringing the continent of Dothmora and the world of Lumria to life with his artistic talents.\nOur main goal for this campaign is AUD$10,000. This will allow us to print the master miniatures for Shadow Hold and The Mining Guild, create the moulds and put into production the Shadow Hold (7 miniatures) and Mining Guild (7 miniatures) factions. As well as print the rulebook.\n  Welcome to the Eastlands of Dothmora, a realm riven by intrigue, feuding lords and warbands fighting in the secretive Shadow War. It is a land steeped in rune magic and blood, yet one where the various races \u2013 humans, elves, dwarfs, fauns, trolls, ogres, orcs, goblins and halflings \u2013 live in harmony, owing allegiance not to race but to one of the mighty factions that make up this war-torn kingdom.\nTwelve Elements of War is a 28mm Tabletop skirmish wargame. A typical warband will include between 7 - 12 models (depending on your faction and style of play), activating one model at a time. Players alternate turns activating models, keeping both players engaged and thinking. Despite only activating one model at a time, it successfully simulates combined attacks with multiple models; the first attacks in a round weaken and lock-down a model, making it easier to finish off by attackers later in a round.\nIt uses a multiple D6 dice, one-roll system for all rolls during a battle. Roll a number of dice equal to the Model Statistic that you are using to attack/defend/employ, add bonus dice if you have an advantage of some type, like charging. Compare the result of this roll to the enemy model's statistic or enemy model's roll to see if you succeed. The dice system does not use charts or tables & is used for all rolls, making the game extremely easy to learn.\nThe broad range of Faction Lists each bring something special to the battlefield, and each faction choose from the 9 fantasy races. Each Faction is balanced to each other, despite having multiple fantasy races and at least 6 roles per Faction to choose from. Successfully employing a variety of different races performing melee, shooting or magic roles on the battlefield is the key to winning.\nOver 20 different mission combinations ensures that each game of Twelve Elements of War will different from the next. Creating a balanced warband is only the start; quick thinking, using the right model at the right time & an assertive battleplan is the key to completing your objectives while denying your opponent theirs. \nThe fun with Twelve Elements of War doesn't finish after one game. Twelve Elements of War has a complete Campaign system that sees your models gain experience, better abilities, new skills, money and magical runic items as they play battles and also explore the world of Lumria acquiring strange and unique items. You will also have the option to visit a town after each game. In town you can choose to go to the Tavern to recruit new members and heroes, The Market to purchase new items and equipment, the Arena to watch pit fighting and maybe pick up a few pointers. Lastly the Temple, where you can prey to the gods to heal your wounds or ask for their blessing in future battles. In addition to visiting these places, you roll on one of four unique \u201crandom encounter charts\u201d.\nGames can be played on a vast variety of battlefield types, from cautious tactical advances in the snow covered Forest of Sighs, to fast paced skirmishes leaping from building top to building top in the sprawling Port City of Arcadia.\nLastly, with 100's of magical  item combinations to try out and over 36 unique runic spells to cast with your magic users, this game has a large amount of re-playability.\n(these playtests where external and independent of Sword & Board Games)\n\"Gameplay was smooth and fun. As a designer I love the elegance of the underlying 'core engine' (i.e. number of dice = skill, success on 4+, success determines difficulty of opposite roll). I also love the depth and variety of the background. The post-game sequence brought up quite a few laughs, and a feeling of 'fantasy world' out there waiting to be explored\". \u2013 Alessio Cavatore\n\"The faction rules give a distinct narrative flavour to each warband without overloading each player with too many extra rules, and the fact you can field different races makes the warbands look really cool, and makes the game look very different from anything else on the market\". - Playtester \n\"Easy-to-learn, streamlined mechanics. They gave a fast, dynamic feel to the game. We had some very cinematic moments in our battle, like when my opponents dwarf charged from a rooftop into a melee below\". - Playtester \n\nHighguard\nNoble and proud, its soldiers armoured in the finest steel plate, Highguard once ruled all of the Eastlands\u2026 but that day is now past.\nThe Mining Guild\nRuling an ever-expanding subterranean realm, the Mining Guild is a faction renowned for the toughness and tenacity of its warriors and citizens.\nThe Geniocracy of Toth\nMasters of invention and technology, the Geniocracy makes extensive use of clockwork constructs, aiding its citizens in menial tasks and marching alongside its armies when it goes to war.\nThe Shadow Hold\nShrouded in darkness, the acolytes of the Shadow Hold are Runecasters who wield powers beyond comprehension and are feared across all of the Eastlands.\nThe Keepers\nReligious fanatics who believe they alone can save Dothmora, the Keepers are a fervent order who see it as their divine duty to rid the Eastlands of dangerous Runecasters.\nHeroes for Hire\nWarbands can be supported by a number of unique \u201cHeroes for Hire\u201d lending their services to your noble cause (for the right amount of sovereigns of course)\n(NOTE: Concept art miniatures may be slightly altered, have different poses and weapons based on feedback from the gaming community)\nIMPORTANT: You will not be asked to select your miniatures until the renders have been completed after the campaign.\nHigher resolution images can be found on our website\nLeft to Right: Concept Art, 3D Sculpt, Production, Painted\nAs you can see from the pictures above, we are more than capable of delivering from concept art to finished miniature.\nUNLOCKED: Shadow Hold Male Faun\nUNLOCKED: Shadow Hold Male Elf\nUNLOCKED: Shadow Hold Female Goblin\nUNLOCKED: Shadow Hold Female Troll\nUNLOCKED: Shadow Hold Female Sorceress\nUNLOCKED: Shadow Hold Bane Knight\nUNLOCKED: Shadow Hold Male Halfling\nUNLOCKED: Mining Guild Male Elf\nUNLOCKED: Mining Guild Female Orc\nUNLOCKED: Mining Guild Male Troll\nUNLOCKED: Mining Guild Male Dwarf\nUNLOCKED: Mining Guild Male Goblin\nUNLOCKED: Mining Guild Female Human\nUNLOCKED: Left to Right: Mining Guild Female Halfling, Mining Guild Female Human\nLOCKED: Left to Right: Highguard Female Elf, Male Faun, Female Dwarf\nLOCKED: Left to Right: Highguard Male Ogre, Male Orc\nLOCKED: Left to Right: Highguard Male Goblin, Male Human (NOTE: the Goblins will look more like the 3D rendered ones and a lot less comical)\nLOCKED: Left to Right: Toth Female Ogre, Male Human, Female Orc\nLOCKED: Left to Right: Toth Female Faun, Male Dwarf\nLOCKED: Left to Right: Toth Male Halfling, Male Orc\nUNLOCKED: Left to Right: Keepers Male Dwarf, Female Faun, Male Goblin (NOTE: the Goblins will look more like the 3D rendered ones and a lot less comical)\nUNLOCKED: Left to Right: Keepers Female Halfling, Male Human\nUNLOCKED: Left to Right: Keepers Female Ogre, Male Troll\nLOCKED: Left to Right: Elspeth Vogel, The Wraith, Sar Ronald Ashworthy (Heroes for Hire)\nLOCKED: Left to Right: Goshnak, Heran Stonesheild, Finley Hobbs (Heroes for Hire)\nLOCKED: Left to Right: Highguard Weapons, Mining Guild Weapons, Toth Weapons\nLOCKED: Left to Right: Shadow Hold Weapons, Keepers Weapons\nLOCKED: Toth Small Assault Construct\nLOCKED: Keepers Sabre Hound\nLOCKED: Keepers Hunting Harrier\nTwelve Elements of War rulebook cover\n We have moved away from the \u201csterile\u201d style of what you would expect to find in game books these days. We are trying to show a \u201crough\u201d and \u201chand drawn\u201d style of art as you would have found in the old  rule books from the late 70's and 80's when tabletop gaming was in its infancy.\n\nAs we have indicated many times before, we feel that many of today\u2019s tabletop gaming books have lost the \u201cwarmth and feeling\u201d that they once possessed. Having said that, we must stress that the team at Sword & Board Games do play numerous other games and we have great respect  for other companies achievements and products. Their huge success is a testament to their awesomeness).\n\nWe understand that the style may not be to everyone\u2019s taste however it complements the gaming world that we have created extremely well. The book is being styled as a traveller\u2019s tome/journal, so again the \u201crough\u201d style fits nicely. All the rules and lore will be set out in a format that you would expect from a typical rule book.\n\nThe rulebook will be 160 pages long and will include 42,000+ words of lore and background, rules, faction character lists, warband rosters, quick check guide, campaign rules and much more.\n\nFor more information on the rules, please head to our website to view the \"How we made it\" article or download the free \"Quickstart\" rules from our downloads section.\n\nhttp://www.swordandboardgames.com.au/how-we-made-twelve-elements-of-war.html\n  Main Goal: $10,000: Shadow Hold & Mining Guild Faction (Total of 14 Miniatures will be produced and the rulebook printed)\n\nStretch Goal 1:$20,000: UNLOCKED The Keepers Faction (Total of 7 Miniatures will be sculpted, Printed, Molded & Produced) Freebie: Caster, Warhost & Hoard pledge levels will receive a single miniature of your choice\u201d\nStretch Goal 2:$30,000: LOCKED Highguard Faction (Total of 7 Miniatures will be sculpted, Printed, Molded & Produced)  Freebies: Caster, Warhost & Hoard pledge levels will receive a single miniature of your choice\u201d\nStretch Goal 3:$40,000: LOCKED The Geniocracy of Toth Faction (Total of 7 Miniatures will be sculpted, Printed, Molded & produced) \u201cFreebie: Caster, Warhost & Hoard pledge levels will receive a single miniature of your choice\u201d\nStretch Goal 4:$46,000: LOCKED Faction Weapon Sets (weapons sets will be sculpted, Printed, Molded & Produced) \nStretch Goal 5:$56,000: LOCKED Heroes for Hire (Total of 6 characters will be (Total of 6 Miniatures will be sculpted, Printed, Molded & Produced)\u201cFreebie: Warhost & Hoard pledge levels will receive a single character miniature of your choice\u201d)\n                                   More Levels coming Soon!!!\n\n\nDepending on which stretch goals are reached, additional time may be needed to sculpt and produce these miniatures.

But that wont stop us delivering a fantastic game.\nWe here at Sword & Board Games are very serious about future support for Twelve Elements of War. We have years of miniatures, rules and supplements planned to further the gameplay experience. However, this all depends on the support of the awesome people of the gaming community.\nWho are Sword & Board Games?\nSword & Board Games was founded in 2011 in Sydney Australia by a group of gamers with a passion for tabletop gaming.

They will do it in their own, unique, fun way! \nScale - Map Flats are sized in inches and scaled at 1 square = 1 inch. Because this is compatible with most tabletop RPGs and 28mm miniatures games, 1 square is roughly equivalent to 5 feet.\nWet Erase-able - I use my Expo Vis-a-Vis pens on these all the time and they work like magic!\nDurable - These maps have a +100 bonus vs. water, milk, soda, energy drinks, baby wipes and household cleaning products. \nHigh Def - Yup, these babies are better than real life! Printed at 1440 dpi. \nSimpler Solution - These bad mama-jamas are tons easier to haul to your next gaming session than 3D terrain and hold up better than any card-stock or cardboard maps that exist on the market currently.\nModular - These maps do not bind you to keep re-playing the same set up over and over. You can arrange and re-arrange the settings as much as you need to.\nAffordable - You've seen a lot of maps out there, and sometimes, as a broke gamer, it's not always attainable to get decent quality maps that will hold up against the vicious battles that will be waged on them. It is our goal to provide not a decent quality map, but a STELLAR quality map at a price that a financially impaired GM can justify. \nD'Nal and the Hathonian Plains -\nHuh??? That's right, we decided to create a world around these maps! We're that cool! \nThat's not to say, or deter you from using them in other known worlds by any means. We simply want to paint the canvas of a new and exciting world for you to throw your unwitting players into! \nD'Nal - is a large continent in the world of Etheros. D'Nal is rich in culture, crops, mystery, and adventure. We start our Map Flats sets with the Hathonian Plains.\nHathonian Plains - The plains on D'Nal take of most of the center mass of the continent. The elevation and climate are perfect for growing crops and raising livestock. Inhabited mostly by human peasants and famers, the wealth is found in the soils of the farmsteads. \nThe plains, however, are also home to monsters of all shape, size and intelligence. Under the Hothonian Empires protection, the vast plains are filled with pockets of unwatched and unexplored territories. \nThe houses and structures found on the Hathonian Plains can act as a sanctuary to weary travelers, or as the setting for terrible acts that only the heroes can face and survive. \nBring on the samples!!\nPLAY\n\nHathonian Tavern: What noteworthy adventure doesn't involve a tavern? A sinister plot, meeting with a new employer, or just looking for a brawl. The tavern has always been a key component to storytelling.\nTavern\n Farm House: A great setting for a side quest, the scene of a dastardly deed, or just a place to catch some shut eye on the road to journeys end.\nFarm House\n What you will get: \nWhat you get solely depends on your pledge level... but we all know that. So lets talk pledge levels! \nLet's answer one of the most important questions first: \n\"What level do I have to pledge to qualify for stretch goals?\" \nAny \"Core Set\" that you pledge will qualify you for the stretch goals.

This means you get the sharpest and most vivid details in your maps. The 15oz vinyl is very sturdy, yet still just as flexible as you're used to with the common Battlemats on the market.  \nOkay, here are some more samples: \nThe Church: This awesome structure can be the beacon of hope for many but also harbor deep, dark secrets that would appall the members of the community. Also, a great place to find adventure!\nChurch with Cult basement\nThe Armorer: Any respectable city will have a good armory for the adventurers to get some armor or weapons. This flat brings a common structure to vivid life!\nArmorer\nTownhouse bottom floor\nTownhouse Top Floor\nAlchemist shop\nPush Goals: \nOK everyone! I'm throwing out some push goals! These will all be added to the Hathonian Plains Core Set and above. These are just a few of the samples that will be included with each set. There will be 12 of each addon set. \n$2000 - Treasures & Crates\nTreasure Hordes\nTreasure Chests\n$3000 - Traps\nMagic & Standard\nTraps\n$4000 - Blood Effects\nBlood Trails\n$5000 - Hex Grid Option\nAt the $5000 level, you will have the option to select the Hex grid or Square Grid in your survey after a successful campaign. So for those of you wanting that hex grid option, here it is! \nStretch Goals:\n$6500 - Map Augments*. I know... you're saying - \"What does that mean?\" Well, I'll tell you what that means. \nOur maps are made with specific dimensions. This limits their re-usability. So we have come up with some 'Augments' that will spice up what would otherwise be redundant scenes. \nTavern Private Room\nFor example: We have a few augments for the tavern, one is a nice sized stage area that you just lay on top of one of the sides of the tavern. Or how about a secluded room off to the side of the tavern for private meetings? We are including these augments as a free addon at the $6500 mark!\nSpare Bedroom\nFull list of augments coming soon! \n$7000 - Plains Map*. All core sets will include a 2X3 foot plains vinyl map with 1 inch square grids. \n$7500 - The Keep*. All core sets will include a two floor keep. Both floors of this structure is  24\"X30\" and is the perfect addition to the Map Flats family.\n$8000 - Merchant Ship*. All core sets will include a 4 floor merchant ship. These ships will be put out on four 10\"X30\" maps.\n$9000 - Dungeon Map*. All core sets will include a 2X4 foot dungeon vinyl map with 1 inch square grids.  \n$10,000 - Double Sided Maps* - All maps will be double sided with square 1 inch grids on one side and 1 inch hex patterns on the reverse side. \n$12000 - 2X4 upgraded to 3X5* Dungeon and Plains map sizes are upgraded to 3'X5'. \n$15,000 - Surm Kara Crater Teaser* - This is a teaser set for another part of D'Nal. Once home to an ancient metropolis tens of thousands of years ago, the Surm Kara (land of the dead) crater is all that remains. It is said that a great fire destroyed the city and all of it\u2019s surroundings. It was a fire so terrible that to this day even vegetation will not grow on the lands. This does not mean that the area is void of life. Many adventurers seek ancient treasures and glory in the crater, but few return. Those unfortunate few, however, return with grim stories of strange and distorted creatures prowling the barren lands, taking refuge in the crumbled remains of a long forgotten city. At this level we will include the following maps: \n(Qty: 1) Surm Kara Crater Terrain Map (3'X5')\n(Qty: 4) Scavenger tent (4X5)\n(Qty: 1) Chieftains domicile (6X6)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 1 (12X10)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 2 (10X8)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 3 (8X6)\n(Qty: 1) Crumbled Building remains 4 (6X4)\nCity of EeSos Teaser:\nThe great city of EeSos is located on the Tounge of D\u2019Nal, a plateau that hangs over the ocean. The city is home to tens of thousands including the King of D\u2019Nal. The city is rich with culture, but also has it's own secrets.\nDeep beneath this city, hundreds of feet under the plateau, are the docks. This is the main hub of exports, imports and black market dealings.  \nThe docks are connected to the city by stalagmites and stalactites that have fused together over thousands of years. The stalagmites are enormous in size, some so large that they hold the homes of the peasants and other merchants who reside under the plateau.  \nThis teaser set will include 10 additional maps including:  \n4 structures from the city\n4 structures from under the plateau\n1 City Map\n1 Map of the 'Pillars'\n*Virtual orders that qualify for stretch goals will be delivered in virtual products. So if you have pledged for virtual maps, you will get the stretch goals in virtual formats. Also if you have pledged for vinyl and virtual maps, you will receive both formats of stretch goals.\nBackground: \nThe Map Flats concept came from Ted's love of high quality graphic game maps and his inept ability to transfer the images in his mind to the mats he was gaming on. An avid Gen Con attendee, he admired the 3 dimensional gaming supplements but immediately recognized the inherent problem of 'easy transport' of the pieces. Also, there is a limit to customizing those pieces during play. When you draw on them, typically the only way to 'erase' the markings is to re-paint them.\nMap Flats was then born. It started with putting together a small collection of commonly used structures and items\nWe're also participating in Kicking it Forward. This is an amazing project where we pledge to give back 5% of our profit to other Kickstarter projects. We have a great community here and we're proud to be a part of it as both creators and backers!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want to utilize Kickstarter as a tool for several reasons. One is to get a strong feel for the market for this product as well as get funding for more map genres and expansions. We also want to raise awareness of these awesome products and try to get them into gaming stores all over. With your help, we can achieve national exposure and get more exciting maps and genres underway!\nWhere's the money going? \nIn short, production, packaging, artwork, shipping and marketing. The goal is to continue producing high quality maps for you to use in all your game genres and create a new world for your gamers to explore. \nRETAILERS:\nWant to sell Map Flats at your store?

One of the more brilliant and enduringly legendary artifacts ever introduced into the D&D/Pathfinder universe, the Deck calls to the gambler in all of us.  It tests us as players, forcing us to weigh personal goals against loyalty to the party.  A bad draw can completely disrupt a campaign, getting a character killed, trapped, stripped of all items, or compelled into story lines that were not part of the original script.  A good draw can imbalance a party, making one character able to overwhelm content and overshadow the rest of the team.  And for these reasons, the Deck can challenge a DM/GM as well.  \nIn early 2013, during the usual clean-up chatter following a Rise of the Runelords session, Ed Courtroul, the game master of our international party of expat gamers in Tokyo, approached me with an idea: \"We should make our own Deck of Many Things.\"  Ed is a serious collector of RPG items, from entire sets of modern accessories to memorabilia of historical significance.  So, when Ed explained his ideas about the Deck of Many Things, I was intrigued.  I'm passionate about art and the creative process in general, and I liked the idea of bringing something to the gaming world, something gamers now and well into the future could get excited about.  A short time later, Ed ran me through all he knew about the Deck, not only its in-game lore, but every known physical incarnation of it ever released, from early DIY print-and-cut versions in supplements, right up to the most recent release -- all of them now out of print.  As I listened and learned, I thought about having a Deck myself, about how it would feel in my hand, the size and weight.  I thought about how players might react when a DM places a Deck on the gaming table after the rogue picks the lock on the bone chest the party found behind the loose stone near the wizard's bookshelf.  I thought about announcing the number of cards I would draw, of turning them over one at a time, the whole party reacting to the thrill of each card as it was revealed.  I felt the hook being set:  I wanted a Deck for myself, and I wanted our Deck to be the one gamers reached for at moments like the above.\nThe Analog Games LLC Kickstarter Limited Edition DECK OF MANY THINGS is a tarot-sized (roughly 3\"x5\"), 25-card deck in a printed, shrink-wrapped tuck box.  It will include the 22 original Deck of Many Things cards, plus THE BEGINNING Limited Edition card, and a couple of cards displaying the Open Game License, as required by the License itself.  Each card will be printed on high-quality 300 gsm art paper, which is durable and exceptionally suited for printing detailed artwork.  That was vital to us, because we knew going in that the art is everything to this deck.  We wanted the images to jump off the card, so the instant someone turns a card, even if they know nothing about the Deck, they should know whether fortune or doom is upon them.\nThat's why Holly Rorke was hired as our Art Director.  Holly is a veteran freelance fantasy and indie comic book artist.  We have depended on her instincts and interpretation of the classical descriptions of the cards' effects in developing an image that captures the OMG! factor of each card.  Plus, we gave her unlimited freedom to design a special, limited edition 23rd card that would only be available in Kickstarter decks, and she blew us away with THE BEGINNING, a visually compelling card that also harbors a wealth of possible interpretations and outcomes if used in-game.\nMUSIC:  All backers will receive a private link to download the song Tales of Many Things, the original composition created specifically for the video attached to this Kickstarter campaign.  Use it as you will in accordance with the Creative Commons License.\nLIMITED EDITION:  Every DECK OF MANY THINGS sold via this campaign will be a special limited edition deck, available exclusively through this campaign.  It will contain THE BEGINNING card and will have the Funded with Kickstarter badge on the tuck box.  Decks sold after this Kickstarter ends will not contain THE BEGINNING nor the Kickstarter badge on the tuck box.   They will also not have domestic shipping rolled into the price as it is in our rewards.  In other words, the limited edition Kickstarter deck costs less and contains more.\nFROM THE ARTIST:  The ARTIST'S DRAW and DRAGON RIDER images are of the artist's choice -- please do not pledge for them thinking you can request anything specific or ask for changes to the artwork.  These are unique, one-of-a-kind sketches (Artist's Draw) or mixed-media color prints (Dragon Rider); they are not offers to create custom art by request.\nMULTI-DECK ORDERS:  Remember, the decks that follow the Kickstarter will not have THE BEGINNING nor the Kickstarter badge, so if you are the type to want something just a little special that says you got in first, you may want to order more than one deck here.  Some to keep, some to use, some to sell, whatever.  As multi-deck orders save us fulfillment costs, we have lowered the per-deck pledge prices accordingly.\nAdd Ons do not come with any Deck of Many Things.  To purchase one, just add its cost to your pledge total and advise us when the post-campaign survey arrives what the additional money was for.  Anyone is welcome to purchase an add-on, even if your initial pledge is only $1.\nDeck of Many Things Windows Screensaver - $2\nThis $2 add-on screensaver will have the entire Deck, including the \u201cface cards\u201d once our backers\u2019 faces are painted in, plus any stretch goal cards we happen to unlock. This little gem is only $2, but if everyone buys one, that\u2019s more than $1000 towards the next stretch goal. Ah, economies of scale!  Note: sorry, the software doesn't let me make screensavers for Mac.\nCustom Character Theme Song - $50\nIf you\u2019re like me, you get pretty attached to one or two of your characters. Well, for just fifty U.S. greenbacks, I\u2019ll work with you to compose a 3-5 minute instrumental theme song for a character of your choice. Does your female elf ranger stalk the forest gracefully to the sound of flutes and oboes? Does your dwarf paladin make his entrance to horns, drums and bagpipes? I have a complete home studio, and can compose in styles ranging from death metal to classical. Each song will be made personally for you to your specifications. Need a sample? How about this for a Varisian Bravo?\nCan you help the party past all the danger to collect all the loot?\n To keep this main campaign page from becoming too cluttered, details about unachieved stretch goals are contained in Update #13, visible to everyone.\n$13,500 - PDF GUIDEBOOK - ACHIEVED!\nGee,you guys are good... and stealthy!  You achieved this goal while I was doing the math and creating the graphics.  I have grand plans for the PDF guidebook.  What will be in it? The artwork from each card with the \"classic\" effect from the d20 SRD listed, plus recommendations on how to use the card in play, tips and tricks, and hopefully anecdotes on each page about a memorable time this card came up in someone's gaming session.  Where will all that additional material come from?  You, if you choose to collaborate via the newly unlocked \"Profession (Scribe)\" reward that is detailed below.  The guide will also have a thank you page listing all our backers, some extra special stuff for those who bought face card portraits, and best of all, it will be FREE to all of you and everyone else, always and forever.  You won't even have to buy a deck to get one, it will be a free download from our website.  So, all your names and the wisdom of our Scribes will readily spread 'round the world!

Any Backer's Choice card which is not claimed as a reward by the end of the campaign will not be produced.\n100 Facebook Likes - ACHIEVED!\nThis secret treasure was unlocked as well: a free browser based digital Deck of Many Things which scales perfectly for mobile devices.  Once the Deck artwork is complete -- around the time the Decks are delivered -- we'll post ad digital/mobile Deck of Many Things on our website, which you can use as a quick and portable reference, or even to shuffle and draw as from a real Deck.

So the art, which is the heart and soul of the Deck, is low-risk at this point. Following a recent run-in with a wild bear, we've put Holly in a padded room and given her only a 3DS with the corners rounded to make sure nothing happens to her before the last of the artwork is complete.\n\nFINANCES\nMany late nights entering formulae into Excel spreadsheets, testing and retesting assumptions, anticipating \"perfect storm\" scenarios, combining incense with a religious offering worth at least 25g, and rolling handfuls of dice has led us to the funding goal you see here, and hitting it exactly via the worst case scenario that I could conjure will still leave us able to fulfill all rewards, and bulk order our first batch of non-limited edition cards for sale after the Kickstarter, with $17.40 to spare. \n\nPRINTING\nFinding a printer we could trust to get us quality decks at a reasonable enough price to make the Deck affordable to gamers was the single biggest challenge our project has faced. After negotiations with numerous printers, the printing situation is sorted.\n\nFULFILLMENT\nFulfillment is the most potentially overwhelming aspect of a Kickstarter campaign. So sayeth our mentors, the amiable community of successful campaign creators we've communicated with. So, we're not taking any chances. We hired the professionals at FULFILLRITE, veterans of countless Kickstarter fulfillments, to take care of this for us. Joe Brieger at Fulfillrite has been patiently working with us almost from the very start of this idea, so don't worry. We got this. Which brings us to fulfillment's ugly sister:\n\nSHIPPING COSTS\nWe won't really know for certain how much it costs to ship one, two, five, or ten of our decks until we actually have them printed, pulled, packaged and shipped. That leaves a little bit of risk in the project, but I estimated high -- especially for international orders -- in order to minimize the impact of a bad estimate.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 411, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1997853065/deck-of-many-things", "project_name": "Deck of Many Things"}}, {"backer": "TheSheDM", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Enter into a shadow war between two Fae Courts in your own city, as you\u2019re thrown headlong into a world of extremes and contradiction where you have to adapt to a new reality or perish.

With the setting being a modern North American-esq city, Arden, we decided to focus on local stories. There are still Celtic Fae, as North America does have a strong European influence, but we also pulled from Native American stories, urban myths, and lumberjack tall tales. And besides, we have some things that are ridiculously cool and don\u2019t get enough play.\nDespite the large city, there\u2019s a small community feel in the game as the number of Fae and Nightmares measure in the hundreds. This, and the shape-shifting nature of many characters, have contributed to the setting being particularly gender neutral, and queer & LGBT friendly. With the smaller \u201crelevant\u201d populations there are some new social mechanics, notably the effect of status within the courts on interactions, and the trickery skill. Both of which reflect features heavily found in both Celtic Fairy Tales and Native American stories.\nWe have 4 flexible character \"races\", 5 arcane backgrounds, and edges that focus on your character\u2019s progression into something supernatural. For the GM we have 2 plot point campaigns, a plethora of savage tales, location based encounters, and a selection of magical items. In addition, we have equipment, game and Fae personality generators. In the game generators, we not only have your usual combat games, but also social and investigative focused tables.\nWe\u2019ve put a lot of work into this book, both the world, and making sure that everything mechanical we added was both necessary and reflected the setting. Over the course of a year, we\u2019ve designed the world and run two playtest campaigns. We\u2019re done most of the writing, the majority of the work left is in paring down and cleaning up the fluff, organizing and stating out the bestiary, and cleaning up changes to a few mechanics.

In addition, we're keeping the project as simple as possible.\n\nWriting\nThe two of us are the writing and production team, so if something drastic happens it will slow us down, though we've accounted time for this. However, it also means we don't have to worry about outside writers flaking on us or not meeting their deadlines! Most of the book is written, and just needs cleanup, and can easily be worked on by just one of us if necessary. All the files are backed up on an external drive and on the cloud regularly, so chances of data loss are small. \n\nArt\nThe art is being done by other people, so any delays there will delay the project, if they exceed the expected lag time. Should this get extreme it is possible for Mariah, one of the writers, to also do illustrations for the book, though this would slow us down.\n\nShipping\nCosts could go up again. However, we've budged for possible increases, and we're committed to getting the product to you.\n\nExchange Rate\nWhile this project is using Canadian dollars, most of it will be spent in USD.

We\u2019ve added over 200 new models to the Bones range, and we\u2019ve discovered that these products are monstrously popular. You wanted more! More monsters! More Demons! More Dragons! More characters! More variety and more amazing new models!\nYou're in luck! We haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. We have many more models that we think deserve to be added to Bones - new sculpts and classic favorites from our metal lines! We\u2019d like to see if you think so, too!\nBones are still really expensive to produce, and we still need your help to expand the line. Your support makes the molds that we need to produce the figures, and in exchange you get the first crack at these figures for a fantastic deal!\nWhat's in it for me?\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot since we fulfilled our first Bones Kickstarter project, so you won\u2019t find as many pledge levels. Turns out that most of you just wanted the core set with the potential to expand over time. What this Kickstarter will do is add 30 more models: character models, new sculpts, and monsters. After we hit our goal, we have plans to make the value of your pledge grow.\nAll we need is your support.\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nWhat?! You're a gamer, right? Are you still living under a rock? Bones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change one.\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed one massive Kickstarter and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of a Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our first Kickstarter. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2012 longshoreman strike that delayed two of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in the model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for a buy in level model. This event did not occur in our previous Kickstarter but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount for the model. Also we reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

More than one house of cards in Telloria\u2019s murky political landscape has tumbled to ruin by Irene\u2019s hand in service to Queen Goritsi. However, Irene has committed the ultimate sin in her Sovereign\u2019s eyes by refusing the Gift of vampirism. The Gift cannot be given, only received from  whatever dark forces seethe within Telloria\u2019s borders beneath the shadowy forests and moonlit peaks.\nAs a result, Irene has been exiled to Fructus Isle, a home to pirates, criminal masterminds, and political refugees. The Sovereign hopes that the brewing conflicts and the stress of the coming international summit will push Irene into accepting the Gift. Irene has her own ideas, and now considers herself a free agent, selling her services to the highest, or in some cases, most interesting bidder.\nIrene is most at home in the shadows, observing enemy movements, or sneaking into their camps to steal away vital intelligence. In her role as an assassin, she prefers to strike unseen, when she can maximize her opening blow. With preparation, she can exploit even the strongest opponent\u2019s weaknesses. She\u2019s a predator among predators, and her powers can only grow.\nIrene\u2019s nickname was come by honestly, although she despises its use. When in a great passion, or caught unawares, her eyes turn a solid, metallic black. It reminds her constantly that she must remain vigilant against her strongest emotions, lest she succumb to the Gift.\n   All 5 Faction Starters, a hardback rulebook with variant exclusive cover, and an exclusive sculpt of \"Iron Eyes\"! ($340 MSRP).\n*exclusive - We'll only have these available for Kickstarter backers with remaining stock sold or given away at conventions.\nWant more stuff? Just add the appropriate amount to your pledge from the optional menu below and we'll confirm what you want with you after the Kickstarter ends.\nDetailed descriptions of the Monsters available here: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coolminiornot/wrath-of-kings/posts/574506\nNote: Kingdom Death Twilight Knight crossover figure requires at least 1 Faction Starter pledged or $50 worth of Wrath of Kings models.\nWe were going to print all the Faction Cards on gold foil cards as tournament prizes, and we thought it'd be a nice little piece of bling for those of you that want it.  These will be custom printed with every single unit in the game on release (might not have this exact layout). Short of winning a tournament, this will be your only chance to get these, and we likely won't be printing more than a few hundred decks.\nYou'll still be getting your regular Faction unit cards of course, this is just a bit of fun.\n*note: Gold = Gold metallic colored. Not sure if there's any real gold in there, but we seriously doubt it.\nFor a look at the actual sculpts check out this update:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coolminiornot/wrath-of-kings/posts/586337\nWe'll be releasing these in plastic as part of the regular release schedule (after the Kickstarter - we don't want to bloat it and push back delivery), but the high quality European cast resin versions of these models will not be offered into general sale later. Just add the appropriate amount to your pledge if you want any, and as always we'll figure out what it's for after the Kickstarter concludes via our pledge manager. Note: May not have final rules on shipment - rules will be downloadable when available.\nActual tape case may vary, this is just a mockup. We're getting a bunch of these customized with the Wrath of Kings logo since someone keeps stealing ours at shows, and we thought you might like to have one too! It's not exclusive or anything, but we highly doubt a lot of distributors are going to want to carry them so this is a good time to pick one up without extra postage.\nThe boys and girls at Kingdom Death:Monster were kind enough to send their Twilight Knight into Arikania!  Check out her full story here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coolminiornot/wrath-of-kings/posts/587616\nNote: There is minimum pledge level of $50 for Wrath of Kings items (or 1 per Faction Starter) for the Twilight Knight.\nWe've move production forward for a 3rd type of Infantry for each Faction - for more details about them please check out this update:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coolminiornot/wrath-of-kings/posts/592165\nThese are Zombicide Survivors cosplaying as Wrath of Kings characters.\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coolminiornot/wrath-of-kings/posts/594757\nZombicide and Zombicide: Season 2 Backers - if you only want these items please add $10 shipping in the USA.

This is just for Kickstarter backers!\nThe pictured Specialist will be added to each Faction Starter for all our Kickstarter backers only!\nLike the setting?

Shaded areas are suggestions only, final result may vary based on what parts we can do.\nThe same as the $375k stretch, this time with another tool for another set of leaders!\nAll Infantry boxes pictured get 50% more models - Kickstarter only. Note, we don't have all the sculpts to show yet, but there are 3 sculpts of each infantry type per infantry box.\nWhen the Ancient King roamed the world in his mortal form - he's a Kickstarter and convention exclusive since he won't be making an appearance in the game, and is way too powerful to field. Get him free if we hit this stretch, if you pledged $200 or more (or an Ancient King EB at $190)! Otherwise if you really want him (he's cool looking), he's $10. We repeat - this dude has no rules, but will have a Gold Deck card.\nIf we hit this stretch, we'll add a bonus figure to each Faction Starter. These are Rank 2 characters (in plastic) with full rules. They'll be released at retail as normal but are not included in the Faction Starters.

Textures have simple patterns like bricks or stone while accents have items like sewer covers or bones to add interest.  To use the stamps all you need is to put a little sculpting putty on your base and press the stamp pattern you want, then allow the putty to harden.  Multiple stamping may be needed when mixing and matching textures and accents, but they give the sculptor endless possibilities of bases for a fraction of the cost of resin bases, an almost no time compared to gluing together bits.  Advanced sculptors can use the stamps as a jumping off point to reduce project sculpting time.\nOur stamps are made of a urethane rubber, and are 3/8\" thick made to last for years.  They are 3\" X 5\" to allow for larger bases and greater variety of texture.\n1. Allow us to create a higher quality product- We are looking to get our master molds 3D printed. This will allow us to \u201ccrisp up\u201d the stamp edges and textures like steel plates, tiles, and accents.  The stamps will also gain some details we could not even think of offering prior to this project. You can see in the photos below the dramatic improvement your support will have.  \n2. Allow us to improve the line- We are at the point of deciding what is working and what needs improvement. This will involve increasing the number of accents and adding some support products like putty and bases. With stretch goals we can add even more.\n3. Help us get the product out there- We have be quite successful so far, selling well over 500 stamps with little to no marketing, just word of mouth and some reviews. Kickstarter itself will help us get the word out, and a cleaner product will allow us to sell through more means than just our own online store.  Retailers who have used our stamps agree that the product is great and worth carrying, but they all agree the stamps need to look cleaner if we want to see it on their walls, or more importantly flying off their walls.\n4. Put the our stamps in your hands!- Let\u2019s face we all like to come to Kickstarter for two things support ideas we believe in and the SWAG! Ask anyone who has contacted us for tournament support or customer service, we want to see people happily using our stamps, this campaign will be no different. Just look at our pledges, we start with a chance to get more stamps for your buck during the campaign, and we will be throwing in some basing putty. Our stretch goals will add even more; we are planning on free bases, more stamps, and some surprises!\nThis is the kind of improvement you should expect to see in our stamps from this Kickstarter. Both tan stamps were pulled from prototype molds that our 3D printer sent us, the black ones are from our hand made molds we are using now. While one or two small tweaks are in order for the Sewers & Grates Stamp, we are quite excited with possibilities of this new production level!\nWhen we meet goal we will be producing 20 different stamps (15 Textures and 5 Accent) plus the pledge sampler stamp, more stamps will be unlocked with stretch goals.   We will be 3D printing the new molds so that lines will be crisper and cleaner, things like tiles & steel will be more uniform, and the details can be more complex.  Here are some 50mm bases that have been created with the stamps we have produced over the past two years.  Remember the new molds will make these look even cleaner! Many of the first fifteen textures will be similar to what we have already produced, with a few new ones added to the line.  All of the accents will be new. Be sure to watch the update section for renderings of the new mold plates so you can see what impressions will left on your base after stamping. \nThe Pledge Sampler Stamp- This stamp will have four patterns on it, similar to the textures above. Measuring in at 3.5\" X 3.5\" it is great for the hobby person on the go.  It will include: Flag Stone, Narrow Wood, Random Steel Plate, and one Kickstarter exclusive texture, MASS GRAVE, which will consist of a layer of human bones.  It will also be labeled on the side to show you pledged to our Kickstarter.  \nOn the left is the CAD drawing of the sampler textures that will be printed. The Mass Grave you see to the right will go in that blank spot you see on the CAD drawing.  The bases are a 20mm square & 30mm round to show you the scale.  For more detailed pictures check out updates #7 & #8.\nFor those that would like a second and third opinion, we have had a number of reviews including some demos on other websites.  With Podcasts we have posted the time stamp to the start of our review, but it would be great if you could listen to the whole thing out of respect of the Pod Casters who put a lot of work into their shows.\nShiny Penny Musings- written review with pictures about a 1/3 of the way down the page.  http://shinypennymusings.tumblr.com/\nBoosted Damage Podcast- around the 39:30 mark. http://www.boosteddamage.com/?p=440\nThe Eternal Warriors- Right at the start of the podcast \"easier than painting\". \nhttp://ec.libsyn.com/p/e/e/c/eec53dd31748a8db/Episode_36.mp3d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d01cf8734d9c95ddd22&c_id=4417653\nHand Cannon Online came up with some great demos of some advanced basing work that becomes super easy with our texture stamps.  We also are proud of being listed on their top ten gift list for two Holiday Seasons in a row now. \nhttp://handcannononline.com/blog/2011/07/21/basing-basics-part-1-with-happy-seppuku-terrain-stamps/ \nhttp://handcannononline.com/blog/2011/08/23/basing-basics-part-with-happy-seppuku-terrain-stamps/\nWargaming Tradecraft- A great brand new review of our pre-kickstarter product with some alternative ways to bring the textures from the stamp to your base.\nhttp://www.wargamingtradecraft.com/2013/07/review-stamping-with-happy-seppukus.html\nFor those wanting a bit more here are some extras you can purchase to help you in with your base stamping needs.  To purchase add-ons, pledge an additional dollar amount, over your chosen pledge, equal to the extras you would like. After the campaign the survey we will send you will have a spot for you to inform us which add-ons you wanted.\nHappy Seppuku Model Works is a family owned company that is dedicated to helping others in the hobby we love. We like to find new and inventive ways to improve the models and scenery of their games, all while trying to help our customers save money in the long run. We have been producing our base texture stamps for two years now with great success; however we are ready to step up our game a bit. This means improving our tools and offering an even better product than what our customers are already raving about.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been producing texture stamps in house for over two years now, and we have worked out the kinks with production system, so there will be no problems there. Problems that could occur would only cause a delay, these would be:\n1. Our 3D printer could get booked up. This could cause a delay of a few weeks.\n2. Overwhelming success. Ironically being super successful could cause a delay, mainly with rubber supply. Our distributor tells us that the company will have enough rubber; however it may have to come for the other side of the country, if they do not have enough on hand. Great success may also mean bringing in some more people and training them on how to properly produce stamps, which could take a week or so.\n3. Surprise! We cannot account for everything, me getting hit by a bus, aliens blasting our work shop.

This project\u2019s main objective is to create and produce 5 new fantasy miniatures for use in our tabletop skirmish game Freeblades.  Your backing will take these 5 miniatures from artistic concept to masterful sculptures to production molds from which are spun countless freebands of highly detailed Falkaaran figures for customers to purchase.\n[Visit the Updates link above to see all the latest info on this project - or scroll to the bottom of this page...]\nThe 5 Falkaaran miniatures we seek your support to produce are the: Jendal Bladeseeker, Karadal Bladesister, Knight Defender, Pikeman and Sailor.\nJendal Bladeseeker\nThe bladegrounds of Jendal produce some of Faelon\u2019s finest and most dangerous swordsmen.  Before a bladeseeker can advance to the venerated rank of Blademaster he must complete a bladequest.  Bladequests are multi-faceted journeys of personal trial and growth, but are also designed to return experience and lessons back to the bladeschools.  Jendal bladesworn, with their rugged armor and vicious kolekars, often find service as a freeband leader the perfect vehicle to carry them on their bladequests.\nBladeseeker Sculpt\nKaradal Bladesister\nKaradal is charged with shielding Falkaar\u2019s most open border, and the barony\u2019s warriors serve on the front line of the kingdom\u2019s defense.The Karadal bladeschool teaches one of the most direct fighting styles, concerned with striking the killing blow quickly and without wasted motion.The bladesworn of Karadal are cynical about the role of others, feeling they bear the burden of constant border clashes while others only talk of practice floors and mock combat.\nBladesister Sculpt\nKnight Defender\nEach of Falkaar\u2019s Dukes and Barons keeps a cadre of knights in their service.The Knight Defenders are the guardians of the Royal Gate in Baramar and attend the King and Crown Prince directly.Some are sent on detached duty to study foreign armies or the fighting ways of the Tribes.They are highly sought after as freeblades for their skill at arms and ability to stand like a castle tower in a fight.\nKnight Defender Sculpt\nPikeman\nPike-wielding soldiers form the resolute bedrock of Falkaar\u2019s armies.  Many of Falkaar\u2019s young men learned the way of war marching and drilling for their Duke.  Mustered out of their liege\u2019s army, many seek work as freeblades, putting their martial skills to good use.\nPikeman Sculpt\nSailor\nFalkaar is both a maritime and a mercantile nation.Cogs and caravels, cruisers and cargo ships alike need able bodied men and women to serve aboard.Many in Falkaar respond to the call of the sea, even those who are not raised in sight of it.Often the adventures on which freebands find themselves take place off the coast, up rivers or among the islands.Sailors make the perfect addition to a Falkaaran freeband, especially one with a penchant for nautical work.\nSailor Sculpt\nDGS has the pleasure of working with some of the best artistic and sculpting talent in the gaming industry including Gael Goumon, Patrick Keith, and Chris Jackson.  We collaborate with this top caliber talent to bring highly detailed and amazing miniatures to market.  We do not shrink from the cost of top talent because we know it makes for the best products for our customers.  By backing our project you will enable us to continue partnering with this talent to make the best products for which a gamer could ask.\nAll our miniatures are 32mm scale and cast of white metal (lead-free) alloy.  This material creates a high quality durable miniature with exceptional texture and surface for painting brilliant works of art.  Each figure is sold unpainted.\nA word on scale.Our 32mm models are designed to match favorably with what has become known as \u201c28mm heroic scale.\u201dHeroic scale models are not just taller than 28mm, they are also aggressively proportioned with large hands, heads, muscles and weapons.Our models are typically as tall as current \u201c28mm\u201d models, but reflect typical anatomical proportions.Our models compare in scale with those by Reaper and other top manufacturers and are superbly sculpted to allow strong character identification and a fun and rewarding painting surface. Whether used with DGS\u2019s games, in role-playing or any other miniatures experience, our figures will enhance your gaming success.\nThis photo shows one of our models in comparison to a Reaper Miniatures model.\nScale Comparison.

With Freeblades and our miniatures so well received by gamers, we have decided to accelerate our plans to make and release our sixth faction - the Falkaaran Adventurers.

Stylistically the intent is to create a range of miniatures that combine an old school vibe with current sculpting styles.  \nIn order to achieve this goal each monster is designed to look as if it has lived a little.  They collect items, use weapons, and wear armor.  In essence I am looking to create a fantasy range populated by gritty and realistic monsters.\nIf you share this vision of a grittier more realistic world of monsters and men or if you just like the way these miniatures look I would appreciate whatever level of support you are comfortable with.  Thank you for taking the time to get this far!\nBrett Zeleznik\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI have chosen to use Kickstarter to raise the funding to get the production molds completed.  Fractured Dimensions has already raised the money to get the sculpting done and to ge the master molds completed.  Using Kickstarter will alow me to get the miniatures into production as well as expand the range at a faster pace than would otherwise be possible.\nSpecial Thanks\nI would like to give a special thanks to Paul Muller, Bobby Penafiel, Ian Mountain, and Pedro Navarro for all the hard work they put into getting the miniatures and concept sketches finished.  Without the hard work of these people none of this would have been possible.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nTo help with crunching numbers for your miniatures acquisitions, feel free to download this Excel spreadsheet. The two \"Desired Quantities\" columns with the light grey cell backgrounds are where you input what you want. The rest of the cells are automated and locked.\nThese miniatures are only available during this Kickstarter.  They will not be offered again at any point.  Each one is $5.00 individually or you can get he entire set of 9 miniatures for $40.00.  These are available to backers at any level.  To order these just add the correct amount to your pledge level.  There is also a stand alone pledge level that will allow you to get the entire set of miniatures, for $50.00, without getting any of the Demon and Devil miniatures.\nStretch goals will become available to all backers for purchasing as soon as that stretch goals funding level is met.  All miniatures unlocked in stretch goals will be sculpted by Paul Muller.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n    .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n*** Once this level is reached all backers at the Infernal Overlord level will get a FREE 25 POINTS worth of miniatures of their choice. ***\n.\n.\n.\n.\n*** Once this level is reached all backers at the Infernal Overlord level will get a FREE 5 POINTS of miniatures of their choice. ***\n. \n.\n.\n     .\n.\n.\n*** Once this level is reached all backers at the Infernal Overlord level will get a FREE 5 points of miniatures ***  \n.\n.\n.   \n.\n.\n.\n.\n*** Once this level is reached all backers at the Infernal Overlord level will get a FREE 15 points of miniatures of their choice. ***\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nBacker Icons\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nBecause there is the potential for a lot of miniatures to be available in the future International Shipping needs to be specifically addressed.  Basically I can Ship 4 lbs to anywhere in the world for $23.95 and 20 lbs for $59.95. \n   We can do this two ways.\nIf you want to save money on shipping you can wait until everything is done and I can send one package for everything you have ordered.  For example if you have pledged at the $95.00 level you are already paying $10.00 for shipping so as long as the package is under 4 lbs you will only have to pay an additional $13.95.\n\nThe second option is for me to send the stretch goal add-ons in a second package and charge separately for it.  This way you get the initial items faster but you pay will pay more for shipping. \n\n\n\nWhichever option you choose you will only pay the exact amount it costs me to ship it to you. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has some element of risk. We have done everything in our power to minimize this risk, and we've used what we learned last time to reduce that even further. During our first project we experienced a delay of three days and this time we've done everything possible to eliminated that possibility.\n\n There are four phases to this project and each has its own risks and challenges.\n\n The first phase was to come up with the concepts. The challenge is to come up with a miniature that has an old school look but still has a unique style all its own. This has already been completed and you can see for yourself the concept brought to life.\n\n The second phase of this project is to have the miniatures sculpted. The challenge here is to get the miniatures sculpted by the right artists. All the miniatures for the basic pledge levels have already been sculpted so there is no risk associated with this phase of the project. The stretch goals however have not been sculpted and it is always possible that there will be delays in the sculpting process. If this happens please be patient with us as we will get these miniatures sculpted and out to you.\n\n After the second phase is complete we move into the production phase. This phase consists of having master molds and then production molds made. I have this all done by a well respected company who is very good at sticking to deadlines. The challenge hear is to get the items into my hands in time. This risk is mitigated by having a professional third party handle molding and production.\n\n The last phase is the shipment phase. While this is not complex it really just boils down to me packing up all your orders in a timely manner and shipping them to you (with a tracking number). I have been running a small miniature company for about a year and a half. I have experience having miniatures sculpted, produced, and shipped out to buyers.\n\n With Stretch goals this entire process has to be repeated from the beginning. For this Kickstarter this is where the possibility of delays must be highlighted. The stretch goal miniatures are just in the concept phase right now and no sculpting has begun so there is a possibility that there could be delays at this point. I have learned a lot from my previous Kickstarter campaign in which I just recently had to find a new sculptor because of delays with the sculptor I was using. This is a very hard decision to make as it delays the delivery of stretch goals but it is one I am willing to make if it comes down to it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #123", "update_userinfo": "Some updated news", "update_content": "I hope everyone is doing well.\nSome important news not directly related to the Kickstarter project.

So, if you play a Spartan warband lead by a Demigod of Ares, you can fight against a Harbinger of Anubis to control the Aegyptian Underworld!\nMore than anything, WarGods was designed for gamers who enjoy creating a cool story when playing the game, not just winning. The rules reward real tactical play, not rule-breaking gimmicks and unstoppable heroes. The background is a fascinating mixture of real mythology and historical cultures with an innovative fantasy twist. If you've ever watched and enjoyed old adventure films with Greek heroes battling against stop-motion monsters, WarGods of Olympus is the game for you!\nGameplay Demo:\nThanks to the San Diego WarGods players: Narrator: Wade, Camera: Donovan, Spartans: Tony, Anubi: Joe, and thanks to Mike Biel for logo animation.\nAll of our miniatures are hand-crafted in lead-free pewter and provided with plastic slotted base. All miniatures are sold unpainted, unless the reward level description specifically states otherwise.The size of an average human warrior is around 30mm scale.  The Trojans, Spartans, and Mycenaeans all have a September 2013 ship date. Amazons are expected to ship in October 2013.\nHow to order miniatures:\nOn the right side of the page are our reward levels. Simply select the reward that has the assortment of miniatures that is right for you, and pledge to that level. At the end of the program, we\u2019ll send you a survey where you'll be able to tell us what faction you want, as well as some specific requests like shield options, etc.\nAll 6 factions have now been unlocked: Spartans, Mycenaeans, and Trojans (all shipping in September) Amazons (shipping October), Corinthians and Athenians (shipping July 2014). Each of these factions has the following packs of miniatures available in the reward options:\nWarband Starter Set: a box set containing 1 Phalanx of 12 spearmen, 1 Herald with standard, 1 Musician, 2 Honor Guards, and a king (Amazons get Penthesilea, Trojans receive Aeneas, Spartans receive Tychedes, and Mycenaeans receive Agamemnon.) \nPhalanx: 12 warriors armed with spears and shields. The miniatures of this unit are posed with a front rank, middle rank, and rear rank, with the spears of each rank held at a slightly higher angle.  This ensures that the models don't bump into each other when placed in formation, and creates a cool cascading 'wave' effect when viewed as a complete unit.\nSwordsmen: 10 warriors armed with swords and shields.\nArchers: 10 miniatures - 9 Archers armed with bows and a Captain.\nPeltasts: 10 miniatures - 9 Skirmishers armed with swords, javelins, and small shields, and a Captain.\nHero: with Armor Rack (a small extra miniature that can be used as scenery or as a game objective.)\nCaptain: with Casualty (a small extra miniature that can be used as scenery or as a game objective.)\nEach unit will contain a number of different poses, usually 3 or 4, but sometimes more for the Phalanxes.  We like our units to have lots of variation! \nThe Demigod is the leader of your warband. Each Demigod has a selection of 10 different powers -- for example, Hades can command the dead and summon a monstrous 3-headed hound to protect him, Poseidon can control the creatures of the deep and cause the earth to shake and stun his enemies, Hecate can call upon dark magics and the powers of the night, and so on.  Choose the Demigod you like best to command your warband.\nEach Demigod miniature is supplied with a 25mm square plastic base, and is about 35mm tall (on average.)  We've designed them to be just a little taller than 'mortals', to help convey their supernatural power!  The Demigod miniatures are available individually or as a complete set, so choose the reward level that works best for you.  At the end of the program we'll send out a survey where you can specify which miniatures you want.\nAll of the Demigod miniatures were sculpted by Chris FitzPatrick, based on concept art by Des Hanley. Actual sculptures may vary from concept art; we'll update the images as the sculptures are completed. Click on the images below to see larger versions!\nThe Amazons have been unlocked! Amazons are available in the same troop options listed under the Trojans below.  All Amazon rewards have an estimated delivery date of October 2013.\nThe Amazons are the legendary women warriors of northern Hellas. They are allies to the Trojans, and bitter enemies of the most other city-states. We've designed our amazons to look dangerous - these are not cheesecake pinup girls, but deadly, cruel warriors who mean business! To read an excerpt from the upcoming rulebook detailing the culture of the Amazons, click on the following link:\nhttps://www.crocodilegames.com/docs/Rules/ExcerptAmazons.pdf\nHere's a preview of some of the Amazon miniatures to come:\nNote: The Amazon Hero actually comes with a square base.\nConcept art for the Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons, by Des Hanley.\nThe Trojans are the legendary warriors of Homer's The Iliad, who fought a long and tragic war against the united Greek city-states. Our Trojan miniatures were designed to have a mysterious, eastern feel, with a nod to historical Bronze Age armor, weapons and imagery but realized with a dramatic Hollywood flair. Each Trojan miniature is around 30mm scale, and is supplied with a 20mm square plastic base. \nBelow is a complete listing of the Trojan miniatures that are available as reward options, planned for release in September 2013:\nAeneas and Trojan Honor Guard concepts by Des Hanley.\nTrojan Add-Ons now Available:\nSample miniatures painted by Debs FitzPatrick. All miniatures supplied unpainted.\nThe Corinthians have now been unlocked, and will ship to backers in July 2014.

We've already released the rules and background for the Spartans, Mycenaeans, & Titans. These are detailed in our webzine, Croc Tales, and you can download your free copies here:\n\nhttp://www.crocodilegames.com/crocTales.cfm\n\nSpartans and Titans are in Croc Tales 7, Minotaurs and Satyrs are in Croc Tales 6, Titans are in Croc Tales 2\nHow do I get Add-Ons?\nKickstarter only allows 1 reward level per backer, so if there is something you would like to get in addition to your reward, you can include Add-Ons.  Simply increase the actual dollar amount of your pledge level by the value of the Add-On - once you submit the page, Kickstarter will take you to Amazon's checkout to authorize the payment. You can change your pledge value any time before the end of the project. No payment will be taken until the project is funded on June 30th.\nOne of our backers made a pledge calculator to help figure out the total cost of add-ons. Thanks Marker for all your hard work! \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApiJCtUbRUsPdG1VaXRTTDNWakJGY09YTkhQZEo4VlE#gid=0\nAt the end of the program, we'll send you a survey where you'll be able to specify the particular Add-Ons you want.\nThere is no extra charge for shipping Add-Ons unless stated next to the price.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMiniature battle games require a huge amount of effort to get right.

OR for throwing at your RPG Game Master, punish an abusive character, or waking up that sleeper in the corner! This is a FULL set (the only foam set with d6 and [stretch goal] Ten's d10 being included at one low price) of large soft foam polyhedral dice.\nThese soft foam dice are great for many uses. From your spawn's first set of dice (ages 3+), to helping the hard of sight old fart DM see the numbers, to educational uses (yeah I said that), to just throwing them at your Game Master!\nThe basic set will include six dice, 1 of each of these 2\" (tall) foam dice:\n4 sided die (1-4)\n6 sided die (1-6) (numbers not pips)\n8 sided die (1-8)\n10 sided die (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)\n12 sided die (1-12)\n20 sided die (1-20)\n\nThese dice are just the right size to fit in your fist and they are squishy too! Fondle them without shame. Roll them and knock over miniatures without remorse. Best of all the 4 sided die doesn't hurt when you step on it!\nIf you want two rewards, you can just add the total of the other reward to your pledge.\n.\nNOTE: The dice shown in the video are very similar dice but not the actual dice we are making. They are only shown for demonstrational purposes.\nThe final color of these dice will be done all in DEEP PURPLE with white lettering- unless we reach the stretch goals that allow voting. The font will change to something more stylish but very readable.\nThese dice are made of non-toxic Polyurethane and then tampo printed (stamped) for long lasting markings. Child safe (if they don't eat them!), Cat friendly, and recommended for ages 3+\nFor a video demo of rolling the dice: http://youtu.be/YMLuz2h27Rg\nPrototypes from the factory:\nThe dice will come packaged in a plastic bag with a printed cardboard hang top.\n.\nNOTICE: Add-Ons can be only added non-EU and non ESSEN orders as we do not have these extra items in the EU to ship them and would cost an extra shipping charge. If you still want them, you can pay for an International shipping charge instead of EU to get them there. We can probably stick a bag into a first class envelope to get to you though. So again, NO LOOSE DICE will be shipped to the EU.\nTo buy any item off the ala-carte menu you simply need to modify your pledge to add the dollars listed to your total pledge amount, but leave your reward set to the original reward. After the campaign finishes, we'll use a system called BACKERKIT to allow you to spend your over pledged amount in a cart like checkout system.\nRETAILERS: We encourage backers to name a local store in their area they would like to pick up their dice from instead of having them mailed. These dice will also be available in distribution later this year but you'll be the first to get them if you back us here.\nWe will include a 7th die for FREE with ALL sets!

Well we include 7 dice instead of 5 for the same price. LR doesn't include a d6 die! Ours will be a bit smaller and all the same color so they look less like kids toys. Ours is sold in normal distribution channels so they don't have to special order. We have more/different colors and FUDGE dice for all your collector customers!

Not the jackpot, \"just\" a thousand bucks, and being a typical middle-class middle-manager a thousand dollars is nice, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't going to change my life.  So I decided to do something special with the money.  I decided I wanted to spend it to bring something that would last;  I would spend it to try and bring Jack Chick's epic 1984 graphic novel / tract to film.\nI wrote Chick Publications explaining this to them and I'm super-excited to announce that I have obtained the video rights to make a movie based on Dark Dungeons.\nDark Dungeons: The Movie\nIf you're not familiar with Dark Dungeons you can read it in its entirety here;\nDARK DUNGEONS:  THE COMIC\nBut all you really need to know is that it sets out to show what Jack Chick knows to be the truth behind role-playing.  It shows that;\n*Playing RPGs can make you gain real life magic abilities\n*If you gain a high enough level you will be invited to join a secret cult\n* Gamers whose characters die are in danger of committing suicide. \n* That DM's are vile temptresses that are out to corrupt their players to the forces of evil. \nGiven all those startling claims it's amazing that the crusade against RPG's has not been more successful!  In fact, the last movie to crusade against D&D was Tom Hank's 1982 classic, \"Mazes and Monsters.\"\nWe are going change all that. I'm already investing all of my lottery winnings in this project but it's just not enough to get it filmed and that's where you come in. \nIf the idea of seeing a movie where all the anti-RPG arguments above are made with every last drop of drama and conviction I can wring out them appeals to you, then I want you to invest today and make this movie a reality. \nPlease check out the video above to see what we are capable of and remember that you are only charged if we meet our funding goal.  If the project does not receive it's complete funding you are charged ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! \nNEW REWARD:  Backers of every level will receive their name on the movie credits if they wish.  Size of that name depends upon level of backage.\n______________________________________________________\nUPDATE: I am thrilled to announce a partnership myself and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment (makers of The Gamers and Journey Quest)!!!\nOur mission is to combine our powers to develop, produce, and distribute Dark Dungeons: The Movie!\nZombie Orpheus will be working through multiple versions of the script until we get the story that we know needs to be told and will be providing directing, filming, and acting talent as well!\nJust think what ZOE can do with the Dark Dungeons story!\nPlease spread the word about this partnership, as I know that together with ZOE we can all make the movie that you want to see.\n____________________________________________________\nUpdate:\nWE are funded! Dark Dungeons: The Movie! is now going to be made. I want to give a big thanks to all our backers out there who shared my dream to bring this to life.\nBut there is no resting on our laurels as it's time to announce some stretch goals:\nStretch Goal #1: $18,500 - the Necronomicon and Cthulhu mythos are all too real, according to Jack Chick's website, so if we reach our first stretch goal I will be glad to expose the Cthulhu threat in Dark Dungeons the Movie!\nStretch Goal #2: $21,000 - One of the most powerful ways to get across the powerful emotions that a serious drama like this raises is through song. I'd like to include a dream sequence where Debbie visualizes her internal struggle through verse:\n(Debbie, in a sad, thoughtful singsong:)\n\"Is this God in my hand, or is it just a d4?\nOh can anyone tell me what I'm rolling for?\nAre there traps and daggers, magic missiles galore?\nNo, this ain't God in my hand, it is just a d4.\"\n(Ms Frost, cackling:)\n\"You have mastered the magic, you have mastered the spell,\nYou are ready to unleash the powers of hell!\nYou have God in your hand, and you have your d4.\"\nNow I hope that you know what you're rolling for.\"\nStretch Goal # 3: $25,000 - Dark Dungeons the Movie! is a fictionalized account of the oh-so-very-real dangers of Role-playing but we would like to include a short documentary on the DVD about the fearless crusaders who have stood up to \"Big Gaming\" in the 1980s and find out why the crusade did not enjoy more success and where it stands today.\n__________________________________", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am the best person to make this project work because I am the only person who CAN make this project work. There is no guarantee that Jack Chick will allow anyone else to make a movie based on his work in the future either. He might, but he might not. But I have the right to make a movie about Dark Dungeons right now and I have the ability to make this happen. The time is now. The place is here. The power is mine. \n\nThe quality of the movie will probably be very similar to that of my introductory video; that's the best we can do with what we have. So please take a look at that to judge what type of movie we are capable of making. \n\nThe fact is, we are going at this with an ultra-low budget and that makes things incredibly harder. When the million and one things go wrong I won\u2019t be able to throw money at the problem but will have to improvise as best I can. I also will be making the plot fit the budget, rather than the other way around. This includes simple things like not setting any scenes at night (lighting can be expensive and time consuming), no large crowd scenes (more people mean more complexity means more money), and showing puppet demons fleeing Debbie instead of using CGI demons. \n\nBut I feel that the epic story of a girl who wants to be Debbie instead of Elfstar deserves to see the light of video and will put all my time, energy, and love into making this film and will do everything it takes to get it done.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "From the Makers of Dark Dungeons - New JourneyQuest!", "update_content": "Hi Dark Dungeoneers! \n Once again, thank you so much for making the Dark Dungeons the movie exist.

We've always wanted to make the process of editing your campaign pages much more organic and natural, and now we have the chance. Watch the video for a quick demo of what we mean by \"natural editing\"\nThere are some significant technical challenges here, which is why the stretch goal is so aggressive. I still think we can hit it, especially as we approach the final push that most Kickstarters get.\nAs with the other stretch goals, this will be a post-reforging target. My best estimate right now is that we can launch this sometime in December of 2013. I wish I could promise it sooner, but this gets to the very core of Obsidian Portal and I don't want to under-emphasize the difficulty.\nMega Stretch Goal - Extra Month at $75,000\nFor every $10k we raise over the initial goal, we will be able to extend the premium Ascendant time for every backer (Hasted Ascendant and above) by 1 month. We've already achieved 6 extra months! So get out there and tell your friends. The more backers we bring in, the more Ascendant time everyone gets!\nShe can't take much more, captain!\nUpdate - Additional Years Available\nBy popular demand, we're offering additional years as an add-on purchase. Simply pledge an additional $35 on top of your chosen backer level for each additional year you want. More details and examples down below the backer levels.\nStretch Goal #4 - Custom Campaign URLs - $50,000 - ACHIEVED\nPart of the reforging is an overhaul to make things look better, so we think everyone would like to make their page URLs look nicer as well. Every campaign will get its own subdomain (ie. \u201cmycampaign.obsidianportal.com\u201d) and Ascendant campaigns can set up their own raw domain (ie. \u201cmycampaign.com\u201d).\nThere will be significant technical challenges with this stretch goal, both in making sure that old URLs do not break and also making sure that all your old links to characters, wiki pages, items, and so forth automatically redirect to your new custom campaign URL. We don\u2019t want to underestimate the difficulty here, so as with our File Storage stretch goal, we\u2019re shooting to complete this stretch goal after the main reforging process. Our target date for the custom URLs would be mid-October 2013.\nStretch Goal #3 - File Storage Locker - $35,000 - ACHIEVED!\nWe\u2019ve always wanted to expand our image upload to include files of any type. Every campaign has files they need to share, like PDFs of your world\u2019s history or MP3s of your campaign theme music. If we hit this stretch goal we can add a spot in every campaign to store and manage all your shared files, so it\u2019s easier to keep all your campaign materials in one place.\nPlus, if we can hit this stretch goal, we will be able to increase the storage size limits for both free and Ascendant campaigns. The free limit will climb to 250MB and the Ascendant limit will rise to 10GB. That should be plenty of space to share everything your group needs.\nNote: For this and all future stretch goals, we are targeting a post-August release date. We will do our best to get as much completed as we can by August, but we want to be realistic and open about our timelines. For the file storage locker, we\u2019re aiming for sometime in September.\nStretch Goal #2 - Names! Names! Names! - $20,000 - ACHIEVED!\nSince the beginning, I've wanted a good, solid random name generator as part of the character creation and management. So many times I've been staring at my players, mouth hanging open, waiting for a name to come out. They had asked about an NPC I hadn't prepared, and I just needed a name. Here, let me explain:\nSo what are the particulars of the name generator?\nA variety of different naming \"genres\". You'll be able to quickly switch between Elven-ish, Dwarven, guttural Ork (think lots of Ks and Xs), and so forth.\nFast! - It will be right there when you need it, ready to give you the name you need and keep your players in the game.\nIntegrated - Instead of just spitting a name at you, you'll be able to create a new barebones character on the fly with the name pre-generated. So, when your players ask about that random new NPC 3 months later, they will be tracked normally in Obsidian Portal, just like all your other characters.\n\nStretch Goal #1 - Reworking the Maps - $10,000 - ACHIEVED\nThe campaign maps have been one of our favorite features since the beginning, but just like everything else, they need some work to make them better! If we hit this goal, we will be able to make the following improvements:\nDeeper zoom levels for Ascendant maps - 5 instead of the current 3\nHigher resolution images - 4096x4096 pixels instead of the current 1024x1024\nA library of map markers - Different colors and shapes. Imagine dropping crossed swords to mark a battle, a tower to mark a wizard's abode, and a cave for...a cave. That's the idea.\nBetter connection with the rest of your campaign - Add markers for specific characters and/or wiki pages, instead of only the general purpose markers we have now.\nThe maps are already fun. Now let's reforge them into something truly useful and awesome!\nObsidian Portal Reforged\nObsidian Portal is the award-winning online campaign management system for tabletop role-playing games. We want to revitalize the existing Obsidian Portal by increasing its functionality, adding new features, and cleaning up the design. We are taking the strong core that is Obsidian Portal, heating it up in the furnace, and reforming it into a sleeker and sharper tool. A better Obsidian Portal will make your life easier as a game master, which will make your game the best it can be. That\u2019s what \u201creforging\u201d is all about.\nImprovements\nTo provide you with the best possible experience, we\u2019ll revamp the most frequently used parts of the site and rework them so that they\u2019re easier to use. We will be examining every page for ways to make them flow better, provide the information you need, and allow you to navigate and manage your campaign faster and easier. The redesign will add more features to enhance your gaming.\nA perfect example of this is our plan to create a campaign dashboard that will put the most important details of your campaign right at your fingertips. The dashboard is just the first of many changes that will fundamentally enhance Obsidian Portal and make it a much better tool than it is today.\nA very rough draft of the new dashboard\nWe\u2019ll be supporting these functional changes by improving the overall design of the site. We\u2019ll take our current site and give it a consistent look and feel that will make it more intuitive to use\u2014not a button here and a link there, but a cohesive design strategy.\nWith more of your support, there\u2019s even more we can do to make Obsidian Portal the most robust campaign management system. If we make our original goal, keep an eye out for stretch goals for additional improvements.\nBack us now and get a year of premium Ascendant membership at a reduced price when you back at the Ascendant level.\nWhy Obsidian Portal?\nIt\u2019s free to use and built from the ground up, for gamers by gamers. We host a huge community of tabletop RPG players who are all looking to get the most out of their tabletop gaming experience. You play your campaign and we help you manage it. It\u2019s that simple.\nWith Obsidian Portal, you can manage your tabletop RPG campaign from any computer, anywhere. You can tell your story and get recognized for your innovation and creativity. Now help us take Obsidian Portal to the next level!\nBenefits to Backers\nA year of premium Ascendant membership (Hasted Ascendant level and above). Not a GM yourself? No worries, the Ascendant time can be gifted to your GM!\nCool backer-only souvenirs like campaign maps, custom map markers, profile badges, t-shirts, letterpress cards, and more\nThe opportunity to have a hand in the reforging process. All backers will receive developer updates along the way for an exclusive look at the design process. Plus, Tinkerer Ascendant level and above will be able to provide feedback during the design and beta testing.\nA slicker, more useful, easier to navigate Obsidian Portal. A better Obsidian Portal will make your life easier as a game master and improve your game.\n\nMy Backstory\nWhen I started Obsidian Portal in 2006, I knew I needed to set aside some real time and focus hard to make progress. To accomplish this, I quit playing video games altogether and told myself I wouldn't play again until the site launched. If you're a gamer like me, then you know how hard that is, and also how much time that can free up. I accomplished some amazing things in those first 9 months, and it's thanks to that dedication that Obsidian Portal is where it's at now.\nFast forward to now. Over the summer, I have the chance to focus on Obsidian Portal almost full time. Plus, I have a team of designers and programmers lined up to help out. So, in the spirit of what it took to launch, I'm once again swearing off video games and putting my nose to the grindstone. It will be a hot and sweaty summer, but by GenCon in August we will have some awesome progress to show for it!\nYou've seen what I can do by myself on nights and weekends. Now let me show you how awesome we can be with a real team working near full time!\nBacker Level Details\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n\nExample of the finished postcard thank you\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time (a 20% discount off the normal price of $39.99/yr) - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time (a 12.5% discount off the normal price of $39.99/yr) - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\nEarly access to the beta server to play with the updates and new features as they are developed.\nA handmade letterpress card inviting you to the beta program.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\nEarly access to the beta server to play with the updates and new features as they are developed.\nA handmade letterpress card inviting you to the beta program.\nA custom video made by the talented Mikhail Twarogowski, who composed our Kickstarter video for us.

Also, having two stages allows us to cater to two different markets, the DIYers that like to paint and the guys that want it ready to play out of the box!\nTags :: Kraken, Firbolg Skeleton, Peryton, Mermaid, Massive Tentacle, Botanimoth, Unpainted, Painted, 4 packs, Available, Funded, Achieved.\nNAT = Unpainted, PPM = Production Paint,\n& KSX = Kickstarter Exclusive.\nDon't want to use our crazy bases? The KS figure bases are removable from the figure.\nOur Supporters are important to us, and we are determined to prove it whether through private messages, comments, or simply by having a campaign with customization features & rewards for everyone interested in minis.\nBelow is a chart revealing our Stretch Plan for this campaign. Highlighted cells are a quick guide to pricing multiples of miniatures that have been achieved in this campaign.\nClick here for more details.\nClick here for a visual representation of what is available.\nIf you want to back us and aren't sure what level is the sweet spot for minis & rewards - right now it's Deep Sea Crew - start there!

Easy as pie. :)\nTags :: Pledge Levels, Bedrock, Canopy, NPC, Pre-Gen, Skeleton Crew, Wrecking Crew, Deep Sea Crew, Full Crew, Fire Spark, Rainbow Road, Thunder Bolt, Cloud Nine, Netherworld, Sky High, Pandemonium, Moon Beam.\nNAT = Unpainted,  PPM = Production Paint,\n& KSX = Kickstarter Exclusive. \nSee the galleries for our Master Painters Ben Riegler & Karl Kura .\n.\nLooking for 1 of Every Mini? \nPledge Rainbow Road, $75 Gets you 1 Painted Kraken (your choice paint) with matching Massive Tentacle & 1 Mermaid (your choice paint). Then ADD- ON $5 for 1 Peryton (your choice paint) & $9 for 1 Painted Skeleton (your choice paint). .. Total Pledge, without shipping, is $89.\nFor folks that want more than one or want to include additional items in their pledge (excludes pledge levels), simply add the prices of the items shown in images to eligible pledge levels! \nFor example: If you want a medium sized Kraken Tentacle [listed for $3 in existing DCMs], added it to your Thunder Bolt pledge level [listed in the pledge guide for $90] you would enter the total for your pledge as $93.00 [in KickStarter/Amazon]. If you are outside the US please add on an additional $15 to your total.\nAnd at the end of the campaign we will send everyone a email to the survey link, and use the Kickstarter survey for final confirmation of addresses for your orders.\nTags :: Combat Counters, Combat Clips, Vampire Bases, Collector Coins, T-Shirts, Blackbyrne Wicked Tooth Pathfinder Module, Labyrinth Signed Card, Sea Dragon Ship, Kraken Tentacle Repaint\nPlease see Image above for more details.\nCombat Counters can be used to track which monster is which, to track damage, to countdown as a timer, to track psionic points, or any thing else based on numbers.  \nThere are 4 colored number dials (0-9) that come in groups of 8 with 16 pegs.\nPlease see Image above for more details.\nPacks of Combat Clips contain the following (1 of each):  \nA Flag, \nA Banner,\nA Torch, \nA Hovering Sphere, \nThey can be used to: track light sources, statuses, or allegiances on the battle mat.  All four come painted. The banners come painted as canvas, ready to be customized by you.\nPlease see Image above for more details.\nWe can now offer Blank DCM Bases thanks to the efforts of 20 special people (many thanks)!  We have Small, 1x1, 2x1, 2x2 & 3x3 10 packs available.\nYou can add-on any of the 10 packs below or add-on our special Vampire Bundle for $50. The Vampire Bundle has twenty three 1x1 ten pack bases, two 2x2 ten pack bases and one 3x3 ten pack bases for a total of 260 bases (more than enough for a good start). \nPlease see Image above for more details.\nThis set of 3 quarter-sized metal coins comes in Dwarven, Elven and Keldornan!  \nThe old Keldornan Eagles are simple pressed gold measured by the metals weight alone.  \nThe Gold Dwarves of Stonehold use uniquely squared coins called Durgots passed down throughout generations of Dwarven history.  \nCurrency is a concept foreign to Elves. They have difficulty finding value in \"precious metals\" that are not formed in to works of art. The Alliance introduced the Stags as currency to the Elves of the Sylvan Lands to strengthen the bond that the Alliance formed between the Elves, Dwarfs, and Humans, honouring this custom and thus further opening trade routes.  \nThis item is automatically included in some pledge levels. It can ONLY be added-on to \"Deep Sea Crew\" & \"Full Crew\" pledge levels for $10.\nWorking Title: \n\"JAGGED ROAD TO WICKED TOOTH\" \nThis Pathfinder module is designed to take adventurers from level 1 to level 4 on a wild ride through parts of Ara (the Dungeon Crawler world).\nIt has campaign specific rules, for those that are interested, or it can be played with standard Pathfinder rules. It will contain maps, play mats, art from the DC world, as well as, Pre-Generated Characters & Non-Player Characters, NPCs, (which our backers can pledge to make)! \nLimited to 1 copy per pledge. \nWant to get all the special items, check out THUNDER BOLT & CLOUD NINE pledge levels.\nThis card doubles as a card of authenticity AND as a Dungeon Crawler Labyrinth Encounter Card! \nIt will be signed by Jey Legarie and uniquely numbered. Limit of 1 per pledge. \nCheck out DC Labyrinth here.\nThat's Us! We are just 2 people not afraid of hard work, doing what we love, making games and meeting people. We have been successful as a Mom & Pop Shop in our business ventures, manufacturing products for the Dungeon Crawler Universe.\nWe are pretty new to the miniatures industry, as our first miniatures came out in late 2011 early 2012. Up until the now the manufacturing of our miniatures have been funded by 3rd party licencing. \nWe did this because we are Plasti-Addicts, and our favorite is Pre-painted. We've been collecting pre-painted minis (PPMs) since 2003, we have a very good idea of what is already in collector's hands. \nWe invite you to enjoy your Dungeon Crawler minis (DCMs) in your favorite campaign setting or ours, let your imaginations run wild, after all, that's what table-top gaming is all about! Or you can choose to add them to your Kickstarter Pledge, these and the card game are Add-on items ONLY.\nDon't want to wait, order some now.\nRead our ECG reviews here.\nDesigned to play in Story Mode, but expands to support 2-6 players.\nEverything will ship together or will be split in to as few stages as necessary (but, we will keep you abreast of all situations).  Shipping is included for continental USA backers, and International backers add $15 to their pledges depending on their reward level.\n*Note that we do not usually ship to Italy or Argentina.  We are willing to ship to Italy and Argentina for our KS and will provide a confirmation # as usual, but if the package goes missing we will not be sending replacements.  Our only other alternative is to not include these countries in our campaign.\nOH, CANADA!\nWe're a Canadian based company and we're in the tight spot of counting Canada as an \"international\" country because of KS settings.  So, for those Canadians that back us, we're going to offer you a $10 credit at the end of the campaign which you can use towards anything that this campaign is directly responsible for funding. So, this will not include; the ECG, From the Depths, Omens or Town Folk.  This will be in exchange for you having to cover the shipping costs of being \"international\" while just being over the border from our US-based fulfillment house.\nFor more information on Canadian Shipping, Kickbacks, Loyalty, & Refer-A-Friend credits click here.\nClick here for more details about the Pandemonium Guarantee.\n.    \nClick here to see more badges\nYou can place badges your signatures on forums or emails, put them as your avatars, and basically whenever you can - link to this campaign. \nWe are an Indie company and we know how hard it is to work to fulfill your dream, so we are proud to support other indie companies!\nFind Us\nKeep Tabs on Us & Share Your Stories With Us with Social Media.\nclick\nNow, let's get Krak'n!  ;)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDepending on the size of the order we place, the delivery date may be delayed.

It has to be remade by people who love it and the Kickstarter campaign for War For The Overworld is the campaign to support if you want to see Dungeon Keeper back.\" - Peter Molyneux, Creative Director at 22 Cans and Creator of Dungeon Keeper\n\u201cWar for the Overworld is shaping up to be a great God Game that brings back fond memories of both creating and playing Dungeon Keeper 2. I wish the team the best of British in bringing their creation to life.\u201d \u2013 David Amor, Chief Creative Officer at Relentless, ex-Bullfrog Productions\n\"I am quivering with demonic anticipation at the thought of helping to bring War For The Overworld to fetid fruition, taking over where Dungeon Keeper left off - this will be the last word in evil. Mwuahahaha!\" - Rich Ridings\n\"It's scandalous that nobody has yet managed to create a game that captures the spirit of the original Dungeon Keeper. Scandalous! I have high hopes that War for the Overworld will correct this, and give fans something that will make them happy. Can I have my free copy now?\" \u2013 Simon Carter, project lead on Dungeon Keeper and freebie whore \n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see some fresh blood taking up the wicked mantle and spreading such evil fun once more. Very best of luck chaps!\u201d \u2013 Mike Man, Creative Director at Vostopia, ex-Bullfrog Productions Lead Artist\n\"I'm incredibly excited about War for the Overworld! It looks like we will finally get the sequel we've been waiting for!\"\u2013 Simon Roth, creator of Maia\n\"It looks good. They seem to have gotten the feel right...they seem to have gotten the aesthetic right [...] Might very well be worth a backing.\" -Totalbiscuit, The Cynical Brit, December 22, 2012\n\"While an official Dungeon Keeper sequel seems unlikely, next year fans could have the next best thing - a game heavily inspired by the Bullfrog classic built by some of its biggest fans.\" \u2013 Wesley Yin-Poole, Eurogamer, November 29th\n\"For any fan of Dungeon Keeper this is definitely a lot to take in. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s almost emotional for you as you realise you can finally massacre those self righteous goody-two-shoe heroes once more.\" \u2013 Thomas Mattingly, Indie Statik, November 29th\n\"Subterranean Games clearly know their stuff \u2013 and War for the Overworld sounds like a Dungeon Keeper game made by Dungeon Keeper fans.\" \u2013 Jamie Donnelly, BeefJack, November 14th\nIn War for the Overworld you have the power to create vast dungeons filled with hordes of evil minions who share a common goal: to crush the bones of the goodly heroes that dare to enter your unhallowed halls. You will command mighty armies, create vicious traps and cast dastardly spells to overcome the pitifully gallant armies that defend foolish principles such as \"honour\" and \"righteousness\" \u2014 it's going to be more fun than taking candy from a baby... \nWhile defeating these dungeon crawlers will be remarkable fun, it will provide only fleeting satisfaction. Fortunately, there is a much larger enemy that stands between you and dominance of the Overworld.\nThere is no correct way to build a dungeon; however you will quickly learn what suits your unique style in War for the Overworld. Each level opens up as a blank slate and it is up to you and your scaled hand to carve out the world as you best see fit. Because there is no set \u201clevel\u201d upon which you play you will have to choose where to dig, fortify, and build the whatever your depraved mind can imagine \u2014 whether it is a vast dungeon filled with cavernous rooms or a series of winding hallways that stretch off far into the unknown depths is up to you.\nDo you prefer to crash through your enemy's front door with a swarming army, or is subterfuge your game? All game decisions happen in real time whether you're building your dungeon, training your army, issuing orders to your minions or tapping into more primal powers to cast spells upon your foes.\nAs an Underlord you have the power to call down terrifying spells to wreak havoc and misery upon your foes. Of course there are spells that augment your already formidable creatures in battle. In addition to spells, some of your minions have begun to dabble in the occult and have found many sinful rituals that will influence the entire battlefield. These rituals require many ingredients, and no doubt sacrifice will be involved to make the nastier ones possible.\nEntice wicked and devious creatures to your dungeon through Gateways. Keep them in your service by fulfilling their basest desires and they shall eagerly fight for you. Your minions will autonomously work in the rooms of your dungeon that are best suited to their skills \u2014 for a price. Some minions require little more than food, but those intelligent enough to perform skilled labour in your dungeon will require pay \u2014 make sure to keep your coffers full and you'll have an army in no time!\nWith dozens of unique rooms to choose from you can create an underground metropolis for your fearful denizens. Each room has a distinct purpose that will draw new minions to your dungeon and provide you with additional utilities.\nFortify your domain by placing various doors throughout the dank halls of your dungeon to control enemy movement, or catch unsuspecting trespassers with your murderously designed traps. If you're the kind of player who likes to hide behind static defenses then this vein of evil is right up your well-defended alley.\nWithin the depths of this realm exist ancient shrines of immense power that are but a murmur of the ancient forces that used to walk this realm. These powerful bastions of magic will grant boons to your creatures and spells, or weaken those of your enemies. Make sure to keep these shrines defended for their arcane powers only remain yours as long as you control them.\nResearch and unlock spells, rooms, and traps in each level in a way that best complements your play style. In the Archives your minions will research the three veins of evil (Sloth, Greed, and Wrath) to grant you the rooms, traps, and spells that you want to play with.\nThe initial campaign will include the first chapter of the single-player experience where you face off against the righteous Emperor Stockington and the vast armies of his Sterling Empire. His mighty generals have been called to a war council in the capital of Socksford in preparation for war... how delightfully charming. Further chapters of the campaign and plans for additional story features will be revealed soon!\nIn Multiplayer you will finally prove once and for all who is the best of the worst amongst you. With dozens of customizable settings, you and as many of your friends as you want can battle in unranked free-for-all battle and team matches.\nWith the power of the developers in your hands you have the potential to realize your fiendish desires. In this mode almost anything is possible. Whether you want to craft labyrinths with increasingly difficult hazards for sport (bookie not included), or build a massive dungeon for your creatures to roam is up to you as you command the very rocks of the Underworld in Sandbox mode.\nWhat you see on our Kickstarter page was created by us over the past few months. Every member of our team has dedicated their free time to work on this project while also holding down full-time jobs. By helping us reach our initial goal you will allow us to work on this project full time long enough to complete the game (in addition to helping us pay for expensive software licenses (Unity, Maya, etc), hire voice actors, pay server costs and other small expenses that crop up during development [coffee]).\nOn behalf of every member of the team \u2014 thank you for your support!\nSpending breakdown:\nCommunication is vitally important to us, and we suspect you feel the same way. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible on our end. So far we\u2019ve done our best to update our page with additional information that was either unlisted or hard to find. We are almost certain that by going through this page and our website your questions have will be answered. If you still have questions please get in touch with us  \u2014 we will resolve any questions you might have within 24 hours.\nBuilding off of our dedication to open communication we have set firm release dates for our Bedrock Beta (March 30, 2013) and base game (August 30, 2013).\nWe\u2019ve done this to ensure that YOU know exactly what to expect from our campaign and when to expect the game \u2014 instead of a broad \u201cin X year\u201d or the dreaded \u201cwhen it\u2019s ready\u201d  \u2014 we don\u2019t want you to guess when you\u2019ll get the game.\nOur Kickstarter video was narrated by the phenomenally talented actor Richard Ridings. We believe there is no one better to voice your actions in War for the Overworld. If you help us reach \u00a3225,000 we will be able to hire him on as the narrator for the entire game and pay for studio costs associated with his recording. After we reach this goal, we will move on to our Flex Goal system.\nWe sat down and discussed the best way to allow our crowdfunded project to best reflect the desires of the people who were backing it. Since the idea of predetermined additional features did not sit well with us we took the existing paradigm of Stretch Goals and improved upon it. We settled on the idea of Flex Goals \u2014 which allow you to choose which additional features you want added to the game.\nFor every \u00a375,000, there will be a Flex Goal unlock.  After our campaign ends, all supporters will be able to vote on which features they want added to the game through our backer-exclusive website. These features are extensions and will be developed after the base game has been completed.  We anticipate each will take no longer than four months to implement (with some features being far easier to implement). We will continue to add Flex Goals to the game until we run out of funding. In-depth explanations of Flex Goals are coming soon!\nMatchmaking & Ranking: We will implement more advanced skirmish matchmaking, ranked ladders, and player statistics for a fully featured and competitive multiplayer experience.\n2 Lords 1 Dungeon: Two Underlords will be able to cooperate in the same Dungeon.\nController Interface: We will develop a controller friendly interface which will allow us to support Ouya & Steam Big Picture, and possibly the Xbox Live Arcade & PlayStation Network.\nHero Mode: Control an advanced hero (additional spells and leveling system) in a dynamically changing dungeon crawler.\nExtended Underlord Campaign: We will add additional chapters to the Underlord campaign.\nEmpire Campaign: Play as the Empire and battle a series of Underlords in a full-length campaign.\nCo-op Campaign: Team up and take on the Empire with your friends in a specially designed campaign chapter.\nCompetitive Campaign: Assume the role of an Underlord or the Empire and fight one another in a full-length versus campaign chapter.\nArcade Campaign: The moderately insane Underlord Eccentrious has given you some...interesting tasks in order to gain his favour including Golf, Dodgeball, Whack-A-Dwarf, Tag & more.\nThe Adventures of Stumpy the Imp: Take control of Stumpy the Imp as he ventures through a full-length first person campaign throughout the Underworld.\nSurvival Mode: A co-op survival mode where you and your friends must build an impenetrable fortress to fend off ever increasingly difficult waves of enemies - who can survive the longest against this onslaught?\nUnderworld MOBA: A MOBA multiplayer map with advanced versions of our units enhanced for an action packed experience.\nClick here to view our NEXUS page!\nAlmost everyone on the team has modded a game at one time or another and we want to give you the power to easily mod War for the Overworld. \nBecause of this we've created an editing tool that we call Dungeoneer. This tool will allow you to create your own maps and campaigns in addition to implementing custom assets and creating new game modes.\nIf you're wondering how powerful it is \u2014 we are using Dungeoneer to build the actual game. By working with you we can ensure that Dungeoneer becomes the best tool it can be and will be providing access to it as part of the Bedrock Beta to improve it based on your feedback.\nWe wouldn't be here without the support of the wonderful community, but we can only reach our base and Flex Goals with YOUR help!  Help us by spreading the word.\nHave you already pledged?  We have this wonderful backer image that you can use anywhere you are looking to spread the word.\nHave any other ideas for helping our campaign?  Leave a comment on our Kickstarter page or send us a direct message. \nAlternatively, you can get in touch with us at the following locations:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe all love making games, the past couple of months that we spent on actual development have been amazing, but of course it's not all sunshine and roses -- game development is never an easy task. Some of the problems we have encountered already are the difficulties in working across 8 or so different time zones. This problem created bottlenecks in development. We solved this by creating an Assembla workspace for our project, which has tickets, reports for activity and roadblocks, and all sorts of neat features that keep us all on the exact same page... literally. \n\nWe haven't released a game before, it's true, but the quality of what we're doing speaks for itself -- if you have spent a few minutes in the Playable Showcase then you've probably realized that we are committed to a beautiful looking game that plays just like a big-budget title would from an established developer. \n\nMoney. We're asking for what we believe is reasonable, budgeted out for at least 8 months of *full time* development, which will easily be enough time to create this game. Considering all progress so far has been done in our spare time, at 40+ hours a week the game will be out faster than you can say Whack-a-Dwarf.\n\nThere are two main reasons why we are able to do all of this on what seems like a relatively small budget:\n\nFirst, the entire game is being built with modability and versatility in mind (it's almost entirely data driven), and as such, piecing the game together once we have conquered a few initial hurdles (many of which we have already achieved or are well on the way to doing so) will be a relatively quick and painless process.\n\nSecond, we have all taken a very careful look at what we actually need to keep ourselves going until the release of the game, as that is our goal here: making a game.

Midgard has grown considerably in that time, especially with the recent release of the Midgard Campaign Setting.\nBut in all that time one problem has remained - how to represent the unique characters and races from Midgard on the gaming table. Perhaps a skeleton for an Imperial Ghoul? A goblin for a Kobold? And what about Dragonkin, Gear Mages, Harem Assassins? And with the newly released Campaign setting even more people are now in need of characters and monsters to suit their game for this wonderful new world.\nWell EasternFront Studios and Kobold Press have teamed up to bring the world of Midgard to life on your gaming table with an exciting new range of quality miniatures.\nMick Leach and his stable of talented artists and sculptors have already started work on bringing these miniatures to your gaming table. The initial goal is to fund the production of 6 miniatures of the same quality that you have come to expect from EasternFront Studios. Check out pics of the initial minis below - the Dwarf Wanderer, Ghoul Necromancer, Gear Mage, Harem Assassin, Bone Collective and Aboleth.\nHere in our trading house you'll find the various minis you can choose from. All Type M, or man-sized or smaller minis count as a single Mini Choice. Type L or larger minis count as multiple choices.\nFor example, if you want an Aboleth, either add $20 to your pledge, or trade in 5 of your Type M choices.\nOnly Bandits and higher can access the Type L Choices, Add-Ons, Extras and Upgrades. Goblins are only able to make a single choice from the Type M choices and Thralls are unable to access the goodies that can be found here. These restrictions are due to postage costs being included in the higher levels.\nStretch Goals - Baba Yaga Horsemen\nOur next 3 Stretch Goals are Baba Yaga's Horsemen Red Sun, White Day and Black Night (also known as Red, White and Black). These three horsemen are legends throughout Midgard, and are Grandmother Winter's faithful emissarys, scouts and warriors abroad.\n$28,000 - Red Sun\nIf we reach $28,000 Red Sun will be unlocked for backers to select. He will cost 3 Type M Choices or +$12.\n$30,000 - White Day\nIf we reach $30,000 White Day will be unlocked for backers to select. He will cost 3 Type M Choices or +$12.\n$32,000  - Black Night\nIf we reach $32,000 Black Knight will be unlocked for backers to select. He will cost 3 Type M Choices or +$12.\n$28,000 Bonus Mini - Neimheim Gnome\nContinuing the Baba Yaga theme, we have our first bonus Gnome. Gnomes in Midgard struck a deal with Baba Yaga and struck an infernal bargain with her for power.\nIf we reach $28,000 we'll give everyone who gets BANDIT KING reward level or higher a Neimheim Gnome.\n$30,000 Bonus Mini - Kobold Cthulhu\nIf we reach $30,000 we'll give everyone who gets GUILD LEADER reward level or higher another free mini - the Kobold Cthulhu.\n$32,000 Bonus Mini - Kobold Beetle Rider\nIf we reach $32,000 we'll give everyone who gets GUILD LEADER reward level or higher another free mini - the Kobold Beetle Rider.\nWe want to try and make this kickstarter as flexible for you as possible and minimise complex trades so we can focus on making you quality miniatures and getting them to your gaming table as quickly as possible.\nEach miniature in this kickstarter is classified as one of 2 types: Type M (up to 35mm in height) or Type L (over 35mm in height). Each Pledge Level from GOBLIN onwards gives you the choice of one or more Type M miniatures that you can choose from the initial list and any unlocked through stretch goals. These choices can also be traded in for Type L minis. The Eastern Front Trading House section below outlines how many Type M choices each Type L mini counts as.\nThe Trading House also contains other extras and options that you can add to your pledge and rewards. For example, you can add more Type M and Type L minis to your rewards and 'upgrade' your resin Type M miniatures to metal (Type L miniatures, such as the Aboleth, cannot be made in metal).\nAll rights to the custom miniatures remain with EasternFront Studios and Kobold Press. This includes sole rights to manufacture and produce them.\nFinally, you can choose a maximum of 10 miniatures of a specific model due to Kickstarter guidelines.\nWe have four fantastic sculptors working on this project. Here is a little bit about them.\nTim Prow has been sculpting for 15 years and has produced work for FASA, WizKids, and Reaper. He spends much of his current time running his own studio, through which his work he has been involved in film and TV.\nJason Wiebe has sculpted for Reaper, Dragon Forge, WizKids and Wizards of the Coast and is the chief wizard at Pariah Artworks. He is also sculpting the miniatures for Low Life and will initially be responsible for any and all kobolds in this kickstarter.\nFancagne Didier, in addition to being a renowned sculptor, is also multi-lingual speaking Vietnamese, Vanuatu Seke, English and French. He is spending much of his recent time sculpting for Kaha Miniatures.\nDrew Williams is a regular at Gen Con, won 2 Frothers Unite! Pro-Am sculpting competitions, has sculpted for AEG, EM-4 Miniatures, Demonblade Games and Black Orc Games and sculpts maquettes for Pixar.\nThanks to all of our wonderful backers who went on this amazing ride with us and helped us kickstarter the Midgard Miniatures line.\nYour support is greatly appreciated and each and every one of you rock.\nKeep an eye out for us in the future as we have much more planned and with your help we can bring even more awesome miniatures to your gaming table.\nPost Kickstarter Communication Plan\nIt is very important to us that we keep you up to date with what is happening regarding your pledges and rewards.\nSo we want to let you know our communication plan - basically how often we plan to publish updates about the projects progress.\nJanuary and February: monthly updates\nMarch onwards: fortnightly updates\nApril: Kickstarter Survey\nOf course, this is the bare minimum contact we commit to. If we have more to tell you, or need to tell you important information, we will do so in addition to these updates.\nAlso, we will provide more frequent information on our facebook forums so they are also a good place to check and keep track of.\nIn January and February, Kickstarter and Amazon will be collecting payments from you and transfer them to us. This process is meant to take about 2 weeks but there are nearly always delays and issues with it. Also during this time we'll be assigning the remaining unlocked sculpts to our sculptors. During this time there won't be much that is interesting to tell you. Some cool stuff no doubt. But not a lot.\nOnce the sculptors start completing their greens, however, we'll have more to show you and this will help you start to make decisions about which minis you want. Then of course as the day of delivery arrives we want to let you know as soon as they've been cast and shipped to you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEastern Front Studios has acquired the exclusive licensing rights to produce the Official Midgard RPG miniatures line and has worked with Kobold Press and Wolfgang Baur on this project for nearly 2 years. This has allowed us to address the risks during the pre-production and production phases to make sure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to be able to deliver these miniatures to you.\n\nWe have a lot of experience in delivering rewards for kickstarters through running the Dwarf Gladiators kickstarter and supporting others such as the Fallen City of Carez boardgame by Golden Egg, Andy Hopp's Low Life Miniatures and the Bleeding Hollow by TPK Games.\n\nBased on this experience we know that there are a number of points in the process where delays can occur:\n\n\u25a0 Sculpting\n\u25a0 Production\n\u25a0 Quality Control\n\u25a0 Shipping\n\nAt the moment, Bleeding Hollow, Fallen City and Dwarf Gladiators are all on schedule and expected to meet their shipping dates. Low Life has been slightly delayed but is expected to ship in January, within 4 weeks of its initial delivery date.\n\nThe expanded team is staying focused on keeping our many newly made friends up-to-date with these projects and answering any questions they may have.\n\nThe biggest challenge we can think of is that of extreme success. We have prepared as best as possible for this outcome. The first 6 of these miniatures are already made in preproduction GREENS and we have dozens of possible designs ready to give to our professional and talented sculptors, who are up to the job. The one thing it might do is delay our ability to send out the final rewards to you by a few months. Of course we'll keep you completely informed of any challenges or obstacles such as these that might affect our delivery dates throughout the kickstarter and beyond.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #88", "update_userinfo": "Foundry's update", "update_content": "Hi guys just a quick update to let you know I spoke to Mike Noe at iron wind metals via Facebook and he says the casts can be continued once they return from Gencon and once they locate the molds..I will need to send them pics of existing older EFS minis to help track them down in their unsorted pile when they got turned over to them by Majestic when Brian'ss widow let them take charge of them and apparently tons of others.I sent Jeff at Valiant the similar question when can we continue but have not heard back as yet via email if they do'nt respond by Thursday I will call them.I imagine they are probably busy also  Gearing up for Gencon.\nMick"}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 1941, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/607885648/midgard-rpg-miniatures", "project_name": "Midgard RPG Miniatures"}}, {"backer": "TheSheDM", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "UPDATE: We can hardly believe it, we made it to $100,000 for the Super Duper Bonus Level!

Dr. Cat did all the client and server programming to launch Furcadia in 1996, Talzhemir did all the art, and they worked together on game design and web pages.\nExecutive Producer Emerald Kaiten Catz, and Chief Technology Officer Aleksi \u201cFox\u201d Asikainen joined the company as partners after discovering Furcadia, taking the lead on further development from 2000 onwards.

People who make content learn to like it, because they want to make content, and they also want to eat food and sleep under a roof, and the opportunity to do both at the same time seems like a pretty good idea. \nAfter the \"dot com bubble,\" we ran the site entirely on donations for over a year. The word crowdfunding hadn't been invented yet; back then, people simply called it \"begging,\" but I think it's clear that those days are long past. We look back on that period with incredible fondness, and I don't think we're the only ones. It was just two of us then, not the juggernaut that it is now; we have mouths to feed, as it were. I think we had assumed it wasn't possible to do it that way anymore - to operate a site at this scale without advertising dollars - but it occurred to us that we'd never actually asked. People often want to know how they can support the site in a way that doesn't involve t-shirts or looking at advertising, and I think we may have a way. What I'm saying is that we want to sell out, and we would love to sell out to you. \nHow Do You Intend To Do That\nBy doing this. \nLeaderboard Ad Removed, $250k Goal\nThat's for the amount you see on the right. If it turns out to be something people want to see, or not see as the case may be, we'll add stretch goals to restore old services we used to offer, convert the entire site to a Creative Commons license, and ultimately remove every ad from the site for an entire year. We intend to be a company that succeeds by making things, specifically things for you, and are orienting ourselves toward that goal. \nAll ads on homepage removed. $525k goal\nSo, we're turning to you. Would scouring ads from Penny Arcade, with everything that entails, be something you\u2019d be willing to reach into your pocket for? The more we considered it, the more we agreed it might just be. Not only would you no longer have to look at advertising when browsing Penny Arcade, but not having ads would create a chain reaction that would lead to a bunch of other interesting stuff. Without the almighty \"pageview\" to consider, why not populate the RSS with full comics and posts? Why not enable and even encourage apps, first and third party, for people to read it however they damn well please?\nThat seems pretty compelling to us, but in keeping with Kickstarter tradition we\u2019ve greased the wheels with a buffet of backer rewards and stretch goals. This is an amazing experiment in our opinion. If it doesn\u2019t work Penny Arcade will be fine. We\u2019ll keep going just like before with no interruption in service and nothing will change. But if it did work, I mean, wow.\n\nThat would be something. \nStretchgoals:\nUpdate #1: $550k Stretchgoal\nOne of the things that excited us most about the idea of trying an ad-free model was the amount of time it would give us to actually make comics. Currently, we do all kinds of creative services projects that are part of the existing model, but in their absence, that's all time we can put to work for you. We have a ton of weird settings, and ideas for more, that are simply not possible with the schedule the current system imposes. What we're talking about would be new projects, in settings you already like, that run ALONGSIDE the week's comics, not in their place. Like, oh, I don't know... THIS?!?\nWe have quite a year planned, if you're game.\nCW(TB)\n-----\nUpdate #2: $325k Stretchgoal\nAdditional Revelations! \nWe're just revealing things right and left around here. It would be our great pleasure to acquaint you with Automata: Silverside in lieu of our typical \"creative services\" work. The first of these projects unlocks at $325,000, and we're chomping at the bit. Or champing at it; I can never remember if you chomp or champ. In any case, there won't be anything left of this bit by the time we're done. We're going crazy on it!\n(CW)TB\n-----\nUpdate #4: Penny Arcade Leaderboard Stretch Goal Unlocked! Stretchgoals up to $999k revealed.\nIt's unbelievable, but the campaign has reached our first funding goal of $250k in four days. We've been blown away by the support thus far, and the interest from people outside the industry makes us think we might be on to something here.\nAs promised, we are revealing the stretch goals up to $999k ... behold! (check out the updated list up top!) The new goals we've revealed are:  \nJerry Cosplay: Jerry has agreed to Cosplay as the character of the community's choice (by vote) for one day at both PAX East 2013 and PAX Prime 2013. \nStrip Search Web Show: Discussed in a flurry of tweets, Penny Arcade: The Series Season 4 will be our version of America's Next Top Webcomic titled... STRIP SEARCH. This incredibly ambitious and expensive production will bring together over 10 up and coming webcomic hopefuls for a week of grueling challenges and horrifying social experiments, hosted by Mike and Jerry. For what? A considerable cash prize and integration into the Penny Arcade offices for one year. \nTwisp & Catsby Children's Book (free online): Mike and Jerry will create and publish online (for free) a Twisp & Catsby Children's Book. \nOriginal Tabletop Adventure: Mike and Jerry will write a completely original tabletop adventure, not tied to any particular system, to be released for free. \nFree PA Comic Reader developed for iOS and Android \nPA Blanks/Creative Common License: We will release, with each Monday, Wednesday and Friday strip, a blank version of the comic (art without word balloons) for your editing and remixing enjoyment. In addition, we will open the ENTIRE PA archive to a Creative Common License under CC BY-NC-SA. \n-----\nUpdate #5: Automata Project Unlocked, More Lookouts Info, Comic Sketch Reward and Additional Q&As!\nWe\u2019ve just crossed the $325,000 mark, meaning the Automata strip for 2013 is LOCKED IN. As a teaser, Mike created this image to give you an idea of what\u2019s in in store:\nOur next goal is to make Jerry cosplay as whatever you want him to, which for those in the office is VERY EXCITING. If that goal is met, we\u2019ll first open submissions via an online survey, and then select the top 5 choices by raw #s. From there, we\u2019ll have another online vote-off.\n\nLooking down a bit further on the stretch goal list, Jerry also wrote this piece to go along with a new sketch by Mike for the Lookouts, Daughters of Eyrewood:\n\ndaughter, daughter,\nkilled her father\nlook at what her\nblood has bought her \nNew Reward - Original Comic Pencil Sketch\nThis isn\u2019t a reward you\u2019ll find on the right side but is actually one that applies to ANYONE that contributes more than $2,500. You will receive in the mail, one of the original pencil sketches from the Penny Arcade archives (and for those donating $5k, you\u2019ll receive two, and so on). \nThese sketches are what are scanned in and digitally inked, so each online strip has ONE pencil sketch associated with it. These are the ORIGINALS. (please note, the strip you receive will be at random) Since Mike no longer does the pencil sketches ahead of time, this part in the process no longer exists making these extra rare.\nWe've also updated the FAQ with some additional questions. Please check them out below!\n-----\nUpdate #6: $350k reached, new rewards added!\nWe crossed the $350,000 mark over the weekend, so it looks like this thing has some legs. After listening to a ton of feedback, we have a few more rewards that may interest you!\n\nPrecipice Promotional 1 GB Flash Drives - $250 (30 available)\nWhen we made Precipice of Darkness, Episode 1, we had manufactured 50 USB Credit Card drives (seen here) for media kits, etc. With this reward level you\u2019ll receive this Flash Drive in the mail filled with the digital versions of Books 1 and 2 and the remastered Jerry tracks! We have two versions of the drive (Gabe and Tycho) \u2013 which you receive will be picked at random. Add $10 for International addresses.\n1 lb of Jerry\u2019s Coffee Roast - $300 (10 available)\nJerry will ship to you a one pound bag of his signature coffee beans that he roasts himself. Add $10 for International addresses.\n\nLogo Design by PA Design - $1500 (10 available)\nGive Kiko and Erika the name of your company and a synopsis of what exactly it is you do, and delivered to you will be the one-colour AI/PDF/PSD files for your further manipulation. This is the team that designed the PAX Logo, the Trenches Logo, the Child\u2019s Play logo, etc.\n\nBrew with Jerry - $2500 (4 available)\nIt\u2019s no secret Jerry loves brewing, and this reward gives you the opportunity to brew with Jerry in Seattle. You only need to handle your transportation, and Jerry will take care of the rest. Must be 21 or older.\n\nPing Pong. Your Team vs. Team Inferno - $5000 (1 available)\nInvite you and up to 9 of your friends for an officially sanctioned match against Team Inferno in Seattle, WA. The most expensive pizza you have ever purchased will be included. You just need to handle transportation.\n\nPA will crash your birthday party - $5000 (1 available)\nMike and Jerry and possibly some other people will crash your party and totally eat all of your food and drink everything in your fridge. Must be in the Seattle area.\n\nKhoo will plan your bachelor party - $7500 (1 available)\nThis is for planning and day-of execution only. Robert Khoo will take whatever your pre-determined budget is and plan a\u2026 uh\u2026 experience for you and your friends. A more detailed description to this reward would be against the code. See PA:TS S02E28 for reference.\n\nMike and Jerry DM - $8000 (1 available)\nMike and Jerry will be your DM for you and 3 of your friends, running an adventure just for you. You just need to handle transportation to Seattle.\nWe\u2019ve also been getting some really interesting ideas for stretchgoals from readers \u2013 if you want to suggest some before we announce our next set of them, send an email to ks@penny-arcade.com. Thanks!\n-----\nUpdate #8: The Final Cosplay Vote + More details on Strip Search\n(Note: Skipped #7 since it was just the initial cosplay vote)\nWe've crossed the $375k mark, meaning Jerry is on the hook for cosplaying as the character of your choice. We did open submissions in Update #7, and after over 15,000 suggestions, here are the top 5 to vote on:\n\n1. Bayonetta\n2. Sailor Moon\n3. The Fruit Fucker\n4. Tycho\n5. Yummy Chan\n\nHonorable mentions go to Strawberry Shortcake and Lollipop Chainsaw. ;)\n\nAlright, vote here!\n\nGabe also just posted an update on Penny Arcade about Strip Search, but you can read it here as well:\n\nI admit to being a huge fan of reality tv style game shows. I love shows like So You Think You Can Dance, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, and Master Chef. I even watch shows like Ink Master and Shear Genius. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s singers, chefs, fashion designers or gardeners. I love watching groups of people pushed together to compete at something they are good at. I don\u2019t know a thing about cooking or dancing but I can\u2019t get enough of these game shows. I\u2019m always amazed when the challenge is something like \u201cmake a fruit tart\u201d and one guy says \u201cshit I\u2019ve never made a fruit tart before\u201d and then he proceeds to make a fucking fruit tart. I could never do that and maybe that\u2019s why I love watching it so much. Could you pull a theme out of a hat and then write and draw a comic strip about it? Probably not, but I\u2019m guessing you might like to watch people who can.\n\nThat\u2019s the idea for our new show Strip Search. It is the next goal in our Kickstarter and It is a reality game show for web cartoonists. Like any of these other shows I mentioned it is about watching incredibly talented people face off in a competition with a reward that could change their life.\nIn the case of Strip Search we are talking about ten people. Each one of them a talented cartoonist. They will all live together in a house here in Seattle. They will compete in a series of challenges that will test their skills and we will slowly whittle them down until we are left with one winner. This cartoonist will win a cash prize along with integration into the Penny Arcade machine. That means a studio in our office but it also means access to our business people, our merchandising operation, our designers, and our ping pong table. The winner will get plugged into the Penny Arcade family for one year. We will not own any of their work, and there will be no evil contract to sign. We will just be there to support them and help grow their comic in a way that very few other organizations could.\n\nTycho and I will be the hosts and participate in the judging but we won\u2019t be alone. We are very lucky to have friends in every corner of the industry from syndicated newspaper comics to book publishers, and web comic pioneers. We\u2019ll be bringing these folks in as guest judges and mentors throughout the competition. You\u2019ll also see everyone here in the office working with these contestants. It\u2019s a huge undertaking for us but incredibly exciting I think.\nThere is something magical about watching a comic strip come together. I think Strip Search is a show that could appeal to a much bigger audience than anything we\u2019ve done before on PATV. So if you could help us get the word out I\u2019d appreciate it. Tell your friends who like reality TV and tell them to tell their friends. I\u2019d love to see Strip Search get funded and if it does we are very close to the goal of all ads removed from the home page and our Daughters of the Eyrewood Lookouts comic.\n------\nUpdate #9: More Lookouts Art, a New Reward, FAQ Update, Jerry Cosplay\nWith 15 days left, we've raised almost $400,000, which is nearly a half-a-million dollars, which is basically a million! Right? Or...? Listen. We don't have time to thrill you with our incredible mathematics right now. It's time to reveal the terrifying revelations of Kickstarter Update 9!\n\nMore Lookouts!\n\nGabe drew more concept art for Daughters of the Eyrewood to further entice you:\nI know this level seems out there, but we still have 15 days! We are also adding another reward level at $50 for a hi-resolution, 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d print of the above Lookouts image sent to your door. Please add $5 for international addresses. (this level also includes all previous rewards!)\n\nJerry Cosplay Poll Results!\nI'll be honest, I'm actually a little shocked at the result. The winner is... the Fruit Fucker? I just feel like... that doesn't have a lot of shame-factor to it. This was an opportunity to really get some ridiculous photos of Jerry, and the community chose the Fruit Fucker? All right, we'll try to do something with it that will maximize embarrassment.\n\nOh! And I forgot to mention in the last update with honorable mentions that we also got a lot of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew suggestions, which would have also been really funny.\n----\nUpdate #10: Kickstarter Shirt Revealed!\nWe\u2019re less than $40k away from hitting our Strip Search stretchgoal, and we figured you would want to see the Exclusive Kickstarter T-Shirt commemorating the campaign! \nThis is at the $150 reward level and also includes The Dickstarter Print, Digital Versions of Books 1 and 2, Remastered Digital Singles of Jerry\u2019s PA musical works, an 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d print of the Lookouts image from Update #9, a copy of Rainslick 3, names for your band AND your pet by Jerry, thoughts of you during coitus from Mike, and of course, the glue that holds this whole campaign together, Mike chasing a duck around while he shouts your name.\n----\nUpdate #11: Strip Search UNLOCKED! Call for entries begins NOW.\nWe\u2019ve just hit the $450k/Strip Search stretchgoal! We move fast, so it\u2019s time to get the process rolling. May I present to you, the initial call for entries.\n\nAs mentioned in previous updates, the winner will get office space (for free!) at Penny Arcade HQ in Seattle, WA AND access to all of our facilities and resources (Mike, Jerry, Biz Guys, Merch Guys, etc) for one year on top of a $15,000 cash prize.\n\nThe deadline to submit is midnight, 8/24/2012 (TWO WEEKS FROM NOW). What you\u2019re applying for is to be on our new reality show, Strip Search, later this year. The process to get to our final participants will be incredibly thorough, so please know this is only the first of many steps.\n\nSome quick notes on the show:\n\nThere will be no cost to you, other than your time.\nYou will be asked to sign a video release.\nYou will be asked to sign an NDA.\nYou will NOT be asked to sign anything regarding the rights to your existing or future works.\nYou need to be 18 or older and legally be able to enter the United States.\nYou will need to take about two weeks of your life later this year for this and this alone.\nIf there are any other questions, please ask them below, and I'll get them answered.

Tolkien\nDwarves have long been a fixture in fantasy literature and games. These sturdy little humanoids excel at taking on great odds and at consuming large quantities of potent ale. Any dungeon crawl or quest that lacks dwarves is depressingly empty. In addition to being a warm and welcoming people dwarves are also often the first line of defense against the slime-ridden denizens of darkness. Despite these laudable qualities, they are considered a lesser race by many of the other humanoids, little better than halflings. The haughty and self-important elves, in particular, seem to despise this diminutive yet noble breed. Help us show those pointy-ears once and for all by making your next hero a dwarf!\n\nThe Dwarven Adventurers Box Set Project is about creating miniatures to represent a set of 5 dwarven heroes. The Group will include a paladin, a berserker, a cleric, a mage, a rogue, a mechanist, and a necromancer.The goal here is simple: get the 7 miniatures sculpted, cast, and distributed to all of you! Depending on the level of funding that the project reaches, the miniatures will either be cast in a durable urethane resin or white pewter metal. The Dwarves will represent a relatively balanced adventuring party and or a selection of dwarven heroes to lead in any fantasy army.\nThe Dwarves will be sculpted on a 28 millimeter heroic scale and will fit well with almost all tabletop wargaming and RPG miniatures. \nHere are some 28mm scale miniatures I've sculpted as studies of popular miniature lines:\nBelow are our Goals! All reached!\n\nWhen stretch goals are reached extra value is added to existing rewards. As we pass these funding benchmarks, these benefits will become available.\nWhen we hit $1500 Character Sheets for each dwarf will be produced and made available to backers in PDF format for each of the dwarves for DND 4th ed. and Pathfinder rules (possibly other rules systems as well depending on demand).\nBecause of the costs involved in pewter casting, it is only feasible for us after a certain order size is reached. When we hit $3000 the miniatures will be cast in pewter instead of resin.\nWhen we hit $3500 An additional dwarf, the Mechanist, will be  produced and included in every box set at the $25 backer level and above. This means each boxed set will contain 6 dwarves instead of 5!\nWhen we hit $4000 Scenic bases will be sculpted, cast in resin, and included with each miniature.\nWhen we hit $4500 Backstories will be written for each of the Dwarves and made available in .pdf format for all backers. This will be written by author S.B. Coates who has recently launched his own project: Zombies Ate My Teacher a family friendly Zombie Survival work of interactive fiction. Check it out!\nWhen we hit $6000 A second additional dwarf, the Necromancer, will be produced and included in every box set at the $25 backer level and above. Now each box set will have 7 miniatures instead of the original 5!\nNw that we've made it past the stretch goals its time for EPIC GOALS!!!!!\nEPIC GOALS are not part of the stretch goal benefits but are an entirely different thing that works exactly the same. How do you access these EPIC GOALS? By pledging or increasing your pledge to a clearly marked pledge level with EPIC GOAL benefits! \nThese benefits are listed below. \nAt the $10,000 benchmark EPIC GOAL a Dwarven Bard miniature will be included in each EPIC GOAL qualifying set along with the 7 other minis.\nWhen we hit $15,000 in backing a ninth dwarf, the Druidess AND her animal familiar (a smaller mini) will be added to each EPIC GOAL eligible pledge level for a total of 9 dwarves and a critter.\nWhen we hit $20,000 The Undead Dwarf is added to the EPIC GOAL eligible box sets to make 10 dwarves total!\nWe've reached all of our EPIC GOALS, it's time for the addition of...\nMEGA GOALS work much like EPIC GOALS in that eligible reward levels include all of the benefits from the EPIC GOALS and Stretch goals but include 5 additional dwarves! All 15 dwarves will be in your hands well before Christmas!\nHere's the rundown on the MEGA GOAL dwarves:\nWhen we hit $25,000 the Monk, a dwarf trained in unarmed combat, will be added to MEGA GOAL eligible box sets, bringing the total to 11 dwarves per set.\nWhen we hit $30,000 the Huntsman, a master beast slayer, will be added to the MEGA GOAL eligible box sets, bringing the total to 12 dwarves per set.\nWhen we hit $35,000 the Witch will be added to the MEGA GOAL eligible box sets, bringing the total to 13 dwarves per set.\nWhen we hit $40,000 the Highwayman will be added to the MEGA GOAL eligible box sets, bringing the total to 14 dwarves per set.\nWhen we hit $45,000 the Fallen King will be added to the MEGA GOAL eligible box sets, bringing the total to 15 dwarves per set.\nWe've reached all our MEGA GOALS... now for our:\nAdd-on Goals are different from Stretch, EPIC, and MEGA goals in that they are not automatically added to a pledge level once they have been reached. Instead, once these goals have been passed, the benefits of the goals may be added to your reward (for any of the backing levels starting at the $12 backer level) by increasing your pledge by $4.00 per benefit.\nStill confused? Here's an example: Jimmy has pledged at the $40 level and is going to receive 15 dwarves + a critter, the scenic bases, .pdf files of the character sheets and backstories for each mini. He also wants to add the $50000 Add-on goal benefit: the Fighter (female!!!) to his order. To do this he simply increases his pledge level by $4.00 and sends us a message to tell us that the Fighter is the Add-on benefit that he would like.\nAlternatively, Jimmy could add $8.00 to get both the Fighter and the Brewmaster included in his set or $12.00 to get both Dwarves and the set of Dwarven Character Cards.\nNOTE: Due to the additional production time needed, adding Add-on benefits to your order will delay estimated delivery of September 2012 shipments until October 2012. We do not foresee any delay issues with any of the other due dates.\nHere's the rundown on Add-on Goals:\nWhen we hit $50,000 the Fighter (a female!) will be made available to add to your reward (for any of the backing levels starting at the $12 backer level) by increasing your pledge amount by $4.00!\nWhen we hit $55,000 Character Cards (Cards with the dwarf's concept art on one side and a brief bio on the backside) will be created and made available to add to your reward (for any of the backing levels starting at the $12 backer level) by increasing your pledge amount by $4.00!\nWhen we hit $60,000 the Dwarven Brewmaster will be made available to add to your reward (for any of the backing levels starting at the $12 backer level) by increasing your pledge amount by $4.00!\nWhen we hit $65,000 the Dwarven Miner will be made available to add to your reward (for any of the backing levels starting at the $12 backer level) by increasing your pledge amount by $4.00!\nWhen we hit $70,000 we'll add a bit sprue and a d6 die (with our logo [cause you love us] in place of the one pip) to everyone's order who is getting the character cards. The bit sprue will include the following: a canary, a crossbow, an axe, a sword, a badger, a shield, a pack of gear, a large hammer, and a throwing hammer.\nIf your order includes the character cards than you'll get a die & bit sprue at no additional cost. For orders with multiple sets of character cards that means you get multiple dice & bit sprues at no additional cost.\nFor those of you who aren't hobbyists, a bit sprue is a collection of parts that can be used to enhance or customize the dwarves. To utilize the bit sprue, you'll have to be willing to use a little super glue (or green stuff) and elbow grease.\nAt the 75000 level we are going to have bit sprue 2.0 (full of generic objects) made available at no additional cost to those at the ULTIMATE ADVENTURES PACKAGE LEVELS. Outside of this level it will be $4 to add-on to your order. Bit sprue 2.0 will include: a bag, a bottle, a treasure chest, a book, a cauldron, a tankard, and 3 dwarven skulls.\nAt the 80000 level we are going to have a small print made of the all of the dwarves at no additional cost to the ULTIMATE ADVENTURES PACKAGE LEVELS. Outside of these levels it will be $2 to add on to your level.\nAt the 85000 level we are going to have the unconscious dwarf made available to all those at the ULTIMATE ADVENTURES PACKAGE LEVELS at no additional cost. You can decide if he is unconscious, wounded badly, or dead (yay!). Outside of these levels it will be $4 to have him added. There will be no .pdfs attached to this guy.\nTHE FOLLOWING ARE EXTRAS, NOT ADD-ONS. THEY ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED IN THE ULTIMATE ADVENTURES PACKAGES!\nAt the 95000 level any Backer (from the $12 Backer Reward Level and above) can add this Troll (for your dwarves to fight) for an additional $10. The troll will be 66 mm tall, he'll be cast in resin. He'll be unpainted ($50 to get him painted [limit 1] for our painted levels). He will not have any .pdfs attached to him. This limited edition model will be kickstarter exclusive. He'll be ready in November 2012 (If you would like him to ship separately from an earlier order add an additional $3 for domestic & $5 international).\nThere has been a small group of vocal commenters that have asked for a blacksmith, so for those who are interested in one: at the 100000 goal level our backers (from the $12 backer reward level and up) can purchase a Female Blacksmith (anvil included) cast in pewter for $4. She works just like the troll and t-shirt. Unlike the troll, she gets a backstory. [Also, remember, if you are not interested in her no need to add her! :)]\nShe'll be ready in November. Painted levels can have her added to be painted [We'll increase the limit on how many extras we allow by 1 to fit her in]. If you'd like her to ship separately from an early ETA box set, then ($3 for domestic & $5 for International).\nFINAL GOAL!\nWell, the idea of progression miniatures was tossed out awhile ago, which led to an amusing discussion about babies and tombstones (it may have gone the way of zombie babies as well). So this is what we've got:\nSo, to our Backers! At 125000 goal level (100x our original goal!) we are going to give every pledged backer (from the $12 backer level and higher) 1 sprue that has a baby dwarf, boy dwarf, girl dwarf, and a tombstone. You read that correctly, IT'S FREE (the first one is free!). We are not planning on painting them (painting levels can discuss this with us via messages). No .pdfs attached to these guys. Bases are not included. The kids will be 15mm to the eyes. The tombstone will be 25mm tall. The baby will be proportional to the kids in size. ($4 for additional sprues - if you want them)\nAdditional info:\nFor the rewards that offer painting: the painting will be done by Mike or by Cam Kendall of Big Squid Studios. Here is a miniature that Mike sculpted and painted. Here is a link to Cam's blog where he put up some of his painted minis.\nMike worked as an in-house painter for Blue Table Painting until May of this year when he decided to pursue sculpting full-time.\nDISCLAIMER: The term \"Box Set\" is a term used in the miniatures industry to denote a collection of miniatures that is sold as such.

This time my goal was to showcase a single specific AR-37 Transport Ship named \"The Nova Eclipse\", in an unprecedented level of detail. Both levels of this twin-deck starship, and its hull surface, are presented on this double-sided poster using a subtle 1-inch grid for gameplay with miniatures. If we can raise $3000 (to fund the print run, cover cards, packaging, shipping, and related expenses), Mass Transit IV will see print.\nIf we manage to double that amount, raising $6000 before the end of the funding period, I will also be printing the \"Alien Starship Tiles\". This set of twelve double-sided cards (along with two sheets of bonus terrain inside their front and back cover cards) can be used to construct all manner of living alien ships--a bio-engineered invasion fleet just waiting to be explored!\nFinally, if we can actually raise $9000 before time runs out, I have one additional product ready to print and offer up as a reward for backers: A double-sided poster called \"Deck Space.\" For years players have been asking me to produce a poster containing an empty field of deck plating as the basis for the creation of custom terrain maps. This is that product, and more: One side is a field of empty deck that perfectly matches my \"Sci-Fi Cargo Tiles\" product. With those tiles (or the sheet of 13 cargo items included on the back of this poster's cover card), you can set the stage for a different encounter location every time you use the map. The back side is similar, but matches the railway system running through my Mass Transit maps to form a larger, customizable battleground.\nWhen you select a reward package that includes more than one map product, you may choose from the new products funded by this Kickstarter drive, and/or from my in-stock individual poster maps and terrain card sets listed in my map store at http://www.mapsofmastery.com/store.html\n\nShipping for these products is free. Even international orders will be shipped at no additional charge. That said, if backers from other countries would like to add $10 to their pledge as a courtesy to help offset the extra expense on my end, it would be appreciated.\nEvery backer will receive access to downloadable PDF copies of the maps that are printed through this funding drive. If we fund all three products, backers will get all three sets of PDF files!\nPlus, I have other bonus rewards in the works if we pass certain benchmarks, like custom dice with the Nova Eclipse insignia on one face, or downloadable PDF versions of the maps with different features. If those additional rewards are unlocked (I'll post goals for them if and when we pass the main goal), all backers will have them automatically included with their map(s) at no extra charge!\nOh, and one more thing: the outstanding and enormously talented Star Wars artist Jeff Carlisle has offered to illustrate the Nova Eclipse for us! If his work is complete before the end of the funding period, his image will be included as part of the poster! How cool is that!?!\nPlease help me reach these goals by telling all of your friends about the project.

I've got yet more padded envelopes on the way, so there should be another batch going out by week's end.\nBy the way: If someone who has received their reward package yet could post here to let me know that the maps and dice arrived safely, I'll rest a little easier. :)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "More maps outbound!", "update_content": "Hi, folks!\nI'm pleased to say that the first batch of rewards left the building this week, and are now speeding on their way through the US postal system.\nBefore anyone starts checking their mailbox in earnest, though, I should point out that the first batch was relatively small; for the larger reward packages, I'm trying to use a padded flat rate envelope that's gentler on your products than what I've used before, but the postal service seems unwilling to send out more than one bundle of 15 of them at a time.
