Before we get started, I know it's been a really long, strange, difficult 12 months for a lot of us, so I hope everyone is doing okay and staying safe.\nSo... where were we?\nIn the not-too-distant past \u2013 about 6 years ago, November 2015 AD \u2013 we ran a Kickstarter to BRING BACK MST3K after 15 years in hibernation.\nIt was a little bit stressful, and a lot of work, but I've gotta tell you... the whole experience went better than we had ever hoped:\nThanks to you, our campaign broke a bunch of Kickstarter records.\nOver 48,000 of you took up the cause... and together, we raised over $6 million.\nWith your help, we got picked up on Netflix and made 20 new episodes!\nAnd you know, you can't ever please everybody, but it seems like most of you were pretty happy with 'em.... and the critics were too: \nAlso, having those new episodes on Netflix, along with a lot of our \"classic\" episodes, helped a lot of folks discover Mystery Science Theater for the first time. So, if you weren't there to help #BringBackMST3K... Welcome! We're glad you're here to help  #MakeMoreMST3K.\nThanks to our Kickstarter, we also built up enough momentum to experiment with taking MST3K in new directions, including three live national tours, where we got to meet thousands of you in person!  Also, during our live tours, it became really clear to me that MST3K works best when you can experience it together, with your family and friends, or your fellow MSTies.\nAnyway: as you know, nothing good lasts forever.  Sometime in late 2019, during our third live tour, we got word: even though Netflix liked how our new episodes came out, they wouldn't be renewing us for a third new season.\n(Sometimes, business is just business, you know? Was it disappointing not to get renewed? Well, sure. But starting now, we want to focus on looking forward, not back. And when you see what we're planning now, I hope you'll agree that this could end up being the best thing for MST3K in the long run.)\nThen, the day after we finished the live tour, the whole world shut down for a year. And you know, as terrible as COVID has been, it did mean that I had plenty of time to think about where Mystery Science Theater can go next.\nWhen I thought about it long enough, I realized three important things:\n 1. The world isn't done with MST3K yet.\n We still want to make more episodes of MST3K.\nA lot of you still want us to make more MST3K.\n2. It's time to try something new.\nIf enough of you want more MST3K, maybe we don't need anyone to renew us.\nFrom now on, we want you to decide how long MST3K keeps going.\nWe don't need a network to \"let us\" make more MST3K. We can make it for you. \nWhen we do, you should be the first ones to see it.\n3. We need a better space for sharing MST3K, and watching it together.\nWithout a network, we'll need a home for new MST3K, and...\nWe want it to be easy to enjoy MST3K live with other people, so...\nWe need our own online theater for live screenings and events! \nI'm glad you asked, friend... because that's what this new Kickstarter is all about.\nThanks to all of you, Mystery Science Theater 3000 has come a long way since our first Kickstarter.  Now, if you decide to get involved again, here's what we can do next:\n1. MAKE MORE MST3K episodes with a new, sustainable model, that lets you decide how long we should keep going, and lets us bring new episodes directly to you, without depending on a network to distribute or keep renewing us for new seasons.\n2. BUILD THE GIZMOPLEX, our own virtual online theater, where we can host frequent live screenings, premieres, and community events \u2013 and you can host MST3K watch parties with friends whenever you want. More on that in a minute. \nMan... you're way ahead of me. \nIf you were part of our first Kickstarter, this next part might sound familiar:\n If our new Kickstarter can raise at least $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three more new episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000...but we'll also have enough to build the Gizmoplex. \nAnd then \u2013 just like last time \u2013 the more we raise, the more we can do! Here's what we'll be able to do at each of our goals, all the way up to our final goal of $5.5 million: \nUPDATE (5/8): We hit $6.4M, which means JOEL ROBINSON will return to HOST 2 NEW EPISODES and we'll add a 13TH NEW EPISODE!\nAlso, you know, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but if things go well, we've got a lot of other ideas we'd like to add into the mix. You can find out more about that below, and also in this Backer Update.\nNow listen, I hope you're already convinced that the best reason to join our new Kickstarter is because we'll able to #MakeMoreMST3K and #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nBut since this is Kickstarter, let's talk about REWARDS.\nI'm really proud of how most of the rewards from our first Kickstarter campaign turned out, and ever since then, a lot of you told me how much you loved them too. So, this time around, I want to do our best to \"raise the bar.\" You'll have to decide for yourself if we pull it off, but I'll tell you that we've got a few rewards this time that I'm really excited about \u2013 especially the Gizmoplex DIY Concession Pack, our new Challenge Coins, and a pretty amazing design for an MST3K Musical Snow Globe! \nUPDATE \u2013 Since there are so many rewards to keep track of, and we want to make sure you know what to expect in each pledge level, we've also put together this chart, which has been UPDATED to include the ALL-DIGITAL EXPERIMENT 85! \nSo yeah, as you can see, until you get above Experiment 500, most of the rewards \"stack\", which means you get all of the rewards listed in all of the lower pledge levels,  not just the new rewards listed with each pledge level. And unless it says otherwise, all reward levels above Experiment 500 include everything listed on this chart. I'm telling you, it's a lot of cool stuff. \nUPDATE (MAY 5): Joel has shared some \"sneak peek\" images of the designs for our new rewards, including TWO T-SHIRT DESIGNS, TWO POSTER DESIGNS, the MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE and the just-released MISSION PATCHES!\n FIRST LOOK: T-SHIRT DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: POSTER DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE \nYou can read more about the Musical Snowglobe in this Backer Update, but you should know that it will have a \"wind-up\" mechanical element in the base which plays a new rendition of the MST3K Theme Song, composed just for this reward by Paul Sabourin:\nFIRST LOOK: NEW MISSION PATCH (ADD-ON) \nAlso, one big change since last time is that we're now able to offer \"Add-On Rewards\" right here on Kickstarter. That means that we don't have to guess exactly what you'll like, or create a million different confusing pledge levels. \nHere are some of the Add-On Rewards available right now:\n\n SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED!\nAlso, just in case you missed the notice in the description of each reward level: We're not collecting shipping costs for any rewards until after the Kickstarter ends.\nAbout 2-4 weeks after our Kickstarter campaign ends, you'll get a reward survey to give us all of the details we need, like your t-shirt size, or the name(s) you want us to use for each of the \"Special Thanks\" rewards. When you give us those details, we'll also collect shipping for any rewards that go in the mail!\nREWARD TIMING\nWhile a handful of rewards \u2013 like the \"MST3K Season 13: Collector's Box Set\" on DVD and Blu-Ray \u2013 might not be available until as late as June 2022, other rewards \u2013 like Weekly Production Updates \u2013 will start within just a few weeks of when our Kickstarter campaign ends. So, don't let the \"June 2022\" delivery date scare you. Kickstarter just asks us to list the latest date when we expect all rewards to be sent out.\nNow, I know this is already a lot of information, especially if you already watched our video, and I think I've told you most of the really important stuff.\nAnd, if you still want more information, there's a lot more detail below, so keep reading if you want to know more about...\nHow the Gizmoplex will work!\nHow the Gizmoplex can make MST3K better! \nHow we set our funding goals!\nHow we'll spend whatever we raise!\nAlso, one of the things I like best about Kickstarter is that it's not just a \"monologue,\" but a really great way to have a conversation with all of you who care about the show. So, if there are other things you want to know about, I hope you'll take a look at our FAQ... and if the answer isn't there, I hope you'll ask!\nWe'll also do our best to read and respond to all of your comments. But just so you know, I'm pretty sure that our first Kickstarter also got more comments than any project that came before it! So, if that happens again, please be patient if it takes us a little while to get to everything. We've got a whole month, and a lot more to tell you!\nThere's one more thing I need to say before you go, and it's pretty important:\nOver the last year, as I was trying to imagine where Mystery Science Theater can go next, I also spent a lot of time thinking about how we got here.\n(It's kind of crazy to realize that it's been almost six years since our first Kickstarter, and almost thirty-three years since we first aired on KTMA on Thanksgiving in 1988.)\nAnyway, when I look back on everything that's happened, it's really clear that our first Kickstarter was one of the defining moments in Mystery Science history. For our first campaign, we asked you to help us make new episodes, and to prove to \"the networks\" that there was still an audience for MST3K... and you did!\nBut together, we've done a lot more than that. Thanks to you, Mystery Science Theater has been able to produce 2 new seasons, 20 new episodes, 6 comic books, 3 live national tours, and 1 record-breaking Kickstarter.\nToday, I hope you'll join us again to write MST3K's next chapter: to prove that we can #MakeMoreMST3K without depending on a network to keep us alive, and to #BuildTheGizmoplex, a unique online theater where MST3K can continue to grow.\nBut \u2013 and this is the important part \u2013 I also want to be cautious. We're all just crawling out from COVID, and it's been a difficult year. I know that things are more difficult for a lot of people than they were during our first Kickstarter. If you decide to pledge, please: only give what feels comfortable, even if it's just a few bucks. And if you can't afford anything, that's okay too! We'll find other ways for you to stay involved, and to make sure you can still get access to all of our new episodes and Gizmoplex events.\nThat's all: more than anything, please just take care of yourself... and if you can't help out right now, don't think twice about it. We'll still be here when you're ready.\nI guess that's everything, so... we've got 30 days. Let's see how this thing goes.\nCheers & Thanks,\nJoel\n\n\nHey, you're still here. So, I guess you want more details, huh?\nOh yeah, that's right. Thanks for reminding me.\nI think the Gizmoplex might be the biggest \"new idea\" we're working with this time around, so there are a lot of details and possibilities I'm excited to share with you as we go. Here's what you should know right away.\nHaving a Gizmoplex All-Access Pass has three important benefits:\n1. Live Premieres & Events: The Gizmoplex will host at least TWO LIVE EVENTS EVERY MONTH for our first year, where you can join me, our cast and writers, and some special surprise guests. Each event will be like a night at the theater, and will have a lot of fun surprises. Some of our ideas include theme nights hosted by our cast and special guests, live commentaries, and maybe even live riffing! Also, we won't just screen episodes: it'll be a real show, and could include new sketches, trailers (done \"MST3K style\"), live Q&A panel discussions, interviews, contests... and the return of the MST3K \"viewer mail\" segment! (And yes, if you can't make one, you'll be able to see it after.)\n2. The MST3K Watch Club: To make it easier to watch MST3K with your friends, the Gizmoplex will also be the official home of the MST3K Watch Club! Each month, you'll get on-demand access to a new selection of episodes, and the ability to host your own live screenings for up to 10 people! Anyone with a Gizmoplex Pass can join for free, and if you want to invite someone who doesn't, they can get a \"Day Pass\" for just $0.99!\n3. Gizmoplex Apps: Since we reached our second goal ($3.3M) we'll be able to develop apps that bring the Gizmoplex to mobile devices and TVs! Right now, the plan is to include apps for six of the most popular platforms: iOS, Android, AppleTV, AndroidTV, FireTV and Roku. And no promises, but we're also looking into apps for XBOX, PlayStation and Samsung TVs. Like Crow says: we're gonna conquer cyberspace, man! (Read more about the apps here.)\nSo, if you think about it, we think it's a pretty different model than we could pull off anywhere else. I really want the Gizmoplex to feel like something new: less like another Netflix with nothing but MST, and more like a charming, off the radar, suburban cineplex that plays movies for 99 cents, long after their first run.\nIf we get this right, the Gizmoplex Pass won't just give you a monthly subscription to a catalog of MST3K episodes, or a place to watch the episodes you own on-demand: it'll be more like a \"Season Pass\" that gives you tickets to every show at your favorite theater: front row, opening night, every time. Take that, Moviepass!\nYou can read a LOT more about our plans for the Gizmoplex in this Backer Update.\nAlso, even though this won't make a lot of sense until I give you more details, there's one more thing I want you to understand:\nThe Gizmoplex won't just be our new online theater and event space. It's also going to be an important new location that The Mads are creating on the show, and inside the world of Mystery Science Theater, as their next step toward world domination: the first cineplex on the moon!\nAnyway, I think it'll all make sense when you see it... but until then, remember, \u201cIt\u2019s just a show, I should really just relax.\u201d\nSo, there you have it: in a nutshell, this is what we want to do. After 33 years, it's time for Mystery Science \"Theater\" to have an actual (virtual) theater that MSTies can call their own. It's time... to #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nAny other questions?\nOh, wait. I think I know what you're going to ask. \nJust like last time, I'm sure some of you are wondering, so go ahead and ask. \nI knew that's what you were gonna ask! And since we're asking you to pledge some of your hard-earned money \u2013 especially after a difficult year \u2013 I want to be really open and transparent about this. So, let's break this down a little bit.\n1. Without a network supporting us, we need to fund everything ourselves. During our first Kickstarter, we estimated that, once production was up and running, we'd be able to produce new episodes for about $250K each. In the end, though, the budget for each new episode ended up being closer to $350K. For the last two seasons, we were able to cover the difference through our deal with Netflix... but this time, we're on our own. We've got a lot of ways we can keep the budget lower, but, you know... it's still going to cost something. And when you think about it, $350K for 90 minutes of television is still one of the best deals in show business.\n2. We still can't spend everything we raise on Kickstarter to make the show.\nCampaign Fees: Between Kickstarter and the credit card processor, we pay about 8% of your pledge in fees. There's also a fee for CrowdOx, the platform we'll use to manage all of your surveys and rewards after the campaign ends.\nMaking Rewards: We reserve about 20% of your pledge in order to design, produce, print, sort and pack all of your rewards. And that's not even including shipping, which we're not collecting until after our Kickstarter campaign ends!\nDedicated Support: During our first Kickstarter, we underestimated the amount of work involved in providing customer support and creating detailed backer updates, so we had to depend on volunteers to do a lot of it. This time, we want to make sure we're prepared, so we budgeted about 4% of each pledge for that.\nBuilding & Running the Gizmoplex: We really want the Gizmoplex to be great, but getting it started will take some work \u2013 and keeping it running also means we'll have some monthly fees to cover. We also need some budget to support all of the special live events we're planning to host. So, we're using about 3% of your pledge for that.\nWhen you put it all together, we have to spend about 35% of what we raise just to cover Kickstarter expenses, and to keep all the promises we're making to you.\n\n3. The more episodes we make, the less each one costs! Like we explained during our first Kickstarter, the basic idea is pretty simple: for some parts of production, we have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we're making.\nFor example, let's say that our writers realize the show needs a custom-built oversized rubber chicken. No matter how many episodes we have, it's going to cost $1000 to make. So, if we only use it in three episodes, we have to spend $333 per episode on a rubber chicken. But, if we use the chicken in twelve episodes, that $1000 goes a lot farther, and our rubber chicken kaiju only costs us $83 for each episode. Make sense?\n     Based on those numbers, you can see that the cost for each episode gets lower as the number of episodes goes up:\nSo yeah, just like our first Kickstarter, I know that a fair number of you won't care about these types of details... but since some of you will, we want to be as clear as possible.\n1. KEEP CIRCULATING THE URL. Back in the day, MST3K wasn\u2019t seen nationwide and we encouraged people to record the shows on VHS and send them to their friends and loved ones. It was our version of \u201cI Want My MTV.\u201d Every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged MSTies to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes,\u201d and you guys did. Then, in our last Kickstarter, we updated that to \"Keep Circulating the URL,\" and you did that too. Now, we've got a new URL, so we're asking you again:\n2. FOLLOW @MST3K ON SOCIAL MEDIA. Be sure you're following our account on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Those are one of our best ways to keep everyone up-to-date on what's going on, so encourage your fellow MSTies to follow them too! We really appreciate it, and we couldn\u2019t do it without you. You\u2019re like our virtual street team!\n3. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGE FROM EACH UPDATE. From now until our Kickstarter ends on May 7, most of the backer updates that we send will include a suggested message or image.

The world of Thrones & Bones is the sort of place where legends are born, and I have no doubt people are going to be talking about it in the same breath as DragonLance and Greyhawk in years to come. This is the start of something very special indeed.\u201d \u2014 George Mann, former Publishing Manager, Games Workshop and bestselling author\nThis first volume of the Thrones & Bones Campaign Setting contains approximately 200 pages of lore and mechanics for your 5th edition games. Within this lavishly illustrated tome, players and game masters will find over 60 pages of lore detailing the people, places, and perils of this northern land, as well as new races, subclasses, feats, spells, and magic items. Norr\u00f8ngard features a mechanic for gaining and losing honor, an original system of rune magic, a bestiary of 29 new monsters (well, 28 monsters and a very cute seal), as well as rules for playing the ball game of Knattleiker, the insult-rhyming competition called Flyting, and the in-world popular board game, Thrones & Bones. Two complete starter adventures kick off your exploration of this fascinating setting.  \nThrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard is gorgeously illustrated throughout with original artwork from such amazing artists as Andrew Bosley, Justin Gerard, Ksenia Kozhevnikova, Randall Mackey, Will O\u2019Brien, Craig J. Spearing, and Bryan Syme. It features original cartography from Rob Lazzaretti and battle maps from Heroic Maps (available in a Digital Map Pack for VTT or Printing).   \nCreator Lou Anders is a Hugo-winning editor, a Chesley-winning art director, and a critically acclaimed author with 25 years experience working in genre entertainment in magazines, television, film, book publishing, and role playing games. In addition to his own novels, Anders has written Star Wars stories for Disney Lucasfilm and has done RPG design for Kobold Press, River Horse Games, and 3D Printed Tabletop.\nEditor Misty Bourne provides more than twelve years of publishing experience, having worked on such projects as Mythic Odysseys of Theros (Wizards of the Coast), Underworld Lairs and Tome of Beasts 2 (Kobold Press), and the Epic Legacy series, Total Party Kill series, and Tyrants & Hellions (2CGaming). She edits Hit Point Press\u2019s \u201cBig Bads\u201d (2020 silver ENNIE winner) and is the author of HPP\u2019s Animated Tarot.\nThrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard presents a world ten years in the making.  Although the Thrones & Bones trilogy is a middle grade series, Thrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard is not a children's RPG. This first volume in a planned series greatly expands on the lore of the novel, and as such, presents a rich, Norse-inspired realm that stands on its own and which promises hours of adventure for 5th edition fans of all ages. Take the first steps into a world of adventure today. \nThe Raven Guard, the Hrafnhird, are a group of 9 elite warriors who protect Norr\u00f8ngard at the king's command. A special, limited reward tier allows you to help us craft one of these 9 warriors. We'll work with you to determine their name and specific characteristics, then we will use your own likeness, or another you prefer, to create their appearance. Futhermore, your name will appear in the credits of the book. Be a part of Norr\u00f8ngard history forever! Limited to 9 backers. (Update: This tier has SOLD OUT!)  \nThe Troll King, Digr Miklimunnr, came to his position by being both the largest forest troll in all of Norr\u00f8ngard and Ymiria, and the only troll ever reported to have not one or two but three heads. A special, limited reward tier allows you to become one of the Troll King's three heads. We will use your own likeness, or another you prefer, to create the appearance of one of Miklimunnr's heads. Futhermore, your name will appear in the credits of the book. Be a part of Norr\u00f8ngard history forever! Limited to 3 backers (for obvious reasons). \nIn collaboration with Andrew Mills and Mike Sheridan at Alter3dimensya, we're proud to be able to offer the 3D printable Thrones & Bones Board Game Arena as an add-on available to all pledge tiers. This add-on will include files for 3D printing a Thrones & Bones board game with two variant sides. One side will be a faux-wood textured frame with the Thrones & Bones logo, for using the board game as intened (as a board game). The other will be stone stadium seating, for when you want to use the board game in your RPGs as a \"life-sized\" arena upon which the player characters must fight to the death. Also included are LED torches for adding lights to the corners of the board game when it is used in the arena configuration.  (Note that this add-on is for downloadable .stl files, not physical product, and that the final version may differ slightly from what is pictured here. The retail version of the Thrones & Bones Board Game Arena available after the Kickstarter is expected to cost approximately $35.) \nIn collaboration with Heroic Maps, we're proud to offer the Thrones & Bones VTT Map Pack, already included at certain pledge levels. This digital map pack will include all the maps needed to run the two adventures included with the Thrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard book, offered here at a sizable discount, as the retail version of the Map Pack available after the Kickstarter is expected to cost approximately $75.  \nIn collaboration with David Joseph Wesley, the Thrones & Bones Original RPG Soundtrack will be 30 to 45 minutes of instrumental music designed to accompany you on your adventures in Norr\u00f8ngard. For a taste of this Grammy-nominated composer's work, you can listen to his song \"Midwinter\" here. The Thrones & Bones Original RPG Soundtrack album will be delivered via Bandcamp, available as a high quality download in MP3, FLAC, and more.  \nDelivery of digital products\nAll digital products will be sent to every backer via email through DriveThruRPG.\nDelivery of physical products\nAll physcal products will be sent to every backer through DriveThruRPG.\nShipping costs are not included in any of the listed prices. Because of postal variations and yearly increases in shipping costs, the shipping for print rewards is calculated and charged in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter closes.\nPricing estimates here:\nhttps://support.drivethrurpg.com/hc/en-us/articles/209936893-Estimated-Shipping-Costs-For-Printed-Products\nIf you'd like a preview of the setting, you can listen right now to Part 1 and Part 2 of \"The Aptrgangr's Challenge,\" an actual play podcast of the first adventure in the book from the good folks at Table Talk. The episode is available on iTunes and Spotify and here is the direct link to their page. More episodes will be posted as they become available.\nMore information on the Thrones & Bones series, from which the campaign setting originates, can be found here. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a low risk Kickstarter. To minimize the risk, the entire book has been written, illustrated, and designed prior to the launch. It is with a copyeditor now. In other words, THE PROJECT IS 99.9% DONE. Funding is for recouping the investment that has already been made, and stretch goals are to acquire even more artwork and to bring in other designers to add additional adventures to the setting. In other words, the book is happening. Funding and stretch goals only make it that much more amazing. \n\nAlthough it is my first Kickstarter, prior to becoming a full-time author, I worked as an editor and art director in science fiction and fantasy publishing for fifteen years, winning both a Hugo award for editing and a Chesley award for art direction during that time. Before that, I had five years experience working in science fiction and fantasy magazines. I've been a full-time writer since 2014, and I have also written RPG content for Kobold Press, River Horse, and 3D Printed Tabletop. All together, I have over 25 years of experience writing, editing, art directing, and presenting imaginative content. \n\nFinally, I believe very firmly in seeking the advice of smart people and listening to them.

The copyedits were delivered a while ago, and I am slowly updating the text to replace it with the copyedited text. Nearly done with chapter 2 (of 5) there. And I can't stop making monsters. We've got 37 of them in the bestiary now, the most recent additions being the \u00e4lva (a fairy from Scandinavian folklore), the galtifer\u00f0 (a ghostly pig of my own invention), and the hyldemoer (a creature from Scandinavian myth that is sort of a cross between an awakened tree, a dryad, and a hag). Of course, all these new monsters need artwork, and the last of that is coming in now through early July, along with a couple additional spot and half page illustrations commissioend just to fill in some gaps.

The is nearly complete with only print-testing of the arena portion remaining. And Grammy-nominated composer David Jospeh Wesley has begun work on the Although this is subject to change, the idea we are working towards is to have a \"theme song\" followed by music that matches the key settings in all eight of the adventures from the two books.

Please join us as we raise funds to continue our coverage of board games and the wonderful people who play them.\nWe are a group of gamers dedicated to growing and promoting the board game hobby and those who enjoy it. Tom Vasel, Zee Garcia, Roy Cannaday, Mike Dilisio, and many others produce weekly videos covering hundreds of different games both new and classic. Additionally, Eric Summerer, Suzanne Sheldon, Mandi Hutchinson, and Tom produce a weekly podcast all about games and the people who play them.\nBut that's not all! We also provide you with news, variety shows (such as Board Game Breakfast), a series of popular \"Top Ten\" videos, shopping guides, and more! All of this can be found at our website - www.dicetower.com.\nOur show gets a majority of its funding from our Kickstarter campaign each year. We have seven full-time employees and four part-time employees. Like so many of you, we had various plans last year which were disrupted.  We pivoted into a ton of live coverage instead.  This year our goals are to:\n Continue to produce regular live content on a set schedule \nIncrease interaction with our listeners\n Continue to increase the quality of our current YouTube shows \n Produce more top ten lists with special guests \n Upgrade our equipment \nYou might notice that these are very similar to our goals in 2020, and that's because I want to focus even more on the quality of our streaming.  The Winter Spectacular was something we worked hard on, and we believe we can bring ALL of our content up to that level.  In this campaign, we have a myriad of cool rewards but we hope that your main goal in supporting this campaign is keeping the Dice Tower on the air.\nWe are dedicated to keeping the show and our videos free for download and viewing, and we appreciate you helping us in reaching that goal.  We ask you to consider giving above and beyond the cost of the rewards to maximize what we can do this year!\nPLAY\n\nGoing beyond our goal will allow us to do more for you on the channel!  Here are some of our stretch goals!\n\nWe have a pile of wonderful rewards to send out to you as a gift for backing our campaign.  We know the value of these rewards does not come close to the amount you are donating to the show but they are simply a small \"thank you\" gift that we are sending as a token of our appreciation.  We also ask that you look at them that way - to donate money to the show is the main goal of this campaign.\nThe following promos each have their own pledge level, but also can be added to a regular pledge.  Simply add the amount to your pledge and you can choose which ones you want at the end of the campaign.  Realize that some add-ons will accrue more international shipping at the end of the campaign.\nThere will also be some add-ons that are only added on in the pledge manager.  These will include (but are not limited to) promos from last year, and more!\nWe can only fit in a limited number of these rewards, so they are unlikely to be available in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter.\nEach Thursday, we do a live show of Boardgame Breakfast!  Want to show us up in the trivia section?  Backers will show up live in one of our Thursday Breakfasts for the game show section!\nWant your own Dice person?  Tina will draw you (based on a picture you send in) in the color die of your choice.

It's taken a while and a little bit of courage but I've decided to try and release a fully-illustrated compendium of all the magic tattoos I have created over my time DMing for my parties. Magic tattoos are special in that they allow you an extra level of character customization (look that much more badass) while simultaneously granting you unique and interesting abilities (be that much more badass)! Why not give it a shot, right? There will be more than 120+ illustrated, never-before-seen, and functional magic tattoos, with much more to come depending on the stretch goals we reach!\nThe tattoos will also all be tweaked to be more in line with the ones being introduced to us in recent 5e releases. All the tats you'll find in this book will have some amazing flavor of their own, which will set them apart from the limited selection of existing magic tattoos and the large pool of magic items already out there!\nThe Elongating Tattoo presents some interesting new opportunities...\nFor one, all the magic tattoos you will find in this book are tailored to work in tandem with specific body parts! For example, tattoos like the Soaring Tattoo will grant you majestic inky wings when applied on your back (and only your back)! The Tome of Mystical Tattoos will also show you exactly how each beautiful tattoo would look on the optimal limbs alongside a detailed flat sketch for a clear view of all the designs. Beautiful full-page illustrations are also in the works showcasing the wide variety, utility, and power of the tattoos within this compendium. \nHonestly, the best way to show you the type of quality and content you can expect from this project is simply... to show you! You can click up there to download a sneak peek which includes some of the new tattoo mechanics, and at least 2 fully-illustrated and fleshed-out tattoos from each of the six sections of the Tome of Mystical Tattoos. \nHey again! I'm Karl Nicolas (he/him), a librarian, writer, and editor. I also manage the day-to-day of Natwuns as the creative director. We create beautifully illustrated maps for tabletop games along with other assets. This can range from monsters and NPC characters to magic items or comics, depending on our mood! I'm an avid D&D player and DM, and I am thoroughly in love with the imagination and creativity that this beloved game inspires. For this project, I want to produce the best possible book that I can for all of you, and I'll be working with some talented editors and artists to supplement my work in whatever way possible to deliver on that promise! \nYou can also check out our website at natwuns.com to subscribe to our newsletter, check out our social media to follow along with this project's progress, and anything else coming down the pipeline.\nTattooist's Tools... I wonder what those do...\nThis wouldn't be as much fun if we didn't fiddle around with the system a little, right? In the Tome of Mystical Tattoos, I will outline a system that explains the mechanics of things like obtaining tattoo designs, recreating found designs, and how the new artisan's tool - the Tattooist's Tools - fits into all this. I promise this will be a fun addition and something that you can forego completely anyway if you're only interested in some kickass tats! \nUnlocked Stretch Goals\n$5000 - UNLOCKED - 10 more tattoos in the \"Head\" section of the book - a total of 30 instead of 20!

Nope, that's definitely a mystical tattoo!\nSummoning is not beyond the magical tattoos in this book.\nNeither is domination for that matter...\nWould you like a full magical sleeve, perhaps?\nNo body part is off-limits! Well... maybe some.\nAfter you choose to back this project for the hardcover book reward in one of our tiers, you will be sent a link to purchase the book at cost from DriveThruRPG. DriveThruRPG Print on Demand services will print the book at-cost (this would probably be in the range of $15 to $25 US) and then shipping costs to your address will be calculated. This is honestly the most cost-effective way for you to receive the hardcover book, especially at this time. It reduces overheard and allows you to buy the book cheaper than if I opted to include the printing and shipping costs in the Kickstarter reward.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " LAST 24 HOURS! \nSkies of Sordane is live!  \nThe Skies of Sordane has now launched! After a bit of a delay (sorry about that everyone!), my team and I are now ready to present the Skies of Sordane Kickstarter!\nThis Kickstarter's goal is provide a high quality range airship and miniature STL files for your 3D printers (Both FDM and resin printers!). All miniatures will be test printed on multiple FDM and resin printers to ensure quality. After the campaign ends (if successfully funded) we will roll out miniatures after they are tested and completed!\nAll miniatures will be sculpted for 32mm/35mm scale!\nNote: This is for digital files only. Physical products will have to be purchased from our licensed sellers.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nMy name is Benny, I've been playing D&D for over 20 years now and love that I can still be inspired by others. As most of you can probably tell, I was inspired by Eberron this time! I said to myself \u201cI need some airships in my life!\u201d .. I couldn\u2019t stop writing lore and before I knew it, Sordane and its Skies were born!\nKickstarter allows us to present to you all the work we have been doing and the work we intend to complete and provide to the masses. We've take a long time, put in a great deal of effort and thought to create 5 awesome bundles each with their own unique feel while still remaining individually to one another within each bundle.\n3D printing has opened the world up for us DMs to make supremely customized sessions for our players. Since becoming a 3D printing advocate, my players and I have enjoy vibrant sessions on terrain and settings that feel exactly as they should!\nCore Bundles\nThere are 5 Core Bundles. Each bundle has 1 airship and 6 crew miniatures. All files will be printable on filament and resin printers (and will be tested on multiple printers of each type before sending out the files!). \nReward Tiers\nThere are reward tiers for 1, 2 or all of the Core Bundles. There is even a cheaper all in pledge that gives everything except the 2 larger ships (Arrodan Syndicate and Cin'dar Navy Core Bundles' ships) that will not be printable on small resin printers. The 3 other ships will be printable on small resin printers! Large resin printers and normal medium FDM printers will be able to print all 5 ships.\nMerchant Tier\nWe have a special merchant tier available to everyone who is looking to sell printed miniatures from our range of products. Our merchant licensing program is still in the works, but you can sign up for it right now! \nYou will be paying a small admin fee and 10% from all sales. Every month you will send us a report in a format provided from us.\nFirst year - $60 CAD admin fee (included in your pledge) + 10% of sales\nEvery year after - $30 license fee + 10% of sales\nThere will be no $100s paid yearly for your license fees. Stay tuned for more information on this as the campaign continues.\nPrinter Preparations\nShips will be keyed and sliced up for different sizes of printers. The 3 initial sizes are:\nAllstretch goal ships will be printable on small resin printers and The Fleet reward tier with only 3 of the ships, will include every stretch goal just like The Armada tier. The only difference is the absence of the 2 large ships!\nSmall resin printers from Photon and Mars sizes and up. \nMedium sized FDM printers like the Ender 3 and up\nLarge volume resin printers like the Transform.\nAesthetics\nThe aesthetics of Sordane and its many airships and races, are inspired by arcanapunk fantasy. The world is very much still high fantasy (dragons, swords, magic, etc), but magic makes life more interesting, deadly and ultimately more fun by introducing a high level of technology created from magic! It is entwined into every element of the existence of this world. \nNote: if you don't like the way something looks, the stretch goals will provide great amounts of additional miniatures and modular options for the core minis and ships. Please don't be afraid to make recommendations of stuff you would like to see in the stretch goals! Only the first initial stretch goals are set. More will come later!\nCin'dar Navy Corsairs from the Cin'dar Navy Core Bundle\nThe Gleaming Shard from the Artificer Guilds Core Bundle\nTesting out some homebrew rules with a couple of the ships =)\nShoal Class Trade Barge from the Merchant Guilds Core Bundle\nSize comparison of the 5 Core Bundle ships!\nCin'dar Navy\nThe Cin'dar Navy is one of the greatest fighting forces in the skies of Sordane. They are well equipped and patrol, not only their own territory, but that of neighbouring nations that pay tribute to the crown of Cin'dar for its protection of their trading and passenger routes.\nThe Ship - Roshan Class Cruiser - These massive ships are the main battle might of the Cin'dar Navy. Aside from the legendary Titan Class Battleships, they are equipped with powerful fighting forces and impressive armaments. There are almost no other ships known to the continent that exists that can go 1 on 1 with a Roshan Class Cruiser.\nThe Crew - Cin'dar Corsairs - The Cin'dar Corsairs are the grizzled backbone of the Cin'dar Navy. Ranging from eager fresh recruits to war-hardened veterans, the Cin'dar Corsairs are a righteous organisation of warriors that sail the skies of Bordair exterminating pirates and keeping the peace - Cin'dar's peace...\nCin'dar Navy Core Bundle\nMerchant Guilds\nThe world of Sordane has 9 continents and many nations on each of them. The powerful Merchant Guilds control most of the economic life blood. They travel the skies moving people, resources and riches all around the globe to seek their piece of the pie and live better lives.\nThe Ship - Shoal Class Trade Barge - The Shoal Class Trade Barge is a mainstay in the Merchant Guilds of Sordane. Heavily armoured, slow, but reliable, they populate the skies of the trade routes and above the major cities. The Trader Guilds save money and spend less on their ships. Opting for the less expensive Shard Blimps. Powered by engines with smaller crystal shards providing magical vapors. While slower and less advanced, they attract less attention from raiders and pirates.\nThe Crew - Mercenaries - The Merchant Guilds often hire mercenaries to travel the skies with them. These mercenary contracts are often short term as typically adventurers will barter for payment and free passage from one city to another parting ways on arrival in order to provide protection. Pirates need be wary for these seemingly innocuous ships can often contain a very combat capable crew of guardian adventurers.\nMerchant Guilds Core Bundle\nArrodan Syndicate\nThe Arrodan Syndicate is known as the Arrodan Guild by most. But  unlike most, they live outside the law in most of the nations where their operations can be found. Their size and influence provide their leadership with unparalleled protection from the authorities in the nations in which they operate and some even say they run several nations as a shadow organisation. No one knows their true numbers and they are entirely nomadic in nature and they are spread far and wide.\nThe Ship - Geshtar Class HQ Airship - The Geshtar HQ ships are from where the Syndicate operates out of. These flying fortresses have entire communities living aboard them. They are slow, but incredibly powerful and the focal point of any large scale battle. Few ships command the respect that even 1 of these monstrosities does.\nThe Crew - Ardragoons - The warriors of the Syndicate are known as the Ardragoons. They are a fierce and loyal fighting force of powerful wizards and fighters. Children are stolen from orphanages or taken from defeated enemies. Ardragoon training methods rely on creating new family bonds within the group. Indoctrination is how they operate and power is what they respect.\nArrodan Syndicate Core Bundle\nCarren Pirates\nThe Carren Pirates are one of many criminal organisations. While not massive, they are  well known for operating along the Chill Mountains between the nations of Cin'dar and Kaydlen. Their numbers are large enough to require frequent patrols from both nations in order to stem the acts of piracy in the region.\nThe Ship - Sintel Class Frigate\nThe Sintel Class Frigates  are a dated, still used, Cin'dar Navy mainstay. They are cheap, reliable and battle ready. After the war with the Oldathar nation, Cin'dar decommissioned older frigates and left them in storage yards. During a great heist, the pirate king Histalethen broke in with his crews and stole 20 older decommissioned Sintel Frigates.\nThe Crew - Carren Raiders\nThe Carren Raiders come from all over Bordair. Typically poor or less well off citizens of the various nations are recruited when they are young and impressionable. They are promised riches and freedom from past hardships. They often have deep connections with the well organised crime syndicates in the larger cities where the Carren Raiders need help to sell their ill-gotten gains.\nCarren Pirates Core Bundle\n\nArtificer Guilds\nThe Artificer Guilds across Sordane have a reputation for creating the most useful, powerful and dangerous items in the world. There are many guilds, but only few hold enough power to create such powerful ships as The Gleaming Shard. Crews often consist of wizards, artificers and their bodyguard creations.\nThe Ship - The Gleaming Shard\nThe Gleaming Shard is one of the most advanced ships in Sordane. While there are other comparably powerful ships, when complimented with it's powerful crew, it's nearly unstoppable. The Shard is also used by the guild to study the stars, nature of the surface and the volatile nature of Sordane.\nThe Crew - Watchers of the Shard\nThe Watchers of the Shard are a group of powerful artificers and guardians personally selected by Jexal to crew the Gleaming Shard - pride of the guild. These crew are battle hardened and employ all manner of magical aerial tactics. \nArtificer Guilds Core Bundle\nKickstarter Exclusive Monster Mini\nThe Arcane Dragon will be available to the following reward tiers for free:\nThe Fleet\nThe Armada\nMerchants of Sordane\nIt's just added value on top of everything else. I really hope that those of you who are on the lower tiers don't feel left out. Nothing is being taken away from your pledges and you're still getting the 2 Skycoaches completely free no matter what tier you are on. That's still some pretty awesome value!\nIf I know anything about Lee and his abilities, this dragon is going to be AMAZING. Head on over to his Patreon and check him out. https://www.patreon.com/minimonstermayhem/posts.\nNote: If you upgrade your pledge or late pledge to one of the included tiers up until the end of May, you will still receive the dragon file. After that, it will never be sold again.\nKickstarter Exclusive Arcane Dragon (lore to follow later)\n50 Cast n Play Bases For All Tiers!\nCast n Play have provided us with 50 of their bases for ALL TIERS. You read that right. We just added a ton of beautiful bases to our campaign for you to print out for your minis. They feature many different useful terrains!\nPlayable Interiors\nWe unlocked them at $160k and that will allow us to make interiors for every ship in the campaign. This Stretch Goal will add some initial development time to each Core Bundle, but we will still try to get the bundles out as we had planned before (one at a time and release them likely in pairs or singular 1 month apart or so).\nIf you are not interested in printing your ship with the playable interiors, you can still print the solid form pieces of each ship. This is simply an added option =)\nAll 4 levels of the Carren Pirates Sintel Class Frigate\nPrototype Work in Progress\nAs you can see from the images, we have finished the first draft of the ship, but there will be more work required as we go forward and we will be continuing to review and improve. Some things are final, some things are not. This ship will be the biggest of the medium ships (some of the stretch goal ships may be on this level as well like the brain flayers).\nThere a few things to note about the ships and their interior designs going forward:\nThe ships will have open spaces and closed rooms like you see on the lowest level of the example ship and the 3rd level with the engine room, brig and cannon battery. Lots of space, but they will have predefined areas\nOn the prototype the internal doors are solid, but we will be engineering a way for them to either be removable or able to open! Stay tuned for updates =)\nThe main deck or the \"2nd level\" of the Carren Pirate Sintel Class Frigate\nThe main deck or the \"3rd level\" of the Carren Pirate Sintel Class Frigate\nShip Dimensions\nThe dimensions of the Carren Pirate Ship are the largest of the 3 medium ships in the Core Bundles. It is about 70 cm long, 26 cm wide (excluding the propellers), and about 8-9 cm in height per level. It's not small =). The interior you get is expansive. I already have multiple sessions planned on this bad boy. The Merchant Shoal Class Barge and The Gleaming Shard are both around 50 cm long each and a little bit skinnier in deck space than the Sintel Frigate. They will each have 1-2 internal decks along with the top deck. The Arrodan Syndicate Geshtar and the Cin'dar Navy Roshan Cruiser will both have 4-6 decks (they are big!)\nThis specific ship will be one of the 3 medium ships (and all stretch goal ships) that will be pieced and keyed for small resin printers from the Anycubic Photon and larger. It's obviously not a quick build, but it will be with you forever and it will provide many great playing experiences. I am currently printing off the prototype right now on my Transform printers so I should have some updates for you of actual printed ship layers in a couple of days. Look for updates on the smaller sliced and keyed versions coming soon!\nNote: There will be assembly instructions with every ship for each of the different sizes of sliced versions! (small resin, medium, etc)\nThe main deck or the \"4th level\" of the Carren Pirate Sintel Class Frigate\nAs promised, I have taken 4 popular Stretch Goals that were unsuccessfully voted for from the survey and moved them over to addons for people to help chip to reach more Stretch Goals!\nThese 4 Addons are just that - additional content. These would have been developed outside of the campaign eventually, but since we want to give you guys a chance for more stretch goals, we are adding them to the back end of the campaign for that extra push! (see below for How It Works)\nHow It Works\nOn each Addon, you will see a dollar amount (in Canadian dollars!) to add to your pledge for each addon. Simply change your pledge and increase the $ amount for the number of addons you want. You will be allowed to select your addons in the MyMiniFactory pledge manager at the end of the campaign\nIncreasing Your Pledge Amount\nIf you're not sure how to increase your pledge amount, it's pretty simple. Just go to the top of this campaign page and click the button that says \"Manage your pledge\" \nFrom here, you will click on \"Change your pledge\" and simply increase the $ amount by which addons you would like! For example, the Roc + the Rules Guide would be an additional CA$14. All of them would be CA$ 34 .\nDelivery\nAddons will be done after the Core Bundles are delivered. Same as the regular stretch goals! (The Rules Guide may come out earlier).\n\nBy popular request, we now have a Social Stretch Goal that we can reach! If we get 100 backers from the shared link below, we will unlock 3 unique halfling pterodactyl riders! (Please make sure you tell your friends to actually pick a tier - $1 donations will not be counted towards this goal!) - We have unlocked this stretch goal!!\nUNLOCKED!\nStretch Goal Link:  https://bit.ly/2HAT5cV\n\nMyMiniFactory Pledge Manager\nWhenever we are ready to start delivering files, currently planned for April tentatively,  your pledge will be accessible via the MyMiniFactory Pledge Manager.\nThe MyMiniFactory Pledge Manager is designed for seamless STL file fulfillment.

The base set of .STLs offer incredible value which will get greater with the more stretch goals achieved.\n A FREE .STL file is available here to test print for yourself, it also includes a Chitubox file if you happen to be printing on a resin unit. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5lxbh345cuumtq2/AAC3DwE0uusEhBaVH4zSQLv8a?dl=0\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere are the renders and original prints for each of the 25 base Dwarves. .STL files have versions with both an attached base or no base variations. \nPrinted physical models come attached to a black base as shown in the images and are printed in either Elegoo or Anycubic Grey resins. Models are on a 32mm base (apart from the Blacksmith who is on a 40mm, stretch goals might also vary).\nBackers of the digital tier will also receive the chitubox project files which contain the models hollowed and supported, the same files I used to print the models below. So if you have a resin machine such as the Elegoo Mars, Epax X1, Anycubic Photon etc... these files will just need slicing and should be ready to go :)\nDwarven Barkeep\nDwarven Barkeep Variant\nDwarven Travelling Merchant\nDwarven Brawler\nDwarven Brawler Variant\nDwarven Brawling Santa\nDwarven Santa\nDwarven Blacksmith\nDwarven Guardian\nDwarven Infantry\nDwarven Rogues\n Here are the stretch goals for this campaign. Work will start on these once the campaign has ended. Any new art will be featured here.\n\u00a32,000 - Undead Dwarf ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a32,500 - Dwarven Wizard ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a33,000 - Dwarven Cleric ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a33,500 - Dwarven Ranger/Hunter ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a34,000 - Dwarven Barbarian ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a34,500 - Dwarven Paladin ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a35,000 - Dwarven Death Knight ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a36,000 - Dwarven King ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a37,000 - Female Dwarves x 3 (Artificer/Engineer, Herbalist and Sorceress) ---- UNLOCKED!!!! \n\u00a37,750 - Dwarven Gravedigger ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\n\u00a38,500 - Beach Holiday Dwarf ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a311,000 - 3 Additional Female Dwarves (Warrior Tank, Paladin and Ranger/Hunter) ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a312,000 - 3 Additional Variants, Logger (based on the Barkeep), Druid (Based on the Wizard) and Chef Warrior (Based on the Chef and Santa) ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\nSOCIAL MEDIA STRETCH GOALS :\n25/25 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Guardian Variant ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n 50/50 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Coal Miner ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n75/75 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Chef ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\n\n104/100 Shares/Retweets - Female Dwarven Barkeep ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\nWe utilise a combination of Pixologic Zbrush and Autodesk Maya to create our models, Marmoset Toolbag is used to bring you the model renders and Chitubox Slicer is the software for prepping our 3D printing files.\nOnce we have a 3D file ready for printing we transfer it via USB to one of our 3D Printers. Our farm consists of several Elegoo Mars' MSLA printers along with a Kelant S400 for larger/bulk prints. Prints take varying amounts of time, to maximise hardware consumable life, as well as printing time, we pack our printbeds with more models as long as it doesn't reduce quality or success rate. We have a range of spare consumables and a supply of resin upfront for incoming work.\nOnce printed we clean our models using a 2 stage isopropyl clean. Models are then given time to dry before going into an ultrasonic bath in warm water. Once done, we remove supports and then submerge them into water and cure via UV lamps to be sure all the resin is completely solid. Models are given a mild isopropyl rub after they have cured/dried, finally they're glued to a base.\nWith regards to packaging and delivery, we like to recycle as much as we can so will re-use as much packaging as possible whilst also keeping the models safe. We use a combination of boxes, sponge and padding(like bubble wrap) to ensure models are well protected.\nOnce the campaign has ended production will begin. .STL files will be sent out for the base models soon after campaign end to those that pledged for them. \nIf you have pledged to a physical tier we'll need to know which of the Dwarves you wish to get in your pledge, this can include stretch goal Dwarves that have been made at the time, although the manufacturer of these might delay your order slightly. Once the campaign is over and all the pledges tallied we'll send out a survey asking which models you would like, you can also email - EpicsNStuffs@gmail.com with any questions or queries.\nProduction on both the stretch goals and physical prints will happen simultaneously. If people would like to purchase additional physical prints of the stretch goals if reached then they will be able to at additional cost. You can add additional models by adding the value of them to your pledge (\u00a310 for 1, \u00a315 for 2, \u00a319 for 3 and \u00a322 for 4). If you do this please send us a message either via the above email or direct PM and we'll add a note to your pledge and reference it once all pledges have been processed.\nUPDATES - We'll publish updates to the Kickstarter as and when they're needed prior to the campaign ending as well as keeping people informed on progress once production has began. This campaign will have email: EpicsNStuffs@gmail.com dedicated to it, any communication should come to this email to get a fast reply. \nShipping costs added when you pledge, nothing else is added once the campaign ends. We have shipped plenty of these miniatures around the world, this is simply how much it costs and includes the packaging and postal charges. \nEstimated delivery for this project is June 2020/July 2020. There may be minor delays caused by factors that are not under our control such as postage delays or customs. We haven't currently experienced this in current store sales but there is always the risk of incidents outside of our control. We would endeavor to keep backers updated via the Kickstarter until all items are delivered.\n\"Please note the above estimate is based on a prediction we have done, if the KS becomes more successful than I thought this will cause the delivery date to shift.\" ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe base set of digital files are complete and have been printed by myself, so with regards to the digital base element of the project there is no risk at all. Additional digital stretch goals along with their test printing is also low risk as we have a track record of producing such assets in a timely manner.\n\nWe have delivered over 50 physical miniatures via online stores since enabling this feature a little over a month ago and have received brilliant feedback. We have scaled up to accommodate targets outlined in the kickstarter in terms of hardware and consumables needed for printing.\n\nIn crowdfunding projects there are always certain variables that could escape the initial plan. As a consequence there is always the possibility of a delay in delivery although delivery estimates for physical items are currently very conservative. These delays are typically caused by last minute additions to the campaign, such as new Stretch Goals, or are a delay within the shipping process itself such as problems with customs releasing the goods, there is always the potential for 3D printer hardware issues however we have spares and the means to purchase additional hardware if required.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Digital", "descp": "This pledge grants you access to all the digital .STL files for the Dwarven miniatures so you can print them at yourself.\n.STL files will be delivered via a download link and will not have shipping costs.\nINCLUDES:\n.STL Files delivered via Dropbox or My Mini Factory\nAll Models Test Printed", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["1,005 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Physical x 1", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 1 x Dwarven miniature 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n1 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (16 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Physical x 2", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 2 x Dwarven miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n2 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (11 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a319 or more", "title": "Physical x 3", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 3 x Dwarven miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n3 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers", "Limited (7 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a334 or more", "title": "Physical Rogues", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to the 8 x Dwarven Rogue variation miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n8 x Dwarven Rogues (1 of each variant)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (5 left of 5)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a388 or more", "title": "Physical -

The adventure includes pre-generated characters, and is playable as part of a campaign or as stand-alone play. Doom on the Warden is a new frontier for Metamorphosis Alpha, in both style and substance, and for the first time the pre-generated characters include wolfoids.\nFloating Above the Starship Warden...\nThink you know everything about the starship Warden?\nThink again!\nIt was a little-known fact that the colonization starship Warden had many discrete safeguards and catastrophe protocols in place should complications arise during its long voyage. These safeguards proved insufficient to protect the Warden when it encountered the radiation cloud. When the ship\u2019s computers analyzed the impending threat, the military A.I. enacted the Omicron Protocols, causing a portion of the ship\u2019s dorsal hull to disengage. This portion, hidden within the Warden\u2019s outer bulkhead, contains the classified military cantonment, code named \u201cLevel 0.\u201d\nUncontrollably drifting through uncharted space, mankind\u2019s first colonization starship Warden has survived for over 300 years. While floating through the interstellar dark, strange civilizations have arisen - mutant, human, and wolfoid. Battles have been fought, wars have been waged, and finally the end is near\u2026if anyone survives. The moment has come to repair the Warden and return it on its course \u2013 or to disable it forever.\nIn 1976, TSR published Metamorphosis Alpha, the very first sci-fi RPG, written by James M. Ward.\nIn 2014, Goodman Games worked with Mr. Ward to re-release Metamorphosis Alpha in a deluxe hardcover edition.\nIn 2016, Goodman Games released Epsilon City, the largest expansion to Metamorphosis Alpha since its debut.\nNow, in 2020, James M. Ward is back with an adventure to rival the deadliest crafted by the mind of Gary Gygax, Tomb of Horrors. Goodman Games brings you Doom on the Warden, the adventure that changes Metamorphosis Alpha forever!\nColor cover edition of Doom on the Warden\nAbout the Product\nSince the release of Metamorphosis Alpha, the story of the starship Warden has continued unchanged, but that ends now. Doom on the Warden is the first-ever official Metamorphosis Alpha adventure that continues the story and answers the question\u2026What next?\nFormat: Doom on the Warden will be published as an 8.5\u201dx11\u201d hardcover, with an estimated length of 32-48 pages. (This will likely grow with stretch goals.) The hardcover is available with a color cover, or in a gold foil edition. \nAuthor: Mr. James M. Ward is the creator of Metamorphosis Alpha and a 44-year veteran of the gaming industry, with prior creative credits that include Gamma World as well as many D&D products during his time as a creator and Vice President with TSR. Mr. Ward has already completed the manuscript, expanding on materials, playtests, and notes built over a lifetime of gaming, including some that trace back even to his famed original campaign.\nContent: Doom on the Warden is packed with the answers to the starship Warden\u2019s biggest mysteries!\nThe Adventure: James M. Ward\u2019s most devious adventure ever! Part hex crawl, part deadly delve. Forty-four years after the original release of Metamorphosis Alpha, the story of the second half of the voyage is finally being told.\nCampaign-Style Play: Drop this adventure into your ongoing campaign to turn everything on its head. Complacent denizens of the starship Warden will find themselves racing to uncover the deepest of the Warden\u2019s secrets, and to restore its course.\nConvention-Style Play: Three teams of pre-generated characters, each with their own individual reasons for undertaking this deadly quest, are ready to populate your table as the adventure was originally run.\nThe Maps: A map of the mysterious \u201cLevel 0\u201d and the military command dome found within.\nWhat is Metamorphosis Alpha?\nMetamorphosis Alpha is the original science-fiction tabletop role playing game in which the players are passengers on the interstellar colony ship Warden. Struck by radiation, the ship\u2019s occupants have mutated into unusual and deadly creatures. After several generations, civilization has been cast into ruins, and there is little knowledge of how to use the technology of the Warden. Reduced to tribal barbarians, they must struggle to survive amidst a backdrop of advanced technology, mutant monsters, and the vast spaces on an intergalactic colony ship.\nNeed a copy of the original rules? Goodman Games publishes a Metamorphosis Alpha Collector\u2019s Edition, which reprints the original 1976 first edition rules set. The collector\u2019s edition also reprints all the original Dragon magazine material for Metamorphosis Alpha, and has new content as well. It is available as both a softcover and deluxe oversized hardcover edition, as well as a foil oversized hardcover, and can be purchased as an add-on to this campaign.\nFoil cover edition of Doom on the Warden (mockup)\nWhat is Doom on the Warden?\nAt its core, Doom on the Warden is a horror story. Characters enter a strange, secluded location and are immediately confronted by incomprehensible foes who often strike without warning. Mad voices taunt them and, no matter how prepared the characters think they are, they are in truth out of their depth. Whether it is the primal dread of the shroud of darkness or the maddening uncertainty that vital equipment will work when called upon, the referee should emphasize the horrific elements of each region, seeking to unsettle not only the characters but the players themselves.\nThe adventure expands on the mysterious involvement of Earth\u2019s military aboard the starship Warden, previously mentioned in The Warden Armory and the Goodman Games Gazette. There is new information on what happened in the Warden\u2019s early days. Unraveling the mystery sends the characters through 4 distinct geographical regions, into the secret military command dome, and beyond. Along the way, they will be confronted by threats old and new across 54 possible encounter areas.\nThe Stretch Goals\nWe love Metamorphosis Alpha as much as you, so we\u2019ve outlined a series of stretch goals to elevate your experiences aboard the starship Warden. Here is the breakdown of stretch goals, which may evolve over the course of the campaign:\nStretch goal #1 ($7,000): CLEARED! First set of printable reference cards. There are 100+ creatures, weapons, and items to encounter in this adventure. We would like to create simple cards to summarize them for players and judges alike. These will be provided in PDF format and can be printed for use in game. This first stretch goal will cover creation of approximately 30 such cards, which should encompass most of the weapons in this adventure. \nStretch goal #2 ($12,000): CLEARED! Two new colored metal arm bands available as add-ons. First launched in our previous Metamorphosis Alpha projects, these metal arm bands mimic the control bands in the original game. These make great tabletop props and Mr. Ward allows their use in his convention games. At this stretch goal, we will manufacture two kinds of new bands: the bio-science band (first encountered in Level of the Lost), and the military command band (first seen in the Warden Armory). These will be add-ons available at $10 each.\nStretch goal #3 ($15,000): CLEARED! Second set of printable reference cards, similar to the goal above. This will be another 30 or so such cards, which should be enough to cover most of the items encountered in the adventure.\nBonus stretch goal! ($19,000) CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of Level of the Lost! \nStretch goal #4 ($22,000): CLEARED! Printed endsheets with great art to adorn them!\nBonus stretch goal! ($24,000): CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of The Android Underlords and Warden Adventures. \nBonus stretch goal! ($26,000) CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of Robots Among Us. \nStretch goal #5 ($27,000): CLEARED! Third set of printable reference cards, similar to the goal above. This will be another 30 or so such cards, which should cover most of the monsters, mutants, and robots encountered in the adventure.\nBonus stretch goal ($29,000): CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of The Mutation Manual.\nStretch goal #6 ($35,000):CLEARED!A sewn-in satin ribbon bookmark to hold your place when you run the adventure.\nStretch goal #7 ($45,000): Expanded page count on the printed books to include some or all of the reference cards. There are some printing parameters we'll have to verify but the goal is to get most or all of the reference cards printed and bound into the book.\nAnd beyond that...who knows?\nDoom on the Warden color arm bands (mockup)\nAdd-Ons\nThere are so many ways to support this Kickstarter!\nAdd-On Items from Previous Metamorphosis Alpha Projects: You can add any of the below print items to help support the Kickstarter and achieve stretch goals.\n Metamorphosis Alpha Collector\u2019s Edition, softcover edition, $30\n Metamorphosis Alpha Deluxe Collector\u2019s Edition, oversized hardcover edition, $80\n Metamorphosis Alpha Deluxe Collector\u2019s Edition, oversized hardcover gold foil edition, $120\n Metamorphosis Alpha deck plans illustration, 24\"x36\" poster, $20\n The Android Underlords (adventure), $10\n The Captain\u2019s Table (adventure), $10\n The Level of the Lost (adventure), $10\n Death Ziggurat in Zero-G (adventure), $10\n Warden Adventures (scenarios), $10\n What are the Prisoners of Rec-Loc-119?

These make great tabletop props and Mr. Ward allows their use in his convention games. Backers of Doom on the Warden will be able to add on bracelets at a cost of $10 each! We will do a fresh production run to meet demand. \nThe colors available are based on the previous two Metamorphosis Alpha Kickstarters, plus the two new ones from Doom on the Warden, and include all except the rare command band. The available colors are:\nFrom the original Metamorphosis Alpha: civilian (brown), ecology (green), security (red), engineering (gray), and medical (white) bands.\nFrom Epsilon City: military (black), programmer (yellow), sciences (light blue), administration (dark blue).\nFrom Doom on the Warden: bio-science band (first encountered in Level of the Lost), and the military command band (first seen in the Warden Armory).\nAdditional bands may be unlocked via stretch goals. Quantities are limited!\nPlease note: the arm bands must be shipped separately from books and will have a small incremental shipping charge applied after the Kickstarter (roughly equivalent to an extra $1-$2 per armband depending on destination.)\nTimeline for Release\nDoom on the Warden is scheduled to ship in September of 2020. Many of our previous Kickstarters have expanded significantly in scope as successive stretch goals are cleared. If this project expands significantly with new stretch goals, we will provide an update on release date.\nShipping & Handling\nShipping and handling costs are not included in the pledge levels. At the end of the Kickstarter, Shipping and handling charges will be invoiced via BackerKit. This allows us to add on stretch goals as the project expands. Expected cost of shipping/handling may change if the project evolves from a single hardcover. If you are unsure how expensive international shipping can be, please ask us for an estimate.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGoodman Games has run many Kickstarters and all have been successfully fulfilled.

While we ultimately expect to reach our typical fulfillment speeds, note that orders placed during this closed beta may take several months for fulfillment as we ramp up capacity. Fulfillment will be gradual, as we work through orders in the order they are received. \nThis timeline is our best estimate, but we will open submissions and start shipping orders as early as possible. Note that, in the case of high order volume, order submission for both hand-painted and 3D printed color miniatures may be made available in stages, with priority based on time of the pledge.

Our rendering and UI has re-imagined classic techniques for the digital world. Replicate the beautiful subtlety of dry brushing, ink-washing's ability to add depth, and much more. Printed designs will include subtle shading and lighting within the color texture, making details pop and adding fantastic realism to your design.\n\nBy giving you the option to hand-tune highlights, low-lights, shininess, hue shift and more, we will give you unparalleled design tools and let you see a whole new spectrum of possibilities.\nCutting Edge Manufacturing Technology\n3D printing has evolved at incredible speeds, with new technologies emerging all the time. We're happy to say that this thrilling new print technology means that highly detailed, color printed tabletop minis are finally possible! \nHigh-tech, full-color 3D printers turn pixels on the screen into atoms in your hand!\nColor is produced by mixing a range of color materials on the fly, allowing for full, vivid CMYK prints with beautiful gradients and detail. This technology employs dissolvable support materials, removing the need for support sprues and allowing for smoother, more consistent surfaces than ever before.\nThis plastic is similar in durability to our premium plastic material. Faint layer lines may be visible on the surface of the figures, especially in strong direct light.\nOne-Click Color Schemes \nNo need to have an art degree or knowledge of color theory to have fun coloring your character. You will be able to quickly paint your character in seconds, using a wide range of artist-designed color motif presets so you can \u201ctry on\u201d a wide range of color schemes or use them as a jumping-off point for your own design.\nA Multitude of Digital Paint Options\nWe'll offer a library of artist-tuned paint options for a wide range of materials. Experience the coloring-book joy of turning a character from grayscale to full, rich color quickly and easily!\n We'll also offer the ability to \"mix your own paint.\" Customize more than just the color: adjust shininess, highlight, mid-light, and low-light tones, and more. Your hand-crafted digital 'paints' will be saved with your character, allowing you to revisit and tweak them to your heart's content.\nTons of artistically tuned options for every material, all at your disposal!\nFive years ago, Kickstarter's support allowed us to launch revolutionary web-based design tools for custom miniatures.

We've continued to work tirelessly, adding content and working with the world-leading 3D printing service providers to deliver the latest and greatest technology--and the best custom miniatures on the market.\n\nSince our launch, we've expanded our tools and customization options.

And we're certainly not done yet! You'll even find several sneak-peeks at upcoming parts sprinkled throughout this very Kickstarter! We continue to develop new models for the site, prioritizing the most commonly requested additions. \nHero Forge adds new content every single week on what we call \"Treasure Tuesdays!\"\nWhy Kickstarter? \nKickstarter has been an incredible tool to help us connect with tabletop and miniatures fans. This direct connection has helped us work with our most passionate supporters and offers an avenue to hear about what features and content you'd like to see added.

In particular, for their creativity and dedication, we would like to thank Glenn De Leon Garza, Ilya Bondarenko, Roman and Vadim at ZugZug Art, and Rich Carey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Will reaching your funding goal distract you from adding new content? Color is great, but I want more stuff on Hero Forge too!\nA: Our modelers\u2019 time and effort will still be dedicated to new content, parts, fantasy races, and features, even as our tech development team works on color at the same time. With independent, focused effort by our art team, we anticipate accelerating additions to the site, even as we add our new color features.\n\nQ: Will I be able to redeem my reward for an \"XL\" or mounted \"XXL\" figure?\nA: For simplicity, we have set rewards for our standard size-range, unmounted figures. If you prefer to redeem your reward's value towards a more expensive XL or mounted figure, that's alright: we will apply your pledge value and you can pay the difference. Pricing on larger-sized XL and XXL figures is TBD.\n\nQ: I saw a part or feature in your video which isn't on your site yet! What's the story?\nA: We have new parts, features, and content in development constantly. In order to keep up with weekly content releases, our art team works diligently on future releases, both those near completion and ones much further away. If you don't recognize any particular parts on this page, chances are they are in development and will appear on the site in the future!\n\nQ: When are you going to add X part? Will Y feature be available when color launches?\nA: We process all feature and part requests through the following survey, so please feel free to fill it out to have your request added to our official user wish-list: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HeroForgeRequest. Our user request wishlist has many hundreds of unique entries, so we cannot provide estimated dates for specific additions.\n\nQ: Will Hero Forge 2.0 be backwards compatible?\nA: Yes! All of your existing characters and saves will be fully compatible with our new tools. You will be able to revisit old designs and add color.\n\nQ: Will digital download .stl files be available in color?\nA: No. Not initially, at least. File formats which support color are less widely supported by 3D printing software platforms, as color is not yet common for home 3D printers. While we expect to one day offer textured, color 3D model files, for the time being we will continue to distribute digital download model files in .stl format: the most commonly supported format for 3D printing software platforms.\n\nQ: What Printer are you using for your color prints?\nA: We plan to manufacture full color prints using the Mimaki 3DUJ-553 full color printer. We have experimented with a wide range of color printers, and have found this technology to offer the most vivid color, cleanest gradients, and best quality at miniature scale. At Hero Forge, we are always exploring the latest and greatest materials, and have historically added to or updating our material options as 3D print technology improves--this is always a possibility for the future.\n\nQ: Do I have to use all my rewards at once, or can I order figures one at a time?\nA: Backer tiers include one instance of shipping. If you'd prefer to redeem your backer rewards one at a time, you will simply need to pay for any instance of shipping after the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1x 3D Printed Color Mini", "descp": "Receive Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on a full-color, 3D printed tabletop miniature!\nINCLUDES:\nCustom FULL-COLOR 3D PRINTED miniature\nGet early access to full color design tools\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17,577 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1 Year Access to Token Maker Unlimited", "descp": "Get a full year of access to the new Token Maker.\nINCLUDES:\nGet early access to full color design tools\nReceive 1-year access to the Token Maker Unlimited\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["834 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Print and Paint Yourself", "descp": "Receive special Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on 10 digital download .stl files for 3D printed tabletop miniatures!

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The coolest game to ever hit the planet first appeared some 38 years ago, featuring an electronic tower that lit up, played music, and somehow ran an epic fantasy adventure game with its state-of-the-art technological wizardry. That game was Dark Tower. We want to bring you that same sense of awe and wonder, pushing the boundaries of what a board game can actually do. After 3 years of painstaking work by a team of two dozen designers, engineers, and artists, we are thrilled to present to you a game with echoes of that long-gone wonder but ultimately unlike any game you've ever experienced.\nReturn to Dark Tower is a game for 1 to 4 heroes who undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the titular tower. Now featuring both cooperative and competitive play. Designed by Rob Daviau and Isaac Childres -- designers of the two highest rated games of all time on Board Game Geek -- along with Noah Cohen, Brian Neff, and Justin D. Jacobson, the streamlined rules offer players difficult choices about when to advance their objective, gather resources, deal with threats, or level up.\nEach player controls a unique hero with their own starting inventory and special abilities. Along the way you gain helpful items, powerful virtues, and trusty companions to help you achieve your goal: Find a way into the Tower and defeat a powerful adversary.\nFiguring out the best way to utilize all of these assets is the key to victory. The game actively works to stop you, responding to your decisions and taking advantage of your missteps. Foes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, will stalk your hero and assault your buildings.\nOur innovative combat system leverages the power of the processor. Within the app, select virtual \"cards\" from each foe's unique deck, revealing the potential consequences of the fight. Then, use your hero's advantages to modify those results. Will you mitigate losses across the board, or focus on one to gain valuable resources for your effort.\nLooming over the board, the Tower itself is the greatest menace you'll face. Each turn, you drop a skull in, representing the threat of corruption. You decide where emerging skulls are placed, making those buildings less useful. At times the Tower itself springs to life, releasing trapped skulls in a single wave or revealing glyphs that sap your will.\nThe path to victory is fraught with peril. Battles and events can give your hero corruption. If you don't cleanse skulls from the buildings to keep them in check, the supply quickly dwindles.  \nTarry too long and face the risk of having all of the seals of the Tower break. Corruption, skulls, and time: Any one of these pitfalls can spell defeat.\nReturn to Dark Tower constantly presents new challenges. The adversary within the tower, the plan to access the tower, and the suite of foes you will face can mix and match in thousands of combinations. Play the same array over again or try something completely new.\nFor complete information on how to play, you can download the draft rulebook: \nOr check out this live playthrough we'll be doing on the Dice Tower:\nWe've also arranged for a how-to-play video by Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! at the time of release. \nCreated by a world-class team of designers and engineers led by Tim Burrell-Saward, an expert in technology-augmented games, the Tower itself is a game component without equal. From its very foundation, it's been devised to play an integral role in the game. Using a collection of magical-yet-reliable technologies, it generates game moments that simply wouldn't be possible without it. The Tower literally and figuratively dominates the table, drawing upon all of these powers to foil you. You will grow to curse its name.\nLearn more about the intense tower development and prototyping process in Tim's designer diary.\nThe game itself is rich and satisfying. But we have a few additional items in this campaign to upgrade your play experience even further.\nFor those of you new to Kickstarter, an \"add-on\" is something that's not included with a regular pledge. If you're interested in getting the neoprene board or any other add-on we might add to the campaign, it's really simple. You have two options:\nYou can manually add the amount of the add-on to your existing pledge. (For the mat, it's $45 including shipping.) If you have already backed and you go to the top of the campaign page, you'll see a button in the top right that says \"Manage your pledge\". Click on it and it will take to you a \"Change your pledge\". Then you can click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. Then, in the box with your \"Pledge amount\" you can manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge. Click \"Continue\" and your good to go. (NOTE: You can also use this method if you want to upgrade from the Charge the Tower to the Azkol's Fortune level.)\nYou can add any add-ons in BackerKit (our pledge manager) after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll talk more about how pledge managers work as we get closer to the end of the campaign, but it might help to think of it as an online store where you \"spend\" the money you pledged in the Kickstarter campaign and where you can add new items too, like the neoprene board.\nThe Alliances expansion offers new rules and components to add further depth and variety to the game. It includes two new heroes, who can be used in any game. The Archwright fortifies buildings to protect the kingdoms; the Haunted Recluse dabbles in forbidden lore to powerful effect. Influence is a new resource that can be used to form alliances with powerful guilds or to thwart the capricious whims of the nobles. It also features new treasures and allies with more intricate abilities for experienced gamers.\nThe Dark Horde box contains stunning sculpts by Punga Miniatures of all the foes in the game. These figures bring the foes to life. (Keep checking back here as we unlock new foes and show off new sculpts.)\n The Coffers box replaces the cardboard resource tokens from the game and the Alliances expansion with top-quality, heat-transfer plastic tokens that have a great feel and durability.\n This 50mm diameter and 5mm thick metal coin signifies the active player. If you signed up for notification before the campaign launched, you will receive this for free if you back the kickstarter and get at least one copy of the game.\nSeriously, folks. This mat is huge and heavy. It's about 80% larger area than the game board. This makes the spaces larger as well of course, which can be a boon if you're playing with the miniature foes from Dark Horde. A real specialty item for those who want to play an epic game on an epic stage.\n Check out this rendered example of a gold foil art print:\nGive all your cards a little extra protection. This add on includes enough high-quality sleeves to cover the cards in Return to Dark Tower and the Alliances expansion. 110 standard card sleeves and 85 mini sleeves (plus some extras for lost or broken sleeves). Most sleeves will have a custom print, but some standard sized sleeves will be completely clear to accommodate the double-sided cards.\n\n\n\nPart of the fun of Kickstarter is achieving new heights and unlocking those sweet stretch goals. We've already packed a ton of content into the game, but we'll manage to find a way to get even more goodies in there. So let's break those seals!\n\nAt PAX Unplugged, we were able to run a number of tabletop media folks through the game. These opinions were freely given and provided without compensation. Here's what they had to say:\nWe know you'll love Return to Dark Tower. But you might be wondering why you should back now. There are four main reasons:\n You can get what you want. The game itself is not exclusive to Kickstarter. We do have a retailer pledge in the campaign, so there are stores who will have the game when it fulfills. However, we are still unsure if we will be able to sell the game into retail distribution, and the add-ons are particularly unlikely to be available widely if at all. Backing is the one way to make sure you get what you want.\n You'll get the game early. Even if the game does ultimately go into retail distribution, we promise to hold the retail street date for at least 90 days after fulfillment is completed. As a thank you for backing, we want to make sure our backers get the first chance to play.\n You'll get the game cheaper. As you can see above, you will pledge less than the suggested retail price. While it is true that some online retailers often sell games for below the regular price, that's less likely in this case. If the game ends up not going into retail distribution, aggressive discount merchants won't have access to it. Even if it does, the discount is likely not be much better than what we're offering in the campaign.\n You get to be a backer. Being a backer means being part of a community. You'll get to speak up on decisions we make during the campaign and share ideas with other backers. Most importantly, you'll help make this game become a reality. Some publishers have taken to using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. That is very much not the case with Return to Dark Tower. We simply could not make the game without the success of this campaign. You'll be a part of that success and part of unlocking stretch goals to make the game even better.\nIf this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easier than it looks, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun! You can download this PDF file to learn the ins-and-outs of being a backer:\n\nWe are once again using Quartermaster Logistics to oversee the fulfillment process. They have an extremely efficient system, quality packaging, tracking information, and their customer service is second to none. We have key fulfillment partners within each shipping region and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT, to the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China.\nPlease use the chart below to calculate your shipping fees. Due to an error in setting up the Kickstarter page, some countries are charged at the time of pledge, while others will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. You will also be charged additional shipping if you order add-ons or multiple copies and at similar rates.\n\n\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes or to the following countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again. They are a \"pledge manager\", a third-party service that lets us manage our orders and fulfillment. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll be able to add items to your pledge at that time. If you are unsure about what items you want to get during the Kickstarter campaign, you can back at the \"Map to BackerKit\" level. This will qualify you as a backer for any backer-related goodies and will give you access to the pledge manager to fill out your order later.\nRETAILERS\nWe have a special pledge tier for verified brick-and-mortar stores: For Bazaar Proprietors Only. You pledge only $50 during the campaign. In the pledge manager, you will finalize your order. However, you will not have to pay the remaining balance due until the games are ready to ship. Please click here for detailed information and terms.\n\nRestoration Games was founded in 2016 by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory,  bringing the fun we had to a new generation of gamers.\nSPREAD THE WORD\nA Kickstarter campaign is only as strong as its backers. You will help push this project to be the best it can be. We greatly appreciate anything you can do to let people know about this campaign, whether it's posting to your social media accounts, sending emails to your friends, or letting a co-worker know about us.\nIf you haven't joined the game's facebook group, go do it. We've got a great group of fans, talking about the game, and it's a good place to go to ask questions.\nAnother fun way to spread the word is adopting a social media avatar.

So, while we've learned from each one we've done, the challenges keep getting bigger as well. Notably, the tower itself is a complicated component with mechanical and electrical components. Fortunately, we've enlisted Tim Burrell-Saward and Andrew Sung, both with significant experience on these types of projects, to assist us in overseeing the manufacturing process.

And we're finally ready for you all to have an early look. I tapped Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer, to do a deep dive on the app's heroic journey to date. As with all of these updates, keep in mind that we are still refining and will continue to refine until the game gets into your hands and beyond. Everything here is still \"in progress\".

It's one last check to find any last little problem before we hit the big red button that says: spend a million dollars and make 25,000 copies of this game.\nI have to say, it's an extremely rewarding milestone. This is a project that I've been working on for three years. To open a box and see an actual playable game, is pretty amazing. But it's also a bit tense.

With the print materials locked down, we're looking to refine the data in the app to further balance the game and make it more fun. These playtests will be done in Tabletop Simulator (on Steam) and (unlike prior playtests) will use the actual app (with a built-in Tower simulator). We know some of you signed up for and did some playtesting for us last year. But circumstances can change -- especially during current events these days. So, even if you signed up before, if you're still interested in testing, please sign up again.

As most of you know, the original game from 1982 was a competitive game. Players raced to defeat the brigands in the Tower. The first one to do it won the game. Early on in our development, we decided to make our restored version cooperative. We think it's more thematic appropriately and mechanically. But we knew some folks would like to be able to play competitively like in the original. We continued to work on it even as we entered the Kickstarter and finally announced we were doing it way back in Update #11."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Let's Check Out the Box Bottom", "update_content": "As we move into this next stage of production, my plan is to post smaller, more regular updates and start showing off some stuff you all haven't seen or that has been updated since the campaign. Today, we're going to take a quick look at the box bottom.\nFirst thing to mention is that it's not really the box bottom at all. The box will, of course, have a bottom, but this ain't it. Bigger picture, we know that you all have paid a lot of money to get this game. Granted, most of the expense is in that beautiful electronic Tower that will sit in the middle of the table. But we want to make sure the rest of the game meets that high bar. Traditionally, a box bottom serves as a marketing piece to attract the eye of someone browsing at the store, and it also has a number of legal requirements, like safety icons and copyright notices. Fine and necessary, but not pretty to look at. So we made the decision to have the traditional box bottom turn into a separate slip sheet that is placed over the box bottom and held into place by the shrinkwrap. When you open the shrink, you can toss the sheet. This meets our needs for the store shelf, but allows you to have a beautiful game box on your shelf at home."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Guest Update: Checking in on the Tower with Tim Burrell-Saward", "update_content": "I know folks like to get a closer look at the manufacturing process, and there's no one better to fill us in than Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer.\nBefore we jump in, Board Game Geek's annual \"Most Anticipated\" list is underway.

This is a very visual Kickstarter, and you will need to watch the videos to see for yourself. Each individual dice has a video below! There are 10 total dice, be sure to watch them all!\nMassive increases to production have been made; new equipment, hired help, and a more efficient process means that all dice will be shipped before September of 2020. This is still an overestimate, they may arrive sooner.\nOrders will be filled by backer number, meaning the first orders in go out first. If you haven't ordered and want your product faster, don't wait any longer!\nWhat you see in this Kickstarter is not what you get, because what you will get is even better. The funding has allowed me to make some major improvements to the dice. The improvements: higher quality colorant for the resin, higher quality acrylic for the numbers, better equipment to make molds for a more perfect dice, and improved sanding process to eliminate small imperfections.\nSome individual dice have gotten improvements, read the message under each one. You will be able to see the full improvements before finalizing any selections.\nMalfeasance \nPLAY\n\n Malfeasance will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nAcropolis \nPLAY\n\n Acropolis will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nAndromeda \nPLAY\n\n Andromeda will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nGrandiosity\nPLAY\n\n Grandiosity will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above and a darker purple paint for numbers.\nBotanical\nPLAY\n\n Botanical will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above and a darker green paint for its numbers.\nTempest\nPLAY\n\n Tempest will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nHellfire\nPLAY\n\n Hellfire will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nNoxious\nPLAY\n\n Noxious will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nAphrodisiac\nPLAY\n\n Aphrodisiac will look a little different than it does in the video, the core and shell will be similar, but the paint for the numbers will be white.

But excellent results can also be achieved with the filament\nFree files Example stl files\nfree download:\nhttps://www.crosslances.net/2019/11/15/free-files-example-stl-files/\nInstead all the scenic pieces are ideal for filament printers, without any support necessity.\nWhen battles are raging in the world there are always those who choose to be part of the factions of evil and those of good. Paladins fight for light and peace, faithful to the sun god, these brave fighters protect their golden cities, do you want to fight in the path of light too?\n\nThe tower is built in three distinct sections: base, center and top. So that the center is modular and the height of the tower can be decided\nWood elves don't like war but when the threat of other armies comes closer, they surely know how to defend themselves and counterattack!\nThe wood elves live in the woods and forests, they worship the goddess of nature, if you also want to defend mother earth, then you know which side to take\n\nThe tower is built in three distinct parts: base, center and top. So that the center is modular and the height of the tower can be decided\n\n               Unlike the paladins, the chaos warriors have given their soul to evil and darkness, their hearts are dark and full of evilness, always ready to give vent to their weapons!\nThe knights of chaos worship evil and darkness: demons, devils and any evil entity.\nIf you don't have any pity on anyone in battle, then the chaos is right for you!\n\nThe tower is built in three distinct parts: base, center and top. So that the center is modular and the height of the tower can be decided\n This miniature is our gift for you!\nYes exactly, you will just need to pledge any level, even just 1 euro and you will be able to download immediately!\nYou will find the download link in the updates as soon as you made the pledge.\nNow our regular customers know that we are not used to classic add-on methods found on many kickstarters.\nWe will not include stretch goals, but we will listen to all your suggestions during the campaign and we will try to sculpt as many pieces as possible based on your requests.\nIn the meantime, here you have some sculptures that you can receive for free in the \u20ac 22 or higher packages.\n\n\n               Crosslances studios is founded by 3 artists and their commons passion for the world of games.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Chess has been a game that was part of our lives as we grew up. As long as we can remember, our parents enjoyed playing a game of chess with friends, while having a glass and telling stories.\nMotivated by these memories, we decided to take a game that has been played for over 1500 years and create a set of uniquely crafted glass pieces that pay homage, but also add a new dimension to this iconic classic game. \nIt was a journey of over 12 months that got us to the point where we are ready to create the moulds so all we need is your support to start the production!\nThe process of developing the final chess pieces was as important to us as the result itself. From modern 3D printing, to an old school approach to glassmaking, our designs slowly progressed to a stage where we now partner with a factory that uses high precision technology to make our full set which requires no less than 72 simultaneous injection points. \nThe old school approach taken in the development of the final glass pieces\nThe result speaks for itself.\nThe Glass Knights are also a collection of the most refined shot glasses ever, that you can use to create a twist and a completely new playing experience, or simply flip the board over and you have yourself a tray of unique glass shots for your next party.\nYou asked yourself how come the drink doesn\u2019t spill everywhere, right? We took care of that. The food grade silicone is placed on the end of the piece in less than a second and it creates a seal that ensures that not a single drop of your precious liquid escapes.\n\nIn addition to the fun element, we wanted to create a chess board that wouldn\u2019t need to be hidden away when you\u2019re not playing. \nQuite the opposite. In fact, we designed the Glass Knights board and pieces down to the most minute details so that you would be proud to display it in your living room or office.\nRest assured that almost every person walking in the room will stop and pick up the pieces.\n\nWe were ruthless in the engineering of each piece to add intricate details on the glass, while ensuring they are durable so you don\u2019t have to worry about dropping them. That is why finding the right factory that could create such a quality piece of glass narrowed the search down to only a few that had the technology to manufacture the Glass Knights.\n\nAside from the visual aspect, we know just how important is the feel and the weight of each piece. The smooth surface of the glass and the intricate details, combined with just the right thickness, make from each piece an experience to play with.\n\nThe Glass Knights is created with kids in mind too! Aside from the fact that you don\u2019t have to worry about your kids dropping the glass pieces because they are made from one tough tempered glass, the pieces can be filled with sweets or dried fruit. \nThat will take their enjoyment of the game to the next level. The only downside may be that it\u2019s your responsibility to go down to the store and get the tasty rewards. Once you\u2019ve done that, you can have your free time while they play away!\nAlthough we don\u2019t recommend going around throwing your Glass Knight pieces, we did thousands of iterations and reiterations to create the ideal tempered glass that can be dropped and live to play another game. \nThe Executive Set is the add on that can raise your game to the ultimate level.\nWe introduced the handcrafted wooden board that glows in the dark in a limited edition that will be capped at only 100 pieces. Each will have a unique serial number as proof of its authenticity.\nIf you decide to upgrade to the Executive Set, simply choose the appropriate reward level. The only thing left is for you to enjoy it. You deserve it.\nEach Executive Set wooden board requires over 15 hours to handcraft.\n\nWhen designing the Glass Knights, we wanted to go beyond any expectations from a normal chess piece set and make every element have at least one function.\nThat is exactly what we did with the thermoformed containers that house each glass piece, as well as double as ice cube trays.\nNow with each full set, you will have 36 of the most unique ice cubes that are shaped as chess pieces! \nGetting the right dimension and weight is also something we looked closely at in order for you to feel the weight of each piece, while also ensuring the optimum thickness of the glass to make withstand pretty much all accidental drops from day to day scenarios.\n\nTo make things even more excited, we are introducing two free upgrades once we smash our first stretch goal.\nPart 1: Three Box Colors To Choose From\nThat\u2019s right! You will be able to choose the color of your Glass Knights box so that it best fits with your style or house and office design.\nPART 2: Water-Resistant Box \nIn addition, we know that you may want to take the Glass Knights box out to the pool or simply don\u2019t want to have to worry about spilling liquids inside. That is why the 100K Stretch Goal will also mean that we make the box water resistant!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreating a Kickstarter project without a doubt can pose a lot of challenges. We acknowledged this and that is why we set out to diminish to a minimum each risk by working with a team of fellow Kickstarter creators that have successfully launched 11 crowdfunding projects.\n\nWe then started to analyse each aspect and reached the conclusion that most of the challenges arise in the pre-production preparation which defines the quality and pace of the actual production process.\n\nTo diminish this risk, we narrowed our partnership to two factories which we worked closely with for over 6 months to ensure that when we launch the Kickstarter project, the Glass Knights chess board and glass pieces are at the stage where every detail is worked out, without the need to make any further changes, before creating the final metal molds and starting the production. \n\nWe look forward to embarking on this journey with you as our backers and members that helped found the Glass Knights!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "1 x Glass Piece of Your Choice", "descp": "A unique glass King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook or Pawn to display in your office or home.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 159 or more", "title": "Glass Knights Pieces + Board |Early Bird", "descp": "Your unique opportunity to own a unique, full set of the Glass Knights that includes the glass pieces + board.

This time, he\u2019s deciding who\u2019s been naughty and who\u2019s been nice\u2026 that\u2019s right, he\u2019s not just Trolley Tom anymore, get ready for ."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "What's next on the Tracks?", "update_content": "Hello all you Trolley Hoppers!\nThis campaign has been a whirlwind, and we\u2019re thankful that you all took a chance on us and backed it! It was incredibly fun, so thank you guys for that! Now that the vast majority of games have been out for a bit, things are winding down slightly on our end. We wanted to give you guys an update on how things will be  moving forward.\nNumbers wise, the campaign is 91% completed. The other 9% represents backers who have either never responded to their PledgeManager email or backers who started it but didn\u2019t actually finish it. Of course the PledgeManager system isn\u2019t perfect, and it\u2019s possible you never got your email. I tried to help by posting several updates reminding you all to do it, just in case you didn\u2019t get your email, but I'm aware those may have also slipped through the cracks. Even though we were trying to cover all the bases, we understand that everyone has different circumstances, and things may have still been missed accidentally. I\u2019m here to let the remaining 9% of you know that there\u2019s no need to worry! You will still get your games, and, in fact, your entire original orders, unaltered! Since the PledgeManager is locked, you\u2019re not able to complete your orders on your end anymore. In order to still get your games, you can reach out to me, Maya, at  for help putting your address in and getting you on our weekly batches. Moving forward, we\u2019ll be sending out small weekly batches to get your games to you. I submit the batches to QuarterMaster every Thursday, and they get shipped out the next week. You can also shoot me an email if you\u2019re just curious about tracking or any sort of updates with your order in general. Now that things are really winding down, we won\u2019t be doing regular updates anymore. Here\u2019s a bunch of links to all of our websites and social media which will alert you of new games and new fun in general!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Trial by Trolley: Social Distancing Rules", "update_content": "Hey Trolley Fans, \nThank you all for your ongoing support! We have some great updates to share with you:\nShipping Update - Third Wave and Weekly Batches\nThe third wave is about to be shipped! We transferred the backer data over to QuarterMaster on Monday night. They let us know they got everything, and are just doing a final look over. This means the third wave will go out any day now! If you're on the third wave, you will receive tracking information to your email when your order has shipped.

I\u2019ve slipped and fallen on ice 3 times, so I\u2019m clearly doing amazingly. We\u2019re sending you this update just to fill you in on where we are right now as far as shipping. We had a really great time at PAX Unplugged! We were able to meet a bunch of you guys while at the con, and it was rad playing the game with you! You guys have some weird humor and apparently a lot of murder secrets, but I guess we all know whose fault that is. We\u2019re very excited to get you your games.\nLocking the PledgeManager "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Elaborating Production Update Info", "update_content": "Hey y'all!\nSo, a little more info about the delay. There were quite a few things that factored into us missing December as the estimated fulfillment window. It isn't actually very hard to be off on an estimate by a month. There is a lot that goes into making something on the other side of the world and then shipping it to all corners of said earth.\nWe added the Tram Sam mini pretty late in the campaign, and we had to get that mold started much later than the other molds. Typically, molds take 30-45 days to make, and there is no speeding those up. We really wanted to give you guys a great quality Tram Sam miniature, so we knew that was going to make our timeline a little tighter. As expected, it did."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 6552, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cyanideandhappiness/trial-by-trolley", "project_name": "Trial By Trolley"}}, {"backer": "Impact!

This means that our fans have the power to continue or cancel the story. We crowdfund through Kickstarter because it allows us to bypass the traditional studio system, ensuring that the stories we want to tell are not constrained by what Hollywood is willing to fund. Every JourneyQuest film is produced under the Shared Cinematic License Agreement which allows you to remix, create, adapt, and distribute works set in the world of Fartherall. These are films funded by you for you. \nNote that anything marked with \"kickstarter exclusive\" is an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.  \nTake a moment to like and follow our social media and community accounts on the services you use (ZOE Facebook \u2022 JourneyQuest Facebook \u2022 Twitter \u2022 Instagram \u2022 Twitch \u2022 Discord \u2022 YouTube). Then encourage your friends and fellow JourneyQuest fans to do the same \u2013 these signups allow us to build enthusiasm for the campaign and communicate important updates.\nAdditionally, this year we are adding Quests to our campaign. We know that our fans are our best promoters and we want to celebrate this! For all backers at any level, we will add exclusive digital rewards to your pledge for every quest completed.  \n *Final Quest rewards are contingent upon Kickstarter campaign success.\nThroughout the campaign, our livestream studio will host JOURNEYQUEST\u2019S MOST VICTORIOUS CHARACTER, Fartherall\u2019s epic bracket competition. Your votes throughout the week determine which character will arise victorious from their encounter.  Every Thursday at 6pm Pacific, we will announce the winners of the current week's matchups and immediately go into live polling for the next round's winners who will be announced at the end of the livestream. In the final week of the campaign, we will live stream a 5-hour campaign countdown and finale on Friday, July 12th. \nIn addition to the game, we will host regular JourneyQuest watch parties complete with live commentary. Be sure to watch the \"Upcoming Events\" section above as well as our social media channels to make sure you don't miss a thing! \nSHIPPING\nIMPORTANT: WE CHARGE FOR SHIPPING AFTER THE CAMPAIGN IN BACKERKIT, NOT IN KICKSTARTER.\nDo NOT add shipping fees to your pledge now. \nAnything that you pledge over the cost of a reward level will not count as credit in BackerKit and will go directly to the JourneyQuest 4 production. Only give more than a pledge level if you want us to spend your additional contributions making JourneyQuest 4 even more awesome.\nFULFILLMENT\nThe JourneyQuest 4 campaign will be fulfilled by our partners at Ship Naked, who maintain shipping depots in the United States, Canada, Germany, and Australia. Barring circumstances outside our control (like tariffs or trade wars) we will fulfill physical rewards from those depots.\n What will shipping cost in BackerKit?\n International Backers: expect to pay around $7.75 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\n United States Backers: expect to pay around $5.75 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\nAll shipping estimates are subject to change but will reflect the best market rates we can find when fulfillment begins.\nJourneyQuest is created by an ever-growing team of talented and passionate actors, producers, crew, and support staff. Together, we've not only produced three seasons of JourneyQuest, but the ongoing Gamers series, Dark Dungeons, Demon Hunters, Attacking the Darkness, Strowlers, and much more. \nWhile our budgets are still a fraction of what Hollywood spends, doing it right means taking care of our cast and crew. Your support is what lets us keep telling original stories that you can't find anywhere else!\nWe are excited to shoot this season in British Columbia with talented Canadian director Joanna Gaskell, the co-creator of Standard Action.\nShowrunner and writer Matt Vancil has once again lent his talents to a hilarious season four script and will oversee production.\nProducer Tony Becerra returns to oversee production. He is joined by Mike Waverecan, a producer from M1 Films. M1 Films joins Zombie Orpheus for production of this season.\nSocial media coordinator Lee House will add his considerable talents to spreading the word about this campaign far and wide.\nOf course, it wouldn't be JourneyQuest without our phenomenal cast. This season we're thrilled to bring back Christian Doyle (Perf), Alyssa Kay (Nara), Fran Kranz (Silver Tom), Kevin Pitman (Glorion), Brian Lewis (Carrow), Emille Shimkus (Wren), Jesse Lee Keeter (Rilk), Bob Sapp (Karn), Samara Lerman (Assassin), and many more! \nZombie Orpheus Entertainment is pleased to team up with The Fantasy Network, a fan-supported, creator-distributed streaming service, to broadcast every JourneyQuest episode. In addition to works from Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, The Fantasy Network distributes original programming from Arrowstorm Entertainment (Mythica), The Forge Studios (The Rangers), Recursor.tv (Nina Unlocked) as well as numerous independent producers (AFK, One Hit Die, Ren the Girl With the Mark). While many titles are available on The Fantasy Network for free, your pledge of $10 or more unlocks one month of Fantasy Network subscriber-exclusive access.\nWe will be using BackerKit for pledge management after the campaign. A BackerKit survey will be sent to all backers several months after the Kickstarter campaign has completed. You will be able to update your address, add shipping fees and shop our pre-order store for any additional items from our back catalog that you would like to add to your shipment. \nOur shipping partners at Ship Naked will be handling warehousing and shipping for our campaign from their warehouse in the US. If we have a sufficient number of international backers, we will utilize their warehouses in Canada, Germany and Australia as well.\nWorld of Fartherall is available for your storytelling and art under ZOE's new Shared Cinematic Universe License Agreement (the SCULA).\nWhat does this mean?\nIt's like the Open Gaming License and Creative Commons had little license babies: it's an agreement that gives you permission to create, adapt, and release your own derivative works within the world of Fartherall!\nCheck out the web page for the full details, but the fast and dirty summary is that as long as you abide by the terms of the agreement, you have the freedom to create non-commercial AND commercial Fartherall derivatives. Make a roleplaying game. Shoot a web series. Create your art. Sell it if you want. Or give it away. It's your choice.\nYou, the fans, have made these works possible and this new agreement helps us give back. Come and play, you're invited!\nJust remember to Share Alike, Transform (don't copy), provide accurate Attribution, and don't break the law.\nPlus, if you want your creations to become a canon part of the world, we offer a path to make them official. And a cool seal. It's pretty awesome. \nZOE and JourneyQuest are committed to cultivating healthy, inclusive communities where everyone is welcome. We extend that mission to improving representation both on screen and behind the camera. We're stronger when we work together to achieve common goals!\nWe welcome fans old and new to the community that will come together during this Kickstarter campaign and remind everyone that hate speech is not tolerated in this space. \nOur moderators are trained to help if you experience harassment in any ZOE-managed social arena. If we happen to miss it when it happens, please don't hesitate to reach out and let us know, so that we can take action to resolve the issue.\nWe are always happy to assist! If you have a question that was not answered here, please send us a message through Kickstarter or via the contact form at zombieorpheus.com.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we work hard to mitigate our risks, the unforeseen can always throw a curve ball. Sometimes we have to recast a role at the last minute. Sometimes we have to redo work in post if it doesn't meet our standards. Sometimes product gets delayed at the manufacturer. And any time international travel is involved, we have to be prepared to adapt and adjust with circumstances outside our control. But with a nine-year track record of crowdfunding success at Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, our reputation should speak for itself. \n\nAdditionally, we now have excellent relationships with manufacturers, our fulfillment partners at Ship Naked, the team at BackerKit, and everyone else who's part of making sure that our campaigns are completed to your satisfaction. \n\nOur pledge to you is that we will always do our utmost to deliver on our commitment to excellence.\n\nNOTE: We have budgeted for rewards and production based on current treaties, exchange rates, and tariffs. Given political volatility in the USA and elsewhere, we want to make special note that our plans may require significant revision should domestic or global turbulence affect the production of JourneyQuest Season Four.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Tip Jar", "descp": "Receive access to backer-only updates and the post-campaign BackerKit store.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["197 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Stream it First!", "descp": "Stream JourneyQuest Season 4 when it premieres on The Fantasy Network with a one-month subscription.

Stretch goal bookmarks for all! And more stretch goal news, and The Legion of the Skull returns! All subscribers receive four stretch goals! First, a copy of \"Cubicles of the Magician's Skull\"! This booklet compiles the hilarious missives from the immortal sorcerer Skull who is our leader, publisher, and mascot! And secondly, a never-before-published Morlock story by James Enge, plus a new story by John C. Hocking! And a new bookmark! Additionally, backers at the Legion of the Skull level will receive a booklet of essays on sword-and-sorcery literature!\nTales From the Magician's Skull is a printed fantasy magazine dedicated to presenting all-new sword-and-sorcery fiction by the finest modern crafters in the genre. These stories are the real thing, crammed with sword-swinging action, dark sorceries, dread, and ferocious monsters -- and they hurtle forward at a headlong pace. \nLast year, we published issues #1 and #2 to great acclaim. The stories were well-received, and the fans demanded \u2013 more! MORE! We hear you, fans, and the Skull is prepared to grant your desire!\nThis Kickstarter launches issues #3 and #4, as well as subscriptions to future issues! \nPublication Schedule\nOur goal is to publish Tales From The Magician\u2019s Skull twice a year, with issues released in March and September each year. Issue #3 is complete and ready for printing, with a September release date. Issue #4 will release in March 2020, and others will follow bi-annually thereafter. Upon reaching issue #666, the Skull will travel to a higher plane and the magazine will end.\nSubscriptions\nSubscriptions are available at a 10% discount from single-issue pricing. Subscriptions are 4 issues in duration and are offered in print and PDF format. Just select the appropriate pledge level.\nPrint Format\nWith our first Kickstarter, we included a stretch goal to print the magazine on a luxurious textured, tan-colored paper stock that conjured memories of the pulp papers of years past. We love this format and will continue to print the magazine using this paper stock. It does mean a higher funding threshold, which we believe is worth it.\nInterior illustration by Samuel Dillon\nIssue #3\nIssue #3 is brimming with 80 pages and contains 7 stories, each featuring a full page black-and-white illustration. When appropriate to the tale, maps to strange lands and martial arenas are included as well. Each story has been written, edited, illustrated, and laid out in classic pulp magazine format. A bonus section translates elements from each story - creatures, magic items, and more - into Dungeon Crawl Classics game terms. \nIssue #3 features fiction by James Enge, John C. Hocking, Howard Andrew Jones, Violette Malan, Joseph A. McCullough, Sarah Newton, and William King. The magazine is edited by Howard Andrew Jones and published by Joseph Goodman of Goodman Games, with layout by Lester B. Portly. An appendix by Terry Olson provides DCC RPG game statistics based on some of the stories.\nEach story is lovingly illustrated by industry stalwarts, and issue #3 features art by Samuel Dillon, Justine Jones, Doug Kovacs, Brad McDevitt, Russ Nicholson, Stefan Poag, Matthew Ray, and Chuck Whelan. The cover is by the legendary Sanjulian.\nIssue #4\nWe have already started recruiting stories for issue #4 but there is still more work to do. Our target release date is March 2020, and all will be complete by then!\nInterior illustration by Samuel Dillon\nHere are the stories in issue #3!\nThe Face That Fits His Mask, By William King\nHe could change in mid-spring, tear out the man's throat, feast on his bones, drink his blood. The beast of the change gibbered in the back of his mind, begging to be unleashed. His fingers splayed, his nails began to lengthen\u2026.\nBy That Much, By Joseph A. McCullough\n\u201cYou claim not to know me, and that is probably best for you, but do me a last service. If you can, gather what remains of my body and give it a suitable place to rest.\u201d \nTyrant\u2019s Bane, By John C. Hocking\nSomeone in the garb of a royal guardsman came out of the stairwell.  His blue armor was covered with blood and there was a fist-sized hole in his cuirass through which Benhus could see the wall behind him.  There was a sword in each hand and, as he advanced, the dead man lifted both weapons.\nFive Deaths, By James Enge\nThe heavy stone door moved easily upon its hinges; Morlock pulled it open and stepped through cautiously. Lernaion was about to follow when there was a sudden bodiless screaming and the door slammed shut.\nThe Forger\u2019s Art, By Violette Malan\nHis head wore a surprised look when it landed a few feet away. The body slumped to the ground, pumping out blood onto the grass. \n\u201cWhy do people always talk too much?\u201d Parno wiped his sword clean on the dead stranger's tunic.\nThe Second Death of Hanuvar, By Howard Andrew Jones\nHanuvar twisted, parried a blow that would have caved in his skull, and lost his balance. He saw the pit yawning, and the flame more than twenty feet below.\nThe Wizard of Rememberance, By Sarah Newton\nThe memnovore towered over him, its mouth distending into a translucent sleeve of slime. Acid burned Suven\u2019s flesh, and he screamed. In the demon\u2019s larval embrace, he prayed for oblivion.\nTable of contents page for #3\nMaps \nThis is a small detail, but we think it's important. The early issues of pulp literature occasionally included illustrated maps and diagrams to help the reader understand the fantastic places being explored by pulp heroes. \nTales From the Magician's Skull does the same. Doug Kovacs, famous for his fantastically illustrated maps in the role-playing-game space, has provided illuminated maps to explain some of the stories' locations. \nThe T-Shirt\n\"There is no greater honor than to wear my visage upon your frail husk,\" says the Skull. \"And now you can achieve this honor with a mere 25 of your monetary units. Dollars, I believe they are called.\" Simply select the T-shirt pledge level if you only want a tee. If you want a tee in addition to the magazine, select the magazine pledge level you want and add +$30 (which is $25 T-shirt cost plus $5 shipping).\nBack Issues\nWe still have copies of issues #1 and #2 available. Select the appropriate pledge level to purchase these back issues while they last!\n Shipping Costs \nPhysical copies will be shipped as they are ready. When you make your pledge, shipping charges will be applied.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " The Dark Trails RPG is a game which pays homage to the popular weird West genre.  It can be used as a standalone game or as the perfect complement to a growing line of products that all utilize the rules found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) RPG.   As a player, you\u2019ll find a wealth of material that allows you to assume the role of one of 11 unique classes, with descriptive names like: the Calavera, the Bedlamite, and the Sin-Eater.   As a Judge, you\u2019ll find over 400 pages of material giving you a wealth of resources for designing and running fantastic adventures set against the haunted landscapes of an unforgiving weird West. \nYou may be wondering about the above mentioned game that Dark Trails is tethered to. Dungeon Crawl Classics is a Fantasy RPG written by Joseph Goodman of Goodman Games. Since debuting in 2012, the book has gone through seven (7) printings and spawned a wonderful community of passionate gamers both new and old. DCC continues to grow by leaps and bounds by way of exciting adventures penned by some of the best writers in the industry, including third-party publishers using the system to fuel their own creative fires.\nFortunately, the Dark Master (Joseph Goodman) has granted permission to include a modified version of the DCC ruleset within the pages of Dark Trails to make it the first 3rd party published work to include the necessary rules for play. You don\u2019t need anything other than the Dark Trails RPG to play the game aside from some dice, paper, and pencils. \nSome of the DCC rules were purposefully left out when weighed against their place in a weird West setting, but these omitted rules can easily be added to Dark Trails should you own a copy of DCC and wish to include them.\n This Kickstarter funds the standalone hardcover book for the game. Funds raised will be used to pay for additional art, editing, and layout for a quality book made by traditional offset methods to ensure it is as durable as it is beautiful. \n Dark Trails is the product of three years of writing and playtesting by author David Baity. You may remember David from his first DCC adventure \u201cCarnival of the Damned\u201d published by  Purple Sorcerer Games. While David has handled the majority of the writing chores with the Dark Trails RPG, lots of folks have thrown their name into the hat to help flesh out the magic and bestiary sections. Daniel J. Bishop, Brandon Goeringer, Bob Brinkman, Diogo Nogueira, and Jeff Scifert are just a few of the talented minds that have worked their magic to make Dark Trails something truly special.\nFor one of the two editions of the game we've commissioned none other than the legendary SanJulian to grace us with a beautifully painted cover filled to the brim with \"weird.\" You can see a few more of SanJulian's DCC covers below, and be sure to check out his website  for several works you've probably seen grace the covers of your favorite novels and other publications over the years.\nWho else is on board to help to bring the world of Dark Trails to life? Over the last two years, the author has recruited some of the best up-and-coming artists in the industry. The Dark Trails RPG currently features work by Angga Augustiya, Todd McGowan, Christopher Torres, Simon Todd, Danny Prescott, Adam Slivka, David Hoskins, Aaron Robinson, MARCINs, David Coppoletti, and Diogo Nogueira.\nAdditional funds raised by the Kickstarter will help continue to fund new art from the above-mentioned artists, in addition to work by Stefan Poag, Peter Mullen, and Bradley K. McDevitt, just to name a few!\n Dark Trails will be printed in two editions (standard and limited edition), both are hardcover books  8.5\u201d x 11\u201d trim size. The books will be printed in the USA by offset printing methods to ensure the quality of the book meets consumer expectations.  Currently, we plan to keep the interior printed in B&W on 60# paper and stitched binding. \n The standard edition will feature a full-color cover painted by iconic artist, Sanjulian (Creepy magazine, Vampirella, etc.) while the limited edition will feature a leatherette cover, accented with metallic foil stamping and an embossed version of the Dark Trails RPG logo. The ultimate goal with the limited edition is to create something that looks like it was pulled right out of the Old West! \nBelow, you can see mock ups of each book to give you an idea of what we're visualizing. The painting used to represent the standard edition is not the final Sanjulian cover, and both covers are subject to change. \nA mock-up of the standard edition. This is not the actual cover and all elements are subject to change\nA mock-up of the limited edition leatherette edition. All elements are subject to change.\n\n\n The weird West genre is certainly well represented in the RPG industry, but those wishing to find a fully developed weird West RPG that utilizes a class-based system based upon the DCC RPG will be sadly disappointed. Dark Trails fills a niche for a DCC based weird West RPG by providing 11 original character classes paired with innovative rules designed to leave your players feeling like they\u2019ve just spent several hours adventuring in a Western landscape where the emphasis is placed upon the weird!\n\n\nYou\u2019ll find several classes to choose from within the pages of the book, so let\u2019s give you a basic rundown of what you\u2019ll find. \nBedlamite: Absent-minded inventors constantly constructing inventions that defy all logic, including \u201cwondrous\u201d contraptions that are brought to life by their creator\u2019s sheer force of will. Bedlamites often become addle-brained and introverted, preferring the company of their automatons to that of their allies.\nCalavera: Spirit-mediums, most often female, that can both see and speak to the nearby dead wandering the closest regions of the Spirit Lands. The calavera shines like a beacon in the night to the restless dead, eager to have her deliver a message, or perform one last task that will put the spirit to rest. Aiding in those tasks marks her as a veritable queen of the underworld and the dead are not only willing to share some of their dark secrets but also have been known to reach across the grave to protect their only connection to the land of the living.\nGambler: With the big changes running through the weird West, the gambler could be called the chosen paladin of Lady Luck, able to manipulate the ebb and flow of chance like an occultist weaves arcane energy. Gamblers alter the probability of events going on in their surroundings and have a skill set that favors thievery and subterfuge.\nGunslinger: Sometimes, a poor soul is cut down before their time, and when that person is a law-dog or hardened soldier even death isn\u2019t enough to discourage them from staying in the fight. These restless spirits possess the guns they died with and send out a call to those deemed worthy of carrying them. Gunslingers find their uncanny skill at gunplay supernaturally elevated by the spirits of vengeance that choose them.\nLuchador: A luchador is most often a person noble of heart seeking the thrill of martial combat in and out of the sacred ring. In addition to high-flying acrobatics coupled with raw strength and fortitude, luchadores gain the ability to tap into their inner spirit, channeling it through their masks for supernatural effects.\nMountebank: The typical \u201csnake oil salesman\u201d of the frontier, these amateur alchemists and full-time showmen find that the events of the Seven Days of Night have unlocked a doorway to the mind that reveals recipes that defy all logic and, once brewed, resemble the magic potions of legend.\nMystic Monk: Trained in the sacred art of martial arts and schooled by master philosophers, the mystic monk is a humble warrior wandering the weird West in search of enlightenment. In addition to being a master of martial arts, the mystic monk can summon his inner chi, a virtual battery of spiritual energy used to perform superhuman feats.\nOccultist: Occultists devote their lives to the mastery of the ambient arcane energies constantly flowing around all living things, learning to weave and channel them to miraculous effect through spell work. Occultists are considered master investigators and have a nose for all things arcane and unusual.\nRevelator: The revelator serves as a bastion of faith to those seeking refuge from the madness infecting the world. They can perform divine healing and miracles in addition to serving as a bane to evil creatures\u2014both living and dead\u2014all while serving as a pillar of faith to those that still believe in the comforting words of The Good Book.\nSin-Eater: During the Seven Days of Night, no souls were granted passage to the Underworld and instead were cursed to wander the Spirit World where they were preyed upon by creatures native to the realm, or worse, taken as slaves by their own kind. Charon, lord of the ferrymen, knows an abundance of restless spirits could potentially unravel the barrier between worlds. Some ferrymen are hand selected by their lord to return to the surface world in order to shepherd lost souls to the afterlife and destroy those that prey upon them by using River Rites and the soul-aegis, a weapon that strikes fear in the hearts of the wicked.\nTommyknocker: Sometimes, a soul is just too pissed off to pass on and needs to get a slice of vengeance before taking that ride into the sunset. Tommyknockers are walking corpses for almost all intents and purposes, but the strength of their soul is such that it acts as a furnace, providing a means to animate its corpse-shell to take care of unfinished business. In addition to an unnatural strength, the tommyknocker is one of the toughest hombres found in the weird West.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the DCC magic system, you\u2019ll be familiar with how things are done. If you\u2019re new to DCC styled magic you\u2019re in for a real treat! Spells can be cast multiple times if you continually roll high enough. Roll low and you might lose the spell for a day, or worse, suffer from the effects of corruption! On top of being able to cast known spells multiple times, the total of your roll means potentially casting that low-level magic missile spell with effects so strong that you just might wipe the playing field with your trusty \u201cfinger guns.\u201d In addition to a full complement of spells and miracles found within the pages of Dark Trails, you can import any of the 120+ existing spells found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG into your game, should you own the book.\nYou\u2019ll find over 150 spells, wondrous contraptions, elixirs, and miracles within the pages of Dark Trails, but we didn\u2019t stop there. In addition to the above, you\u2019ll find a reliquary of beneficial and cursed magic items, along with rules and tables for crafting magical firearms. \nThe author of the Dark Trails RPG really wants to present you with a game that has some innovative rules that help capture the feel of a Western-themed game. You\u2019ll find several interesting mechanics scattered throughout the book (some that you may even wish to port to your DCC game), but the main rules that make the Dark Trails RPG a horse you\u2019d want to throw a saddle on include:\nNew rules for firearms that incorporate a standard poker deck, including specialized critical hit and fumble tables.\nBoons & Hexes represent a run of good/bad luck your character might be having during a typical session. They\u2019re awarded based on things like exceptionally good/bad die rolls, true heroics, and great role playing.  Boons earned can be spent for in-game perks, while Hexes increase your chances of receiving more disastrous results on fumble and fear charts. In addition, they affect how NPC interactions pan out\u2014consider the unlucky cowboy to have a dark cloud following him around.\nA new system that replaces the \u201cstandard\u201d alignment mechanics found in most RPGs. The new system helps tell the story of how decisions determine the path a character may walk and how that path affects their reputation when dealing with NPCs.\nAn innovative system for fear and madness that simulates a character\u2019s ability to handle both physical and emotional stress during the adventure, including an extensive list of mental disorders for those who slip too deeply down the rabbit hole!\n\n Lot's of folks are hard at work putting their twist on the weird West genre. For starters, you can check out Thick Skull Adventures \"The Last WIll and Testament of Obediah Felkner.\" Author Stephen Newton is close to launching his exciting take on a weird West adventure that blends perfectly with the Dark Trails RPG. You can find more info at Thick Skull Adventures \nYou can also take comfort in knowing some talented up-and-coming writers in the gaming community have become so inspired by past playtests that they\u2019ve taken the initiative to start writing Dark Trails adventures. \nThere\u2019s no bigger compliment for an author than to learn folks think enough of their game to create material before the book is even released! The author has big plans to produce both free and paid content once the book is released into the wild. This includes supporting those who wish to produce their own Dark Trails material!\nYou\u2019re going to love the bestiary in this book! Over seventy-five creatures have been pulled from the works of Lovecraft and the pages of folklore from all around the world! Several notable folks have thrown their passion into helping make the bestiary something special, including but not limited to: Daniel J. Bishop, Jon Hook, Brandon Goeringer, Bob Brinkman and more! \nYou\u2019ll also find that several included creatures contain charts with all sorts of tweaks and nasty surprises to make each encounter terrifying and unique!\n\nSometimes, a Judge has a hard enough time wrangling up a posse, let alone coming up with a trail-ready adventure to keep'em busy! Don't you worry, partner, we got you covered! You\u2019ll find a complete 0-1st level action-packed adventure included within the pages, and a ready-made town filled with personalities to get you started on the trail.  As we reach stretch goals, more material gets added.  \n What Kickstarter would be worth its weight in whiskey if it didn't have some awesome stretch goals to sweeten the pot?

The Seven Days of Night brought about supernatural changes to all things, including much of the land! If we reach US $20,000, we\u2019ll bring on master cartographer Jared Blando to craft a black and white map to be used for end sheets.\nUS $22,000: Dark Trails is filled to the gills with 11 playable classes, but there\u2019s room for one more, as we love even numbers! If we can reach US $22,000, author Pete Spahn (Operation White Box) has agreed to throw a 12th class into the book.\nUS $24,000: Judges bringing the weird West to the table are going to need something pretty to spruce up those custom screens, and it needs to be as functional as it is purdy!

Bishop!

Take a gander at Jared's color work.\nUS $34,000: We're going to offer up a form fillable character sheet for both the funnel style and higher level character sheets!

I'm way over budget on art, so I'd hoped we could get by with it, but when Gilbert brought it up I knew it needed to be addressed and immediately hired some of the regular Weird Frontier artists to kick something out fast, and the end result is the art that will fill up those ugly pages with too much \"empty\".

But not any miniatures. Our expert team of Gnome Wizards work tirelessly to bring the most customizable and powerful figures for your character. Our sleek, seamless, flash-less miniatures are unrivaled in appearance and each is blessed by a team of Clerics. \n    Can\u2019t find the perfect miniature for your Dwarven Fighter?  \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Are the only miniatures available carrying a broadsword instead of a warhammer? \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Is the figure\u2019s beard too short for your perfect avatar? \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Through dark and forbidden rituals, we have given you, the player, the ability to select everything about your character. Complete customization is now in the hands of the player. Whatever hands, head, tail, wings, clothes, weapons, and practically anything else you can think of, we can do. Even the most mundane of coin purses will look amazing on your character \u2013 through our high-quality 3D printing.  \n This project combines everything you want from a miniature - the original creative art, with the best quality that can be found for a customized unique printed miniatures.\n*Warning: Miniatures may contain bonus Experience Points \n     The Eldritch Foundry has partnered with the leading US 3D printer manufacturer, 3DSystems, and our in-house printers utilize the most advanced technology available on the market. As such, we are printing at a quality that is substantially higher than anyone else. We print at about 40% higher definition than anyone else on the market.\nMost miniatures currently available on the market are printed at around 50 microns. An Eldritch Foundry miniature is printed at around 32 microns. In addition, we use wax supports. This process means your miniatures will have no flash, no mold lines, and no seams. \n       Our character creator interface is like nothing you\u2019ve seen before, except perhaps in video games. We have developed a one-of-a-kind character creator to a look and feel that closely resembles the character creators in Baldur\u2019s Gate, Planescape, Torment, or even Skyrim (well, at least the starting bit). The interface is intuitive and easy to use, while providing for a maximum level of customization for your miniature.\n    Each and every character choice, from race and class, to armor and weapons, has a unique lore associated with it. We have partnered with several brilliant writers (most notably- the amazing Patrick Stuart!) to create a lore that is as unique as our character creator. \n    This process, from the unique character creator to the expansive and in-depth lore,  makes creating a high quality and custom miniature more immersive and helps create a world-building experience.\n       We have developed the first and only conditional marker base for your miniatures. This base allows for the quick and easy identification of conditional statuses of your character, without the need for conditional rings or milk jug rings. The conditions available on your unique Eldritch Foundry miniature base include poisoned, restrained, concentration, deafened, petrified, grappled, blinded, and frightened. We have even provided conditional marker bases that are blank, if you prefer to draw your own. We\u2019ll even have an option where you can choose which conditions you want on your base (but that\u2019s a bit more down the line).\n      In order to bring you the finest quality miniatures, every piece is first individually drawn by gentle hands of our Tiefling concept artists. Then, these sketches are animated, given sentience, and turned into 3-dimensional models.  Our miniatures are then crafted from these models by an expert team of Gnome Wizards. This process is designed to bring you the highest-quality, unique, and magically enchanted miniatures possible. \n      To bring you more, we must first provide offerings to the lords of darkness and miniatures, who enslave hapless concept artists for no less than 99 years. These concept artists provide us with all the exquisite art, in order to bring the most realistic and beautifully rendered miniatures to you, the player.  Through this project we intend to bring you more items, races, mounts, perhaps a campaign setting, and even a little thing we think of as \"the bits box\".\n       The Eldritch Foundry's founders are gamers, like you. We would like to let gamers take their character from the imaginary and make them a reality. To provide miniatures of the highest quality, both in the form of the model and in the quality, while using the latest in 3D printing quality available. More than that, table-top gaming is a community experience. As such, we provide services both with online sales and through friendly local gaming stores.  \nEnjoyable and intuitive site - for the quick and easy customization of your characters.\nUnique and original craftsmanship -of all the items, armor, weapons, clothes, and accessories your character will ever need.\nBuilt-in status indicator bases - for quick and easy identification of character status' \nNew origin lore written for Eldritch Foundry - making the character creation process much more immersive and interesting. \nQuality 3D printing - showing the finest detail available on the market, exactly as designed by you, the player.\n      The Eldritch Foundry, a group of nerds and geeks dedicated to bringing the most unique and customizable miniatures available. We are committed to improving your games. And we are enthusiastic about our mission.\nThe Eldritch Foundry loves the TTRPG community- and acts on it with a business model that is geared towards helping your local gaming store thrive. We incentivize foot traffic by offering free shipping if you send your avatar to your local gaming store. We share in every miniature sale made within store grounds, and for every miniature sent to stores.\nRetailers- feel free to reach out, we'd love to discuss this in person!\nOur partner FLGS, Knight's Watch Games:\n  \"Eldritch Foundry is a revolutionary company that bridges the gap between producers, retailers and customers.  The ability for a customer to design, purchase and pick-up their customized miniature at the brick and mortar store facilitates better relationships between buyer and seller, guarantees a better shopping experience, and higher customer satisfaction. The immersive process of personalizing a character and reading the powerful descriptions for the various options makes building your dream character super entertaining!\" - Brenda and Paraic Mulgrew of Knight's Watch Games\nThe Eldritch Foundry is a firm believer that the TTRPG community is just that- a community. We strive to work with everybody- from stores, to local artists, to gaming streams, and beyond. As such, we've begun partnering with the D4 D&D stream (go check them out!) to provide their gaming miniatures.\nWe've also started working with artists from the community which we love- first and foremost- the Griffon's Saddlebag (you can see his Retaliating Shield on some of our minis, even!).\n      Based on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all.\nUS shipping (to your local gaming store)- FREE!\nRest of the world - shipping will cost $10.\n What is the Eldritch Foundry?\n      We are two friends, who quit our day jobs, and founded Eldritch Foundry. We provide miniatures of the highest quality, both in the form of your miniature\u2019s model and in the quality, while using the latest in 3D printing technology available. This process will give your miniatures a sleek, seamless, flash-less appearance not available in any other product on the market.\nHow do the miniature coupons work?\n      All rewards for \u201ccustom miniature coupon(s)\u201d are presented as coupons, and as such, are good indefinitely. This allows you to redeem at any point and even for future releases and features.  \nWhen will the Miniatures Ship?\n      Tricky question! Our full Character Foundry will be up and running August 1st, when we debut at Gen Con. We are currently gunning for a weeks turnaround (1-2 days to print, 3-6 days of shipping in the US), but a two week turnaround is a bit more likely (especially if we have a huge backlog). \nIt should be noted that we will be adding more and more items, races, weapons and\u2026 stuff(?) as time progress, so if you have a specific idea for your mini, look up our development schedule on our site!\nWhat about international shipping?\n      Shipping to the US is free of charge. Shipping to Western Europe is going to add about 10$ on top of your pledge level.\nHow do I select more than one pledge goal?\n     In Kickstarter you can only really select one pledge goal, but no worries. If none of the pledge levels are just right, pick the one closest to what you want, and you can adjust upwards later in our backer kit. \nRetailers - What are the typical cost of an Eldritch Foundry miniature in a retail store?\n      Our current pricing point for a single miniature is about MSRP 35$. The conditional marker base should add another 10$ on top of that. Oversized models will run you about 10$ extra. \nWe\u2019re still looking into \u201cbits\u201d pricing and quantities, so that\u2019s a big WIP right now.\n     New to Kickstarter? No problem! Just follow these simple steps: \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1) Development challenges\n\n We have been accepted as exhibitors at Gen Con 2019. As such, we have a hard deadline to have our character creator site up and running by August 2019. With this in mind, our current plan is to launch as soon as possible, with various additional features being introduced later on in the development phase. These additional features, which are being considered non-essential for initial launch, are thus marked down as a phase 2. For example, these additional features consist of features like \u201cbits\u201d purchasing and social media sharing with cool filters are lower on our priority list.\n In all regards, development of the product is largely complete with high-quality highly detailed miniatures. This project is intended to raise capital in financially reasonable way.\n\n\n2) Asset creation:\n\n Our asset creation timeline is very much dependent on how successful the Kickstarter campaign is. Our current funding is enough to let us reach Gen Con 2019 with an already assembled asset library of high Fantasy weapon and armor sets, and the base races of Humans, Elves (& half-Elves), Dwarves, Goliaths and Halflings.\n The greater our success, the faster we hope to add additional assets and features to the system. However, there is an upper limit to how fast we can add additional assets, while still maintaining a high-quality of production. We will have a production schedule posted on our home website once we see how far ahead, we are. This will allow Eldritch Foundry fans to come and see new products and plan ahead for when their favorite race and genres come online.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "",

The journey that brought me to this point was that I had already collected all of the sets of chibi minis I could find on the market to paint for my D&D campaign, but I found out that the company I was following would no longer be making minis.\nI love playing D&D, but once I had set my sights on a more anime style, the usual minis just wouldn't cut it. The first 5 minis in the Starter Pack are actually the original 5 players' characters in the campaign I'm currently running.\nThere are a few reasons I'm running this campaign. The first is that I invested some start up funds in getting together the illustrations for these ten. I plan to invest funds from this campaign into more illustrations for future projects.\nThe second reason is that I plan to look into more tools like a drawing tablet, zBrush, which I see many others in the space using with amazing results, and increased marketing efforts to build a social media presence I can go to for ideas and inspiration.\nMy final reason for running this project is a very long way out, but I've been inspired by fantasy board games that use minis like these and I'd like to one day make my own. If I can continue to create models and illustrations, it will be that much easier to convert them into collectible characters. \nPlease Note: This campaign IS NOT for a boardgame, and it IS NOT for physical merchandise. The rewards include digital .STL files for 3D printing and .PNG files for digital art.\nMagnetic Modular Japanese Gate Wall\nI created this Japanese Gate set to appeal to anyone-not just fans of minis.

Sent to him by his mysterious brother, he continues to find clues about his own path, and that of his family.\nThe swords themselves aren\u2019t the only piece of the puzzle. The note that came with them included writing from his brother, but also writing from an unidentified source.\nOrphan Rogue Mahi:\n\nMahi is a young wood elf who was orphaned at a very young age. Not knowing her parents, she grew up feeling isolated and was met with great hardship even trying to find daily meals.\nNaturally, she honed her skills to ensure her survival. Stealing food meant living another day, and this is what drove her forward.\nMahi enrolled in the military and protects her kingdom to achieve her two simple goals: Get 3 square meals a day and find friends to share them with.\nAlice of Ravens:\n Alice grew up in a large family with five older siblings. Being the youngest in the bunch, she found herself overshadowed by their vast range of talents.\nOnce her family moved from the magical floating city of \nEukalade to the non-magical walled city of Locaste, Alice dearly missed the days she could cast magic freely.\nShe strategically joined the military to gain access to the few areas of the walled city where magic was permitted and began to master her techniques with her raven staff in hand.\nNature's Protector Odessa:\n Odessa spent her childhood growing up within Locaste\u2019s thirty walls. Coming from a family of bakers, fighting was never in her blood.\nShe got a taste for protecting others when a large, rabid dog broke loose and started attacking some nearby children.\nFollowing her faith of the goddess Archena, Odessa decided on her paladin oaths and set forth to make the country safer for all.\nLolita Vampire Lobelia:\n Little is known about Lobelia the vampire; she seems to come and go as she pleases. It is rumored that she\u2019s a fearsome fighter, but nobody seems to be able to provide an eye-witness account.\nIn truth, this playful devil loves to mess around with her \u201ctoys\u201d\u2014a word she uses to describe the unsuspecting victims of her games.\nHer parasol keeps her safe from the sun\u2019s harsh rays, but she\u2019ll use it as a masterful weapon when the need arises.\nDeadly Smile Ellie:\n Ellie suffered her first defeat at the age of three when her entire family was murdered by bandits. Sadness was never an option for her; there was one lesson to learn.\n\u201cThe strongest are the killers, and they\u2019re the ones that survive.\u201d\nThis mantra fueled her every decision and she soon found herself standing atop a metaphorical mountain of the hundreds of lives she had taken.\n\u201cYou certainly look strong. Let\u2019s play a little...\u201d\nPlague Doctor Rust:\n If you\u2019ve ever received treatment from Rust, consider yourself among the lucky ones. Rumors of this mysterious, seemingly decrepit man are many and varied, but it\u2019s agreed that anyone who sees the shadows that follow him will die.\nRust will not talk to you, and it\u2019s unknown if he\u2019s even able to speak at all. He\u2019s been seen deep in speechless conversation with small animals and birds, but one has to wonder if he looks upon them with evil intentions.\nJust what is in those potions of his?\nHealing Scripture Basil:\n Basil: the gentle angel sent from the heavens. His calm demeanor is certain to put you at ease as he remedies your ailments with his powerful healing magic, but you can\u2019t help but wonder what his personal goals might actually be.\nWhile the young angel appears to be an ally of the kingdom, he\u2019s said to have been seen healing the crown\u2019s enemies. Is he just so kind that he\u2019s willing to heal those who are good and evil, or is there something deeper behind his actions?\n\u201cI\u2019ve ensured you\u2019ll all survive, but I must ask that you be more careful in the future.\u201d\nRain of Fire Kress:\n Kress grew up in the western country of Robur. Here, his family has been stationed on the giant wall called the Thievesguard, where their sworn duty is to keep the thieves of the country Genii from invading their allied nation of Lenus.\nKress understands the importance of his duty on the wall, but what he truly wants is a change of scene. Channeling his innate magic to bring fire to the skies with his bright arrows, Kress tries his best to stay distracted from boredom.\n\u201cThe wall\u2019s greatest strength is it\u2019s ability to stand still forever\u2014my greatest disappointment.\u201d\nStretch Goals\nPlease note that I do not already have the illustrations completed for the stretch goals, as I'm relying on the success of this project to finance them. On the launch of this campaign, I've finished 4/6 of my originally planned stretch goal models in multiple poses, and I'm working on the final 2.\nIf the project surpasses all of my stretch goals, I will come up with more.\n[LOCKED] $1500 Stretch Goal: Thousand Fists Orka | 3 Poses\n\n[LOCKED] $2000 Stretch Goal: One-Man Fortress Goldar | 2 Poses + Helmet Variant\n\n[LOCKED] $2500 Stretch Goal: Summer Solstice Folia | 2 Poses\n\n[LOCKED] $3000 Stretch Goal: Tricky, Tricky\n[LOCKED] $5000 Stretch Goal: Musical Twins\nCredits:\nAll of the illustration work was done by Kari, who you can find at:  https://www.facebook.com/karissamoloney/ \nThe music I used in my video was provided by Brenden Obuck, who you can find at:  https://brendenobuck.com/ \nSpecial thanks to my girlfriend Alex for her fantastic mini painting work!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe format of providing 3D-printable digital files means minimal risk for me.

Our goal is to create a wide variety of high quality 3D printable miniatures priced affordably for $1!\n\nBeginning\nWe are starting off with our $1 Miniature Set - Viking Raiders. If you back this set we will send the images displayed to one of our partnering professional 3D modelers, who will turn our sketches into 3D printable models for you!\n\nFuture\nWe have a voting page with access renewed monthly. If you select to back our project with a tier including voting rights you will gain access to our SCoFA page for the month the Quickstarter ends + the following month. We will submit ideas for future models to our SCoFA page for decisions on what models we should pursue next, as well as votes for other things we are working on.\nWe will also make all model miniature sets available on our website once they are developed, and you have our word that any models made under our $1 Miniature Set title will always remain $1 for everyone forever.\n\nAncient Cityscape\nOur $10 tier includes a 50% off ($10 coupon) for our modular city core set. This is available on our website, and is comprised of 17 .stl 3D print files allowing you to build a custom ancient city. It also includes all tiers before it.\nIf you are interested, we have plans to develop a lot of add-on sets for this which we will make available in the future!\nwww.iungogames.com\nOur $20 tier includes a 100% off ($20 coupon) for our modular city core set.

Next, we will develop the models with the Stretch Goal Kickstarter funds, and then will deliver them, in addition to our Viking Raiders set, to you!\n\nWhy are there double Tiers?\nThis is our very first Kickstarter, and we forgot to add clear stretch goals at the outset of our campaign! Once someone backs a tier we become unable to edit it, so we had to create duplicate tiers to add the Stretch Goal reward to them.\n\nThe Viking Raiders\nWe paid an artist to illustrate these three characters (Viking Raiders), and with our goal funded we will work with our partnering 3D modeler to make them 3D printable model miniatures!\nWe had a poll in which our backers voted to decide what position/pose they want these models to be in, and we have updated the illustrations to what they voted on!\n\nHorns on the Helmets\nWe received feedback from our backers, almost half of them, would prefer a version of the models without horns on the helmets. Our 3D modeler has agreed to create this variation on the two models with helmets for an additional $20. We will pay this extra cost, and deliver both versions of the models to any backers of either the Sword Raider or the Axe Raider!

This time around we've got civilian/NPC miniatures from the varied fantasy races to help diversify your RPG/wargaming experience.\nWHAT IS TOWNSFOLKE?\nTownsfolke is a range of 3d-printable miniatures designed by us (Ill Gotten Games). This campaign is for the digital files (not finished miniatures). Townsfolke models (like much of our catalog) are designed to be easy to print at stock settings, and print without support material.\nThe miniatures from the core rewards printed in resin.\nEach Townsfolke model can be printed with or without a textured base. Though optimized for stock FDM printing (with detail levels to match), you can print these models in resin as well (and can do so without support that way too).\n\nWHAT DO I GET?\nThe base pledge ($15) gets you all 15 miniature files included in the core set:\n\nIS THERE MORE?\nYou bet! Not only do we have an extensive range of existing Townsfolke sets available on our storefront (and included with a higher pledge level), but as we unlock stretch goals, every backer at the $25 level and higher will get bonus sets added to their haul. We'll update this space as stretch goals are revealed/added.\n\nIn addition to these new sets, we have an extensive range of Townsfolke sets that are currently available for purchase. These sets will also be added to pledges at the $70 level and higher.\nPlus, we have a free starter set, featuring tavern patrons, town guards, a(n ominous looking) ferryman, and more!\nAnd- we've released a special set, the Interplanar Dutchess with Pet Mimic, that's available for free via Thingivere! \n\nWHAT SCALE ARE THESE MINIATURES?\nTownsfolke are firmly in the 32mm scale, which means they'll be compatible in size with Reaper Miniatures, CMON, modern Games Workshop models, Hero Forge, and most other contemporary/mainstream ranges. However, if you play in a specialty scale, you can easily re-size the models before printing. (If re-scaling, you'll probably want to print the base-free versions and base them afterward to keep fidelity with the rest of your collection.)\nThe guidelines above should work, but when in doubt, eyeball the scale change next to a model that you know is in the scale you want.\n\nWHAT IF I DON'T HAVE A 3D PRINTER?\nIf you don't own a 3d printer (or know someone that does), some of our Patreon members are licensed to sell our Townsfolke models (along with the rest of our catalog of designs), and you can find a list of licensed printers here. It's not necessary for you to back this campaign to buy printed versions from our patrons, simply reach out to them and place an order!\n\nMINIATURE GALLERY\nDwarf Traveler (on and off base) printed by Patreon supporter, Scott Frega\nVarious FDM prints (Ender 3) by Patreon supporter, Mike Sheridan.\nDwarf travelers on a journey, printed and painted by Patreon supporter, Stephen Renwick.\nPixie Pickpockets printed by Patreon supporter, Scott Frega\nThe Interplanar Dutchess taking Blue (her pet mimic) out for an off-leash stroll.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny models we show have been successfully prototyped, so once funding clears, we'll be ready to deliver your rewards as promised.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Passerby", "descp": "You get the core Free Folke set including the 15 3d-printable miniatures shown on the main page.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Onlooker", "descp": "You get the core Free Folke set including the 15 3d-printable miniatures shown on the main page + any sets unlocked via stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["65 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "Bystander", "descp": "You get the core Free Folke set including the 15 3d-printable miniatures shown on the main page + any sets unlocked via stretch goals + all of our previous Townsfolke sets.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["38 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "Sheriff", "descp": "You get the core Free Folke set including the 15 3d-printable miniatures shown on the main page + any sets unlocked via stretch goals + all of our previous Townsfolke sets.\nIn addition, you will receive a special seller's license allowing you free reign to sell 3d printed versions of the Townsfolke files including future sets you acquire that are in this range.

The dragon was printed in 4 parts, the base, tail half, neck half, and head but I really disliked how the seam line was a bit problematic at the tail and neck half so I decided to shrink down the body a tad bit to fit in the 3d printer instead it's at around 170mm now but only requires gluing at the head and to the base which is notched.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Over $100k Canadian Raised! Four Stretch Goals Unlocked!\nTime for some real Sweet Rolls!\nI created Ice Cream Dice to address the severe lack of nearly edible looking dice in the marketplace. I believe I have succeeded.\nOK, OK, that wasn't actually why I started Ice Cream Dice. I wanted dice that were fun, unexpected at a gaming table and a little bit whimsical, all while being usable. I started it because I was so tired of seeing the same dice offered on different sites, by different companies with different names. Names like 'Goblin's Blood' and 'Dragon's Blah Blah Blah'. \nWhen I got to thinking about fun and whimsical, ice cream came immediately to mind and I started on a journey to design the most ice creamy looking dice I could.\nNeo, the classic flavor we all love to hate (well a third of it anyway).\nOrange Dream, a dreamy mix of orange and cream.\nRainbow, also known as Schubert's Sherbet.\nYour Favorite, whether your favorite is chocolate, coffee or caramel, this set has you covered with just a touch of cream.\nBubble Candy, old school bubblegum and carnival cotton candy.\nKiwi, it's even got the seeds!\nThe matte set on the left and the glossy d20 on the right.\nRazzman, the Kickstarter semi-exclusive set. \nAfter this Kickstarter is done, Razzman will be offered once a year to celebrate the day this Kickstarter was fully funded.\nButterscotch: The epitome of potential. \nButterscotch will be redone in production to look like Orange Dream. The original intent was to swirl white and a light brown with a highlight yellow/brown. Unfortunately, these are what I got and with no time to order more test sets, you'll just have to trust me. As you can see, I take my dice palettes very seriously, and will deliver on the potential of these dice.\nThe Dice You See are the Dice You'll Receive\nUnlike some dice companies, there are no renders here, these are the dice you will receive. \nExcept Butterscotch. \nButterscotch will get the Orange Dream treatment with a brown and white gemini/swirled result.\nKiwi's numbers will be re-inked in a pale/golden yellow.\nThe Waffle Dish\nThis waffle dish is a Kickstarter Exclusive. They will never be made or sold again. These are each individually hand blown glass waffle dishes. They are made with borosilicate glass, which is often used in cookware. They are not as delicate as soft art glass, however, they are still fragile.\nThey are small. Roughly 1.5\" - 2\" high and about 2\" - 2.5\" across at the top.\nThis shot shows you how beautiful the inside is.\nSsssssssssstretch Goals\nI could easily have done what most dice companies do and locked the popular dice designs behind fake stretch goals, but I won't. I could have easily found something that was sort of related to dice and offered that as a stretch goal, I didn't.\nI'm a very small company (it's just me) and this is my first Kickstarter, so over complicating things to make it 'look' cooler seemed both dishonest and foolhardy. There's enough moving pieces already, and I'm confident I can deliver on these stretch goals.\nQUICK EDIT: If you're stoked about the D6/D10 Sets and mini D6 Bricks, please read update #17. The graphic below will be changed to reflect the updated information later today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight about now you're saying to yourself, well, that's great and seems like you can deliver it all, but I WANT MORE! To that, I say, take a gander.\nAdd-ons, or...more ways to give me your money!\nI have worked with small creators in our community to bring you two add-ons. These will both be available to add on to your order in Backerkit after the campaign ends.\nFlavour of the Month\nFor $5 (approx. $4 USD / \u20ac3 / \u00a33 ) You can take your kids, your friends or both on an Ice Cream Adventure written exclusively for Ice Cream Dice by Andrew Morley. The local ice cream maker has disappeared! It's up to your party to discover what happened to him. Along the way you may meet yourself some new elementals inspired by Ice Cream Dice. You'll receive a PDF copy of this sweet adventure by late June.\nHandmade d4 Dice Bag\nFor $15 CAD (approx. $12 USD / \u20ac10 / \u00a39 ) you will get a custom, handmade d4 shaped bag that holds over 100 dice! \nThese are Ice Cream Dice exclusives. I partnered with people that could create things that were special, a bit whimsical and useful. These d4 dice bags aren't likely to be produced again. If you want one, this may be the only time to get one. The inside of this dice bag will be a waffle cone pattern, rather than polka dots.\nPins\nFor $5 CAD (approx. $4 USD / \u20ac3 / \u00a33 ) You'll receive a soft enamel pin that will not only shout to the world you love dice, but also, ice cream.\nIf you love pins and just need a couple extra for every lapel you own, I got you covered! The pins are soft enamel with a rubber backing.\nIce Cream Dice Custom Dice Box\nFor $110 CAD (approx. $83 USD / \u20ac75 / \u00a365 ) you can get yourself an Ice Cream Dice exclusive dice box made by the wonderful folks over at Dog Might.\nFor $150 CAD (approx. $114 USD / \u20ac100 / \u00a385 ) you can get yourself an Ice Cream Dice box made out of stunning Wenge wood. This rare dark chocolate colored wood is stunning and sustainably sourced.\nThe folks over at Dog Might reached out to me after seeing my project and told me they had a great idea for a dice box. They weren't lying. These boxes have a lifetime warranty and are gorgeous. Dog Might only works with the best of the best in the industry. I will update this with more details and pictures once I have the prototype in my hands and have all the information.\nFrom Dog Might:  The Dog Might Ice Cream Dice Box is crafted from Flame Birch wood and features a hand applied finish. It comes with a removable foam insert cut to cradle your set of dice perfectly. Remove the foam to easily carry two full sets of polys. Like all Dog Might products, the Ice Cream Dice Box comes with a lifetime guarantee. \nThese boxes are prototypes and a couple of small changes will be happening in the final production. The edges of the D20 top will be a little crisper, and the front facing number will be a 20, because we all know that's the number we like to see the most!\nThe Blue Ice Cream Dice Box\nThis color combo is called cake by Dog Might, but I call it sno-cone!\nThe stunning Wenge wood box with Your Favorite. A match made in heaven.\nFlat Pack Ice Cream Dice Dice Tower\nFor $25 CAD (approx. $19 USD / \u20ac17 / \u00a315 ) you can get yourself an Ice Cream Dice dice tower made by the awesome folks over at Galaxy Gaming Gear.\nThe awe inspiring Ice Cream Dice Tower of Doooooooooooooooooom!\nGalaxy Gaming Gear makes a slew of flat pack minis, terrain and buildings for all your gaming needs. Their designs are particularly kid friendly and it's great to have them on board. I will continue to sell this tower after the campaign, though the price will likely be $30.\nI know, Mom said not to talk about the 'S' word, but we have to...Shipping.\nShipping is the one spell that neither creator, nor adventurer, can break. Being based out of Canada, I feel your pain. I have partnered with a Canadian company that ships straight from China. This is hugely beneficial to all of us, myself included, for a few reasons.\nWe don't have to wait three months for the dice to arrive by freight ship to North American shores, and then wait further while it's unpacked and sent to different shipping centers which then finally get it shipped to you.\nIt's reasonably affordable and delivered with tracking number and insurance to everybody.\nI save money on not having to ship it by sea, which means I pass that savings on to you.\nSo here's the shipping breakdown, it doesn't cover every possible currency, but it covers a lot.\nThere, we did it, we had the dreaded 'S' talk.\nMatte or Glossy, that is the Question:\nHere are the side by side shots of the Matte & Glossy versions of each set. Some key things to keep in mind: \nThe glossy look is achieved by tossing the dice into a rock polisher, so the matte dice are a little larger because they've haven't been polished for as long as the glossy sets. The matte Rainbow and Neo d20's are a little larger than the rest, due to being cast in resin.\nThe powdery look on the matte Neo and Rainbow will eventually wear off. The colors are still softer than gloss, but the frosty look is not permanent.\nIf you prefer your colors to be vivid and brighter, you'll want to go with the gloss.\nMatte isn't very shiny, I know this should seem obvious, but if you like your dice shiny, go with glossy.\nThey do feel different, but the difference isn't night and day like it is with matte and glossy paper.\nWith less polishing, there is occasional color bleed around some of the numbers, it is negligible when it does happen and it only happened on a couple of single numbers on a couple of individual dice in the 25 test sets I got. This may be fixed in production, but I felt it was worth noting\nLet's get to the comparison shots...\nNeo\nOrange Dream\nRainbow\nYour Favorite\nBubble Candy\nKiwi, the numbers on Kiwi will be re-inked with a golden yellow during final production.\nRazzman\nThe Final Butterscotch will look more like Orange Dream\nLet's End this on a High Note\nThank you. They're two simple words that we often toss around without really thinking about what they mean. I think about them a lot and how they relate to this company.\n'Thank' is defined as: to express gratitude to or to hold responsible.\nSo, let me say it again. Thank you. I hold you all responsible for the gratitude I felt every single day leading up to this launch, and will always feel. You cheered me on and you cheered me up, you shared my dice on your podcasts, streams, tweets, instagram, on Facebook. You made sure people knew about me and Ice Cream Dice. \nThis company was inspired by some pretty amazing kids and my desire to make D&D and other TTRPG's more accessible to schools and kids. It is my belief that the skills learned and demonstrated while playing tabletop games, of any sort, are the ones we want our next world leaders to possess. Risk taking, problem solving, learning that you can't do everything by yourself, the value of friendship, exploration, listening to multiple viewpoints, among many other things. \nI didn't get here because of a marketing budget or the right analytics or targeted ads. I got here because of my own work and your support. I didn't get here because I hired a team or had an unlimited amount of money to throw at things. I've said from the beginning, what you see is what you will get. Initially I thought I meant my dice, I soon learned I meant that about myself as well. \nThis community we're all a part of is amazing. I am proud, and humbled, to be a part of it. Here's to many sweet rolls with friends new and old!\nThank you,\nMarc Schubert, aka Ice Cream Dice\nA Really Great Facebook Group!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk in this project is the production & shipping time required to manufacture the dice and get them to you, my backers. I have been working with my factory for a while now and they are expecting my order at the end of March. Production time is usually in the 45 - 60 working day range. So somewhere between 9 - 12 weeks. However, complications can occur, holidays happen and to be safe, I have estimated a 9 - 18 week production range into my timeline. This allows for the custom molds to be created that are required to honor the stretch goals that may become unlocked during the campaign.\n\nI have partnered with a Canadian company that has years of experience shipping dice. They ship from their warehouse space in China which allows me to ensure a lower shipping cost that I can pass on to you, the backers.

FREEBIES!\nReviewers and pro-painters truly love it and are already using it daily.\nWhen painting miniatures, you cannot hold your miniatures with bare hands: You need a miniature handle. Today, there is no straight forward solution on the market: they are either too clumsy, not ergonomic, or overly expensive.\nThat's why we created RGG 360\u00b0, the first natural ergonomic handle for miniature painting. \nWith our unique design, you will be able to hold your miniature for long and comfortable painting sessions. No more cramps, no more unnecessary movement, just having fun painting.\nRGG 360\u00b0 has been designed by painters for painters and developed with the feedback of pro-painters. \nIt is already considered as the best tool available.\n\"[...] Once you\u2019ve got used to the rotating platform [...] may end up being one of those features you never knew you wanted.\" Sorastro's painting\nVous pouvez trouver une VF de la campagne sur le site de Redgrassgames/holder\n3d printed prototype\n\nRGG 360\u00b0 is the only natural ergonomic handle designed to create the best connection between you and your miniature, help you adopt the best painting position and minimise unnecessary movements.\nThe added benefits are greater stability, better precision and minimised fatigue to paint for hours. \n\n3d printed prototype\n\nMany do not pay attention to the handle of their holder. It is however at the heart of your painting experience. The handle is how you connect with your miniature. It needs to be perfect. We perfected it for months!\nRGG 360\u00b0 is the only handle designed to fit naturally in your hand with its unique shape. \nAs there is no strain on your hand and fingers, you won't have to move them and you can enjoy full control of your miniature.\nOnce you have it in your hand, there is no turning back.\n\n3d printed prototype\n360\u00b0 rotation axis is not an afterthought, it is inherent to the natural ergonomic design. Thanks to the handle, you can rest comfortably your wrist on the desk when painting. The 360\u00b0 rotation allows you then to access any part of your miniature fast and reliably. No more parasitic movements. You will rediscover the joy of painting.\n\nNo additional accessories needed. You have the best handle and the best mounting solution for the best price!

More details in the shipping section below.\n\nRead below to have all the details!\n\n3d printed prototype\nA straight simple handle does not fit your hand comfortably. To achieve a good quality painting, you need to stay focused and to hold your miniature naturally without causing hand fatigue. For that, RGG 360\u00b0 is slightly curved and designed to feel very natural in your hand. No odd shape. That's why the sculpted handle has been designed to sit comfortably in the hand.\nPLAY\n\nRGG 360\u00b0 has been tested by many pro painters, painters and even by a 9 years old (Vivien's daughter) to ensure a comfortable handling for most hand size.\nQuite the opposite because the hand on the handle helps improve your overall precision.\nAlso it offers more control and allows you to get around your miniatures without removing your hand from the handle. This innovation will help you achieve a better painting on every angle- Effortlessly\nRGG 360\u00b0 can rotate easily yes, but once you stopped the rotation it will just stay in place. You don't need to hold it with your thumb.\nThanks to our custom made mounting putty, you can fix a large range of miniatures from your favorite games! The putty is of course reusable, we have been using the same putty for months. \nSquare, round, oval up to 55mm\nRound, square, small, large, exotic bases\u2026 miniatures bases come in many shapes. When designing RGG 360\u00b0, we tried some mechanical designs and all kind of sticky materials but they were either non adaptive, clumsy, heavy, none reusable... anyway, they always had disadvantages.\n So we have created a custom made mounting putty, as the perfect mounting solution for your miniatures: Reusable, adaptable, safe, for long. We have been testing the putty for several months, and it never dried out.\nWith 15 grams included with the handle, you have 3x the amount needed to stick your miniatures. \nPLAY\n\n    Made in Europe.\nRGG 360\u00b0 is weighted for optimal stability.\nAdditional custom-made mounting putty included: Our orange putty was customized to have the perfect stickiness and consistency.\nHigh quality axle of rotation: We tried it all, plastic friction, ball bearing... but nothing compare to our special designed axis. It will provide a smooth, accurate and fun rotation, and will last up to several hundred thousand of rotations. Rotate it freely with your thumb, it will stay in place during your painting. Axle of rotation will be graded up to 500k+ rotations.\nMade of PREMIUM plastic: we selected ABS as the best plastic for our handle, due to its density and toughness. The weight will just be perfect in your hand and the handle will last for long\nGraining and engraving on the plastic for optimal grip: Instead of smooth plastic, we decided to add some areas with slight engraving, to improve the handling.\n3d printed prototype\nColour selection available during the pledge manager\n\nPro painters understand and have come to expect advances on miniature tools. All those who tried it said it just feels right and gives a lot of comfort when painting.\n\"[...]  Once you\u2019ve got used to the rotating platform, may end up being one of those features you never knew you wanted.\" Sorastro's painting\n\"[...] This is pretty awesome!\" The Beasts of war (Ontabletop)\n\"[...] RGG 360\u00b0 fits better in the hand and the 360\u00b0 feature is really a great help, which ensures a lot of comfort. For me personally it is the better choice.\" Bruckenkopf online (DE) \n\"[...] The bearing (axle) is easy but it is not too \u201cloose\u201d so you will not be afraid to move your mini just by moving your brush or removing your hand I repeat, for me it\u2019s very well done.\" Le temple de Morikun (FR)\n\"[...] the handle is excellent. This is now my default paint handle. I don't reach for the GW or other brands as much as possible. Totally recommend this handle for any painter !!\" War of sigmar \n\"[...] The key feature and the best thing about this holder is the fact that just with the touch of your finger you can actually turn around  so when you airbrush in a miniature you can literally be   airbrushing and just touch the top of   the holder with your thumb and you can brush all around  [...] it's also nice to obviously hand brush and use a 360\u00b0 feature of this holder now\" Orcpainternerd \n\"[...]Thanks again to Redgrass Games for the use of the fantastic painting handle.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have gained a lot of experience thanks to our first Kickstarter project last year : The Everlasting wet palette. The first KS was a very complex project, coordinating many different suppliers worldwide. But it was a big success with more than 8.000 backers. We have learned from this experience how to create a technical product with a lot of backers from all around the world . For our second Kickstarter campaign, RGG 360\u00b0 will be made in Europe. This new Kickstarter project is driven by one goal: to create a high-quality miniature holder for your painting sessions.\nAs with any production, there are risk concerning the time needed for production and the control of quality. We however believe one point is key and necessary to our project, and will be worth delaying the production, in case the quality is not satisfactory : the quality of the rotation axis. We will focus a lot of attention on this production part. Sample productions showed excellent performance, we will make sure that the mass production rotation axis will be on par with it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "SOLO pack - RGG 360\u00b0", "descp": "Retail value: 12\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\nRGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n15gr of our custom made mounting putty", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,708 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "DUO pack - RGG 360\u00b0", "descp": "Retail value: 24\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n2\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["677 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac29 or more", "title": "TRIO pack - RGG 360\u00b0", "descp": "Retail value: 36\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["320 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac36 or more", "title": "SOLO + Brushes", "descp": "Retail value: 40\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\nRGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2/0\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["573 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "SOLO + Painter Wet Palette", "descp": "Retail value: 49\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\nRGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nEverlasting Wet Palette Painter\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["388 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac55 or more", "title": "TRIO + Brushes", "descp": "Retail value: 64\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2/0\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["262 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac66 or more", "title": "TRIO + Painter Wet Palette", "descp": "Retail value: 83\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nEverlasting Wet Palette Painter\nFree Hydration Paper Pack - 50 sheets\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["122 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac80 or more", "title": "TRIO + Studio Wet Palette", "descp": "Retail value: 101\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nEverlasting Wet Palette Studio XL\nFree Hydration Paper Pack XL - 50 sheets\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["42 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac97 or more", "title": "RGG \"All In\" TRIO + Painter + Brushes", "descp": "Retail value: 121\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nEverlasting Wet Palette Painter\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2/0\n2\u00d7 Free Hydration Paper Pack - 50 sheets\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac115 or more", "title": "RGG \"All in\" TRIO + StudioXL + Brushes", "descp": "Retail value: 144\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nEverlasting Wet Palette Studio XL\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2/0\n2\u00d7 Free Hydration Paper Pack XL - 50 sheets\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["60 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "1 Day Left To Back Our Newest & Most Historic Kickstarter!", "update_content": "Hi all,\nWith the RGG360 project, we had decided to produce for the first time our handles in Europe.

There are 3 waves per Battle, and Victory Points are added up for each player at the end of every Battle. If a Drakka gets through the defense, they raise the Panic Level in the kingdom according to the Threat they present.\nEach turn is a wave, and consists of 5 phases:\nPhase 1: Advance\nPhase 2: Draw\nPhase 3: Defend\nPhase 4: Resolve\nPhase 5: Develop\nIf the players last through all 5 Battles in the game and clear the board, they are victorious & the game ends.

I can think of 2 things that might delay or somehow jeopardize the creation of this game:\n\n1. Manufacturing & Fulfillment Issues\nThis is my first project, and I will readily admit that some things might sneak up on me. However, I've made it a point to surround myself with industry veterans, incredible resources, and trustworthy partners to mitigate any potential delay, and handle any bumps in the road.\n\n2. Injury, Illness, or Death\nFingers crossed nothing like this will happen, but because this is primarily my creation, a lot hinges on me staying healthy. So far there's nothing to be concerned about, and I'll do my best to keep it that way. Although because I'm from Alaska, a random bear attack isn't out of the question - but not very likely. Also, rest assured that I have amazing people around me that will make this happen in any case.\n\nIf there's anything at all you're concerned about, please feel free to email me at info@terminusbreach.com and let me know. I'll be happy to address any questions or issues personally.\n\nOnce again, I want to assure you that if there's any worldly way to make this game a reality, I will find it.

While this is the goal of the campaign, and everything would be fine if that had happened (to be clear, this was not a clerical error), i realized that it was just not true to my vision of the game.

Pledge for '66\u20ac Dragon Hoarder' and get all the dragons plus all the stretch goals.\n WARGAMES VERSION   \nThe Wargame version is meant to be used in tabletop battles along with other fantasy armies and regiments. These models are more pose constricted and carry a compatible wargame square base.  \nROLEPLAY VERSION  \nThe Roleplay version has a larger circular base and has a unique dynamic pose for each dragon, that is meant to be used when roleplaying with your RPG party. The dragons are sculpted without armor or harnesses as found natural in wilderness or dungeon.  \nDIORAMA VERSION The Diorama is the most dramatic and dynamic of all the sculpt types and shows the dragon mid scene interacting with its environment. This model can be used in games, but it is meant for the modeller or painter that wishes to immortalize a scene on his mantle piece.   \nFDM & SLA Samples\nDwarf Regiment \nThe dwarf regiment comes with 2 command figures, a standard bearer and a musician. The 'Hero' pack above contains 2 additional figures, a dwarf hero and commander. There are 6 unique posed infantry miniatures to choose from bearing different weapons and combat styles.\nIMPERIAL REGIMENT   \nThe Imperial regiment comes with 2 command figures, a standard bearer and a musician. The 'Hero' pack above contains 2 additional figures, a dwarf hero and commander.

Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled.\n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit.\n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end SLA machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, all the files have been previously tested on SLA and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce.\n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 200 micron layer height for terrain. A 100 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round. We have also tested the files with larger nozzles, at 500 microns and decent results are possible on most prints, if the layer height and temperature is controlled correctly. 0.5(500 micron) nozzles are not recommended for miniature printing.\n\nSLA printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. We will try our best to split models so they will fit in smaller print beds like those found on SLA machines. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed. Standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'\n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print.\n\nAll the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk. \n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user.\n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how.\n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they are not an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary.\n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Add-On", "descp": "Select this pledge and add-on the total amount for the products that you wish to receive.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Known only through whispers and rumors, the DCC RPG Annual is a legend before its time. Those few who have seen its pages are now but blasted ash. It's your turn, mortal. Be careful when you turn its pages...\nThanks everyone for a terrific Kickstarter! If you missed it, you can find the finished product at www.goodman-games.com once it's in print!\nColor cover to the DCC Annual! By Doug Kovacs\nThe Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game, also known as DCC RPG, is the most fun you\u2019ll ever have playing an RPG. It is also a game founded in principle. Important amongst those principles is an aversion to rules bloat. The DCC RPG core rulebook is but a single book. There are no splatbooks, sourcebooks, character books, monster manuals, or other supplements for DCC RPG. They are not needed. Incumbent upon the judge is the need to create: yon horizon is filled with adventure, and it is your adventure. You have worlds inside you: find them.\nYet the urge to create is a hungry god, and gods demand nourishment. It was originally conceived that an annual publication would exist in some form to showcase the brilliance of the DCC RPG community. This would be the DCC RPG Annual, published each year to distribute these gaming creations.\nThe best of things happened: the DCC RPG Annual was never needed. The DCC community burst forth a verdant jungle of inspiration, with ripe fruit on every limb. Blogs and personal posts; zines; community publications; the Gongfarmer\u2019s Almanac; officially licensed third-party works: there is a vast supply of inspiration from whence the DCC judge can draw and iterate.\nAnd thus we come here to Kickstart a volume which has no place. If you are a DCC fan, you absolutely do not need to support this Kickstarter. Should you to desire to do so, however, you will receive a book that has become a legend, despite never before being published.\nFoil cover to the DCC Annual! By Doug Kovacs. Imagine this printed in gold foil on a leatherette background.\nThe DCC RPG Annual\nSpoken about for half a decade in hoary whispers, at long last Goodman Games brings you: the DCC RPG Annual. Much of the material for the DCC Annual was written between 2012 and 2014, when the original need was perceived. In many ways, it springs forth from the original inspirations of DCC RPG, which were psychically close at that time. There are magic swords. There are patrons. There are even more tables for making monsters unique. There are rules for making cleric deities more distinctive. There are rules for patron weapons and magic rings. There is the lost continent of Mu, and the hidden places between worlds. And there are rules for magical moustaches.\nThe DCC Annual is a hardcover estimated at 160 pages finished length. Like the original DCC RPG core rulebook, it is available in two cover options: a full-color and foil cover edition. It is organized in the same manner as the DCC RPG core rulebook: chapter three is equipment, chapter five is magic, and chapter nine is monsters, just as in the core rulebook. There is no chapter two, because the skills section of the core rulebook has no expansion material in the Annual.\nThe DCC Annual comes in two cover versions. The color cover is painted by Doug Kovacs and features Hugh the Barbarian and his Band. There's a story in this cover, a chapter of the Band history, for those who can find it. There is also a foil edition featuring a new foil design (and someone\u2019s decapitated head). For this Kickstarter, the foil edition will be printed in gold foil. The distribution version will be printed in silver foil. And never fear, art fans \u2013 the foil edition also features Doug's amazing cover art from the color cover edition (reproduced on the interior pages of the foil edition).\nYou absolutely do not need the DCC Annual to play DCC RPG, nor does any material in the Annual supersede or otherwise change the baseline game experience as expressed in the core rulebook. There is no rules bloat: only new vistas of imagination.\nAnd with every gift from the gods, comes a toll. Not only does this Kickstarter offer the DCC Annual, but it also offers three other artifacts to show your devotion: a new printing of the DCC RPG core book featuring yet more amazing art; a new hardcover edition of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin; and an opening offer of the DCC Quick Start Rules for new initiates. Read on! \nThe Shanna Dahaka cover to the DCC Core Rulebook! By Doug Kovacs\nNew Fans, Welcome!\nWe invite newcomers to join the Cult of DCC! As part of this Kickstarter, we are offering the DCC RPG Quick Start rules, in print+PDF format, for the ridiculously low price of $2.00. That price includes postage to anywhere in the world. If you haven\u2019t experienced DCC RPG, this is your chance to get in very affordably. The Quick Start Rules include everything needed to get your character from level 0 to level 2, and also include two one-session adventure modules. This pledge level also includes three free PDF adventures of our choosing.\nWe are also giving away a PDF of the Quick Start Rules for free at this link right here. If you\u2019re not sure what DCC RPG is, this is a great way to test the waters!\nAnd finally, if you as a newcomer decide you want to jump in a little deeper, we invite you to check out the Three Best Pledge Levels, detailed below. The Favored Retainer level offers an affordable way to get started on DCC RPG. \nThe pterodactyl-wizard cover to the DCC core rulebook! By Sanjulian\nDCC RPG Core Rulebook, 7th printing\nAlso offered in this Kickstarter are two other items of interest to the DCC gamer: a new printing of the core rulebook, including new cover art, and a compiled hardcover edition of DCC #83: the Chained Coffin.\nThe DCC RPG core rulebook has been through 4 hardcover and 2 softcover printings prior to this run. (And wow, isn\u2019t that amazing? Thanks everyone for the support!) Now that the hardcover is once again out of print, we are doing another printing.\nAs always, the content is materially identical to prior printings (except for fixing a couple typos). There will be a new adventure substituted in the back, as we do for each printing This printing includes \"Yddgrrl's Maze,\" a level 2 adventure by Michael Curtis. In addition, this print run will be distinguished by the covers. We are offering three covers on this hardcover edition:\n\u00b7 The \u201cbasic blue\u201d cover, the classic Doug Kovacs cover we all know and love.\n\u00b7 The Sanjulian cover. Fans of 1970's fantasy and sci-fi art will know Sanjulian's art from Warren magazines like Creepy and Eerie, as well as his run of Conan covers. This is the red-and-yellow \u201cpterodactyl-wizard\u201d cover you see above. The Kickstarter edition will include an exclusive foil imprint over the DCC logo.\n\u00b7 Doug\u2019s new Shanna Dahaka cover. The Kickstarter edition will include an exclusive foil imprint over the DCC logo. \nThe hardcover 2nd printing of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. Cover art by Ken Kelly\nDCC #83: The Chained Coffin (hardcover 2nd printing)\nDCC #83: The Chained Coffin was originally released way back in 2014. The boxed set proved immensely popular, and not just for the spinning map puzzle. The Appalachian-style fantasy setting of The Shudder Mountains, inspired by the works of Appendix N author Manly Wade Wellman, provides a unique place for your characters to adventure. Michael Curtis did a wonderful job of bringing The Shudder Mountains alive, and several supplemental volumes were published.\nNow that the original boxed set is out of print, we are offering a hardcover book that compiles all material from the original DCC #83: The Chained Coffin boxed set, including all the stretch goal booklets, as well as much, much more:\n\u00b7 All content from DCC #83.1: Tales of the Shudder Mountains and DCC #83.2: Death Among the Pines\n\u00b7 The Shudder Mountain material published in several Gen Con Program Guides\n\u00b7 Moon Eyes and Fire-Flies, a new adventure set in the Shudder Mountains\n\u00b7 Buzzard Hollow, a new Shudder Mountains mini-setting\n\u00b7 Ma Bigginty\u2019s Book of Backwoods Wisdom,a collection of inspiration material that will bring the Shudder Mountains to life in your game\nThe DCC #83 hardcover is estimated at 160 pages and yes, it will also include the spinning map puzzle! (We are working with the printer on logistics, but the most likely scenario is having the map tucked inside the back cover of each hardcover.)\nOne last thing. Doug\u2019s original art for DCC #83 is amazing, but you know we like variety. The hardcover edition features new art by none other than fantasy legend Ken Kelly. Fans of 1970s Warren magazines like Creepy and Eerie will also recognize the work of Ken Kelly, whose career also includes a long stretch of amazing illustrations. And his illustration builds on Doug\u2019s original design for the chained coffin itself. And don\u2019t worry, Doug\u2019s original cover art will also appear in the hardcover edition.\nDCC #83 will also be available in a foil edition, featuring the same amazing image that was printed on the limited-run foil editions of the original module. This cover art is timeless and deserves to remain in print. The Kickstarter edition will feature a different foil color than the distribution edition.\nThe original \"blue cover\" edition of DCC RPG core rulebook. By Doug Kovacs\nThe Three Best Pledge Levels\nIf you'd like to buy copies individually, the table below shows their cost. You can add on funds to purchase more than one book. However, there are some bundle deals that offer a great value. See the summary after the table: \nThe Three Best Pledge Levels. We are offering three great deals that make it easy to back multiple books in this Kickstarter. If you\u2019re a new fan, a dedicated fan, or a diehard collector, one of these is for you.\nFavored Retainer: You are new to the adventure, and you have promise. This pledge level is for new DCC fans and offers a $120 of product for $100. You\u2019ll receive the color-cover editions of the DCC Annual, core rulebook, and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. If you would like to have the Sanjulian or Shanna Dahaka covers for the DCC Core Rulebook, pledge for this level and add an extra +$20 for the price difference.\n Name Level: Your fame precedes you within the DCC community. This $150 pledge is a $30 savings on the cover price of $180. At the Name Level pledge, you\u2019ll receive DCC Annual (Kickstarter-exclusive foil cover), DCC #83: The Chained Coffin (Kickstarter-exclusive foil cover), and a copy of the DCC RPG core rulebook, with your choice of either the Sanjulian or Doug Kovacs cover.\nLanded Lord: Other fans make pilgrimage to witness to your legendary collection. This $300 pledge is a $60 savings on the cover price of $360. As a Landed Lord, you will receive everything offered in the Kickstarter, which is seven books: both covers of the DCC Annual, both covers of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin, and all three covers of the DCC RPG core rulebook (7th printing).\nPrint + PDF\nEvery print copy of the DCC Annual, DCC core rulebook, and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin books offered in this Kickstarter also includes a PDF edition.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThis is stated elsewhere but also to call it out explicitly: this Kickstarter features cover variants that are exclusive as follows:\n\u00b7 DCC RPG core rulebook, Sanjulian edition: the DCC RPG logo will be foil-printed\n\u00b7 DCC RPG core rulebook, Doug Kovacs Shanna Dahaka edition: the DCC RPG logo will be foil-printed\n\u00b7 DCC Annual, foil cover edition: the foil will be printed in gold. The distribution edition will be printed in silver.\n\u00b7 DCC #83: The Chained Coffin: the foil will be printed in gold. The distribution edition will be printed in silver.\nShipping Costs\nPlease note that shipping costs are not included in the pledge levels. Shipping costs will be assessed at a later date via Backer Kit. \nUSA shipments will ship via media mail, bound printed matter or equivalent rates.\nInternational shipments will ship via a tracked service, most likely FedEx or UPS. We will endeavor to find the cheapest option, and also partner with international shipping partners where possible to reduce VAT charges via local-market shipping. \nThe exact cost of each shipment will vary according to the content but please be aware that the hardcover books in this Kickstarter are heavy. International backers should expect to pay minimum postage charges for a single book of at least $20-$25 for Canada, $30-$35 for Europe, and $35-$40 for Australia and Asia. Additional books will obviously add to this cost. Final cost will be assessed via Backer Kit. \nStretch Goals\nWe have learned over the years that there are so many ways to make these books cool! We\u2019ve already worked out a couple options as options for stretch goals, which are listed below. As the project progresses we are open to suggestions from fans on others!\nAt $40,000: CLEARED!We will print new color art on the endsheets of the DCC Annual.\nAt $65,000: CLEARED! We will print maps on the endsheets of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. PLUS we will include a free 11x17 poster print of one piece of cover art with every print pledge!\nAt $80,000: CLEARED!Free adventure! For every book you buy, you'll get one free DCC adventure module in PDF format (exact module to be determined). (The $2 quick start rules don't count!)\nAt $100,000: CLEARED! We will include satin ribbon bookmarks in the DCC Core Rulebook and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin.\nAt $125,000: CLEARED!We will include printed 11\u201dx17\u201d posters of the cover art. There will be several \u201ccheckpoints\u201d on this stretch goal and we\u2019ll use backer feedback to decide which posters to print \u2013 the Chained Coffin cover, the Annual cover, the Sanjulian cover, etc. (Or maybe we\u2019ll just blow past this stretch goal and print them all!)\nBeyond that: We have some fun ideas. We would like to print custom dust jackets featuring the Deadly Hands of DCC art that premiered at Gen Con 2018. Some fans have requested books bound in real leather, and that may be an option we unlock. And we\u2019re open to your ideas as well!\nThe Demon Skull Add-On\nWe are also producing a version of the DCC RPG core rulebook that features the original iconic demon skull image.

Although you can simply add anything you want from the main shop as an add-on, if you like!\" ~Andy]\n \u00a38,000 STRETCH GOAL KLAXON!\nIf we hit \u00a38,000 the New Alternate Dragon Head will be unlocked and everyone can swap it for their Original head or add it for \u00a315 to their pledge.\nYeah ignore what I said above, sort of. Not a crazy stretch goal, though but a very cool one - people asked me to make a new head and I couldn't resist, so if we make it to \u00a38,000 (about 5 dragons away at the time of writing) then everyone can either swap their original Dragon head for this new Alternate one, or add it to their pledge as an extra head for \u00a315.00. It will be used on the next Dragon that Andy makes, in I dunno, a few years' time? Who can say, eh? but if wee hit \u00a38k then Andy will make it fit the current Dragon's body. (Note: above picture is early stage work in progress, it'll have lots more little spines and stuff.)\nThe Heresy Dragon. \nWhat a beast! (For an assembly video, check out Update #4, which is Andy assembling a Dragon for your delight)\nLong story short, this model caused a lot of problems during it's original production run; with ALL of those problems solved there's nothing stopping Heresy from making a short second run of models for those people who missed out on the first run, other than the amount of money, time and intensive labour it takes to make a full set of moulds for the beast, and to cast them. it's a glorious kit and will totally steal the show in your display cabinet!\nDragon painted and given a wonderful scenic base by Sean Powers\nDragon painted and given a wonderful scenic base by Sean Powers\n All 330+ Dragons of the original production run were finally completed in August 2015. Swearing never to even think of bringing it back into proper production after such a gargantuan effort, Andy gladly drew a line under it and plunged into the Return Of the Monsters Kickstarter production (that campaign is all but completed, the final model, the Light Vs Dark diorama should be finished over the Christmas break, for those last 8 backers waiting for it) but since then, email after email has come in from people who somehow missed their chance to buy a Dragon for themselves. They ask him about it at shows or on the telephone. Without fail.\n\nAnd so, the tempting whispers have won. The Dragon's Master model castings are all safely stored, ready for moulding again, and here in 2018, Andy has decided that enough time has passed to distance himself from the emotional attachments surrounding his fight to bring the original production run to fruition, to allow himself to face the Great Enemy one more time. This thing is totally ready to go!\nDragon painted by Daemonslave\nEXPERTS ONLY \nThis is an Expert Kit. Do not buy this kit if you are not expecting to have to put some work in to assemble this beast. Although the joins are incredibly good (weeks of work went into making them as good as possible at the time), you will still have to do some gluing and a bit of gap filling with the putty of your choice, as you would with any multi-part resin model kit. The Dragon is supplied unpainted and unassembled. There is no painted option available, sorry.  Andy recorded a video of him assembling it for Update #3, Well that Worked Well, which should give you an idea of what is involved and if you could cope with it. Click the link above.\nThe kit is produced using a paintable mould release spray but we still advise that, prior to assembly, you wash the parts in warm soapy water to remove any residue of release spray, rinse and dry throughly and prime with a paint suitable for plastic surfaces.  Any minor mould lines can be gently scraped away with a knife or fine file, etc. It would be an ideal model to use airbrushes and oil washes on, in Andy's opinion. If any parts have bent or distorted during the casting process (quality control is extremely high but oversights can happen) simply immerse them in hot water for 20-40 seconds or so and carefully bend into desired position.\nThe Dragon uses a phenomenal amount of silicone and resin in it's casting process, over 21kgs of silicone and the final model is around 750 grams of resin. It is double cast to ensure the best bubble free castings, parts being both vacuum and pressure cast. It takes an entire day to produce one casting and clean all the moulds ready for the next one.\nThe finished model is around 30cm from base of rock to extended wingtip, and approx 44cm wide and 34cm long, in the pose as pictured. It (carefully) fits into an Ikea display cabinet, although you might have to take a shelf out to allow for the height.\nAfter this production wave is done, there will be a significant gap before the next one, if at all. So don't miss out this time around!\nIf this project funds, the first ten dragons will be ready by the end of January 2019. The next ten are scheduled for May just in case, because the Salute show comes along in April and really ruins everything production wise. Last year Andy worked so hard prepping for Salute he gave himself Type 2 Diabetes, so he's allowing plenty of time for it next year. However, if funding hits \u00a38,000 he will be able to speed things up and make extra moulds so some of those second ten will no doubt be ready in February, ahead of schedule.\nThe Dragon vs the Heresy Giant, Mucklegeet, vs a 30mm human figure, Brother Lucius, to give you a sense of size.\nPLEDGE MANAGER AND ADD-ONS - PLEASE NOTE: \nThere will be no pledge manager for this campaign. It adds so much complication to things for a one-man business and Andy wants things to go smoothly and simply this time around. You will be able to add models to your pledge later via the regular Heresy Miniatures shop once your Dragon is ready, or, if you really do want to pay for them now via Kickstarter, you can add any model from the main shop to your pledge by increasing your pledge enough to cover the cost of the models you are adding. MAKE A NOTE OF WHAT YOU WANT. A lot of people immediately forget what they pledged for after a campaign finishes. Surveys will be sent out almost immediately after the campaign so that you can tell us if you want any extras. \nIf you want to make a separate order right away to be sent out with your Dragon, you can do so by visiting the shop, adding whichever models you like to your basket, and then choosing the shipping option ADD TO DRAGON KICKSTARTER. This will not charge you for shipping, but you will be asked to pay correct shipping once your Dragon is ready to be sent. (Do you see why this suddenly makes things get more complicated for a one-man business now?). If you want to add any items from the normal shop to your pledge, simply click 'edit pledge' in the side menu, and add the total amount of add-ons to your existing pledge. Make a note of what you want, I repeat, for convenience. Kickstarter will charge your card during the payment process, which will be during the 14 day period after the campaign ends. You may receive a gentle reminder message from Andy if your card does not get charged sucessfully, as these things happen and often people don't realise they haven't paid for something. We all assume things will go smoothly, but banks are fickle creatures and, for example, can block payments for 'security reasons', especially if your card is used online at some site you haven't used before, for example.\nYou will be emailed/messaged once your dragon is ready, so please keep your contact details up to date on Kickstarter.\nAdd a Winged Netherlord II to your pledge for \u00a3140\nOr perhaps you would like the sensuous, sexy Madame? Add \u00a399 to your pledge, or go to the main shop by clicking this link, make an order for her and anything else you want, and choose Add to Dragon Kickstarter Pledge as the shipping\n                     Andy really does love making ridiculously big models. Here's Mucklegeet the Giant from the last kickstarter, add him to your pledge for \u00a3110.00gbp\nI will add some more Add-On examples during the campaign  just to keep things vaguely amusing for you all.\nREFUNDS: \nIf you change your mind and want a refund, you must do so within 13 days of the end of the campaign, as Kickstarter deducts fees from your payment and does not return them to Heresy if you request a refund from the campaign after 13 days. Refunds will not be given lightly, as every pound of this money is needed to produce the Dragons, so if you're the kind of person who buys things on a whim and then demands their money back two days later, DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL. It is not for you. This is for serious, patient, collectors only, who expect to wait months to get their Dragon, and are happy to do so. There will not be years of waiting like the first time around, but even so, be prepared to wait, because Expecting the Unexpected is an absolute requirement of the resin casting process. See the pledges for approximated dates for delivery (these have been exaggerated to allow for unforeseen delays) If you have a legitimate reason for requesting a refund after the 13 days period, and within 30 days of the campaign ending, any refund that can be made to you will be made, less the amount deducted by Kickstarter for their fees and payment processing.\nSHIPPING: \nShipping will be worldwide, you will be contacted individually for the additional payment once your Dragon is ready to ship. As each dragon weighs around 1.4kgs packed, expect to pay around \u00a322 for shipping to the USA (or Australia) via Royal Mail Tracked and Signed, or a courier can be arranged if preferred, although those services tend to be a little more expensive (faster too) and will incur a minimal fee at your end from the courier in your country. Royal Mail usually puts its prices up in April each year by a small amount. You will be responsible for paying any import duties and taxes.\nBrexit may mean that import duties apply to the European Union countries that the UK is currently a member of, unless some miracle occurs and we manage to stay in the EU Customs Union. I will try to get as many dragons out before March as I can, just in case! Currently typical costs are around \u00a316.00gbp for European shipping\nUK parcels will be sent via Recorded Delivery or Special Delivery as each backer prefers, fortunately the costs are much lower for that here in the UK!\n RECASTERS and OUR RIGHT TO REFUSE\nRecently there has been a sharp upturn in the number of recasters producing models from various one-man independent miniatures companies such as Heresy and our friends. By buying recasts, you are probably supporting much more nefarious industries and practices in the countries producing the pirated miniatures. We reserve the right to cancel the pledge of any backer who is a known recaster or associate of such or who lives in a country renowned for producing counterfeit miniatures. It's simply not on. We also reserve the right to refuse service for any other reason.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery possible problem that could happen, happened the first time around (there's a whole depressing blog about it on Andy's blog) and can now be dealt with through Andy's hard won experience. You don't cast 330+ of these beasts without learning everything there is to know about it. \n\nThe main thing that would affect this production run would be weather conditions - if it gets really cold in the workshop, it prevents the silicone moulds curing, and especially the resin wings from curing as quickly as desired, but the production schedule hopefully allows for this. The first set of production moulds would be completed just before the Christmas break, allowing production to begin in January after the holidays.\n\nThe Dragon will be being produced alongside other Heresy models, which also slows things down, but this is also allowed for in the production schedule. The time scale given is exaggerated because I always expect the unexpected these days, when it comes to resin casting.\n\nIf the campaign proves wildly successful, Andy will shut the main shop if necessary to concentrate on only producing Dragons until things have been calmed down, or will engage the services of one or more trusted casting companies to help produce the extra dragons if it looks like there will be too much work for him to handle alone.\n\nOther than that, injury etc would be the main threats, as with any one-man business, but you can't really plan for that.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Sarcastic Support", "descp": "This gets you onto the comments board where you can sneer and snipe and pour scorn and be really a generally awful human being.

The Busts include a custom base/stand for each one. \nIn addition to designing and sculpting, I also quality check each piece. If you ever receive a defective piece, please notify me directly and I will make it right. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nI am bringing these figures to Kickstarter in order to help fund the production molds and casts.  I have paid for the 3D prints and master molds for every figure except for some of the final stretch goals.  \nShipping Chart\nShipping will be charged after the project ends.  Please refer to this shipping chart to estimate the shipping for your pledge.  The Minimum amounts listed are for a single figure.  The Maximum amounts listed would be the maximum amount you would be charged if your order includes a lot of figures, or if your order includes the 193mm Huge Bust :\nPlease send me any questions you have!\nShipping Date\nI have set the shipping date for April 2019, although I will do my best to deliver it sooner than that. \nA Little History...\nMy wife Kimberly and I founded M&K Adventures back in 2012. Our goal was to create fun miniatures, and that still remains our goal today.  We ran our first Kickstarter in 2015, which was successful and fulfilled on time.  :-)  After that we were very excited and began working towards launching Frozen Ninja 3D where I would begin showing off my own sculptures.  In 2017 we launched our second Kickstarter project, and it had figures completely designed and sculpted by me, Mark.   Once again the project was successful and it also was fulfilled on time.   Here is a link to our previous Kickstarter project :\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/670874743/30mm-to-110mm-fantasy-miniatures-and-sculptures?ref=nav_search&result=project&term=30mm%20to%20110mm\n2018 has been an exciting year.  I have been working hard to make this Kickstarter the best it can be.  In addition, Kimberly and I presented all of our figures in our first role as Vendor at ReaperCon in August 2018.  It was an amazing time, and we met a lot of great people.\nWe are looking forward to a bright and thrilling future!\nOur Booth at ReaperCon! There's Kim!!!\nOur Kickstarter figures on display at ReaperCon\nThe Huge 193mm Bust was also on display at ReaperCon\nInterview Link :\nHere is a link to an \"Artist Spotlight\" interview that was done by Justin Smith from Tales of a Mini Painter.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Earlier in 2018 Art of the Genre ran a campaign to create The Folio of Fiendish Monsters, however that campaign was the only product we've ever done that didn't include 5th Edition D&D mechanics.  Now, before we print this product, and after a lot of fan requests, we are offering the chance to add a 5th Edition monster appendix to this volume.\nIt is our hope that before this book goes to press we can add the 5th Edition content that I've already been writing with each monster I create.  \nGet this incredible monster book with 1E & 5E monsters covered by TSR master artist Jeff Easley!\nWhat will be included in the 5th Edition appendix? Currently I've been writing a 'base-line' stat block for each monster in 5E.  I hit the bigger points of each monster that relate most commonly to game play.  The current blocks look like the following:\n5E Block:\nIce Goblin [AC 14, HD 2d10+2, HP 12, Initiative +4, #AT 1, Hit +2, Dam Ice Dagger 3 (1d4+1), Stealth +5, Cold Blood (DC 14 Dexterity or take Freezing Acid 2 (1d4) per successful melee attack that damages this foe)]\nSTR: 10 (-) INT: 10 (-) WIS: 8 (-1) CON: 13 (+1) DEX: 15 (+2) CHA: 8 (-1) \nCR: 1/2 EXP: 100 \nMonster Type: Small Humaniod\nStretch Goals within this campaign could expand on the 'block', providing Speed, Saving Throws, Full Skills, Senses, Languages, etc. \nIce Goblin illustration by Simon Adams, and they are nastly little buggers!\nWhat are the monsters in this book?  I'm going to provide an incomplete list (76 monsters), just so you have a taste of what the 115 new monsters are like.\nIce Goblin, Frost Ogre, Tundarian, Frost Skeletons, Blizzard Giants, Plated Woolly Rhino, Winter Witch, Hobgoblin Ice Raiders, Warmth Wisps, Ice Wall Dragons, Monofilament Kobolds, Dwarf Eaters, Simsisiun, Demon Prince of Changelings, Lyzinia, Arch Devil of Sin, Tournament Knight, Hell Fish, Typhoon Elemental, Black Sands Lich, Tether Worm, Fey: Dragon-Linked, Fey: Nature-Bound, Fey: Bridge Guardian, Fey: Nightborn, Dungeon Lurker, Tomb Shambler, Shadow Ogre, Karasian Dwarf, Spider Troll, Gloom Husk, Gloom Interloper, Gloom Brute, Gloom Knight, Stone Goblin, Legion Orc, Goblin Wanderer, Feral Kobold, Deep Forest Orc, Tethered Beast, Tethered Humanoid, Bender Scout, Out Island Reaver, Out Island Taskmaster, Out Island Captain, Bojun, Warfang, Sinner Hangman, Old Man of the Woods, Maiden Hag, Fallen Totem, Cuddle Creeper, Marigold Man, Fool\u2019s Paradise, Dire Pine, City Stalker, Beast Spirit Haunt, Street Slitherer, Barkempkin, Brain Larva, Sewer Man, Drowning Fountain, Crimson Roses, Were Owl, Were Gull, Were Pigeon, Moon Child, Dravarian Highwayman, Chaos Bringer, Bastian Born, Devil\u2019s Minions, Blood Caliph, Sand Rippers, Silk Whisperer, Shell Collector, Zhamaran, VirVir, Bonecrusher Dog\nWhat is a Folio? The Folio series is a OSR inspired throwback series from Art of the Genre that revolves around gaming modules and supplements.  Currently there are 19 Folio adventures, dozens of Folio mini-adventures, and 3 Hardcover books.\nWhat do the AD&D pages look like? I've already been playing with designs from the original campaign, but there will have a feel like the monster blocks in the original AD&D Monster Manual, although I WILL be including experience for each creature as seen in Monster Manual II.  \nHopping Brains are coming for you!\nWhat are the other Folio Hardcovers? By the time this book is published in December 2018, there will be 5 'orange spine' hardcovers in the Folio Hardcover Series.  They are The Complete Roslof Keep (which compiles the mega-dungeon from Folio #1-Folio #6), The Complete Cities of Sorcery (which complies two trilogies from Folio #8-Folio #13), The Storyteller's Arcana (a DM supplement cataloging some of my best rules additions over the past 35 years of gaming), The Folio of Fiendish Monsters (as above), and The Complete White Ship (which compiles the mega-adventure from Folio #14-Folio #19).\n*TRADEMARK DISCLAIMER\n\"D&D\" and \"AD&D\" are trademarks of Wizards of the Coast, LLC.

Roll your dice, allocate them to actions on your player board and tribal cards and then call these out to resolve them on the board. Move cleverly across the arena, dancing around your opponents, build up for a strong attack, or pepper your enemy with quick ones. Play for your Tribe, or team up with another Chief or two, combo-ing your abilities with each other to devastating effect. With five different gameplay modes, all available in both realtime and turn based modes, replayability is huge.\n All of the stretch goals that we hit will be included with every game.\nWith many more Stretch Goals to be announced!\nWe have added a lot of content  to the game since our first go on Kickstarter earlier in the year. You now have the option of playing in either REALTIME or TURN BASED modes in one of five of the different GAMEPLAY MODES:\nEvery Eye for Themselves Arena\nAlliances Arena\nNymphlet Ceremony\nKing of the Hill\nDomination Mode\nCheck out a game of Every Eye for Themselves!\nRoll and reroll the dice! (In REALTIME this is as many times as you like - in TURN BASED you get three total rolls with some exceptions)\nYou can allocate any dice that you choose at any point during your rolling to actions that have a matching symbol.\nIn REALTIME mode, you can then keep rolling, or call out and resolve an action. Remember, there are no turns.\nIn TURN BASED mode, once you've allocated all your dice, you grab a TURN ORDER MARKER. Once all players have grabbed one, you move onto the TURN PHASE. \nThen at any point in time in REALTIME mode, you can call out an action and resolve it. In TURN BASED mode, when it is your turn, you can call out and resolve up to two of your actions.\n In REALTIME mode, there are no turns, so you can call out and resolve an action whenever you like.\nIn TURN BASED mode, you need to wait until it is your turn to call out and resolve actions (up to two actions).\nWhenever you call out and resolve an action in REALTIME or TURN BASED mode, you must then clear the dice you used from that action.\nIn REALTIME mode, you can then start rolling those dice as soon as the action is fully resolved.\nIn TURN BASED mode, you may need those dice to roll for an attack or defence. Once the action is then fully resolved, set the dice aside for the next round.\n Check out the changes made for TURN BASED mode here:\n If you just want to see games in play, then check out the videos below:\nHere is a REALTIME game of Every Eye for Themselves Arena being played:\nHere is a TURN BASED game of Every Eye for Themselves Arena being played:\nNymphlet Ceremony Playthrough Video coming soon.\nKing of the Hill Playthrough Video coming soon.\nDomination Playthrough Video coming soon.\nPlayers can choose to play Eye for an Eye in either Realtime, or Turn Based mode. Each of the different game modes can be played in either of these modes.\nEvery Eye for Themselves Arena sees you fight against the other players with the Chief that has essentially done the most damage winning the round.\nAlliances sees you team up with up to two other Chiefs to coordinate your moves and fight against another team or teams. The most effective team will win the round.\nNymphlet Ceremony has you controlling one or more Nymphlets (dragonfly like creatures) as well as your Chief. Your goal is to keep your Nymphlets out of harms way while capturing your opponents. This mode introduces a different style of play that isn't just combat.\nIn King of the Hill you want to control an important section of the arena and then while you're in it, trigger the scoring mechanism. This mode of play focuses on movement and positioning and will see you and your opponents manipulating each other to ensure that you are the only one that scores.\nDomination mode uses changing objectives throughout the game as the scoring mechanism. When the trigger in the soundtrack sounds, the designated area scores and a new one is drawn.\nAs you can see in the above image, the figures in Eye for an Eye are quite chunky and beautifully sculpted by Bob Olley. We have produced physical sculpts rather than going with digitally sculpted files because we love the quality and depth of Bob's work.\nThe sculpted base is 40mm flat to flat to provide stability during the realtime matches. None of these figures are at any risk of being knocked over.\nWe believe that the rulebook should always be available from the start. So please go ahead and download it, read through it and ask any questions that you might have. We have also provided Print and Play files to give you a taste of how it plays out if you would like to give it a crack!\nCheck out their video preview of the Realtime part of the game below\nWatch Dan's How to Play the Realtime section of the game below\nWatch the video preview for the Realtime section of the game with Nick Welford below\n  Click the image to read the preview with Dane\nClick on the image to check out the Kickstarter preview by Dez Maggs\nClick the image to read the interview Ben did with Rowan\n     More info to come...\nThe characters available in the Core game are:\nFind out more about these characters in future updates or check out our rulebook:\nPalaudis Chief Grublic\nHydris Chief Riparian\nFloris Chief Banksia\nIgnis Chief Incendiary\nNimbus Chief Pluma\nLuftle Chief Echo\nEye for an Eye is made all the better by every single one of our contributors. Together, we have produced what you see before you - Eye for an Eye - a labour of love, hard work, blood, sweat and tears. The amalgamation of many years of work, Shae and I would like to acknowledge and sincerely thank the following people for their amazing contributions to our game.\nAs you may already know, Eye for an Eye is part of a series of games called the 'Rise of the Occulites' Saga. The very first game published in this series - Dawn: Rise of the Occulites, also takes place at the very beginning of the saga, a long time before Eye for an Eye. This narrative, scenario based skirmish game allows you to step in as Tribe Chief of your own Occulite Tribe. Powered by the Natural Selection Deck and sporting 19 scenarios, it has a metric tonne of replayability.\nWe've had a lot of people asking if Dawn will be included here as an add on. Instead of doing that, we got together with Eagle Games and organised for them to run a sale on Dawn alongside our campaign. The best part is that you can order it right now by CLICKING HERE!\nFind out how the Occulite Saga began and pick up the complete Dawn - Rise of the Occulites game for a great price and play it while you wait for your copy of Eye for an Eye to arrive. Get immersed in the world!\nDawn - Rise of the Occulites is available both in pre-painted and unpainted, so pick one up that best suits your needs!\nShipping is not included in any of the pledge levels for this campaign and will be charged some time after the campaign has ended. This allows us to ensure that we charge an accurate amount for shipping. It also gives us time to ensure that we get a good balance between quality and low cost shipping solutions once we know how much content is going to be produced for the game.\nWe have engaged Quartermaster Logistics to fulfil our project which means we are EU, Canada, Australia and United States friendly. Below you will find our estimated shipping costs. It is possible that these may change as we cannot control the global market, but we believe that these should be fairly accurate costings.\nEstimated shipping for EYE FOR AN EYE GAME Pledge\nUnited States - $14 USD | $18 AUD \nAustralia - $23 to $25 USD | $29 to $32 AUD\nNew Zealand - $29.50 to $34 USD | $37 to $44 AUD\nEurope - $18 USD | $23 AUD\nCanada - $21 USD | $27 AUD \nChina, Macao, Hong Kong - $14 USD | $20 AUD\nAll other countries - $69 to $75 USD | $90 to $97 AUD \n*Currency conversions are estimates as of 4th September\nEstimated shipping for A TRIBE OF OCCULITES Pledge\nUnited States - $36 USD | $47 AUD\nAustralia - $41 USD | $54 AUD\nNew Zealand - $132 USD | $172 AUD - Sorry guys :(\nEurope - $28 USD | $37 AUD\nCanada - $40 USD | $52 AUD\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong - $35 USD | $50 AUD\nAll other countries - $220 USD | $287 AUD\n*Currency conversions are estimates as of 4th September\nEurope includes: United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweeden\nDue to the fact that we have to run this Kickstarter in Australian dollars, we are at the mercy of fluctuating currency conversions. The currency conversions that we have provided on this campaign were true and correct as of our launch date (4th September).\nTo minimise any issues post campaign, the money will be converted to US dollars as soon as possible as this is the currency that all our manufacturing and shipping will be paid in. This ensures that currency conversion is no longer an issue post campaign.\nFind out more about Darwin Games and Eye for an Eye through these links.\nPlease consider sharing this campaign around with your family and friends so that we can produce this game in the best possible fashion!\nWe have provided a series of Avatars so that you can proudly represent your Tribe not only in the Eye for an Eye Arena, but also in the Kickstarter arena.

Based on these experiences and extensive research, we are confident that we are well equipped to handle this process.\n\nWe have already paid for all of the art, figure sculpting and soundtrack creation in advance (and these components are all complete). We have also been in regular communication with our chosen manufacturer pre checking files and component details. This is in an effort to ensure that the project minimises the chances for any delays and so that we can get it into manufacturing as soon as possible after the campaign ends.\n\nHaving said that, there is always the possibility of delays occurring. Shipping times and getting through customs can cause delays as can the length of time with manufacturing, especially in regards to the tooling of the figures. We have put a realistic timeline on production, but will always be striving to deliver as early as we can.

Downloading STL files for your models is free, which means you can create entire armies of miniatures for only the cost of printing - about $3.50 - $5.00 USD per mini if you are ordering online, and even less if printing at home.\nUpload your own assets. Can't find anything matching the sword/helmet/tunic that you're looking for? Find it online or make it yourself, then upload it to DesktopHero to use with your characters.\nCreate your own poses. DesktopHero gives you fine-grained control over every bone in your miniature's body. Create a pose from scratch, or load a pose from the library and fine-tune it for your character.\nShare your creations with the community. DesktopHero is a community effort where you can share assets, poses, and characters.\nTry it out! The best way to see what DesktopHero has to offer is to jump right in and use it! It's live and waiting for you at www.desktophero3d.com.\nPhoto by Daniel Herrero\nPsst! There's a freebie 3D model for sharing the project! See Updates page for details.\n      We have 3 new features lined up for the next round of development: \n3 brand-new professional asset packs featuring Fantasy, Sci-fi and Modern genres\nA prettier, more intuitive user interface\nThe ability to order 3D prints of your characters directly through the site\nSince DesktopHero's release, our most requested feature has been for more and higher-resolution 3D assets. To that end, we are adding three new asset packs, built completely from scratch and with DesktopHero in mind to ensure a consistent look and feel. The assets from the different packs will be fully compatible, so that if you want to have a modern police uniform with a medieval vambrace and a techy laser gun arm, you can. Everything will just work together, without the clipping effects you often see with the current library.\nUnlike the current public DesktopHero library, these premium asset packs will only be accessible to backers. (All current DesktopHero assets will continue to be freely accessible to everyone, as will assets uploaded by the community.)\nFantasy Asset Pack - Concept\nSci-fi Asset Pack - Concept\nModern Asset Pack - Concept\nAs DesktopHero has expanded to include new features over the last several months, the user interface has become more complex and less intuitive. We're working with a professional UI designer to rebuild DesktopHero's user interface from the ground up, focusing on the following goals: \nProvide simple controls for newcomers, advanced editing features for those who want fine-grained control\nEasily find specific assets you are looking for (rather than having to browse through all of them)\nStart with a preset character, then make minor edits (rather than having to construct a dragonborn piece by piece)\nManipulate character pose in a way that makes sense intuitively\nThese changes will result in a system that makes creating miniatures fun instead of frustrating.\nIt used to be that in order to take advantage of DesktopHero, you had to have a 3D printer. No longer! We'll be working with Shapeways to add 3D print fulfillment to DesktopHero, so that you can order physical prints of your characters directly from the site.\nShapeways offers a number of different material options, including Strong & Flexible Plastic (standard), High Detail Plastic (for painting), and even a variety of metals (in case your characters are fighting a dragon).\nHow much will it cost to order a mini? From my experience, printing a 28mm scale mini through Shapeways using standard plastic costs between $3.50 - $5.00 USD per mini. Printing in high detail plastic seems to fall in the $7.00 - $10.00 realm.\nFor those of you who have access to your own 3D printers, DesktopHero will continue to allow you to download STLs for free.\nMetal-cast DesktopHero Minis, by Calohtar\n...we just wanted to say Thank You to our community.

It can now be brought into being. \nWe are associated with a young Russian company, Punga Miniatures, which will manufacture our resin figurines. The rendering is well detailed and the resin of good quality. Moreover this partnership allows us to offer you a wide selection of interesting add-ons. \nOur original idea was to highlight our origins here in North America. Canada has a history during which First Nations peoples and French and English settlers lived together and built our roots.\nWe want to pay tribute to those natives peoples who didn\u2019t have an easy life and who were often evicted from their own lands and suffered terrible clashes. In the colonies, there were also many French \u201ccoureurs des bois\u201d (wood runners) who worked very hard alongside the native peoples. These explorers discovered the territory and allowed the colonization to expand from coast to coast.\nOur project had a hard time because our Mo Hawk Troll was carrying a scalp in his hand. Blood Bowl is a violent game in which the heads are torn off, crushed and the limbs ground. At first, we didn\u2019t have any discomfort due to the presence of the scalp. However we intended to create beautiful new figurines without any bad aspects.\nIn the wake of some comments, we decided to replace the hand of the Mo Hawk. We will make an alternative hand with a corncob. You will understand that we cannot modify more the previously mounted figurines, videos, etc. So, we apologize to those who won\u2019t find it fit with the original hand.\n***** Shipping: Will be calculated according to the options chosen by each of you.

Dungeons and Doggies is the first in a planned series of Animal Adventures releases! It is a set of highly detailed miniatures combining some favourite dog breeds with the different classes of the fifth edition of the world\u2019s greatest roleplaying game!\nTedric, Cornelius and Montague prepare for a new adventure.\nThis set features not only the miniatures in preassembled ready-to-play or paint PVC, but also a bespoke set of fifth edition compatible rules for using your Animal Adventure miniatures and playing as dogs in ANY campaign setting. \nYou will be able to mix canine characters with your regular adventuring party or create an entire doggy team of heroes to save the world! The miniatures also make perfect companions and familiars for your existing characters in any fantasy setting or game!\nCornelius the Golden Retriever Wizard\nOur range of canine characters are true dogs, four legged companions true of heart and pure of soul! We have chosen to develop a range of \u2018non-humanoid\u2019 minis to offer as much of a unique play experience as we possibly could.  \nEach dog has been lovingly designed and sculpted, by some serious dog fans, to be bursting with personality and detail. From the panpipes of Monty, the bard, to the magical spell bones of Cornelius, the Wizard, care has been taken to add flavour and fun to every model.\nNightingale the Pomeranian Monk\nTedric the Chihuahua Rogue\nMontague the Cocker Spaniel Bard\n The Fetch! Pledge $35/\u00a327\nBecause this is Painting and Polygons\u2019 first independent Kickstarter project (despite our experience on other projects), we have chosen to keep things as simple as possible to make it easy for us to support, while ensuring smooth delivery.  \nThe Fetch! Pledge brings you 13 doggy miniatures along with the Rules and Adventure Companion PDFs, as well as art prints from our artist, April Prime.  \nRather than include stretch goals that would complicate the process, in an attempt to encourage more participation, we are keeping things really easy with only one pledge level, that gets you everything we can cram into this campaign!  \nWe have many more ideas for the future too, including more doggies (and maybe even kitties) so don\u2019t panic if your favourite breed isn\u2019t here! The world of Animal Adventurers is just opening up, and with your support, we hope to be able to make this our first step on our journey into it!\nThe dogs are designed on 25mm and 20mm bases and scaled to fit in with existing RPG miniatures ranges. And, although we are providing full rules to create your own doggy adventurers, each miniature comes with its own pre-generated character, complete with character sheet and short story! Whether you fancy being Hartley, a gruff and stoic fighter or Freya, a noble guardian druid, there\u2019s a dog for every player.\nWe are proud to be able to support the excellent online comic Dungeons and Doggos! As part of our collaboration with them, every backer will receive as part of their pledge, a Kickstarter exclusive cross-over miniature; Tonka, the Mastiff Bard. \nYou can read all about Tonka, and the rest of our fearless canine friends, by joining in with the adventure, as depicted by V Lee Illustrations, every Friday at dndoggos.com.\nAlongside our range of miniatures, we are proud to present and include in our campaign a full set of digital rules and a unique adventure that provides a perfect setting for a great one-shot RPG experience, for absolutely free! \nOur rules set contains OGL fifth edition racial rules for creating an intelligent dog, unique canine feats and class options, notes on a canine deity for divine doggies and magic items specially tuned for dog use (which of course, are chew proof as well!).  \nThe accompanying adventure, titled \u201cWho\u2019ll let the Dogs Out?\u201d, is designed to be played either with the characters included in the rules or with any party of equivalent level and tells the fateful tale of sinister magics, dark druids and a chance for some brave dogs to save themselves, their canine cousins and the local village from a terrible fate! \nBoth the adventure and the rules pack feature stunning artwork from professional illustrator and dog lover April Prime, who\u2019s previous work includes the excellent Baby Bestiary for Metal Weave Games. \nAlongside the free rules PDFs, we are excited to be able to offer some of April\u2019s illustrations as art prints, included as part of the campaign for free for every backer! \nIf you want to find out more about April's work, you can do so at: www.artstation.com/april-prime, or by following her on Twitter, @April_Prime.\nRuss Charles is part of the team and principal sculptor behind Painting and Polygons - a Twitch channel that regularly hosts painting and sculpting spotlights for the games industry.\nRuss has worked in the games industry for many years and has contributed to projects as wide ranging as Reaper Bones, Dr Who, Warmachine, Resident Evil 2, Guild Ball and most recently Critical Role.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping.    \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost.

Again these are estimates: \n Kickstarter Campaign Ends \n \u2022 0 Day \u2013 Pledges are charged. \n \u2022 1 Week \u2013 Survey sent confirming emails. \n \u2022 1-2 Months \u2013 Pledge Manager sent to backers taking payment for shipping. \n \u2022 1 Month Before Shipping \u2013 Pledge Manager deadline - any late confirmations after this deadline will be shipped from the UK after all other pledges are completed and may incur additional cost. \n Shipping Starts \n \u2022 0 Days \u2013 China starts packing EU/AUS/US hub orders.

Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their pledges sooner than others. \n\nWe have prepared as much as possible with our production for a successful Kickstarter; however, we will refund pledges if for some unforeseen reason the product cannot be delivered at all. \n\n======= \n\nRefunds \n\n======= \n\nRefunds may be given within 60 days of the campaign ending, including fees. After that time, refunds may be given minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees, as we will not be able to claim those back after 60 days. \n\nWe are unable to issue refunds once we have begun the packaging and shipment stages of the project (around 6\u20138 weeks before the actual shipping date). \n\nRefunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit/debit card. Refunds after 60 days of the campaign ending are processed via PayPal only. \n\nThis is a GBP Kickstarter and refunds will be processed in GBP for the amount received, excluding any applicable fees dependent on the day on which the refund is processed as detailed above. \n\n================= \n\nTerms and Conditions \n\n================= \n\nIf you do not confirm your shipping and pledge details within 10 weeks of our notification via email to confirm them, your pledge will be treated as abandoned.

Changing locations, managing your resources, and using your powers to devastating effect is just as important as making sure the League recognizes your accomplishments.

Yeah that\u2019s right. He\u2019s back too, and he\u2019s sure to put his fist in your plans.\nIn Dr. Horrible\u2019s Evil League of Evil, you play the role of an aspiring Villain who would love nothing more than to be recognized by the new leader of the Evil League of Evil, notorious Dr. Horrible. While the League still considers you small potatoes, completing Schemes, using your Powers, and betraying your \u201cfriends\u201d might just do the trick. But be careful--after ten years of therapy, Captain Hammer is back, and his preferred handshake is a punch to the face. Literally. So you and your fellow villains will have to stay on the move. Meanwhile Hammer will patrol the town, heroically fixing your mayhem and stopping any Schemes in his tracks, which means it would take a Weapon of truly epic proportion to defeat him again.

We have been working with an amazing new artist that has redone almost all of the art and helped us redesign the \"Hero\" Captain Mallet.

It's been pretty hectic, but everyone we have met and took the time to play the game has been the greatest. I'm listening to all the feedback and honestly and sincerely doing everything I can to address everything brought up. I love hearing from you guys and can't wait to give you more information.\n\nWe have been working with a couple different artists to change the look. Meanwhile we have come up with a new name of the game that we think both keeps the feeling comical and lite while still being a good ode to the original show. We wanted to stay away from the obvious parody version because we don't believe it sets the right mood. That being said we will keep everyone updated as we get closer to relaunching the Kickstarter. \n\nWe are also still making attempts to open a dialog about licensing. No more fingers crossed, but not giving up. \n\nBest regards\nNicholas Engel - Head Troll"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "A much deserved apology", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nAfter 10 years of no sequel, my heart still aches for more Dr. Horrible in my life. 2 years ago my wife and I started development on this game with that exact thought in mind. I want to play a game so I can feel like Dr. Horrible. When we started introducing the game to friends and family, I was shocked to find out so many people have never heard of one of my biggest passions. We would stop playing the game immediately and force them to watch the DVD. We even gave out a couple of the extra copies we bought (knowing at the time when we got them they would make great gifts). This is what started it all. I want to revitalize what is so dear to me and I know is dear to so many others.\n\nAttempting to attend a convention during the launch of our first Kickstarter was a mistake. I\u2019m sorry I did not address this sooner. It\u2019s clear that mistakes were made, and rushing to meet the 10 year anniversary should not have been as important as securing the IP.\n\nIt is very important for me that you, the backers, understand that it was never my intent to hurt or deceive anyone. Attempts have been made and are being made to contact both the company who currently holds the rights to the IP, and Joss himself. They have a copy of the prototype and they have been informed of everything we have done. I now know we should have explicitly and clearly stated that this product is currently unlicensed, and more importantly not gone into the Kickstarter in the current stages of licensing. As a new and overly enthusiastic board game creator I ask for your understanding and forgiveness.\n\nFor those of you that have played the game, or are still willing and eager to play the game. I\u2019m very sorry that you will have to wait a bit longer. We will go back to the drawing board and do this right. I can\u2019t say how sorry I am for the miscommunication and more importantly for the distrust this brings, but please know that this is sincere and I\u2019ve learned a lot from this.\n\nTo the game stores that welcomed us into your locations and showed us so much love. I am deeply sorry for any damage this may have caused your stores name and reputation.I hope our future actions serve as proof of our sincerity and that you allow us to make it up to you in the future. I would ask everyone involved not to hold these stores accountable for my actions.\n\nTo the fans of Dr. Horrible: I feel my passion has clouded my eyes from what is truly important here. The excitement you felt and love you have is the same thing I want to share. For those that thought this project was licensed or in any way directly affiliated with any related parties, you have my sincere apologies.\n\nFunded in less than 2 hours, 4 times the funding in about 48 hours. This shows that there is an interest and we share a common goal. However, the decision to cancel the campaign is the most honest thing we can do. Thank you for your comments and advice.\n\nSincerely\nNicholas Engel\nCEO and Owner of Lucky Troll Games, LLC\n\nPS: If you have any further comments or questions you may reach me here. headtroll@luckytrollgames.com"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Crazy Random \"Happenstance\"", "update_content": "Fellow Villains, \nObviously we need to start off by acknowledging your incredible response--we BLEW past our goals practically overnight, and now our Head Troll is going straight from working himself to death at our launch con this weekend to working himself to death coming up with new enhancements for everyone to enjoy. But before we start that fun we need to address the elephant in the room. One big issue is clearly on everyone\u2019s mind: How does Mr. Muscle keep his hair so luscious? Just kidding. It\u2019s licensing. The short answer is, it\u2019s all part of the plan--a plan we wouldn\u2019t plan if we didn\u2019t also plan on following through. The long answer is, we\u2019ve done everything short of a skywriting campaign above Los Angeles, but the trick is getting the RIGHT attention. And believe it or not, this comment section is exactly the kind of helpful we\u2019d hoped for. After all, overwhelming love and passion for the musical led us to where we are now--what matters is taking matters into our own hands.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Overturn is tactical combat based board game with co-op elements to it. The uses the rich Middle Eastern folklore as a backdrop to tell its story which is ingrained is supernatural elements, legends and conspiracies.\nThe game uses a multiboard system to depict major scenarios with each major scenario ultimately ending after defeating its boss. The objective to win is simple: defeat all the bosses to reach the final boss and win the game. This can be done all on its own but it\u2019s the coop element that makes Overturn unique. Each board or primary mission can be completed with multiple heroes and players yet each player has the option to pursue their own version of the story on the board and the choice to assist other players or not. The combat is turn based with the enemies having their own unique AI that makes them formidable as well as unpredictable. Players grow their levels by defeating enemies and learning new skills and increasing their power. This applies to enemies too who grow just as much tough as the player grows bolder.\n To add one or more Add-ons to your pledge, just add the amount listed on the add-on(s) to your pledge amount. You will be asked to choose your preferred add-on(s) in the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nAbout Overturn:  \n\u2022 Overturn is a role playing board game set in the mystical realm of Drish Barahir where you can embark on an epic journey either on your own or with your friends in a cooperative fashion. \n\u2022 You are part of an elite rebellion who wants to free the land from the tyranny of Zahak and his minions of darkness. Little do you know that Zahak is in league with the mythical monsters of the desert Ifrits to bring them back into power and usher the world into a whole new era of shadow and flame.   \n\u2022 Your objective as a player is to defeat all the bosses on the boards by completing quests and ensuring that there is minimal collateral damage.\n\u2022 Overturn\u2019s unique element is its Co-op gameplay where another player can choose to follow their own path or assist you in the fulfilment of your quest.  \n\u2022 You can win the game by defeating the final boss Zahak and that is no easy task.\nExplore:\n\u2022 The beautiful world of Drish Barahir beckons you discover its secrets making exploration an integral part of the gameplay.  \n\u2022 Move around each intricately designed board where you can do a lot.  \n\u2022 You can either interact with NPCs or search the grid to find a secret which can either be good or a nasty surprise. Or you can engage in combat if you are facing an opponent.  \n\u2022 Every level takes place on a different board. From the moonlit graveyards to citadels and central bazars every level and there board offers a distinct landscape and its own set of enemies and challenges along with secrets.\n\u2022 Travel along the unique and mystical landscapes of Drish Barahir each with its own set of enemies on uniquely designed boards with physical architecture that can even be destroyed. \n\u2022 From watchtowers where sniper archers can shoot you on side to the ground where enemies and mini bosses keep rotating; every step you take in the world of Drish Barahir can be your last. \nInteraction: \n\u2022 Each board has its own set of mission objectives that are mandatory in moving the story forward. However you can get additional side quests by interacting with NPCs ranging adrenaline rushing rescues the hostage quests to freeing the slaves.  \n\u2022 Overturn\u2019s unique gameplay gives its NPCs hidden traits and personal attributes. Interacting with them is extremely important for getting additional side-quests.  \n\u2022 The objective of each board is to fulfill pre-determined quests, side quests through interactions and exploration and engage in blood curdling combat.  \n\u2022 Overturn gives each NPC a unique trait to keep the tension mounted. You may choose to help them but sometimes your good intensions can go against you. The NPC you may choose to help or acquire as your companion can also be a spy or worse possessed by a dark Ifrit so trust no one!  \n\u2022 But as the hero of Drish Barahir; you can\u2019t abandon them either. This dilemma and mystery makes each playthrough unique.\nCombat and characterization  \n\u2022 Select from an array of beautifully crafted heroes to play each with their own gameplay style and unique back story that will make you connect with your player on an emotional level.  \n\u2022 Fight through hordes of Zahak or his minions forces or towering Ifrits that once unleased may rampage across your board.  \n\u2022 Combat is an integral and the most interesting part of Overturn\u2019s gameplay. Every encounter can be deadly as the AI that governs the enemies makes every combat move a matter of life and death.  \n\u2022 But beware though the game\u2019s unique AI makes each confrontation a challenge as your enemies swarm you with varying skill levels.  \n\u2022 That is why each conflict delivers a different experience every time you face a foe.  \n\u2022 Ifrits are the mini bosses of the game that can wreak havoc on the board once they get unleashed through the discovery of a possessed NPC. Neutralize them quick to avoid collateral damage.  \n\u2022 As you defeat enemies you level up unlocking new perks.  \n\u2022 To face more enemies and level up; you need to take up challenges strewn across the board.  \n\u2022 But every action has a consequence in the world of Overturn. Every mission reward in Overturn works on the basis of fate hence a long grueling combat to rescue a family from blood may sometimes reward you with the curse status or you may end up earning a rare weapon.  \n\u2022 The game has a beautiful world full of different enemy factions governed by their respective bosses. You need to be tougher and far sighted to face each boss from the very beginning of the game.  \n\u2022 Be careful though; behind veil of civil war gripping Drish Barahir; there is supernatural and ancient force that is pulling all the strings.  \n\u2022 Overturn make its players choose their actions carefully because death of civilians or NPC will speed up the Chaos Clock. Enough collateral damage will set the clock to midnight which will simply end the game.  \n\u2022 Become part of the rebellion. Liberate the Oasis Lands. \nMore reviews and gameplay videos will be revealed during the campaign\n  The European Union, USA and Canada zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer import taxes.\n We will be charging for shipping after the Kickstarter ends during the pledge management phase. This is the best option we could find, since shipping to backers changes based on their location and what they have ordered. We cannot ship these packages to PO boxes domestically or internationally, due to their size and the high chance of being bounced back to us.  \nUSA: $20-$30 to most states.  \nCANADA: $25-$35 to most cities.  \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries.\nASIA: $35 to China and Hong Kong. $45 to most other countries.\nREST OF THE WORLD: $80.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. If we cannot guarantee that all backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, then we can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the Kickstarter one.

This means our estimated delivery date of July 2019 is just that, an estimate.\n\nWe will do our best to minimize any issues that would cause delays and we will be open and honest about any problems that come up. First and foremost, we respect our Backers, and want to make sure you know that you are our priority.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, fees included.

This represents approximately 15% of the full payment. Once we have started to process and packed your order, when the first ship leaves China, refunds will no longer be available. If any part of an order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the cost of this component, fees included. Refunds within the 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Even though TwixT has received multiple awards and accolades in its history, we are excited to share a recent honor that TwixT received that we are extremely proud of!\nThis re-launched version of TwixT has earned STEM.org's highest product honor, the Approved STEM Trustmark. STEM is the widely used acronym for the educational concept of \"Science, Technology, Engineering & Math\", and is used as an educational methodology in schools. Products that possess a STEM accreditation assist children in cultivating important reasoning skills and greatly improve their learning experience. TwixT was selected for this honor based upon the success of displaying the concepts of Engineering & Math.\nPlayed by two people, the goal of TwixT is to build a fence from one side of the game board to the other, each player both defending their fence, as well as preventing their opponent from doing the same. Blue and Red build their fences from behind each of their respective color borders to the other side of the board.\nRed must connect their pegs from the left to the right of the board, behind the border rows.\nBlue must connect their pegs from the top to the bottom of the board, behind the border rows.\nGAME PIECES\nPegs\nPegs may be placed anywhere on the board by each player, with the exception of behind the colored border rows of the opposing player. For example, Red may not place a pegs behind Blue's border rows, and vice versa.\nConnector Fences\nConnector Fences may be placed to connect two pegs of the same color to secure a border between one or more segments of the fence. \nGAME PLAY\n1. Player 1 (Red) plays first. The Red Player will place a peg anywhere on the board - with the exception of behind Blue\u2019s two border rows.\n2. To prevent an advantage to Player 1, Player 2 (Blue) may invoke the \u201cSwap Rule\u201d which will force a swap in sides. Player 1\u2019s color changes to Blue, and Player 2\u2019s color changes to Red. In the event that this rule is invoked, Player 1 may have one more turn to put one Peg of his or her new color on the board. The Swap Rule may only be invoked after the first turn of the game.\n3. On remaining turns, players may place as many connector fences as they wish on their colored pegs only, or remove their own existing connectors/fences as necessary for their game strategy. Each player may, however, only place one new peg at a time during their turn.\n4. New pegs placed do NOT have to connect to existing pegs, and may be placed anywhere on the board, aside from the opposing player's border rows.\n5. Once a connector fence has been placed, it cannot be crossed by either Player. In the below example, Red has built a connector fence, and though Blue would normally be able to connect their pegs, they cannot cross Red\u2019s connector fence. \n6. It is possible to connect more than two pegs of the same color together. \n7. The first player to connect their fence from one side to the other, with an uninterrupted link of connector fences from behind both of his or her border rows, wins the game. If neither player can accomplish this, then the game is considered a draw.\nBy supporting our Kickstarter project, we are offering premium and limited Kickstarter only rewards as part of our crowdfunding effort.\nCollector's Edition -- $45\nElegantly housed in a solid locking Wooden Box, which itself weighs almost two pounds, the TwixT engraved Collector's Edition adds the upgrade of metal tins to house the pegs and connector fences.  \nName Recognition Package -- $150\nLiterally have your name written in the history books of TwixT (aka - Instruction Manual) for the first 2 years of the game reprint!

With it, you will discover a living and deep setting. Nearly 1500 different miniatures were imagined by the best artists, and the authors have described in detail the vast world of Aarklash. You can lead the agile Da\u00efkinee Elves, the powerful Ophidian Alliance, the fearsome Griffins of Akkylannia, or any of the 16 factions represented in the box!

It has also inspired a role-playing game, named after one of its major cities: Cadwallon.\nEditions Sans Detour\n\u00c9ditions Sans-D\u00e9tour have published The Call of Cthulhu in France since 2008.\nIn 2015, the 7th edition of The Call of Cthulhu was subject to a crowdfunding campaign which was the most successful campaign in Europe, across all categories.

The event box will not be available in stores. However, it doesn\u2019t seem reasonable to us to offer it to stores with all of the unlocked stretch goals, as in that situation we\u2019d be getting about 30% of the final sale price, which, to turn a profit on this production, would mean selling it for roughly 1200 dollars (or more depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked). The complete offer you can enjoy here is thus a Kickstarter exclusive.\nThe miniatures\nThe core box contains 178 unique miniatures from the 16 factions of the game, plus all the unlocked stretch-goals.\nCheck the Starting Selection Catalog here.\nShipping costs will be calculated after the end of the campaign. You will be informed of the total amount of these shipping costs via the pledge manager: these costs will be based upon the weight of the initial box and, of course, the weight of every additional stretch goal contents and miniatures that will be unlocked during the campaign, and added to the box. In order to be cost efficient for our backers, all shipments will be sent by a logistics partner based in the final recipient\u2019s geographical area. For example: subscribers from the American continents will receive their parcel from our US based logistics partner, whereas Europeans will receive theirs from our French based logistics partner, etc.\nThe following spreadsheet shows low and average estimates of the shipping costs per geographical area. These estimates are based solely on the weight of the starting material featured in the Kickstarter campaign. Therefore, they may evolve throughout the campaign, depending on the unlocked stretch goals, or which Add-on contents you choose to add to your order.\nPlease note that international regulations prevent us from shipping parcels to the following countries: North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Myanmar, Sudan and Syria. We add the following countries to the list of countries where we will not deliver: Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Russia.\nWe\u2019ll present here the planned calendars for the project\u2019s completion.

If we hit all our stretch goals in this campaign, you will be getting 12 characters and their associated components, in addition to a series of other upgrades and additions at no extra charge.\n     Click here to join our Facebook Group!\n  Eye for an Eye is played in realtime to a soundtrack across a number of intense, five minute rounds. There are no turns and players all play simultaneously. Roll your dice, allocate them to actions, call those actions out and resolve them. \nPlay Every Eye for Themselves or Alliance mode in casual or tournament settings. One round in five minutes, a full tournament in an hour! Eye for an Eye is a game that will have you leaping out of your seat and enthusiastically yelling your character's moves as you do battle with friends and family.\nBelow you can watch a short how to play video and a full round of gameplay to help you better understand how to play, what the game has to offer and so you can make a fully informed decision to back Eye for an Eye!\nIf you want to see how the game plays out in realtime, check out one of the videos below and look for more during the campaign!\nAs you can see in the above image, the figures in Eye for an Eye are quite chunky and beautifully sculpted by Bob Olley. We have produced physical sculpts rather than going with digitally sculpted files because we love the quality and depth of Bob's work. \nThe sculpted base is 40mm flat to flat to provide stability during the realtime matches. None of these figures are at any risk of being knocked over.\nTo avoid the bases warping during the process, we will be producing them in ABS plastic instead of normal PVC like the figures are. This is much more expensive, but ensures that your figures sit flat no matter how fast you play.\nClick on the images below to download the rulebook and a Print and Play of the game, featuring Palaudis Chief Grublic and Hydris Chief Riparian.

Chief Grublic does not go anywhere without his Luftle advisor \u2018Cobbie\u2019 perched on his shoulder. The two have been inseparable since Grublic banished a rogue group of Palaudis to the Tundra wastes for the mistreatment of Luftles.\nInnate Ability - *Watch Out!*\nBand I Ability - Leap    \nBand II Ability - *Shield Bash*\nBand III Ability - Thunderstomp\nChief Riparian was originally her Tribe\u2019s healer until the Chief was killed at the beginning of The Drums of War. Due to the way she had looked after her Tribe, nature, as is the way with Hydris, honoured her with the new leadership. Her stalks rallied behind her as she quickly worked her way up the ranks to become one of Hydris\u2019 leading Chiefs by the time the wars ended.\nInnate Ability - Healing Mucus\nBand I Ability - Slippery    \nBand II Ability - Lunge  \nBand III Ability - Hunting Net\nChief Banksia was known by his enemies for his brutality and stubborness. During the Drums of War he would only lead his strongest members into a fight, a decision that would often leave them woefully outnumbered. This was never a problem for Banksia who saw this as a challenge. He is always had a plan that could snatch remarkable victories from the very jaws of defeat.\nInnate Ability - Savage Strike\nBand I Ability - Camouflage\nBand II Ability - Ambush\nBand III Ability - Brutal Charge\nChief Incendiary is a modest and honourable leader of the Ignis Occulites. To reduce losses to his stalks, he ensured that his Tribe never fought a battle in vain. During The Drums of War, Incendiary focused most of his attentions on defending the Ignis land borders, which he did successfully for the entire war. He only ever allied with Tribes for honourable purposes and was a key figure in brokering peace amongst the Tribes at the end of the war.\nInnate Ability - Steam Blast\nBand I Ability - Slow Heat\nBand II Ability - Vented Heat Blast\nBand III Ability - Sword Dance\nChief Pluma is known for her swift decision making and surgical precision. Sometimes thought of as reckless, her actions were always in the best interest of her beloved Nimbus Tribe. During The Drums of War, she soared high above the battlefield to ascertain troop movements, head off ambushes and if need be, intercept enemies. She is respected by her peers and feared by her enemies - the mark of a true leader in the Nimbus culture. \nInnate Ability - Gliding\nBand I Ability - Will of the Wind\nBand II Ability - Raking Talons\nBand III Ability - Dive Bomb\nChief Echo was mentored by Chief Grublic before being encouraged to raise his own army of Luftles and Wymbrix to carve their own place in the Occulite world. During The Drums of War, he was extremely proficient and strategically brilliant, taking in all he had learned from Grublic and those around him and reimagining it in his own unique way - hence his name Chief Echo. Despite the Arena\u2019s original intent being just for Occulites to settle disputes, with the support of Grublic and other allies, he successfully argued that Luftles should be able to settle their own disputes in the Arena.\nInnate Ability - Diversion\nBand I Ability - Surge\nBand II Ability - Protect the Chief!\nBand III Ability - Luftle Swarm!\nEye for an Eye is made all the better by every single one of our contributors. Together, we have produced what you see before you - Eye for an Eye - a labour of love, hard work, blood, sweat and tears. The amalgamation of many years of work, Shae and I would like to acknowledge and sincerely thank the following people for their amazing contributions to our game.\nClick on the images to take you to their website.\nAs you may already know, Eye for an Eye is part of a series of games called the 'Rise of the Occulites' Saga. The very first game published in this series - Dawn: Rise of the Occulites, also takes place at the very beginning of the saga, a long time before Eye for an Eye. This narrative, scenario based skirmish game allows you to step in as Tribe Chief of your own Occulite Tribe. Powered by the Natural Selection Deck and sporting 19 scenarios, it has a metric tonne of replayability.\nWe've had a lot of people asking if Dawn will be included here as an add on. Instead of doing that, we got together with Eagle Games and organised for them to run a sale on Dawn alongside our campaign. The best part is that you can order it right now by CLICKING HERE! \nFind out how the Occulite Saga began and pick up the complete Dawn - Rise of the Occulites game for a great price and play it while you wait for your copy of Eye for an Eye to arrive.

This allows us to ensure that we charge an accurate amount for shipping. It also gives us time to ensure that we get a good balance between quality and low cost shipping solutions once we know how much content is going to be produced for the game.\nWe have engaged Quartermaster Logistics to fulfil our project which means we are EU, Canada, Australia and United States friendly. Below you will find our estimated shipping costs.

The currency conversions that we have provided on this campaign were true and correct as of our launch date (24th April). \nTo minimise any issues post campaign, the money will be converted to US dollars as soon as possible as this is the currency that all our manufacturing and shipping will be paid in.

We have also been in regular communication with our chosen manufacturer pre checking files and component details. This is in an effort to ensure that the project minimises the chances for any delays and so that we can get it into manufacturing as soon as possible after the campaign ends.\n\nHaving said that, there is always the possibility of delays occurring. Shipping times and getting through customs can cause delays as can the length of time with manufacturing, especially in regards to the tooling of the figures.

We are confident that we have considered all of the costs that will be associated with this project.\n\nOur biggest challenge will be the time needed to sculpt and produce the miniatures. As the sculptors have to most of the stretch goal work after the project funds, the time-frame following the Kickstarter may be longer than we initially wanted. Please bear with us, these miniatures will be awesome and well worth the wait. We will keep you informed with regular updates on the progress of the project. We're not going to be idle while the sculptors are doing their work, however. The rest of the team will be busy developing the future line of miniatures and finishing games for future releases.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nOur pledge manager for this Kickstarter will be our online store.

(This is your chance to participate in this celebration!) \nMissed the campaign? You can enter our Late Pledge Manager by clicking the above image. The Late Pledge Manager opens May 8th, and supplies are limited.\nNow the whole Street Fighter Universe is literally at your fingertips! What are you waiting for?!  \nHelp Ryu on his journey to surpass all Stretch Goals! Each one we unlock is added to your pledge for Free! We've planned for 12 additional fighters & battle decks to be unlocked during the campaign! With all those unlocked you get TRIPLE the size of a Base Pledge at the Street Fighter Level!\nWe wanted to make our miniatures so good that even if you didn't play the game at all, your pledge would still be fully worth it for these impressive works of art alone - and at their Collectors Scale, they are wonderful pieces to display around your home or office!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game uses a unique scale, the brand new \"Collector's Scale\"! This giant-sized scale has your models large and in charge from 65mm tall all the way up to 85mm tall on some characters all on a standardized 58mm base! We will be offering this scale for all our future Universal Tactics System Games.   \nThis size offers tons of advantages:\nThe miniatures are more like small collectable statues and makes them great for displaying around the house even if you don't play the game at all!  \nThe larger the mini the better the pre-paint process, our pre-painted miniatures are simply the best the industry can currently offer, rivalling that of action figures and full sized collector statues!  \nPlaying with larger miniatures on a board with 3D terrain gives amazing table presence when you pull this game out at any gathering! You'll be the talk of the town!  \nWe believe its quality over quantity, why have buckets of tiny miniatures if they don't get played packed away in expansion box after expansion box? These miniatures will get a lot of table time as your sole representation on the battlefield!  \nTake a look at our featured miniatures video below!\nLet us get a detailed look at each one of our fighters included in the Core Set!\nAdding a NEW DIMENSION to Street Fighter!  \nDestructible Stage Terrain adds a new exciting element to the Street Fighter experience and it adds a new layer of strategic depth to the game as you attempt to out outmaneuver your opponent and set them up for extra damage!  \nEach round the terrain is reset and the fighter positions swapped as to offer an equal opportunity to both players, plus its just more fun to crash into more stuff. Smart awareness, positioning and baiting your opponent can easily win you the day!  \nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME. IT'S SIMPLE!  \nWe wanted anyone to be able to jump right in and play! So we had to make learning the game simple, but yet still have the depth to please experienced gamers and fighting game fans. This was an extremely challenging task for sure, especially when you consider the game system is built not only for Versus Mode but also Free for All and Team Games, essentially three games in one! However after 2 years of development we've believe we have found the right balance between accessibility, strategy, luck and fun factor!  \nIt's as Simple as.... DRAW. MOVE. FIGHT!\n1. DRAW! - Draw 2 cards from your Battle Deck as you start your turn. Skipping this only for the first turn you take.\n2. MOVE! - Move your character up to their Movement Value in any direction.\n3. FIGHT! - Take 2 Actions in any order and in any amount from these Actions:  MOVE, DRAW, or PLAY A CARD.\nOn defense your choice is even easier but yet still an important tension filled decision. Do you BLOCK or COUNTER-ATTACK?\nBLOCK - Roll two default Battle Dice and apply results vs opponent's attack roll.  You may also discard certain cards with defensive dice values to \"BOOST\" your Block Roll.\n-OR-\nCOUNTER-ATTACK - Play a Counter for a Strike, Special or Projectile, if successful discard opponents card and perform Counter-Attack Ability, usually causing damage during your opponents turn!\nAnd that's how the game works! \nAs you roll your Battle Dice & play your cards you will gain meter results which contribute to your Meter Gauge allowing you to enhance certain attacks or save these for the powerful Super and Ultra Combos that can finish your opponents instantly! Best 2 rounds out of 3 WINS!\n CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA RULEBOOK!\nClick the Image above to Download the BETA Rulebook!\nThe Boss Expansion adds in two extremely powerful Street Fighter Bosses. The power level of these bosses is so immense that other players will need to team-up to defeat them in a near hopeless final battle! Here's what's in the set in more detail!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game Boss Expansion includes everything you need to introduce extremely powerful Boss characters. This expansion also includes the Boss Mode game rules in which one player controls the boss in a battle against a team of three rival players! Can you and your friends stop this evil-doer's dastardly plan?  \nBOSS EVENT DECKS  \nEvery Boss comes with a unique Event Deck that can change the battlefield conditions dramatically, forcing the players to cooperate and strategize to deal with the new threat! Each new boss game is a different experience as only 6 to 8 of these events are drawn each game on average!\nBOSS FIGHTER BATTLE DECKS\nIn addition to the Boss Mode, the Boss Expansion includes normal 40-Card Boss-Fighter Decks so that the boss can join in with the rabble and fight on a more even level with their opponents in Versus, Free For All, and Team Modes!\nIf you would like to purchase any of these optional add-on's, please click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on this games Kickstarter Page and in the pledge manager add the total amount of the items you'd like to get to your total pledge.

Please enjoy this Documentary detailing the history of the game from the 25th Anniversary!  \nWe view this as a premium product for fans of Street Fighter, tabletop games and collectable products. The costs of manufacturing a game like this are extremely high due to a number of factors including:  \nIndividual \"Collector Sized\" pre-painted special FX's miniatures that are comparable in size to (\"Nintendo Amiibos\") that can retail for around $14.99 each! And we are packing 8 of them into a single box! 24 in the World Warrior Pledge!\nWe have planned at least 12 Stretch Goal Fighter Miniatures and their Battle Decks as unlocks, each one of these are at no cost to our backers! This cuts heavily into our margins and makes offering this many free mini's impossible at Retail! So get them while you can!\nThis game has among the highest number of full sized top quality playing cards in a single tabletop game ever! 428 cards in the Street Fighter Pledge and each new character unlocked in Stretch Goals adds another 40 cards, an extremely expensive and costly inclusion! With all Stretch Goals unlocked and the World Warrior pledge that's over 1,548 cards! A ridiculous amount and again impossible at Retail!\nCountless pieces of professional & unique artwork for each type of attack and event cards in a Character Deck!\nThe only way a game like this is made possible is to sell directly to our passionate backers who are looking for a premium and high-quality product. As lifelong fans of the franchise, we simply wanted to make the best possible game regardless of the cost! So jump in on this exclusive opportunity, you never know how valuable these limited pieces can become in the future!\nIf demand is extremely high we may consider in the far future making a retail version of the game with a lower amount of miniatures, perhaps unpainted and at a smaller scale.\nIf you miss the kickstarter the game may only be available at conventions and direct from Jasco Games in limited quantities.\nDo you want to help spread the word about this exclusive limited edition celebration of Street Fighter?

When an enemy attacks, you have your entire turn to dodge out of the way, mount your defenses, and launch a counterattack before the attack connects!  \nA Challenging Single Player Game- In Stuff of Nightmares you will be able to battle solo against the trolls that we unlock as stretch-goals in the campaign. Each troll is a distinct challenge ranging from fairly simple to extremely challenging! \nAn Awesome Co-Op Game- Players can collaborate with each other to take down the trolls that we unlock during the campaign!  Play cards to support your teammate on their turn so that you both can taste the sweetness of victory together!\nA Fantastic Multiplayer Game- Stuff of Nightmares can support a four-player tournament out of a single box!

After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

Our plan is to create a 128 page book (like those in the original AD&D orange spine series) and fill it with as many monsters as we can get in there.  All monsters will be set up for 1E AD&D.\nYes indeed, we're going to get you as close to an MMIII as we can!\nWhat is a Monster Sponsor? Well, art is expensive, and even old TSR didn't get images for all its monsters in the original books, so this campaign features a level called a 'Monster Sponsor', and as a backer you are helping create a piece of art for one of the monsters in the book, and in doing so, you will get credit posted next to the image, so you'll be immortalized inside the book.\nSponsor a monster image and get your name in the book!\nWhen is the release? We plan on having this book out before Christmas 2018, so get extra copies for your friends, especially if your name is in it!\nComplete your Orange Spine Hardcover Collection!\n  $11,000: Monster Level Encounter Appendix [UNLOCKED!]: Break down monsters by HD to better customize campaign building or DMing on the fly.\n$12,000: Monster Climate Encounter Appendix [UNLOCKED!]: Break down monsters by geographical zone for better encounter charts and easier DM reference.\n$13,000: Regional Treasure Type Table [UNLOCKED!]: Break down treasure to a specific geographical region for better customized treasure distribution.\n$14,000: New Ability and Powers Appendix: Get a quick reference for various new powers and abilities of monsters in the book.\n$15,000: Full 5E stat appendix expansion! Add 5E D&D gaming stats to all monsters in the book with this special appendix.\nWhat are the backer levels?

Like obscene streamers, the bowels of the red-clothed fat man adorned his mighty antlers; that old bearded man, his fixations, he had never paused a moment to think of him!\nCharacter design by Marcof\n  Did he ever stopped to think of red as the color of blood? And that the blood itself could compete to overcome the intensity of his hateful dress?\nConcept by me\n  Those were strange thoughts, they jumped in all directions ... like his companions! ... those strange little goats on two legs, so similar to the odious little elves with pointy ears, pimps servants flatterers of the fat one, similar not so much in appearance or in the intent, as for the frenzy, the elves to fulfill the silly and repetitive mission of the red fat man, the goat to annihilate everything in their sight!\nSculpture by Cross Lances Studio\n  Rudenolf still had the harmony and the beauty (other new things he had just discovered) of the jumpy ballet in his eyes, a hypnotic dance between the heads of goat and the little elves. The former bound to destroy, the latter desperately trying to escape in panic amids torn bodies, entrails pulled like crimson ribbons to adorn those corpses like badly discarded gift packages... a chaotic motion that contrasted with the immobility of the Four.\nYes, the Four. Rudenolf became aware of them only when they granted him such notion. No matter how but he suddenly opened his eyes and he saw them, cruel simulacra of the red fat one, similar in appearance, but glorious in the aura of their intent!\nit could be purchased as add-on for 15\u20ac\nAnd there they stood, true bearers of gifts. Gifts for all, not only for the odious and boring good of spirit, whose luminous souls had marked step by step a destiny of slavery for Rudenolf.\nThe Four threw the fat man dressed in red before his feet (Rudenolf was standing!) bloodless and panting. They said to him: \"Play with him!\", what is \"play\" he asked, and one of the Four beckoned him towards the brothers with a goat's head, \"They are happy, they have fun\" he said, and as he watched the latter wearing the limbs of the elves like obscene vestiges, Rudenolf understood, and as he eviscerated the fat one he was really happy.\nEach one of them be purchased as add-on for 7\u20ac\n\"Now it's enough!\" the Four said, \"now the game changes, it will have rules, our rules!. Now you can dress red clothes too and you can bring to all the gifts that you will consider just ... pain, fear, despair, your revenge, your new game \"... Rudenolf understood, his nose lit up with a dark red, cruel, not a guide in the night, but a threat, an ominous foreboding, memento of an inevitable promise, joy and expectation yes, but only for Him and his too many buried desires.\n\"Now enough\" shout one of the Four, the one with the wolf helmet, which until now had not spoken, \"stop playing with the bowels of the Elves! ... you prepare Rudenolf, walk with us, at our side, the Coach is waiting for us!\nEach one of them be purchased as add-on for 8\u20ac\nLook at prototypes\n      Model and bases shown are here only to compare sizes.

It brings your dream of Magic, Sword, and Elements mage to reality. With only one roll away! And they are with Glowing Resin!\nFantasy Dice is made by injected glowing resin with different colors background to make it looks Magical and Elemental.\nColor Options\nShadow Black\nThere are 3 ways to maintain the power of 5 Elements, using the mysterious dark energy from another world is one of them. The force of dark energy is different from our world and it's so strong that can keep the natural force of Elements unable to breakthrough. But great power also comes with consequences...And they are with Glowing Resin!\nWhite\nThe Ancient power of Sage is able to seal the power of elements into bones or ivory and allow a caster to summon stable and controllable Elements' force to handle life or battle. However, the academy charges very high for even one Element dice. And they are with Glowing Resin!\nIron\nThe North men are very good at dealing with steel and metal. They use a different way to train mages and control the power of Elements. With the strength of their Chroma Iron, they are able to maintain the force of elements inside for nearly a century.

We are not very good at paint things ourselves, that's why some of the prototypes are sent to some reviewer with painting expertise! We will update you on that soon! And they are with Glowing Resin!\nThat is why we need your help on Kickstarter! The molding for casting is really expensive due to the design complexity.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Maki Games and Royal Art Games are raising funds to start the production of a resin version for our chaos teams. Both Chaos teams are a collection of amazing miniatures made previously in high quality white metal and soon in high quality resin. 16 different miniatures per team, including a Big Guy (Bloodthirsty Beast or Minotaur, depending on the team). Don\u00b4t loose the chance to support this amazing project!\nGiven the constant increase in the price of metal and the growing competition for fantasy football teams, we felt the need for more affordable yet top quality products. For these reasons we decided to switch the production line from metal to resin. For this project we partnered with Royal Art Games for the manufacturing of resin teams since they have proven to be able to manufacture resin teams for fantasy football at the highest standards. The metal teams will soon be discontinued so this is the best chance to get a team in metal, if you like your players to \"hit like solid metal\".\nThe Blood Demons Team includes 9 Pit Fighters, 4 Blood Demons, 2 Blood Demons Heralds and 1 Bloodthirsty Beast.\n        Ares Blood Demons were designed by Macs Gallo, sculpted by Jin Vi and painted by AXIA.\nAres Blood Demons Team\n           The Chaos Chosen Team includes 11 Beastmen, 4 Chaos Chosen Warriors and 1 Minotaur.\n      Himeros Chaos Chosens were designed by Macs Gallo, sculpted by Irek Zieli\u0144ski and painted by Mindworks Games.\nHimeros Chaos Chosen Team\n        Size Comparison\n              Unlocked Freebie!\n    Unlocked Add-on!\n    Unlocked Freebie\n    Unlocked Freebie & add-on!\n  Unlocked Freebie\n  Unlocked Freebie\n  Freebie\n  Once we raise enough funds to reach the funding goal, it means the resin version of our Chaos and Blood demons team will be produced at the end of the campaign. However, reaching the funding goal is not the end! \nThe campaign will go beyond the basic rewards of the project and the more people join the project, the more stretch goals will be unlocked.\n\nThe beauty of crowdfunding on Kickstarter is that you can choose how much to spend during the whole duration of the project. This means you can join the project to get all the updates of the campaign and change your mind until the very last minute of the campaign. So, if you like our teams you could join with one of the lower pledges and then decide if you prefer to drop it before the end or to pledge more funds and get a more expensive pledge or addons.\nAfter the funding goal is reached we will announce new stretch goals for the project. The stretch goals will either unlock new add-ons or add free items to your existing pledge, so the more people join the project the more free items you will get without spending more. This is a very good reason to help us spread the word on social media and in your community of gamers. If your friends join the project you will all benefit from it at no additional cost.\n\nSHIPPING COSTS AND ESTIMATED DELIVERY\nShipping costs for this project will be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager. This solution allows us to charge only the actual shipping costs, which might be different if you take only resin teams, only metal teams or if you opt to get a mix of both.\n\nEstimated shipping cost are:\n10 euros for Europe\n15 euros for USA\n20/25 euros for Rest of the world\nEstimated delivery for this project is early January for the metal teams and late January for the resin teams. There might be minor delays for the resin team depending on the customs clearance process since the resin teams will be manufactured in China.\nMaki Games is a well known Dutch manufacturer of terrain and miniatures. The company was founded in 2013 thanks to the backers who supported our first Kickstarter project. Since then we launched several fantasy football teams thanks to the creativity of Rolljordan, co-founder of Maki Games. In addition to creating our own products we collaborated with several Italian and international firms and manufacturers in the tabletop games market, helping them to manage their Kickstarter projects from concept stage to fulfillment and supporting them in the creation of high quality miniatures. \nIn these 4 years we had the pleasure to work with several world-famous sculptors and artists whose passion and creativity has been fundamental to develop our company. We grew in experience together with our partners and artists and, as we did from day 1, we are committed to maintaining the the highest quality in our casting process. \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have successfully completed several crowdfunding projects in the past and we are confident that the rewards will be delivered.\nIn crowdfunding projects there are always certain variables that could escape our control and as consequence can provoke a delay in delivery.

Everyone involved in this Kickstarter, from writer Michael Curtis on down, is so grateful for the amazing support you have shown this book. \nAnd if you missed out on the Kickstarter, you'll still be able to grab copies of The Dungeon Alphabet from a store near you, or from our online store in due time. \nIf you are a backer, WOW! You guys not only hit every goal we thought of, you added some ideas of your own that we tossed in for good measure! You got past the Leather Edition and moved well beyond, hitting the gatefold map and several extra letters. Amazing. Beautiful. Crazy. Dynamic. Extravagant. Fabulous. Great. ...and you get the idea. All the way to Z. \nHelp bring The Dungeon Alphabet back in a deluxe 4th printing! One of the most popular titles ever released by Goodman Games and a precursor to the design elements that would eventually make DCC RPG so popular, The Dungeon Alphabet is a book of dungeon inspiration that blends creative writing and inspirational art. Every RPG enthusiast, whether player or judge, will find their minds abuzz after reading this book. \nThis Kickstarter funds a 4th printing of The Dungeon Alphabet in a hardcover. Since we\u2019re running this Kickstarter over Black Friday, we are also offering a 40% discount! The book is priced at $12, but only during this Kickstarter. After the Kickstarter it will return to its list price of $20.\nThe 4th printing is expanded with 16 pages of additional content for a total of 80 pages. Depending on stretch goals, we may be able to add deluxe printing features like a sewn-in bookmark, cloth binding, and possibly even a leatherbound edition. (See below for more on that.)\nYou can also add on copies of The Monster Alphabet, a previously-released sister project to Dungeon Alphabet, to your pledge. These are also at the 40% Black Friday discount!\nWhat Is The Dungeon Alphabet?\nThe Dungeon Alphabet is a book of fantasy inspiration. It is filled with random tables that are themed to letters of the alphabet. For example, A is for Altar, B is for Books, and C is for Crypts. The target audience is dungeon masters and anyone who wants ideas for dungeon design. We have heard over the years that many players also enjoy looking through the book as well.\nEach page of The Dungeon Alphabet uses a letter of the alphabet to provide inspiration. In the first printing, so many years ago, there were 26 entries for the 26 letters. With each new printing, we have doubled-up on select letters to add even more material. This 4th printing is now up to 41 entries, including 2 completely new ones and others collected from our annual Gen Con Program Guides, to add a total of 7 letters that are new since the 3rd printing:\nC is also for Crypt\nG is also for Guardians\nH is also for Hazards\nL is also for Levels\nO is also for Omen\nQ is also for Quests\nU is also for Underwater\nJ is for Jewels\nShow Me An Example!\nCertainly!\nHere is a preview of the Table of Contents, where you can see all the letters.\nPreview of the table of contents\n  And here are pages 6-12 of the 4th printing, showing several entries.\nPreview of pages 6-12\n  Tell Me About the Author\n\u201cManly\u201d Michael Curtis is the ruffian behind the writing. The Dungeon Alphabet was his first professional RPG publication, and has launched him on a professional RPG writing career. Michael is well known for his contributions to the Dungeon Crawl Classics line, where he has authored more than a dozen adventures, including the Shudder Mountain setting and associated Chained Coffin adventure. Michael is also the creator of Stonehell Dungeon, and an instrumental contributor the Goodman Games renaissance of the Metamorphosis Alpha line. He is also the lead designer on the DCC Lankhmar project, and the mastermind behind our license to publish the works of Fritz Leiber\u2019s Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.\nMichael's work on The Dungeon Alphabet has been recognized repeatedly. Among many accolades, the book won the Three Castles Award at the 2011 North Texas RPG Convention.\nR is for Rooms\nTell Me About the Artists\nThe Dungeon Alphabet is illustrated by a who\u2019s-who of old-school RPG artists, from TSR founding artists to luminaries of the Old School Renaissance. With each new printing we have added even more art. The roster for the 4th printing includes:\nTSR Alumni: Erol Otus (cover art and interior art), Jeff Easley, Jim Holloway, Russ Nicholson, Jim Roslof\nGoodman Games Artists and OSR Luminaries: Doug Kovacs, William McAusland, Brad McDevitt, Jesse Mohn, Peter Mullen, Stefan Poag, Chad Sergesketter, Chuck Whelon, and Mike Wilson\nThe Endsheet Art\nThe first printing of The Dungeon Alphabet featured an amazing two-page spread on the endsheets. It was a cave exploration scene by Peter Mullen, printed in the same sky blue tone as the original inside covers of the TSR adventure modules.\nVarious endsheet images: the 1st (blue) and 3rd printings\nWith each subsequent printing, we swapped out new art for the endsheets. Peter Mullen provided a second 11x17 image, then Russ Nicholson drew an amazing scene for the 3rd printing. And based on the popularity of this approach, we asked Peter Mullen to illustrate another scene for the endsheets of our GM Gems hardcover.\nFor this 4th printing of Dungeon Alphabet, we plan to include Peter Mullen\u2019s original illustration on the front endsheets, appropriately printed in \u201cTSR module blue.\u201d We\u2019ll also include his other endsheet illustration on the inside back cover. And in the hardcover centerfold, we will print Russ Nicholson\u2019s two-page spread from the endsheets of the 3rd printing!\nDesign Inspiration for DCC RPG\nDungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game, or DCC RPG, is one of the most popular role playing games on the market. Now in its sixth printing, DCC RPG has inspired and re-engaged thousands of gamers, through both its rules and presentation. What many do not know is that The Dungeon Alphabet was a trial run for the graphic design that would eventually come to life in DCC RPG. If you love the overabundance of art in DCC RPG, and the classic pen-and-ink feel, you will love The Dungeon Alphabet.\nY is for Yellow\nAdd On The Monster Alphabet or Other Versions of The Dungeon Alphabet\nYou can add on copies of The Monster Alphabet to this Kickstarter. You can also add on copies of The Dungeon Alphabet in either format (color or gold foil). All are at the 40% Black Friday discount.\nThe Monster Alphabet: Given the synergy between The Monster Alphabet and The Dungeon Alphabet, we are also offering The Monster Alphabet as an add-on. Two years ago, Goodman Games published The Monster Alphabet. Designed with the same principles as The Dungeon Alphabet (and also featuring Michael Curtis\u2019 work), The Monster Alphabet focuses on inspiration for monster design. \nThe Dungeon Alphabet: If you pledged for the gold foil edition and would also like to add the color cover edition, you can do so.\nTo add items on to your pledge: simply add the \"dollars\" to your pledge amount. At the end of the Kickstarter we will send out a survey where you can tell us exactly what you ordered. \nThe Monster Alphabet: Add $12 for the color-cover edition of The Monster Alphabet (in print+PDF) or $18 for the gold foil edition (in print+PDF)\nThe Dungeon Alphabet: Add $12 for the color-cover edition of The Dungeon Alphabet (in print+PDF), or $18 for the gold foil edition (in print+PDF), or $60 for the leather-bound edition (in print+PDF)\nStretch Goals\nOnce we have cleared the basic pledge level, we would like to add a bunch of special features! Here are the stretch goals.\n$7,000: CLEARED! We will print The Dungeon Alphabet with a sewn-in satin bookmark. \n$9,000: CLEARED!

Our leatherbound editions of this nature normally retail for $100 but for this Kickstarter we will offer it at the Black Friday price of $60 per copy.

Since The Dungeon Alphabet first released way back in 2009, it has been universally praised by fans. Here is a sampling of customer feedback.\nSkyland Games: \"I cannot recommend this book highly enough for the dungeon master looking to get the creative juices flowing, and keep their players guessing!\"\nThe Earthlight Academy: \"Even if you don't end up using the tables as presented, just flipping through the pages of this book will have your head swimming with ideas. This is due, in part, to the absurd amount of old-school fantasy art.\"\nGrognardia: \"In the end, it's Michael Curtis's terrific little entries that are the heart and soul of this product and they never once disappoint. Each one of them is a tiny masterpiece, a succinct elucidation of not just what makes a good old school dungeon but also what distinguishes the Old Ways from the new.\"\nGameKnight Reviews: \"Curtis came up with some very unique (and humorous) tables, such as the one for Books. For example, one special property is \u201cBook is enchanted to prevent theft.

Kickstarter does not allow us to donate any of these profits to charity, but our ultimate aim is to support local organizations that speak to the themes of each game we create. Side Effects efforts will support mental health, our global warming game will go toward environmental charities, and so on. \nJen Igartua is unlikely to understand cultural references from the 90's due to the fact that she still super Spanish.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "  Starting from Easter 2017, we decided to begin creating miniatures dedicated to major holidays.\nThese limited edition items will delight enthusiasts, collectors and artists alike, and the models may even end up on board games if the players can use their imagination well enough!\nOur concept is to bring out one or more dedicated models each year, at regular intervals, for a limited period of time and in limited quantities. After the regular sales period ends, models will enter our Legacy Vault, which will remain closed until the next event: once it's closed for good, the models inside will not be sold anymore.\nBut what is the Legacy Vault and how does it work?\nLegacy Miniatures are fairly rare models that aren't normally available for purchase in our store. You can sometimes find them in on sale during special events and always for a very short time. The Legacy Vault is the place where Legacy Miniatures are kept after the sales period ends. Inside this Vault you will find all limited models made in past events. Be warned, the Vault may not reopen for future sales, so if you see a piece that you like and are on the fence, you'd better not risk lossing it for good, and grab it quickly. There's no guarantee it will be available again next year, or the one after that! A certificate will also be issued with each model, authenticating its number and release of issue.\nA Certificate will come with every limited model that you buy from this campaign.\nModels are in 32mm scale. However, bear in mind that this does not mean that they will measure 32 mm from head to toe, but rather that they will have the proportions of this scale.\nModels will be made in resin and/or metal, depending on the model. Each model will come with a generic base, but we are sure that the experts among you will be able to create a small diorama for these limited editions.\nFREE shipping to Europe, USA, Canada\n                           FREE shipping to Europe, USA, Canada\n            FREE shipping to Europe, USA, Canada\n     FREE shipping to Europe, USA, Canada\n     If they\u2019re unlocked, all these models will be FREE for any pledge level from Tier 1 upwards.\n\nIf you want, you can add any number of these as Add-Ons to your pledge: just increase your PLEDGE TOTAL by the reward's corresponding amount, and you\u2019re done. You will then confirm your choice with a post-campaign Pledge Manager system. Thank you!\n     To add an add-on to your pledge, please increase your PLEDGE TOTAL by the corresponding amount. You will confirm your choices with a post-campaign pledge manager. Thank you!\n             This model will join in the Legacy Vault. This mean that will be available  to purchase only during this campaign and particular events\n                       DHL will be used as courier service for all packages and orders.\nShipping costs will be included (and free of charge) from Tieri 1 or higher coming from the EU, the UK, the USA or Canada. For orders coming from anywhere else in the world, the shipping costs will be 16 euros, which you will be charged for during the Pledge Manager procedure. For Add-ons or single models:\nEU - UK: FREE SHIPPING  (or 10/12 \u20ac for single purchase)\nUSA - CANADA: FREE SHIPPING  (or 10/15 \u20ac for single purchase)\nREST OF THE WORLD: + \u20ac16\nFor Add-ons or single model: Based on past experiences, shipping costs will be charged after the campaign through our store-based pledge manager, based on the actual cost of shipping the contents of your pledge and any additional rewards you selected. This method allows us to be fair to all our backers, as shipping is rarely a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d affair: furthermore, we can also provide you with more stretch bonuses, and (possibly) a selection of different shipping options. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs.\nPlease keep in mind that these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases generated by unlocked stretch goals, optional purchases on your part and your postal code. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes, either domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package, the risk of a package \u201cbouncing back\u201d to us is simply too high.\nThe following applies to all perks:\nAll miniatures are sculpted by Greebo and Deadowl\nAll miniatures concepts are made by Matteo Spirito. \nAll sets are safely shipped in padded envelopes or boxes, depending on the pledge \nAll miniatures are made from metal or resin depend on model. Add-ons and freebies will be made in metal, and, sometimes, in resin as well \nAll miniatures will be supplied as unassembled, unpainted and unbased kits, unless explicitly stated otherwise \nThe miniatures and all additional parts are 32 mm scale \nBust is 100 mm size\nShipping commences by January 2017", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a very low-risk campaign, as the entirety of the project is produced by Greebo Games, and it will be made, no ifs or buts about it - provided that it gets funded! As you can see, all models have already been created, so there is no real \u201crisk\u201d. We have several campaigns under our belt, and all have been carried through successfully.\n\nSome of these models can get delayed, changed or deleted: should this occur, we will gladly refund you the money you have spent to claim them, or we can provide you with a selection of any items from our catalog with an equal value.\n\nAll sets will be shipped from Italy.\n\nPlease note that while we always do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country, or before it\u2019s made available in conventions, physical events and for special promotional opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible delay. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and wait for the retail release instead. Thank you.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nREFUND POLICY \nWe can refund you within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, including fees. After that, we have a \u201cno questions asked\u201d policy, though that\u2019s minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them once 60 days have gone by).\n\nHowever, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipping - usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date - no refunds are possible. \nAll refunds after 60 days are processed via Paypal exclusively. Refunds within 60 days will be reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in EUR, and any refunds processed will be in EUR for the exact amount received in the same currency, minus any applicable fees depending on the timeline of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS \nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, we will consider it abandoned, and we will refund or ship on a case-by-case basis.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final looks, materials and contents of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to changes, and may differ substantially from what has been shown while the Kickstarter project is active. You agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that you are responsible for import duties or any other tariffs that may be due to the corresponding tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring that this address is reachable by normal shipping methods. We regret that we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge to this project, but wait for the general release instead.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Step right up, my lords and ladies, and prepare to be mystified by the most bizarre, the most exotic, the most fantastic sights you have ever yet to behold! Step behind this curtain\u2014for the merest, tiniest contribution\u2014and your world will be changed forever! For this is the Carnival of Monsters, and it offers a world of wonders!\nAMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH invites you to experience Richard Garfield\u2019s Carnival of Monsters, a new game from the genius behind such hits as Magic: The Gathering, RoboRally, and King of Tokyo.\nGarfield\u2019s most recent design, this game challenges you to explore exotic, fantastic lands and collect extraordinary monsters to display in your carnival, earning the adoration of the crowd and the fame that only a true carnival master can enjoy. Because we believe that great games deserve great art, we have teamed up with some of the most talented artists in the world of gaming today to make Richard Garfield\u2019s Carnival of Monsters a celebration not only of great game design, but of great game art as well.\nBut this magnificent creation won\u2019t be possible without help from you. By backing this campaign, you can help AMIGO and this pool of talented artists make this project a reality. Explore the sample artwork below, learn more about the game and the artists, then join us by backing this project. \nTogether, we can make Richard Garfield\u2019s Carnival of Monsters the magnificently beautiful game that we know it can be.\nWhile we don\u00b4t think that Richard needs a big introduction, we still feel something would be missing if we did not introduce him properly. \n  As magnificent as the monsters are, it takes talented artists to really bring them to life. We have gathered this team of brilliant artists. Together, they have illustrated more than 1,000 cards for Richard\u2019s most famous creation, Magic: The Gathering. Most of them were part of that phenomenon from the very beginning, and they are delighted to reunite with Richard to illustrate his latest game project, 25 years later.\n  Richard Garfield\u2019s Carnival of Monsters combines card drafting and set collecting for a game experience that is at once familiar and refreshingly new. 2 to 5 players begin with a small number of Lands, which they can use to play Monsters. At the beginning of each of the game\u2019s four Seasons, each player is dealt eight cards\u2014which can include more Lands, Monsters, or other cards they might be able to use to improve their carnival. A normal game takes around 45 minutes and we suggest players to be age 10 or older.\nAt the same time, all players choose one card to keep, passing the rest to their neighbor. You can play your chosen card immediately, or pay one coin to save it for later. Of course, if you can\u2019t play it now, you\u2019ll have to pay to keep it!\nCollecting more Land cards allows you to play more and bigger Monsters.\nPlaying Monsters is the key to scoring points: Every Monster is worth points at the end of the game, and if you play the right kind of Monster in the right Season, you can earn more points and coins during the game.\nStaff cards provide a permanent bonus for your carnival, from new ways to earn coins, to Hunters that can protect you from dangerous Monsters!\nEvents give you a one-time boost.\nSecret Goals are kept hidden until the end of the game, when they add surprise points to your score!\nThe Season ends once all of the cards dealt have been chosen. Now it\u2019s time to deal with those dangerous Monsters you\u2019ve been putting on display!\nFortunately, the King will help out some by sending out his Royal Hunters, but you can\u2019t always rely on them\u2026\nYou can hire Hunters for your staff\u2026\nOr use Nets you have collected\u2014but each Net can only be used once!\nIf your Monster gets out, the King will be most upset\u2014you\u2019ll have to pay your precious coins to clean up the mess.\nRun out of money? No problem! Take out a Loan (or two\u2026 or three\u2026). But be careful! Each Loan will cost you victory points at the end of the game. Get too deep in debt, and it won\u2019t matter how magnificent your Monsters are.\nAfter four Seasons, add up your points from the Monsters you have played, the Secret Goals you have completed, and the coins you have left. The player with the most points is hailed as the true Carnival Master!\n\nWhen this project is fully funded, it will include 104 unique original full-card illustrations, including fabulous monsters, exotic lands, and talented staff members to populate your carnivals. But that is not the end of the campaign! We hope to provide 86 additional individual full-card illustrations so that every monster, land, and staff card has its own unique artwork without any duplication. In order to achieve this accomplishment, we have prepared a number of stretch goals to fund those additional illustrations.\nWith your help, through this Kickstarter campaign, we will be able to recruit the best artists for the job, presenting an all-new fantasy world in a completely revolutionary way.\nDownload-Link for the rules.\nDownload-Link for the cards.\nLet\u00b4s have a look at what the different Editions of the game have to offer. Please keep in mind that everything you see here is still a work in progress. After all, we need your help to make this game as beautiful as we can.\n         Let\u00b4s have a closer look at the individual components. Please keep in mind that everything you see here is still a work in progress.\n  Here is how a game in the middle of the first season might look.\n       Find all media about the game, ask questions and join discussions about it on BGG.\n                     Over 35 Years of Simply Great Games!\nAMIGO, the game publishing company, first saw the light of day in 1980. Successful distribution deals established AMIGO\u2019s name and enabled it to venture into the world of board games, too. The Dietzenbach-based game publisher has developed a strong second pillar for itself by expanding into the area of licenses and distribution of Magic: The Gathering, Pok\u00e9mon TCG, Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG and the new Force of Will TCG.\nThanks to the strength of popular card games like 6 nimmt!, Bohnanza and Wizard, AMIGO has practically become synonymous with card games in Germany.\nIn recent years, the Dietzenbach publisher has focused largely on these very strengths. Classic lines such as Halli Galli, 6 nimmt!, Wizard and Bohnanza have been expanded. Numerous events from years past, like the Wizard and Saboteur championships, as well as Organized Play for trading card games on a national level, continue to enjoy significant success.\nOur partner for the production and logistics of this fantastic game is LUDO FACT. LUDO FACT is synonymous for quality in board games.\nHere is a short excerpt from their company profile:\nFor us it's all in the name: ludere = play, facere = make. We've been bringing pleasure into the world for over 20 years: 70,000 board games per day, 350,000 games and puzzles a week and up to 17 million board games and puzzles a year - for 200 games publishers worldwide. We are the contact partners for a complete game: Production, assembly, packaging and shipping. With our subsidiary Ludo Packt you benefit from short communication channels, because with us everything is under one roof. As the first games manufacturer, we are committed to ISO 9001 certification which is a global standard of quality. We produce items in accordance with ISO norm 9001, the provisions of the law and EN71. This enables our customers to have an even more transparent view of our services. Moreover, we also want to contribute towards global, sustainable forest management which is why we have been certified by FSC and PEFC.\nOur dedicated and professional staff are always looking for the best results and finding creative and functional solutions. We ensure a continuous improvement process with sustainable effects. Thus, our products retain our customer\u2019s joy of playing even after many years.\nIf you want to know more about how Ludo Fact works, watch this great film our friends from The Spiel made:\n     The project is US, Canada and EU friendly.\nShipping costs are not included within the pledge. We will be charging actual shipping cost via our pledge manager after the Kickstarter concludes. That way we can be as fair as possible to all of you, as we will end up with a lot of different sizes of packages.\nWe will ship the games and add-ons in bulk to fulfillment centers in Europe and the USA at our expense to keep shipping costs for you as low as possible and reduce customs fees and VAT where possible.\nIf you want to save yourselves the shipping cost all together: We plan to offer pickup of your pledges both at Gen Con 2018 and Essen Spiel 2018.\nShould you wish to have your games shipped to your home, we would like to give you an idea about the roughly estimated shipping costs for a single game.  We compiled the following list together with our logistics partner.\nEUROPE:\n\u2022 Germany: 10 Euro\n\u2022 Most European countries: between 15 and 25 Euro\n\u2022 Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania: 30 Euro\n\u2022 Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia: 35 Euro\n\u2022 Bulgaria and Romania: 45 Euro\n\u2022 Greece and Iceland: 50 Euro\nNORTH AMERICA:\n\u2022 USA: between 10 and 15 Euro to most states\n\u2022 USA \u2013 Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico: 30 Euro\n\u2022 Canada: between 10 and 20 Euro to most cities\nLATIN AMERICA:\n\u2022 Between 50 and 60 Euro to most countries\nASIA:\n\u2022 China and Hong Kong: 70 Euro\n\u2022 Japan: 70 Euro\nOCEANIA:\n\u2022 Australia: 70 Euro\n\u2022 New Zealand: 70 Euro\nAFRICA:\n\u2022 Between 70 and 100 Euro to most countries\nANTARCTICA:\n\u2022 Should somebody down there be interested, we will try to figure something out but be warned: It will be expensive. ;)\nPlease note that we cannot ship to any PO box, neither will we ship to the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan or Afghanistan.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we know how to publish boardgames, this is our first Kickstarter and therefore a new experience for us.\n\nCarnival of Monsters is a special project in many ways.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Short Version\nWe are funded and producing (at least) three RPG miniatures for all sorts of sci-fi, post-apocalyptic, space opera, and fantasy games that feature aliens, magic, tech, survival, exploration, or all of the above. Two additional miniatures are available as Add-Ons, along with large-scale versions of all five characters.\nMiniatures are true 32mm scale (a 6' person is 32mm to the eyes), expertly modeled and cast in resin or 3D printed to get the finest level of detail possible.\nThe up-front modeling costs are already paid as part of my contribution to this project. I'm taking zero profit from this campaign and every penny goes toward making more miniatures or making the existing miniatures more awesome.\nThere's a lot more history and background toward the bottom of the page, but let's continue with the big stuff:\nThis is as simple as it gets:  \n$1 gets you access to Add-Ons.\n$10 gets you one mini. \n$20 gets you two minis. \n$30 gets you three minis. \nThe first 100 backers to grab a set of all three get them for only $25. If and when Stretch Goals are unlocked, this Early Bird will be good for a pick of any three standard minis, not just the core three.\n$55 gets you a complete set. That's two copies each of the Tusk, Dru, and Grim, along with a Mod Kit for each. That gives you everything you need to create a couple of different configurations of each mini.\n$100 gets you everything. That's two copies of each of the five available 32mm miniatures, and a Mod Kit for each. Create a whole slew of possible combinations.\nPledge any of those levels and you're eligible for Add-Ons, whether from the base list or those unlocked as Stretch Goals. \nShipping is separate and charged during the Pledge Management phase once the campaign has closed.\nAll miniatures come unpainted, with assembly required. Model cuts can be seen on the individual descriptions.\nAdditionally, be sure to check out the additional miniatures and Mod Kits that are available exclusively as Add-Ons.\n    Proof Prints\nBelow are some 3D printed models, just like will be used to create the \"masters\" before casting. I've mounted them on U.S. quarters (approximately 1 inch or 25mm diameter) to show the scale. This isn't some hypothetical product... they're right there in front of you, ready to be put into production!\nMore photos will be made available in an Update.\n  We'll choose Stretch Goals as a group via an online poll found HERE or by clicking the poll image at the bottom of this section. Stretch Goals will come every $1000 to $1500 of funding, then be available as Add-Ons.\nI've taken the liberty of picking the first two Stretch Goals out of the gate based on preliminary fan polling, so that production work can begin on them before the campaign. There are the female Elder and the male Hollow Mage. Others will follow!\nUPDATE: As a response to some backer comments, we have  updated the first two Stretch Goals. These minis will be available as Add-Ons for a slightly higher price than standard miniatures. This is because at this stage, these minis will be 3D printed (still in high quality resin every bit as detailed as the cast minis) instead of cast. If, however, we hit the below Stretch Goals for price reduction, the economics will allow for these minis will be dropped to $10 and be available as part of the pledge packages. For now, they are exclusively available as Add-Ons.\nAnd there's a lot more where that came from! Among the Stretch Goals being considered, beyond those pictured above, are a couple of larger and more expensive items. We'll continue to grow this list of options as the campaign progresses.\nSo, to weigh in on what Stretch Goals you'd like to see, don't forget to respond to the poll below by clicking THIS LINK or clicking through the image, below. The form requires that you log in so that you can come back and revise your answer later, but none of your personal information is shared - not even your email address.\nClick to access survey form\nWorks In Progress\nEven though we haven't unlocked any Stretch Goals yet, confidence is so high that modeling is well underway on the first two. Chances are good that if we break the threshold for the third Stretch Goal early on, we'll be able to get an early look at that one as well.\nElder WIP\nElder Mod Kit WIP\nHollow Mage WIP\nHollow Mage Mod Kit WIP\n  To receive any of the below as part of your backer reward, simply increase your pledge by the listed amount. You'll clarify which minis or other products you want as part during the Pledge Management phase. As with all minis, shipping will be billed after the funding period has ended. \nAdditional minis are available at the base price and include the standard pieces.\nMod Kits include only the additional pieces shown, used to modify the standard mini.\nResin bases are available in sets of three. They will be made available for print on demand via Shapeways (in various materials) after the campaign, but they are much cheaper as part of the campaign.\nPDF rewards will be delivered via DriveThruRPG as soon as the funding is processed.\nUntil meeting the stated Stretch Goals, the Elder and Hollow Mage, and their respective Mod Kits, are available 3D printed as opposed to resin cast. Quality of the prints is every bit as detailed as when casting. \nMega-Sized minis are the available miniatures but in larger scale, and include the pieces from the Mod Kit as well. These may be cast in resin, but likely 3D printed. Minis that are more massive (have more volume) cost more due to material expense.\nProof prints of the Mega-Sized Grim\nAlien Adventurer Miniatures  \nSince the Breachworld RPG was published a few years ago, I've wanted to have some minis to slide around the table, but it hasn't been in the cards. That situation changed a bit, so here we are.\nThese miniatures are for more than Breachworld, and will provide an interesting change of pace from the typical wargaming and fantasy minis that we typically see. This Kickstarter offers you the chance to help produce some beautiful, highly-detailed, wild and imaginative minis for your game. They'll look great on your hex grid, hand-scribbled battle map, or up on your shelf. At 32mm scale (height measured to the eyes of an average human), expertly sculpted to lifelike proportions, these resin-cast miniatures show every detail of their uniqueness and character. The larger scales available as Add-Ons offer even more opportunity for painters and collectors.\nEvery Last Dime  \nHere is what I think is the coolest part - we're going to put every cent raised in the Kickstarter into the miniatures, with no profit taken. I'd much rather grow this project than make the few extra bucks. Not just that, but to front-load the work and keep the funding goal to a minimum, I've put forward the up-front costs for the first three miniatures as my gift to the effort.\nMeeting the funding goal will cover the manufacturing costs of the first three minis, which include prototypes, molds, and material costs. Stretch Goals will cover all of the costs for additional miniatures. Because this is a \"break even\" campaign, I'll regularly share where we are on production costs and how we are going to spend the available surplus on additional miniatures, small additions to existing models, or giving well-deserved bonuses to the artists.\nThanks to the Artists!\nNone of this would be possible without the fantastic art team. Concept art is by Breachworld veteran and all-around wonder, Eric Quigley. The fantastic and imaginative digital sculptor is Kevin Cayuela Borg. Photography is by Anthony Vasser. They rule.\nShipping and Fulfillment\nShipping will be calculated on an individual basis and billed after the campaign via Backerkit.\nFulfillment will be handled through our partnership with BlackBox (from the creators of Cards Against Humanity) and will work to give the best rates to backers across the globe by using multiple shipping centers. If you want a shipping estimate, you can check out their website at blackbox.cool or look in-depth at how shipping works in THIS DOCUMENT.\nSo, Let's Talk About It\nI'm excited to see what y'all think. Let's compare notes and see where we want this thing to head, and discuss how we can make it the greatest possible success.\nThe best place to discuss is right here in the Comments section, so fire away. Some other really good places are:\nJason Richards Publishing on Facebook\nJason Richards Publishing on Twitter using the #Breachworld tag\nBreachworld on Google+\nI'll also be blogging more about it at jasonrichards.net\nIf you want more Breachworld, check out the following:\nThe Breachworld official site\nBreachworld products (many free) on DriveThruRPG; some products here, including some free ones, include the full write-ups for the various Player Races that serve as the basis for the miniatures.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done everything we can to mitigate any risks before the campaign was launched. The remaining major risks are:\n\n1. A technical failure or interruption to supplies could cause delays, such as equipment malfunction, a fire in a warehouse, a shortage of materials, or similar issues. All of the partners on this Kickstarter are seasoned professionals, so this risk is minimal.\n\n2. The project could go so well that additional resources are required, such as additional artists, manufacturers, or shipping concerns. This could potentially cause delays. If this does turn out the case, we'll know early on in the campaign and will keep you informed. If the campaign REALLY blows up we'll cap the offerings and bank the extra capital for an additional campaign once this completes.\n\n3. Issues with modeling or casting could cause delays. However, you have seen the early modeling work, and the history of those involved, and even the preliminary 3D prints, so the capability is clearly established. Our artists and manufacturing partners are veterans of multiple Kickstarters.\n\n4. Post-campaign pledge management and fulfillment always hold challenges, but again our partners in this endeavor are specialists. BackerKit will handle pledge management, and BlackBox (from the creators of Cards Against Humanity) will handle fulfillment.\n\n5. If we have any minis that have very low order numbers, they may simply be 3D printed in resin instead of cast. The level of detail will be the same, but in small lots the buy-in cost for making the molds to cast may be prohibitive.\n\nIf you identify any further possibly trouble spots, please raise the flag and your concerns will be addressed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "SUPPORTER", "descp": "Gain access to comments and Add-Ons.\n*Shipping will be charged separately via BackerKit after the campaign ends", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "PICK ONE", "descp": "Receive one standard miniature of your choice, including those from Stretch Goals.

It is brimming with 72 pages and contains 7 stories, each featuring a full page black-and-white illustration. When appropriate to the tale, maps to terrifying tombs and sinister lairs are included as well. Each story has been written, edited, illustrated, and laid out in classic pulp magazine format.

Hocking, Howard Andrew Jones, Aeryn Rudel, Bill Ward, C. L. Werner, and Chris Willrich. The magazine is edited by Howard Andrew Jones and published by Joseph Goodman of Goodman Games, with layout by Lester B.

Depending on pledge level, backers will receive their issues shipped to them in physical form. There is also an option for PDF delivery.\nIssue #2 will be published in mid-2018 and is currently in production.\nIan Miller's illustration for Beneath The Bay of Black Waters\nHere are the stories in the first issue:\nWhat Lies in Ice, by Chris Willrich\nIt seemed a simple matter \u2013 all they had to do was outrun the iceberg. Except that the iceberg followed after, from time to time sending severed hands scrabbling onto their deck to choke the life from them. If they were to survive, Gaunt and Bone and their comrades would have to brave the depths of the iceberg, where the tower of a power-mad wizard had been entombed for millennia.\nIt would require all the razor-honed skills at their disposal to infiltrate the ice and confront the horrific sentience that yet survived. And some of them wouldn\u2019t be getting out alive\u2026\nThe Guild of Silent Men, by James Enge\nThey came for Morlock at dusk, for aid with a grim and terrible problem. A guildsman had killed his opponent then slain himself with multiple knife wounds, his face frozen in a rictus of horror.\nOthers might have judged the case open and closed, but Morlock soon began to suspect other hands had been involved. Worse, the deeper his investigation went, the more he was certain he himself was in deadly peril.\nBeneath the Bay of Black Waters, by Bill Ward\nWhen Commissioner Shan and General Bao set out to destroy the cutthroats behind the addictive and deadly Black Pearls, they knew they\u2019d be challenged at every turn. But they could never have known the terrible discoveries that lay before them, or guessed at what lurked beneath the waves. Soon they were locked in a savage fight for the soul of their city, two men in retreat with a bedraggled guard force against hordes upon hordes of creatures from the deep\u2026\nBeyond the Block, by Aeryn Rudel\nMatthias had but one morning left him, and it would end with a blow from the headman\u2019s axe. He\u2019d fought to free his sister and dethrone a sorcerous tyrant, but he was outnumbered and alone.\nAnd then his sister\u2019s agents offered him a choice. They couldn\u2019t get him past the guards, but they knew a way he could seek his vengeance. So long as he didn\u2019t mind waiting until after his date with the chopping block\u2026\nCrypt of Stars, by Howard Andrew Jones\nThe Dervan Empire pecked at the sun blasted rocks with an army of slaves, determined to recover the fabled wealth of Volanus. Secure in their power, they worried only about delays. Even if they\u2019d known that the last great general of Volanus was alive and free, why should they fear Hanuvar Cabera? He had no armies left him. What could a single man hope to accomplish against an entire garrison?\nBut then they had never reckoned with the secrets held within the crypt of stars.\nThere Was an Old Fat Spider, by C. L. Werner\nKarl didn\u2019t want much \u2013 just enough coin to purchase a bed each night, just a little luck so that his animal traps weren\u2019t spoiled. Once he\u2019d been a skilled carver with connections to royalty. Now he was a vagabond trapper. Mocked, bullied, and abused by the townsfolk, even the woman he loved could barely stand the sight of him.\nAnd then a chance encounter led him to a dark, webbed grove, where he found a gruesome ally and began to hatch a sinister plan\u2026\nThe Crystal Sickle\u2019s Harvest, by John C. Hocking\nThe King\u2019s Hand was the king\u2019s most feared agent, the grim troubleshooter dispatched when subtlety and speed were paramount. It seemed like his apprentice Benhus might finally be able to prove his worth when the two discovered someone had crept into the royal cemetery.\nBut they quickly learned that they faced no common grave robbers. For someone had broken into the crypt of the king\u2019s sister, a woman whispered to have mastered the darkest of arts\u2026\n  Table of contents for issue #1\nMaps\nThis is a small detail, but we think it's important. The early issues of pulp literature occasionally included illustrated maps and diagrams to help the reader understand the fantastic places being explored by pulp heroes.\nTales From the Magician's Skull does the same.

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played. Every decision is interesting, the sense of cooperation and collaboration is strong, the freedom to roam is liberating, and the mystery is fascinating. This is a must-buy!\u201d\nJamey Stegmaier \u2013 Stonemaier Games\n\"The 7th Continent is quite simply a watershed moment in enthusiast gaming. Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder. The ripple effect of this game will be felt for years to come in the Boardgame Industry and should most definitely be enjoyed by all.\"\nJeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\u201cThis is the ultimate survival/exploration board game. Nothing else comes close to touching it in terms of its raw, epic scope, ambition and design.\u201d\nRichard Ham \u2013 Rahdo Runs Through\n\"I have over 50 hours of gameplay logged with 7th Continent and I feel like I have just scratched the surface. This is easily the best game of the year, and one of the best I have ever played in my life.\"\nLance Myxter \u2013 Undead Viking\nPlay solo or in a team of up to 4 players.\n30 seconds to set-up the game, 30 seconds to save it!\n1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure in a single game.\nRelive the sensation of the adventure books where \u201cyou are the hero\u201d that thrilled so many of us in our childhood.\nNo dice rolls! Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure!\nAlmost 1,000 cards for the base box alone with hundreds of pieces of original artwork.\nJoin the expedition any time, even if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died during it.\nLive a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for each individually numbered card.\nThere are consequences to your actions. If you kill an NPC, they will remain dead for the rest of the game and any options or alternatives that you might have had by letting them live will be gone\u2026forever. Let them live and they might help you later. Then again, they might not.\nAn expansion with two brand new curses, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics!\nThis expansion, which requires the base box, is compatible with all previous expansions.\nIt includes over 250 new cards, including two new curses, which you will have to overcome if you hope to leave the 7th Continent alive. Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials. It includes:\n3 Storage trays\n250+ cards\n1 Hot Air Balloon miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n1 Barge miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n7 new Dividers\n1 rule sheet\nThe curse, \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d, will send you on a whirling adventure OVER the 7th Continent!\nAboard your hot air balloon, you\u2019ll soar over the continent thanks to an innovative wind management system, which will lead you to new, unexplored tracts of land\u2026\nYou can land at any time by taking the Terrain card with the same number as your current Sky card, allowing you to continue exploring on foot. When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper. Make the right choices at the right time or you\u2019ll end up lost and doomed in the pitch black.\nAs insane and suicidal as it may seem, you have no choice but to forge ever onwards into the darkness. What manner of horrors await you? It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse!\n\"Satchel & Journal\" Binder\nThis new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal!\n1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nKeelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1. Click on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page\n2. On the next screen, click on the \u201cChange your pledge\u201d blue button\n3. Then, in the current reward box you\u2019ve chosen, increase the pledge amount by the value of the optional buy then click on the \u201cContinue\u201d green button\n4. On the window that appears, click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d blue button.\n5. It\u2019s done!\n6. A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to fill it by telling us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\n \nIf you want to sleeve the ENTIRE game, including the Stretch Goals and any other content made available during the campaign, then you have to add both optional buys for a total of $79 which includes over 1600+ card sleeves (the \u201c+\u201d is additional sleeves included \u201cfor free\u201d for the upcoming Stretch Goals and optional buys).\nWhat would a Kickstarter campaign be without some Stretch Goats?\nAfter 4 years of work, The 7th Continent became a reality thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings. Rolling dice, pushing toy soldiers and trading sheep for many a moon now, Jamie is, just like you guys, a gamer at heart. He\u2019s also a publisher himself with his own company, Holy Grail Games. Some of you may recognize him from the first Kickstarter campaign.\nTo our families and friends for their incredible support and patience as we created the cursed land of the 7th Continent.\nTo our proofreaders and translators who did an outstanding job!\nTo Olivier Nkweti for his great work on miniatures.\nTo the amazing Gary Chalk, Joe Dever, Didier Guiserix, Gary Gygax, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone for their inspirational work.\nTo all the backers of the first campaign who helped us make this dream a reality.\nTo you, previous and first-time backers, who will allow us to keep on dreaming!\nThank you all!\nWe wish you a not too gruesome demise in the land of The 7th Continent!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe re-printing of the base box does not pose any issues. \n\nWork on the new expansion has already begun and we are confident in our ability to meet the announced deadlines.\n\nWe will, of course, be keeping you updated about the state of the project through each and every stage. \n\nREFUNDS\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf the refund is requested more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Stripe.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAll prices shown in \u20ac (Euros) are based on the conversion rate in effect at the start of the campaign (09-25-2017) which is $1 = \u20ac0.84\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information, and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Then, our Monster Dice will make your time more enjoyable! Also, for both board game players and other people, it will be a marvelous decoration. The weight and visual pleasure will satisfy your appetite much more! Monster Dice will definitely stimulate your imagination while playing games or even watching the game.   \n      Why we chose Monsters for the design? \nWhen we were spending time playing board games, we instantly came up with one idea. There are a lot of cool board game figures, but, why can't the dice be cool? Since we love bizarre things, we wanted to make the monsters permeate well on the dice. We were inspired by monsters that are well known to us in various myths. Each monster was redesigned by our own feelings. However, since we could not destroy the balance of the dice, forming monster dice had a lot of limitations.\n   early models\n  The weight of the dice should be the same in all directions without leaving the corner of the base frame.\n   That was an impossible task by hand, so we actively used 3D simulation.\n   Final Prototype\n   PLAY\n\nMonsters Overview \n     Maintaining Balance \nSince monsters have to be crafted in a degree that maintains equal balance(probability) of the dice, the whole process has been challenging.\nWe have created a well balanced dice through computer simulations and 3D printing prototype tests. \nHowever, the balance may be slightly tilted compared to other normal dice due to complex process of designing monsters on the dice.\nIf you help us to successfully accomplish our campaign, we will be able to complete the perfect balance of Monster Dice by controlling the weight of inner part of the dice. \nD10 Python Dice is the least balanced among other dice. The reason is because D10 Python Dice model has the most decorative shape which makes it harder to equalize the balance of the dice. However. we gained confidence that we can make this dice more balanced from final sample test of D10 Pyhon model.\n   Probability table for 3,000 rolls.\n  PLAY\n\n <Durability test of the Monster Dice>\nSize comparison image for better understanding (on average male hands)\nDetails (size, material, etc.)  \nHere are details of a Monster Dice set:\n\nContains 7 monster dice:\nD4  Fire Drake (3oz, 85g)\nD6  Basilisk (3.7oz, 105g)\nD8  Kraken (4.2oz, 120g)\nD10  Phython (4.2oz, 120g)\nD10%  Dragon (3.8oz, 110g)\nD12  Eblis (3.8oz, 110g)\nD20 Daemon (6.3oz, 180g)\nSilver, Copper, Titanium black plated.\nFully metal crafted dice (Zinc alloy)\nDetailed description of Monsters\n       Every dice is made of zinc and plated in three colors (silver, copper, and titanium black)\n           \nChristmas Delivery\nI strongly believe that there are numerous backers who want to receive their products before Christmas.\nWe'll do our best to deliver products to backers in time.  \nHowever, for the perfect quality of the products, a minimal amount of time is also required. \nWe now know that the delivery can be delayed during the last months of the year. \nSo, we decided to offer a special 'Christmas Delivery' service to backers.\nIf you make a pledge at 'Christmas Delivery' reward, you will receive products before Christmas with no delay. \nThe first finished product is released on December 1st.\nWe plan to receive the initial supply first and send it to backers by air express. \nThis will inevitably involve additional costs.\nHowever, it is a minimal cost and we will cover the extra costs. \nThis service is only available for 400 backers. \nIf you want to meet our gorgeous Monster Dice before Christmas, please pledge at 'Christmas Delivery' reward. \nImportant Info \nThere are three colors available (Copper, Silver, and Titanium Black)\nInformation regarding shipment fee is all provided in a pledge box)\nPlease carefully read the information in each pledge box before you pledge.\nIf you have further questions about us, please leave a comment below.

There has apparently been our hesitation and brought about lack of communication. However, we would like to kindly ask for your kind understanding about this issue. As most of you know, kickstarter campaigners start with small size business, and until some degree of successful achievement, they suffer from huge amount of workload with limited number of labor. In this case, we have had hard situation with our factory. The issue was mainly made since we definitely want high quality of the dice. However, it was difficult for the factory, and no matter how much it costs, we have demanded the better quality with no defect. As everyone agrees, we have been funded well, and were able to bring this campaign alive here. However, it came out to be no revenue left on our hands. \n\nDespite of this situation, we are totally fine with that. But, we are definitely sad that some of our backers are too irritated that finally lost tolerance.

Loxley welcomes contact with all fellow creators and publishers.\nWhen you have the same scenery, it's easy to try the Intro version of another game system. It's a big world of tabletop gaming out there\u2014take a look around!\nYou\u2019ve seen the core team of 16 and the amazing list of legendary guests, 11 authors and 9 artists. You\u2019ve heard about the plan to provide game specifics (\u2018crunch\u2019) for 10 game systems. But what IS the Setting really? What\u2019s there now, and what\u2019s happening soon? Good question. It\u2019s complicated. For the long version click HERE; summary below.\nHistory: This continent is the original home of all demi-humans, who know how to get along with each other and with nature. Humans arrived, tried to conquer the place, but were forced to compromise because they didn\u2019t have an edge. Their realm, Empyrea, has evolved for 3 centuries. Their kings followed a three-prong strategy of cooperation: Minimize technology, promote magic (obeying the gods), Work with nature and the planet for long-term stability and health, and Support knowledge, the arts, and quality of life; avoid misuse of wealth and power.\nPlace: Empyrea is a rectangle. The left side is a coast with sea monsters. Mountains north, with giants. East is blocked, impassible terrain. Deepwood south, with creatures, then tribes, then evil armies -- and they\u2019re planning to visit soon.\nBelow is the primitive digital map that has been available to online players since 1992. Darlene is now rendering it in her unique style, Anna is transforming that into 3D imagery, and Alyssa is detailing cities and towns. Guest authors are detailing locations... Inns, ships, shops, and more.\nOnline campaign map 1992-present\nPeople: The dwur claim the land below, but most dislike sunlight, so noniz handle their surface business. The olve claim the woodlands, and many hobniz are in the gourmet trade near towns. Other \u2018niz (brownies and sprites and many more) are about, as are the Others, various odd monstrous races and variations.\nAction: Upcoming issues of the realm will emerge as time passes. The call to arms will sound, and the fate of the realm will be decided \u2013 perhaps by your characters! Will you run and hide, or are you a real Hero?\nHow To Play\n\nStart: Either your characters grew up here, or they popped in from another place. We\u2019ll provide guidelines for both, and three kits for suggested local character backgrounds (urban, farm, borderlands). In a starting adventure the characters meet and head out seeking fame and fortune.\nYour Stuff: You bring your characters, your game system, your style. Magic, monsters, gods? Use whatever you like. Empyrea will be the backdrop to your stories, just some new names at first. More is there when you\u2019re ready for it.  \nYou seem to be a serious hobby gamer. Consider this a useful tool, a 'second home'. This is a complicated fantasy campaign world, and we can only describe a small part of it in advance. So if you have questions, please post them on any of several sites available. We\u2019re still building that part of things, so bear with us, and help us grow!  \nQueen Nuana and King John IV\n  With the Quick Start Guides (presenting character backgrounds from city, farm, and wilderness life) and starter Adventures, you\u2019ll be playing immediately and learning fast. Supporting materials include the Empyrea Core Book, Player\u2019s Handbook, full color Darlene maps, 3 \"Little Brown Books\", and a System Book with your preferred FRP rules.\nImagine a game world that we all share, and one that you can shape. All subscribers can add their own designs to the official Worlds of Empyrea\u2014realms that are mostly empty, waiting for you.\nSee your own inn or tavern come to life! Or is it a shop within a Royal City? Maybe it's an entire dungeon! (Guidelines coming soon.)\nWith names like Darlene, Elmore, Easley, Jaquays, Otus, Dee, and more, you know the artwork will be of the highest caliber with that \"old-school\" feel.

The Starfinder Roleplaying Game puts you in the role of a bold science-fantasy explorer, investigating the mysteries of a weird and magical universe as part of a starship crew. Will you delve for lost artifacts in the ruins of alien temples? Don rune-enhanced armor and a laser rifle to battle undead empires in fleets of bone ships, or defend colonists from a swarm of ravenous monsters? Maybe you'll hack into the mainframe of a god-run corporation, or search the stars for clues to the secret history of the universe or find brand new planets to explore. Whether you're making first contact with new cultures on uncharted worlds or fighting to survive in the neon-lit back alleys of Absalom Station, you and your team will need all your wits, combat skill, and magic to make it through. But most of all, you'll need each other.\nADVENTURE: The Starfinder Adventure Pledge level is a great entry point for the start of your collection of Masterclass figures. This pledge includes 8 Kickstarter exclusives, including Candy cosplaying as Navasi and Cola cosplaying as Quig, along with heroes from the Pathfinder RPG Legacy Races. Also included is a gang of Space Goblin Zaperators. Customize your pledge with the added 6 Hero Slots and 4 Encounter Pack Slots. Also all unlocked Freebies!\nCAMPAIGN: The Starfinder Campaign Pledge level is the perfect pledge for the miniature enthusiast. This pledge includes 8 Kickstarter exclusives, including Candy cosplaying as Navasi and Cola cosplaying as Quig, along with heroes from the Pathfinder RPG Legacy Races. Also included is a gang of Space Goblin Zaperators. Customize your pledge with the added 12 Hero Slots, 6 Encounter Pack Slots, 2 Fleet Pack Slots, and 4 Creature Slots. Also all unlocked Freebies!\nTHE ALL-IN PLEDGE: includes one offering of every Hero, Encounter Pack, Creature, and Fleet unlocked during the campaign; including the limited editions of six Legacy Heroes, Candy and Cola, a Space Goblin Gang and Kickstarter Backer Only Seelah the Paladin.\n    Stretch Goals are items that unlock as the campaign reaches new heights. More options for heroes, encounter packs, creatures, and fleets will be revealed over time. There are three types of goals: Freebies, Optionals, and Social Media Stretch Goals.\nFreebies will be added to the Adventure Pledge and Campaign Pledge as soon as they unlock. Optionals will provide additional options to use on those Hero, Encounter Pack, Creature, and Fleet Slots.\nSocial Media Unlocks depend on the number of shares the following image receives on Paizo\u2019s Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/paizo/posts/10155550807787530\nHow the Starfinder Masterclass Miniatures Slot System Works\nTo offer the most customizable pledge rewards possible we have developed the Kickstarter Slot System. There are 4 kinds of Slots: Hero, Encounter Pack, Creature, and Fleet. The Adventure and Campaign pledges come not only with specific models but several types of Slots to customize the pledge. Every item option has a Slot type and cost. Additional Slots beyond those in the Adventure and Campaign Pledge can be purchased for the cost listed in the Additional Slots section. As the campaign progresses and more stretch goals are unlocked the type of Slot and cost of each unlocked model will be listed in the appropriate section.\nFreebie Stretch goals add one free model or upgrade to the pledge. Additional models of that unlocked Freebie may be purchased as listed in the appropriate section.\nHEROES: Each Hero represents an individual pulled from the varied Starfinder races, character classes, and themes. These heroes double as playable characters and non-player characters, providing numerous options for players and gamemasters alike!\nENCOUNTER PACK: Encounter Packs include a mix of creatures and hero-like characters that the heroes may encounter in their adventures. Each pack is designed to supply figures for a standard encounter. More ambitious adventurers may encounter larger groups so it never hurts to get multiples of each encounter pack!\nCREATURES: Dangerous creatures from the Alien Archive and Absalom Station are always an exciting, if not terrifying, part of any hero\u2019s adventure.\nFLEETS: Fleet Packs are a great addition to any campaign. These packs allow the epic space battles that are an integral part of Starfinder to be played out in style.\n  The Starfinder Roleplaying Game is a new science-fantasy RPG based on the Pathfinder universe and rules, but complete and standalone. It's backward compatible, so you can still use all those Pathfinder RPG bestiaries, but features all sorts of new classes, races, equipment, and other elements uniquely suited to our far-future setting.\nUsing a traditional grid map and minis, your heroes explore mysterious planets in the far reaches of the galaxy. You\u2019ll also take to the stars as your team pilots their very own starship on a hex-field map with minis! Will you play as a lashunta technomancer using magic to hack the defense grid, an android assassin with a laser rifle, or a ysoki ratfolk mechanic clambering around the guts of a spaceship as you blast your way through the enemy blockade?\nThis is the game that let\u2019s you be as creative as you want. There are new races you've never seen before, new worlds beyond Golarion's system that we've never visited, new twists on magic and the rules system itself\u2014and, of course, tons and tons of cool science fantasy gear, from starships and computers to infinitely sharp zero-edge swords and rune-augmented plasma cannons.\n  For more information on the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, including how to purchase copies of the books, please visit: http://paizo.com/starfinder\nAfter the close of the Kickstarter, backers will receive an invite to our webstore based pledge manager. Shipping will be charged based on the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you select.\nWe will ship your rewards from the closest of several fulfillment hubs around the world:\nUSA (US and South America backers)\nUnited Kingdom (UK, EU, and Rest of the World backers)\nCanada (Canada backers)\nChina (Asia Pacific backers)\nAustralia (Australia and New Zealand backers)\nBelow is the general schedule once the Kickstarter ends so you know when to expect money to be taken and our overall shipping plan.

Each wave will have a specific list of items that will be included in the shipment. The first wave will contain the base pledge models and several additional items. The second and third waves will comprise the rest of the available models. The purpose of the waves is to begin delivery of as many models as possible as early as possible. There are a huge number of sculpts in this Kickstarter. Rather than waiting until all models are sculpted, approved, and manufactured, we will begin fulfilling the first wave while the second wave is being finalized and so on. Once we have the data from the close of the Pledge Manager we will provide a full list of the first wave models. As we move through development and production of the rest of the models we will provide a list of what will be available in the second and third waves.\nBackers of this Kickstarter who pledge during the campaign will have their product shipped before people who pledge after the Kickstarter campaign closes.\nTo help minimize your shipping and customs costs, we will ship rewards to multiple international shipping hubs at our cost (US, EU, CN, and AU). These hubs ship all rewards to backers in their region. Depending on your region, this will help reduce or eliminate any additional import duties you will be required to pay.\nUnited States of America: Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $26.5 / All-in Pledge $35\nArgentina: Adventure $52.5 / Campaign $70 / All-in Pledge $112.5\nAustralia: Adventure $17 / Campaign $21 / All-in Pledge $27\nAustria: Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $22.5 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nBelgium: Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $22.5 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nBrazil: Adventure $52.5 / Campaign $70 / All-in Pledge $112.5\nCanada: Adventure $14.5 / Campaign $22 / All-in Pledge $44\nSwitzerland:Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $22.5 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nChile: Adventure $52.5 / Campaign $70 / All-in Pledge $112.5\nChina: Adventure $15 / Campaign $19 / All-in Pledge $25\nCosta Rica: Adventure $52.5 / Campaign $70 / All-in Pledge $112.5\nCzech Republic: Adventure $20.5 / Campaign $24.5 / All-in Pledge $28.5\nGermany: Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $22.5 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nDenmark: Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $21 / All-in Pledge $24.5\nSpain: Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $22.5 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nFinland: Adventure $27.5 / Campaign $32.5 / All-in Pledge $32.5\nFrance: Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $22.5 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nUnited Kingdom: Adventure $14 / Campaign $16.5 / All-in Pledge $18.5\nHong Kong, SAR China: Adventure $14 / Campaign $17 / All-in Pledge $22\nHungary: Adventure $20.5 / Campaign $24.5 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nIndonesia: Adventure $30.5 / Campaign $41.5 / All-in Pledge $75.5\nIreland: Adventure $15 / Campaign $17.5 / All-in Pledge $19.5\nIceland: Adventure $33.5 / Campaign $39.5 / All-in Pledge $39.5\nIsrael: Adventure $27.5 / Campaign $56 / All-in Pledge $87\nItaly: Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $22.5 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nJapan: Adventure $24 / Campaign $31 / All-in Pledge $50\nKorea (South): Adventure $20 / Campaign $26 / All-in Pledge $40\nLithuania: Adventure $20.5 / Campaign $23 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nLuxembourg: Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $22.5 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nLatvia: Adventure $33.5 / Campaign $39.5 / All-in Pledge $39.5\nMexico: Adventure $48.5 / Campaign $63 / All-in Pledge $93\nMalta: Adventure $22.5 / Campaign $51 / All-in Pledge $82\nNetherlands: Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $22.5 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nNorway: Adventure $28.5 / Campaign $34.5 / All-in Pledge $34.5\nNew Zealand: Adventure $20.5 / Campaign $30.5 / All-in Pledge $61\nPeru: Adventure $52.5 / Campaign $70 / All-in Pledge $112.5\nPhilippines: Adventure $22.5 / Campaign $29.5 / All-in Pledge $51\nPoland: Adventure $18.5 / Campaign $22.5 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nPortugal: Adventure $20.5 / Campaign $23 / All-in Pledge $26.5\nRomania: Adventure $33.5 / Campaign $39.5 / All-in Pledge $39.5\nRussian Federation: Adventure $33.5 / Campaign $39.5 / All-in Pledge $39.5\nSingapore: Adventure $19 / Campaign $25 / All-in Pledge $40\nSlovakia: Adventure $31.5 / Campaign $37.5 / All-in Pledge $37.5\nSweden: Adventure $28.5 / Campaign $34.5 / All-in Pledge $34.5\nThailand: Adventure $23 / Campaign $34 / All-in Pledge $66\nTaiwan, Republic of China: Adventure $15 / Campaign $20 / All-in Pledge $34\nUkraine: Adventure $28.5 / Campaign $34.5 / All-in Pledge $34.5\nRest of World: Adventure $36.5 / Campaign $67 / All-in Pledge $110\nPlease note that these are ESTIMATES ONLY and may change as we unlock more items, if you purchase additional rewards, or choose rewards spanning multiple shipping waves.\nPaizo Inc. is publisher of the award-winning Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Pathfinder Tales novels, Starfinder science-fantasy Roleplaying Game, as well as board games and accessories.\nIn August of 2017, Paizo released Starfinder, its science-fantasy roleplaying game.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "How Much Time Do You Spend Typing?\nIf you spend your work days in front of a computer, you have likely felt some discomfort after a long day of typing. While spending less time on our computers would be the ideal remedy for this problem, that is not a realistic solution for most people. X-Bows was designed to limit the stress on your hands and wrists while also providing a productive and stylish typing experience.\n The Normal Keyboard Works Fine. Why Redesign It?\nThe traditional staggered QWERTY layout was not designed to be comfortable. Its design comes directly from typewriters of the 1800s and very little about it has changed since then.\nThe traditional keyboard layout causes our wrists to flex inwards at an unnatural angle while we type. With over-exposure, this wrist angling very often leads to discomfort or injury. We designed the layout of X-Bows to conform to our natural wrist angle and arranged the keys in an ortho-linear fashion (fancy way to say straight line) because that better aligns with the natural extension plane of our fingers. The reason that typewriters originally popularized the staggered key layout was so that their levers wouldn't jam - not exactly a modern concern.\n Design\nX-Bows was designed with three criteria in mind:\nEnhancing the comfort and ergonomics of the keyboard\nLimiting the learning curve for our new layout\nCreating an attractive design\nEvery decision we made was to fulfill one of these criteria. Here\u2019s what we came up with:\nCross-Radial Design\nThe most noticeable and unique feature of X-Bows is certainly its key layout. The key columns are angled to promote a more natural angle for our wrists.\nMoving the ENTER, Backspace, SHIFT and ALT keys into the center of the keyboard achieves two things:\nFirst, it limits stress on the pinky, our weakest finger. The thumb is very underused on traditional keyboard layouts so repositioning these keys utilizes it without adding undue stress. \nSecond, it makes these keys much easier to reach. On traditional typewriters these keys didn\u2019t exist, had limited functionality, or had completely different functions. They were simply tacked onto the side of the keyboard. Making these keys easier to reach allows you to get more done when you\u2019re typing and reduces the need to move your whole hand to reach a key - one of the most fatiguing acts in typing.\nWe think it looks pretty cool too. \nLimited learning curve\nDo you remember when you were learning to type? It takes a lot of time and practice to develop the muscle memory in our fingers that allows us to type quickly and accurately.\nX-Bows is not the first ergonomic keyboard ever created. Plenty of people have identified that the keyboard layout that we use could be dramatically improved. The biggest impediment to these keyboards gaining broader acceptance is that they require users to learn a whole new layout. Busy people inevitably get frustrated and revert back to their old keyboard when they need to work faster. Despite best intentions, a lot of ergonomic keyboards end up in a drawer never to be used again.\nWith X-Bows, we were dedicated to making that learning curve as manageable as possible. The letter keys have not moved from their QWERTY layout. Your right index finger is still hitting \u201cJ\u201d and your left ring finger is still responsible for typing \u201cW\u201d. You don\u2019t need to memorize a new key layout, your hands already know where all of the letters are on X-Bows.\nThe keys that we did move- ENTER, Backspace, ALT and Control- can also be found on the right side of the keyboard. We call these our \u201ctraining wheel keys\u201d. While we think that the keys in the middle are more convenient, as you\u2019re beginning to type on X-Bows, it is no problem if you find yourself reaching for the backspace in the top-right. They are there while you adjust. Since X-Bows' keys are fully remappable, once you find yourself no longer needing these training wheel keys, you can program them to become shortcuts or macros; increasing your productivity even further!\nWhile you won\u2019t be able to take X-Bows out of the box and feel 100% comfortable typing on it immediately. Our testers have all reported adjusting to the new layout in under a week, some in as little as two days. Compared to other ergonomic boards that can take a month or more to adjust to, X-Bows makes ergonomic typing more accessible than ever before.\n  Johnny, a developer in San Francisco was one of our first Facebook fans. We sent him a pre-production X-Bows and he reported being comfortable with the new layout in under a week\nStylish\nWe didn\u2019t want X-Bows to look like something that your doctor prescribed to you. We didn\u2019t want it to look completely alien to the rest of your desk set-up. We designed X-Bows to have a minimalist aesthetic and a manageable profile. You can easily carry X-Bows with you for a day of work on your laptop outside of the office.\n      Our design has already caught the attention of some media:\n  Want to write about X-Bows? You can find media resources here\nBuild Quality\nYou can have a great design, but it can\u2019t help anyone if the product is not well built. We carefully selected all of the materials used to construct X-Bows in order to optimize durability and comfort.\n Mechanical Switches\nGateron is a relative newcomer to the mechanical switch game. Expert reviews of Gateron switches are overwhelmingly positive. The switches have an estimated lifetime of 50 million clicks- the highest on the market.\nWith X-Bows you have the option of 4 different switch types ranging from loud and clicky to quiet and linear.\nGateron Red switches are quiet with a linear feel and a 45gf actuation force.\nGateron Blue switches have a tactile and auditory click when you press them (you can hear it in our video). 55gf actuation force.\nGateron Black switches are linear, like the reds. They require a slightly heavier actuation force at 50 gf.\nGateron Brown switches offer a tactile bump when pressed but don't have the auditory click that blues have. They require a 45 gf actuation force.\nNew- Gateron Green switches- The Gateron Greens (my personal favourite) are a heavy, clicky switch. They are comparable to the Blues but with a higher actuation force of 80gf.\nNew- Gateron Clear switches- The Gateron Clears are a very light lienar switch. Similar to the Gateron Reds or Blacks, only the Clears have a lower actuation force of 35gf.\nNew- Gateron Silent Red Switches- A brand new switch, released just a few months ago. These are among the most silent mechanical switches on the market. They sound almost the same as typing on a laptop keyboard. They are a linear switch, requiring 45gf actuation force, just like the ordinary reds. To add the Gateron Silent Red Switches to your order, please add CA$20 ($17 USD) to your pledge.\nBody Construction\nThe interior of X-Bows features an aluminum alloy plate to prevent board flex and makes for a very solid feel while typing. The bottom of the keyboard is ABS plastic with 5 rubber pads to ensure that the board won't move around while you're typing. X-Bows weighs ~0.8kg. \nKeycaps\nX-Bows uses ABS+PC two colour injection molding keycaps. In plain terms: they're nice, durable keycaps and the letters will never fade from them. \nUSB Cable\nX-Bows connects by a USB type C port. We will include a 150cm (just under 5 feet) long USB-C --> regular USB cord in the box.\nRGB Backlighting\nRGB backlighting is a controversial issue in the keyboarding community. Often, subpar boards try to make up for their deficiencies with a lot of bright, flashing lights. For this reason we don\u2019t want to spend too much time on our lighting effects, but c\u2019mon, these are pretty fun.\nPLAY\n\nX-Bows' start-up lighting sequence.\nX-Bows has 15 lighting movement effects with controllable brightness, speed, direction and colour. Of course, you can also turn them off.\nPLAY\n\nUsing our software, you can also set individual keys to be lit in a designated colour. This is ideal for people who want to highlight their shortcut keys or those who like a creative, personalized lighting scheme.\nAn example of custom lighting on one of our older prototype boards.\nFeatures\nSoftware\nX-Bows has downloadable software for you to program the keyboard to your own specifications. You can rearrange the layout of the keys (DVORAK anyone?), set a key to become a shortcut (quick access to your inbox for example), or set a macro - one key to serve the function of a key combination (for example, if you\u2019re mistake prone, you can set the pgdown button to become control+z). You can also set specific keys to have designated lighting - gamers might like a glow under WASD (though, we've found that ESDF works best for gaming on X-Bows) or designers might want to highlight their most frequently used shortcuts.  \nAt the moment, X-Bows' software is compatible with WIndows. We are currently working on capatability with Mac and Linux and anticipate it being complete before the end of the campaign. \nA look at the X-Bows software. The interface may change before we ship.\nAnti-Ghosting\n\u201cGhosted keys\u201d occur when several keys (usually 6 or more) are pressed at the same time and one or more strokes is lost because of the abundance of information going to the computer. Most people will never need to press 6 keys all at once, but for those that do, losing one or more of those key strokes is a major problem. X-Bows is 100% anti-ghosting in order to accommodate any key combination that you could possibly throw at it.\nAdd-Ons\nIt has been great to hear from everyone who reached out to us in the run up to our Kickstarter campaign. We have received some really useful feedback and ideas. \nWe are always open to more ideas. If there's another feature or add-on that you would like to see included in our campaign, please mention it to us in our backer comments or social media.\nMac Keycaps\nDue to overwhelming demand, we will be including the option for Mac keycaps. We have reached out to some keycap producers and Mac keycaps are no problem to produce. We will include this as a free option in our backer survey.\nApple Layout with Numpad\n  Blank Keycaps\nSome keyboard enthusiasts have reached out to us asking for a blank keycap option, with a dot to let the backlighting through. We're happy to oblige. This will also be a free option on the backer survey.\nNEW- Regional Layout Keycaps\nWe will be offering UK, German and Nordic as regional layouts. We apologize to those of you who require other regional layouts as we just don't have enough demand to create the molds for them yet. After our campaign is finished, we will be able to offer additional regional layout keycaps on our web store with a significant discount to our Kickstarter backers. \nUK Layout\n  German Layout\n  Nordic Layout\n Wrist Rest\nHow can an ergonomic keyboard not have a wrist rest? We heard you on social media and we completely agree. We have contacted manufacturers and will be creating the design pictured below. If you would like to include the wrist rest with your X-Bows, please add CA$30 ($25 USD) to your pledge.\nThe rest is made from alcantarra and ABS plastic. It feels solid while also being soft. \n    Numpad- New!\nThis is a *GRAPHIC RENDERING*. We will release real photos of the numpad as soon as we can\n**Important edit- The numpad can connect wirelessly through a magnetic transmitter to the main X-Bows keyboard. As the connection is magnetic, the numpad should be in close proximity to the keyboard when working wirelessly.  \n**Important Clarification- X-Bows purchased with the numpad will come with two magnetic connecter transmitters built into them (one on each side). This makes wireless compatability with the numpad possible. X-Bows purchased without the numpad will not have the magnetic connector transmitters. \nOur new numpad will be fully programmable and backlit, just like X-Bows. It is standalone and can work on the right or left side of X-Bows, as the connection is magnetic, the numpad should be closely positioned to the keyboard itself. There is also another USB-C connection on the numpad if you would like to use it separate from X-Bows. The numpad's backlighting effects are synchronized with those of X-Bows.\nA sketch of X-Bows with our new numpad\nThe numpad will connect to X-Bows via a wireless magnetic transmitter or by a separate USB-C cable. If you use the magnetic transmitter, it will not require the use of a second USB slot on your computer.\nThis is a *GRAPHIC RENDERING* of the numpad's wireless magnetic transmitter\nThe numpad will be available for an additional pledge of CA$60 (~$50 USD). If you would like the numpad, you can make an adjustment to your existing pledge and then check off numpad on the backer survey at the end of the campaign.\nStretch Goals- Updated!\nWe have unlocked the silver X-Bows colourway! It will be an available option on the backer survey.\nThe standalone numpad has been unlocked! Please see above for details.\nWe've unlocked a free X-Bows carrying case with all orders.\nOur Story\nX-Bows founder, Dr. Sigo Wang, is a medical doctor, specialized in medical imaging. In his practice, Dr. Wang was seeing a similar injury over and over again. Office workers, writers, and programmers were repeatedly coming to him complaining of pain, weakness and fatigue in their hands, wrists, forearms and shoulders. These are the easily identifiable symptoms of RSI- repetitive strain injury, caused by stress on joints from typing for prolonged hours on a standard keyboard. Dr. Wang sought to find a preventative solution for his patients. \nOver many months of determining the medical strengths and weaknesses of other ergonomic keyboards both past and present, Dr. Wang began to form his own opinion about the ideal design for a computer keyboard. The problem with ordinary keyboards was obvious to Dr. Wang - they weren\u2019t designed to conform to the natural structure of people\u2019s hands. The problem with the ergonomic keyboards currently on the market was simply that people were not using them. Dr. Wang recognized that the main deterrent of most ergonomic keyboards was the steep learning curve; most workers did not have the free time to spend weeks or months learning how to type on a new, often radically different keyboard layout. \nRaising money on Kickstarter will allow us to manufacture at the scale required to produce X-Bows at a reasonable cost. Our design is finalized and our prototype units are fully functional and have been successfully produced at a small scale. Now, we just need a kickstart to scale up our production.\nX-Bows' Team\nThanks: Ryan, Lucy, Johnny, Esther, Andrew and everyone else who contributed their incredibly valuable feedback, expertise and opinions to this project!

Each mage will represent a school of magic, summoning powerful monsters to the battlefield. Pitting their fearsome creatures in gladiatorial battle, one mage will reign victorious, ascending to the title of Archmage.  \nDo you have the strength and strategy to defeat your enemies? Will you become the Archmage?    \n    PLAY\n\nDawn of the Archmage continues the rich fantasy world of Archmage Origins. Once the rulers of Sorcado, mages have fallen from power. Challengers arrive from every corner of the land. Knighted Paladins, land-hungry Lords... all seek to dethrone the mages. But mages don't go down easily. It's time to fight back!   \nEach mage uses summoning powers to bring new and dangerous creatures to the battlefield. Expending massive mystical energy, their battle grows in frenetic power as monstrous beasts fight for the mages who control them, seeking to destroy all challengers in a magic-fueled frenzy. \nMages of Sorcado\nUltimate power hangs in the balance as ferocious monsters shake the earth with battle-lust.\nIn addition to summoning fearsome creatures to fight, mages posses a selection of powerful spells. With a single word, the battle can shift. Manipulating odds, controlling movement, and countering rival's spells, the mage's strategy will determine the supreme ruler of Sorcado. \nThe battle rages everywhere. Modular map tiles allow the mages to customize the battle area. Large, sprawling battlefields or close, confined ones... the fight is different every time. Will it be the Arena? The Forest? The Ruins? Or even Underground?\n  Please be aware that this is a Work In Progress. All is not final. Art and sculptures may still be slightly altered.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Stretch Goal we are currently working towards:\n\nHere's what you currently will get for backing \"Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay\":\n   We also have a Retailer Pledge available! This is what you get with it:\n          The game will feature beautifully sculpted miniatures by industry veteran and highly talented sculptor, Patrick Keith!\n   Here's everything you can add-on to your pledge! After the Kickstarter Campaign is complete, we will send out our Pledge Manager. You will be able to choose which add-ons you want, and the credit from your pledge will be applied. More to come based on overall funding!\n     Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay is a campaign based co-op dungeon crawler where the players take on the role of heroes from the Wanderer's Guild. They must work together to infiltrate the once peaceful village of Barnacle Bay and put an end to Elder Bane and his Cult of the Deep! Throughout the campaign, players will choose branching scenarios that each provide their own challenges. Its up to our heroes to navigate these scenarios by choosing a set of unique abilities tailored to their own strengths. They acquire these abilities by defeating enemies during a scenario, but dont get too carried away! If you do, you are liable to summon more of Elder Bane's cultists who will try and stop you by any means.\nThe Heroes of the Wanderers Guild!\nHere are the models of the heroes that are included in the base game:\n Players will work together to defeat many enemies and challenges pitted against them throughout the campaign. There is no need for a dungeon-master however, since the enemies will follow a simple set of rules based on line of sight and engagement with the heroes. Different enemies will have special abilities, so make sure to pick your targets carefully!\nThroughout the campaign, Heroes will have to tackle different scenarios with different winning conditions. Some will need the heroes to simply make it to the end, others will make you race against an enemy to save the town from being flooded, another might make you face off against a horrendous Megalopotomus! You will also encounter unique boss fight scenarios, pitting your Heroes against the nefarious Elder Bane! Depending on which path you take during the campaign, you will also unlocked special Relics, which gives heroes unique advantages over your enemies.\n  For any of you who are interested a sneak peak at beta stage of our Rulebook, you can find it at the link below:\n**Note: The Rulebook is missing graphics and detailed diagrams, we are actively working on it.**\nhttp://pandacultgames.com/wp-content/uploads/Wander-Book.092717.pdf\nBelow is a video detailing how Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay plays! This is the intro mission to the game. If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask!\n The game also features Boss Scenarios that play very different than the main scenarios. Here is a video of the Level 1 Elder Bane boss fight.\nThe very talented Lance Hinkel from Learn 2 Play Games got a chance to give his review of the game and run through some of the core mechanics with a early prototype of the core game.\nLance Hinkel made another video showing a \"create your own\" kind of scenario. This video is great at showing how you can create your own scenarios at ease and also shows the mechanics of the game very well.! Thanks Lance!\n\nIf you are wondering how people felt about our game, check out these testimonials from our fans at Origins 2017!\n You can also watch us on the episode of Man Vs Meeple!\n \nA few months ago, we had the chance to show the gang of D&E Miniatures and Board Games a demo of the board game. They were kind enough to record a review of what we were able to show them.\n  Throughout this campaign, depending on if we break through our base goal, we will be unlocking Stretch Goals! These stretch goals include additional hero minis that are playable in the game, extra item and event cards, and potentially an expansion to the game if we get enough funding!\n\nAlso note, anything marked with this graphic:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter Backers only. Any excess stock will be available through conventions and special promotions only.\nHere's the map of our current stretch goal progress:\n Current models that have been unlocked:\n                           \nNext stretch goals:\n    THIS PROJECT IS NOW CANADA FRIENDLY AS WELL!!!\nWe will be charging for shipping after the Kickstarter ends during the pledge management phase. This is the best option we could find, since shipping to backers changes based on their location and what they have ordered. We cannot ship these packages to PO boxes domestically or internationally, due to their size and the high chance of being bounced back to us.\nWe are going to be utilizing Ship Naked, which have handled fulfillment for many other Kickstarter campaigns and have international hubs at key locations. We will absorb the freight costs to get our products to these international hubs. This means that all shipping is closer and overall cheaper for Backers!\n\nShipping Quotes\nFor all of you backers who have been so patient with us for these quotes, we do sincerely appreciate it! The only delay on our end was wanting to make sure the quote was accurate and that we could confirm a few things, like how we can now offer CANADA FRIENDLY SHIPPING!\nThese estimates include 2 sections that cover shipping for both BACKERS and RETAILERS.\n**NOTE: These are estimates based off our base \"Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay\" box size and weight. Depending on if we hit more stretch goals and add more to the base pledge, these numbers can potentially increase.**\nEstimated Backer Shipping costs:\nUS to US: $15-18\nCAN to CAN: $16-19 (includes import duty)\nGermany to Germany: $12-15 (includes import duty)\nGermany to EU: $20-23 (includes import duty)\nGermany to Non EU: $22-25 (includes import duty - backers may still pay duty for import outside the EU)\nGermany to Rest of World: $38-41 (includes import duty - backers may still pay duty for import outside the EU)\nAU to AU: $17-20 (includes import duty)\nAU to NZ: $33-36 (includes import duty)\nChina to Asia: $24-27 (includes import duty)\nEstimated Retailer shipping costs: (This is for one master carton that contains 4 copies of Wander:\u201dThe Cult of Barnacle Bay)\nUS to US: $32-35\nCAN to CAN: $35-38 (includes import duty)\nGermany to Germany: $28-31 (includes import duty)\nGermany to EU: $40-43 (includes import duty)\nGermany to Non EU: $45-48 (includes import duty - backers may still pay duty for import outside the EU)\nGermany to Rest of World: $73-76 (includes import duty - backers may still pay duty for import outside the EU)\nAU to AU: $45-48 (includes import duty)\nAU to NZ: $77-80 (includes import duty) China to Asia: $65-68 (includes import duty)\n    Once the Kickstarter campaign is complete, we will be working around the clock to deliver what we've promised in a timely manner. Depending on the campaigns success, this timeline for production may shift. Below is a rough estimate of what we expect from our production schedule:\nEnd of Campaign (Oct. 5th, 2017) - Pledges are charged\n(Nov.-Dec., 2017) - Send out Crowd Ox pledge manager, confirm optional buys and pay for shipping/extras.\n(Dec. 2017, Jan. 2018) - Send out assets to manufacturer for production.\n(June-July, 2018) - Production finishes, starts shipping to international hubs.\n(July-August, 2018) - Start shipping product to Backers.\nAs a reminder, this is only a rough estimate. There are many factors which could change this timeline, including production quality checks, shipping issues, etc.\nWe will be working with the awesome guys at Crowd Ox for all pledge management needs for the campaign. www.crowdox.com\n    Heath Foley, Jonathan Phillips-Bradford, and Elizabeth Beckley\nHeath Foley - Co-Owner and Art Director - Heath has been working in the tabletop gaming industry as a professional freelance illustrator and concept artist for 6+ years.

This includes time spent balancing out which manufacturer to use to guarantee quality board game assets, time spent hunting down and securing the best shipping partner for our needs, and utilizing numerous industry contacts for professional advice and input.\n\nOur game is going to be manufactured in China, which introduces us to a few vague details as far as scheduling goes, such as Production Delays, Shipping Delays, and Customs Delays. This means our estimated delivery date of September 2018 is just that, an estimate.\n\nWe will do our best to minimize any issues that would cause delays and we will be open and honest about any problems that come up.

To navigate through the Death Path, Subjects will reveal cards at the same time. Much of the Death Path consist of Clear Path cards but occasionally you will run into a choice with multiple options. This will cause your deck to split in hopes of finding a quicker path to the end.\nNavigate the Death Path by revealing cards!\nYou may also encounter Pathfinders, crude government-controlled robots trying to slow your progress. There are weapons.... and you'll need them!\nEach time you reveal a Stash card from your Maze Deck, you will draw and Item Card and have the option to equip it.\nEach weapon you find will have a custom die associated with it. D8's for one-handed weapons and D12's for two-handed weapons. These are truly unique dice and not numbered traditionally. The number on each side indicates the amount of damage inflicted if you hit. Some weapons, like the volatile Fusion Staff, have higher and lower damage results representing more risk/reward while others like the trusty Power Nux are more consistent with the damage they inflict.\nIf you encounter another Subject, you will be forced to fight them by an unscrupulous Death Path Bailiff in a 3 round bout (cue the fighting video game clip....\"Round 1...FIGHT!\"). If you win the fight, you will get a head start to finishing the Death Path while your opponent is licking their wounds and falling behind.\nThe first Subject to finish revealing all the cards in their Maze Deck is the winner. If any Subject loses all their Health tokens, they are dead and out of the game. In a two player game, this means their opponent wins. When playing with 3 or more players, the others keep navigating through the Death Path until there is a winner!\nA 2 player game takes approximately 20min to play, while adding additional players can increase that to 30-40min.\nTake a look at the rules PDF here. (May have some minor changes before production)\nThere are expansions planned for additional Subjects,  solo play and playable bad guys too!\nCheck out the pledge levels for details how to get your own create-a-character in the game!\nHow about a gameplay video?\nThanks to JP's wife, Heather, for the support, playtesting and of course losing gracefully in this gameplay video! \n Note: Final art and design may be changed slightly before production.\nNote: Prices do NOT include shipping. Shipping will be charged later based on actual shipping prices when production is near completion.\nAt the base $29 pledge level, you get the complete 2 player game in this Kickstarter. You also get all applicable FREE stretch goals unlocked during the campaign and access to buy any add-on stretch goals we unlock.\nThis 2 player set consists of Subjects, Mizzy Pazzone and Zo Joxxer.\nYou get a large-sized Subject card detailing their background and special rules along with 3 Attack and Defense D6 dice for each of these two characters.\nNote: Every Subject produced for Death Path will have custom Attack and Defense dice based on their character class to showcase their specific fighting style.\nYou also get 2 full Maze Decks consisting of 109 cards. They include the various sections of the maze you will be revealing while you make your way through the Death Path.\nYou get 1 Item Deck with 16 Item Cards. These includes weapons, shields, health stims.... and traps!\nYou get 9 custom Weapon Dice which represent the damage inflicted with each of the various weapons your Subject can use. As mentioned above, the numbers on each Weapon dice are different and non-sequential, based on each type of weapon.\n50+ Social Shares - Metal Coin\nKickstarter Exclusive Death Path Metal Coin Unlocked - FREE to all backers $29 and above!\n100+ Backers - New Item\nKickstarter Exclusive Neutralizer Gun Item Card - FREE to all backers $29 and above!\n$10,500 - New Subject\nKickstarter Exclusive Subject entering the Death Path, former Government Operative, Agent J - FREE to all backers $29 and above!\n$11,000 - New Subject\nKickstarter Exclusive Subject entering the Death Path, Exterminator by day, Hitman by night, Bryx Chel - FREE to all backers $29 and above!\n$12,000 - New Item & Weapon Die\nA weapon that could not only inflict damage but also disarm your opponent?

Find out when we get close to $13,000 funded!\nCHARACTER PACK 1\nMore characters means more fun!\nWhile the Death Path core game comes with an Athlete class (Zo Joxxer) and a Master class (Mizzy Pazzone), you can add $20 to your pledge for Character Pack 1 and round out the other classes in the game.\n(From Left to Right) Del Zhing is a mercenary, looking for the highest bidder. What does the Government want with him? He falls under the Militant class. Rozi Rondi comes from a long line of underground street fighters and can be more deadly without any weapons! She represents the Brawler class while convict, Chuck Janson, is clearly the Ruffian in this group of misfits. He bites. No joke, he does. Last but certainly not least is the Beefy class Subject, Dyna Moto. She's as intimidating as she looks and can even quickly dispose of Pathfinders with her Shock Treatment ability.\nYour games of Death Path will be that much more interesting with 4 new characters in the mix, and each of them coming with 4 new sets of custom and colored Attack and Defense dice. \nAdd on Character Pack 1 for just $20 now!\nITEM PACK 1  \nThe base game comes with Power Nux, Energy Gloves, Stun Blades, and a Fusion Staff as weapons. Plus Heath Stims, Traps, and Combat Shields as other items.\nRemember, every weapon in the game has both an Item Card and a corresponding custom Weapon die. More weapons means more Death in Death Path!\nLet's make some more weapons and other items available, shall we?\nAdd $15 to your pledge to get Item Pack 1 consisting of 2 Fire Daggers (with 2 orange custom D8's), 2 Life Stims, 1 bad ass shield that negates Pathfinder damage, and oh I dunno.... possibly a Magic Zlurpee item that has some pretty amazing effects when consumed.\nPlus one more item that we don't have clearance by The Government to discuss just yet!\nDid we forget to mention that the Fire Daggers may actually hurt the Subject wielding them? Worth it.\nArt concepts still being worked on!\nPlease excuse the terrible image above. No art yet for most of these new items, but rest assured these new Items will add even more mayhem to your games of Death Path! \nDEATH PATH PLAYMAT\nThe people asked us at Gencon for a playmat. Who are we to stand in the way of progress? \nEach Death Path playmat is designed for 2 players sitting across from one another. If you intend to play Death Path with 3-4 players, you should get two mats and place them side-by-side -- or 3 mats for 5-6 players, etc.\nIncrease your pledge amount by $25 for each playmat you want to add on!\nThis 2' x 2' mousepad style playmat is created by Maelstrom Gaming Mats. Unlike some other mousepad mats, this one also includes stitching on the edges to lay flat. \n Check out more of their work here!\n\"I seriously dig the concept!

We discuss the overall gameplay and future plans for the game!\nIn the not too distant future of 2100, the United States has gone from democracy to dictatorship to full police state. In 2088, they passed the ironically titled, Freedom Directive, which gave The Government the complete and unopposed authority to do as they please in the name of \u201csafety for all citizens\u201d. Rights were s tripped from Citizens to make the masses feel at ease whether they approved or not. The Government has now assumed power and control over all of North, Central, and South America.\nThis is only the beginning. By 2150, total world domination is planned, but it will take soldiers.\nThe only \u201crecreational\u201d activity the Government allows is called the Death Path. The Death Path takes the entertainment and brutality of a gladiatorial fighting pit and combines it with a violent and complex maze. Citizens watch the action unfold live on their holo-terminals while chosen Subjects enter the Death Path, ready to battle for their survival.\nAs a Subject, you will be navigating through the Death Path and will most likely encounter one or more other Subjects in the same situation as you. The Government will force you to fight them. The two ways a Fight will end is after 3 rounds, or someone dies. Pretty simple rules for a sadistic human bloodsport like this. You may also injure another Subject long enough for you to take the lead and reach the end of the Death Path first, ensuring your survival.\nSubjects will also encounter Pathfinders, Government-controlled robots on a mission. They are there to put these Subjects through even more rigorous testing \u2014 and more brutal entertainment of course. During their journey through the Death Path, Subjects will have many options within the maze presenting multiple routes. The right one will be a Hidden Path and lead directly to the end of the maze. The wrong one, well, let\u2019s just hope you don\u2019t run into a Path End and have to r retrace your steps.\nWhat is the end result of the Death Path? The winning Subject get to live. And the Government gets a new recruit for their impending war for control of the world. Win-win?\nJonathan Peletis - Lead Designer of Death Path. You may know him as JP, Jonny P, or Main Guy from the tabletop games podcast, Zlurpcast. Before creating Death Path, JP was involved with the rules committee and worked directly with game designer Jake Thornton to assist with the rules for the sci-fi skirmish game, Deadzone by Mantic Games. He also published a variant of that game using walkers, called Mechzone.\nBryan \"Xtreme\" Mitchell - Assistant Designer of Death Path. You may know him as Other Guy from Zlurpcast but he's also the co-founder of Zlurpcast Studios with Jonny P. Well-known in the world of Blood Bowl as the organizer of one of the largest tournaments in North America, Zlurpee Bowl, Bryan has some top secret projects in the works and also does commission painting services as X-Painting.\nJonny P and Xtreme of Zlurpcast Studios\nSince us two knuckleheads can't do it alone, we have enlisted the expertise of Scott Delsigne as the Lead Artist on the project. Rounding out the team is Brock Huffman and Geoff Burbidge assisting with many of the game's Graphic Design concepts. \nProps to Bryce Walter for the awesome video and Eric Dieter for the pipes inside that video! \nPlease do not add any shipping fees to your pledge.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes and will be based on actual costs incurred to ship the games and/or add-ons. \nHere are some cost estimates, but please understand it's just an estimate to help you budget.

It's a shared universe that spans four interesting worlds, created by MidKnight Heroes. Each world has its own style and flare but is 100% pure Chibi. The Super Chibi worlds have everything from mecha and cyborgs to monsters and fantasy. \nSuper Chibi are HQ 30mm multi-part resin miniatures they can be used for board games, role-playing games or simply collector's pieces. The sky is the limit!\nThe Super Chibi Round 3 Kickstarter introduces three more characters from the worlds in the Super Chibi universe. These characters are from the world of Super Chibi Sector 7 and Super Chibi Tacticts, and can be used in any board game or Role Playing Game. In this Kickstarter, we are asking for help in creating these three new characters; Shin, Absolute Valentine and Deyanni. This Kickstarter will cover the expense of taking them from their mastered sculpts to the mold and casting process and help in providing us with funds to help produce additional figures, with an aim to populate the worlds of Super Chibi.\nJust like in all our Kickstarter's we will be including a book in Super Chibi Round 3, Super Chibi Origins. This time, it will tell the stories of our three main characters in their respective worlds.The book will include two short stories that will explain the world of Super Chibi Sector 7 and Super Chibi Tactics.  Just like all of our books, it will be published by MONOLITH and after the Kickstarter will be sold on their site. \nCORE FUNDING: $900, Funded!\nStretch Goal #1: MidKnight Bust, UNLOCKED!\nStretch Goal #2 : Nona, In progress\nCore Characters: Shin, Absolute Valentine, and Deyanni\n      Stretch Goals:\nOnce Super Chibi Round 3 is funded stretch goals will unlock introducing new characters and figures all included in your pledge.\n Time to start working on our stretch goals. First up we have our first ever bust. This bust is of MidKnight our company avatar and its based off her new design. She will be 60mm in scale and cast in resin. She will come in multiple parts and be the biggest miniature we have done to date. Below is her concept art for the Bust. If we unlock this stretch goal we will begin sculpting immediately.\n Bust concept art.\n      Shipping: \nWe will charge shipping after the Kickstarter, based on the actual costs and weight. This will be collected after the campaign ends via our pledge manager. \nIMPORTANT: DO NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO COVER YOUR POSTAGE PAYMENT IN YOUR PLEDGE AT THIS TIME. \nAny funds collected through the KS system are reduced by 10% when Kickstarter collects their fees; this means that any funds collected to cover postage are 10% less than what is actually needed to cover postage, if the postage rates do not increase at the time of billing and shipping (postal rates have increased on us during our projects at least once prior to fulfillment; in one case, the rates increased twice). \nAfter the campaign ends, backers will be able to select their rewards, via the pledge manager. Shipping costs will be calculated at that time. You will also be able to select additional reward options at that time if you wish. \nPostage will be calculated by region when backers make their choices via our pledge management system. All postage fees must be paid before shipment can be completed. Rewards will be posted from the United States to all backer's addresses.\nPostage ESTIMATES by region: (please note these are estimates only; your actual shipping charge may be higher or lower depending on the rates at the time of shipping). \nUS $4.00 - $15.00 (1st Class or Priority Mail) \nCAN / UK / EU $15.00 - $25.00 \nAU / NZ / ROW $15 - $30. \nMidKnight Heroes is not responsible for any customs duties, taxes or fees incurred as a result. \nUS rewards may be shipped via either USPS 1st Class or USPS Priority mail. All International Mail is shipped USPS 1st Class International mail. \n***Note: We have seen with our last set that it can be stuck in customs for a while.

This is the same team that first started working on the project over two years ago and has done most of the work to bring it to you. We realized early in the project that our greatest challenge in bringing our vision to life, would be finding a great sculptor. We have done our research and found the best sculptor for the job. His name, Heriberto Valle Martinez.\n\nA big part of this Kickstarter is to gain the funding to pay for the overall production of the miniatures. We have thoroughly researched the costs associated with sculpting, molding, production, and shipping of the core set of miniatures. We are confident that we have considered all of the costs that will be associated with this project.\n\nOur biggest challenge will be the time needed to sculpt and produce the miniatures. As the sculptors have to most of the stretch goal work after the project funds, the time-frame following the Kickstarter may be longer than we initially wanted. Please bear with us, these miniatures will be awesome and well worth the wait. We will keep you informed with regular updates on the progress of the project. We're not going to be idle while the sculptors are doing their work, however.

Each mage will represent a school of magic, summoning powerful monsters to the battlefield. Pitting their fearsome creatures in gladiatorial battle, one mage will reign victorious, ascending to the title of Archmage.\nDo you have the strength and strategy to defeat your enemies?  Will you become the Archmage?     \n   Undead Viking - \"It is highly enjoyable.\"\n \nDawn of the Archmage continues the rich fantasy world of Archmage Origins. Once the rulers of Sorcado, mages have fallen from power. Challengers arrive from every corner of the land. Knighted Paladins, land-hungry Lords... all seek to dethrone the mages. But mages don't go down easily. It's time to fight back!\nEach mage uses summoning powers to bring new and dangerous creatures to the battlefield. Expending massive mystical energy, their battle grows in frenetic power as monstrous beasts fight for the mages who control them, seeking to destroy all challengers in a magic-fueled frenzy.\nUltimate power hangs in the balance as ferocious monsters shake the earth with battle-lust.\nIn addition to summoning fearsome creatures to fight, mages posses a selection of powerful spells. With a single word, the battle can shift. Manipulating odds, controlling movement, and countering rival's spells, the mage's strategy will determine the supreme ruler of Sorcado.  \n        Painted Examples - Minis Come UNPAINTED (mix of base and stretch)\n  The battle rages everywhere. Modular map tiles allow the mages to customize the battle area. Large, sprawling battlefields or close, confined ones... the fight is different every time. Will it be the Arena? The Forest? The Ruins? Or even Underground?\nPLAY\n\n PREVIEW RULE BOOK:\n  Click to Read\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress. It is not final.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Sacred Sword is the world that our chibi miniature line belongs to. While the game and the world are not present in this project, it dictates our overall theme and feel. The Sacred Sword line will be a high fantasy world, with a distinctly classic RPG feel. Modeled heavily after your favorite classic JRPG games but with a lot of added character and flair. We hope to provide a compelling universe for both your favorite RPG engine or other games that you want to use these for.\nThe Sacred Sword miniature line is a Chibi 32mm miniature line. These are cast in spincast resin and unpainted.\nWe've teamed up with the great crew at Impact Miniatures to produce the best figures at an excellent price and to utilize their vast experience and improve our project as much as possible! I've had a look at a lot of their newest figures and the casting and such are tops! We'll be carefully working with them to ensure every figure is cut well and casts as cleanly as possible.\n In the distant past, the Goddess Lein blessed the world of Edoss with a plethora of creatures all imbued with magic.\nThere was much time that these lived in peace, however, as with all things, times change, the peoples became fearful of one and another, and banded together against those they feared. Wars were raged, and the world was unbalanced, Lien\u2019s power was drained by those who worshiped her and they used her as a tool of destruction. Eventually the world settled, but the balance of the world had broken. Uneven, some of the races became hateful, some even meddled in the lost magics, that which Lien had attempted to banish from her proud world. In a last effort to save her world, she appointed a Sacred Sword to the people of the Dark, those who had fallen most out of balance, her hope that this power would allow the world to band together under its power. She was sorely mistaken. They used the sword to massacre many of those who had once oppressed them. So in a great act of destruction, she swallowed the sword and most of the Maldrazi people. Tired of the petty wars of her children, she slumbered, resting from the weary wars.\nTimes have since passed, and most of the world has long forgotten of Lien, calling her little more than a myth, those who still follow her ways are scattered. Now a new threat arises, great rifts of pure magic have opened across the world. As the rifts grow wider, monsters and wild magics pour through unfettered, now is the time for heroes once more. Is it too late to save Edoss? Or can the heroes band together to find the Sacred Sword to save their world?\nYour funding provides AdventureCraft the needed capital to finish more concept art, sculpting and then casting of an entirely new range of miniatures. We're starting small, with just a few figures. As we reach more funding goals, we'll add new models from you to pick from. And step by step, your feedback and requests will be heard and implemented to create a colorful world. We've already got the first two sculpts finished and ready to go!

Once all the Mage Cards are in place, players compare the power value of the magical energies that intersects at each monster. The player with the higher total mystical power value gains control of that monster (usually). The player who collects the most powerful force of monsters wins.    \n                                               Click to see Larger Version\n              \"I can say Dave has worked his light game creation magic again\" - Tony (Click to Read)\n        Click to Read\n                   We like to support game stores around the world by offering special pricing of the game to retailers during the campaign.

For backers in the United States, this covers all shipping costs.  \nFor backers in other countries, we apply the same $2.00 credit to all international orders to help and support our backers. We bulk ship our international orders to the UK for fulfillment from the UK. This is done to reduce the shipping costs around the world and prevent VAT costs for EU backers. This makes the international shipping as backer friendly as possible.  \nThis allows us to ship a single copy of the game internationally for just an additional $3.00 USD.

More than anything, we thrive on interacting with our listeners and fans. This is the true purpose of AcadeCon. In addition to playing games with friends, both old and new, AcadeCon offers almost unprecedented access to some amazing RPG designers, authors, and some of your favorite podcasting personalities. At AcadeCon, these people are there to have fun and play games, just like you. Join into one of their events and don\u2019t be surprised if they join into one of yours!\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced that AcadeCon is the place for you, please consider our motto: If you're having fun, you're doing it right!\nIf that sounds like something you\u2019d like to support, please buy a badge and come game with us if you can. If not, a donation goes a long way.\nThank you for checking out our Kickstarter and we hope to see you in November!\nWhat's AcadeCon all about?\nAcadeCon is specifically designed to be a smaller, non-traditional convention. We are not trying to (nor do we want to) compete with or replace the huge conventions that attract a national audience. At our convention, you're going to get access to 24-hour gaming hall, a better chance to play in the games you want, the opportunity to spend time and game with special guests, and time to hang out with some of the best gamers in the world\u2014the fans of our show!\nTables of Gamers, AcadeCon 2016\nWhether you are one of our listeners, are interested in meeting and playing with some of our special guests, or just found us by accident, we hope you'll consider attending our convention or simply donating to the cause.\nWhat a picture. Rich Baker running a game, James D'Amato walking by and Jim McClure holding court.\nAcadeCon 2017 is our fifth annual gaming convention. We've hosted four previous successful cons (the first two were invite-only due to space limitations). Our third year was our first foray into a public event, and our success led us to look for a larger and lasting home with the Dayton Convention center.\nBrad K sporting our amazingly yellow Faculty shirts\nWant to see more pictures from last year?\nPhoto Gallery from AcadeCon 2016\n\nThe RPG Academy Faculty (most of us, anyway)\n\n\nWhy do we need to use Kickstarter?\nThere are two major costs associated with AcadeCon and a few lesser costs as well. Our #1 expense is the facility itself. Renting out space at the Dayton Convention Center equates to over 60% of our total expenses. Last year's cost was $6,192.00, and this year we\u2019ve rented out additional space, putting our location costs closer to $8,000.00. Our next biggest expense is for some of our special guests. For those that are flying, we cover their airfare, for those driving, we cover some gas money, and we put many of them up in hotel rooms during their stay. Last year, those costs exceeded $3,000.00.\nWe also have costs associated with marketing and advertisement (KS takes about 9% off of any funds we raise, for example), we used Facebook Ads to let people know we exist, as well as postcard flyers and pencils for giveaways at other local events. There are also up front printing costs associated with signage, banners, badges, and the rest of our convention materials.\nSo, even if we hit our goal of $10,000.00, we would not be \"fully funded.\" Not all that close, really. So, why would we do that?\nWe now have a solid baseline of what sort of revenue we can expect from after Kickstarter badge sales and raffle ticket sales, and we're confident that we can make up any shortfall between now and then, but we need money up front to reserve the location, bring in our special guests, and print all the badges. That\u2019s why we're here. A successful Kickstarter campaign will cover our up-front deposits and down payments, and it may even help us reach our goal of breaking even, or making a small profit later on. And of course, if we exceed expectations, we will have stretch goals for AcadeCon Swag for each Kickstarter backer.\nSO WHO ARE THESE SPECIAL GUESTS THAT YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT?\nWe are so excited to play host to absolutely amazing people from the game design industry and from the podcast world. We're even more excited that these fine folks are willing to come to AcadeCon and play games with us and with you!\nOur guest list includes:\nKenneth Hite\nJames D'Amato\nWill Hindmarch\nJim McClure\nTim Waggoner\nand many more.\nFor an up to date list of all our Special Guests - click here!\n  OTHER SUPER COOL THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING\nARTEMIS Space Bridge Simulator\nOur inner sci-fi nerds are insanely happy to have this chance to pull on those costumes that we don't tell anyone about and log some time on the Artemis Space Bridge Simulator. Sponsored by Game Base 7, this is going to one of the highlights of the convention. Registration information for these games will be included in the gaming schedule when it is released after the campaign ends. Unlike many conventions that host a simulator, ours does not cost extra. It's all included in your badge\u2014though we won't be upset if you give them a donation or purchase some of their wares in exchange for their presence at AcadeCon. \nYou Too Can Cthulhu\n  We are pleased to welcome the You Too Can Cthulhu team back to AcadeCon! The games they ran for us last two years were absolutely amazing and every participant loved their time experiencing Lovecraftian horror at the hands of the team. Who knows what eldritch terrors will be thrust upon us this year?\n\n\nDouble Exposure Envoy Program\nSponsored by  Double Exposure, the Envoy program is unique and awesome! The Double Exposure team will provide us with about 25 brand-new games that you can try out during AcadeCon. Every time you play a demo, you are entered into a drawing to win that game! You can play the same game multiple times to get a better chance at winning something you really enjoy or play them all and see if Lady Luck is smiling on you.\nStretch Goals\nOur goal for AcadeCon 2017 was a streamlined Kickstarter. We've cut out a lot of our alternate revenue generators (virtual games) and just want to focus on selling badges, bringing in Vendors and Sponsors. If we can sell the same number of badges through the KS that we sold in total last year (and assuming our vendors/sponsorships are roughly the same) we should easily be able to fund, and then some.\nIf we can make it past our funding goals, we want to offer some AcadeCon gamer swag items for each person that is buying an attendee badge (the VIP, Regular, GM Volunteer, Games on Demand GM, and Child badges).\n$13k \u2013 PDF program guide. If we hit $13k we'll have a professionally laid out eProgram for all our guests PLUS an AcadeCon 2017 d6.\nSamples - not final design\n$15k \u2013 Every person who bought an attendee badge through KS will get an AcadeCon 2017 poker chip/token.  AND we'll upgrade the Program to an actual printed guide, ya know?  Like a real convention.\nTokens from AcadeCon 2015\nOur tokens for this year will look just like above, except with this year's color scheme and logo.\n$17k \u2013 Every person who bought an attendee badge through KS will get 2 AcadeCon 2017 bookmarks and an AcadeCon tote bag.\nCrappy mock up. But sorta like this\n$19k \u2013 Every person who bought an attendee badge through the KS will get an AcadeCon woven patch.\nNot final design\n$21k - Prize pool enhancement # 1\n$23k - Prize pool enhancement # 2\n$25k - Every person who bought an attendee badge through KS will get  a set of Easy Roller Dice with an AcadeCon-branded dice bag.\n  Like this, but with our Logo on the bag\nDie colors may vary.\nAfter $25k \u2013 for every $200 we raise, we'll spend $100 on prizes and/or new games for the free to play open game library.\nCode of Conduct. \nAcadeCon is an inclusive gaming event open to gamers off all types. Every attendee will be subject to our Code of Conduct.\nAcadeCon Code of Conduct\nWhat about that Kickstarter Exclusive T-shirt you keep going on and on about?\nAcadeCon 2015 was our 1st year as a public event and will forever hold a special place in my heart. The Lodge where we gathered that November was lovely and a fantastic place to begin our AcadeCon as a 'real thing' journey. It also, however, was infested with vultures and it quickly became a joke that those that came to AcadeCon 2015 survived those Vultures . . . so in honor of the idea of ever forward and not having to take a step back and return to the lodge, here is the exclusive Kickstarter backer T-shirt image:\nArt work courtesy of Jaydot Sloan.\nThe KS exclusive T-Shirt is also exclusive to people who are coming. We can't ship this off site. Please do not add $15 to your pledge unless you will be physically coming to AcadeCon and can pick up your shirt on site.\nThank you for taking a look at our campaign.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome to the Button Men campaign! We are in the final hours and hoping to unlock a few more stretch goals before we close! \nSo far, we've unlocked a system logo button for the core game at $45k, a \"Mutton Ben\" button in the funvelope at $55k, a Fight City Mapple map at $60k, and additional cards for the funvelope at $65k.\nNext up are Button Murderers from Kill Doctor Lucky at $70k, a Skully patch (the \"o\" in Button Men) at $75k, and Button Men Pairs at $80k! We'll also unlock a Button Men coin at $85k and bring Fight City back at $95k. You can read more about these in Update #10.\nButton Men is a quick, clever dice game designed by James Ernest. It's easy to learn, loaded with strategy, and one of the best games we've ever made.\nEach player selects a character card, and uses the dice described on the card. Players start by rolling all of their dice, and then take turns capturing each other's dice.\nYou score points based on the size of the dice you capture (and keep), and the player with the most points wins.\nWith endless variations of character recipes, unusual die types, and some simple new 'campaign' rules, Button Men is a game you can enjoy again and again.\nHere's a how-to-play video that explains the basics:\nWe first released Button Men in 1999. It won two Origins Awards, for Best Abstract Board Game, and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game. (And it doesn't even have a board!) A few years later, the web version, Button Men Online, also won for Best Play by Mail Game.\nButton Men has had dozens of expansions, from Cheapass Games and many other publishers. To date, the game has had more than 300 different official characters.\nAnd now we want to bring it back!\nButton Men started on pin-back buttons. The biggest difference with this new edition is that we are printing the characters on trading cards.\nWe will still make character buttons available, but the trading card format makes the game much less expensive. We can make a starter set with 48 characters and 30 dice for about the same price as a set of 12 buttons (and no dice). If that starter set does well in stores, we can make expansion packs that are just decks of cards.\nThe new starter set of Button Men is set in Fight City, a 1950's gangster town somewhere on the US Gulf Coast (think New Orleans, but not real). A \"Button Man\" is a low-level gangster, so the title still fits, even without the buttons. We've stretched the definition a bit, to include a wide range of criminals, male and female, at many levels of the power structure.\nThe Fight City set is divided into four factions, each with a different style of play. Those from Downtown (\"The Core\") use normal dice only. Characters from The West Side have Shadow dice, which make attacks upside-down. Those from the Delta region use Poison dice, which are worth negative points. And characters from Uptown have Rush Dice, which can capture two dice in a single attack! \nYou can read more about the different factions and their special rules in Updates #2, #4, #6, and #8.\nThe basic Button Men rules haven't changed at all, so every existing Button Men character is compatible with the new set. The set's new rules include Rush Dice, rules for drafting characters and dice from a limited pool, as well as several  \"campaign\" variations that let you play multiple characters on each side.\nThe Button Men starter set will be $35 in retail stores, and you can get it here for the same price, along with our famous \"funvelope,\" which is a bundle of cool stuff that you can only get from us. You can also get your favorite factions on buttons, if you want to pledge a little more. You can even become a Button Man yourself with the Drawn In levels.\nHere's the Breakdown:\nThe Funvelope: In every campaign, we add a few cool freebies as our way of saying thanks. The Button Men funvelope will include the following:\nEight additional character cards\nA souvenir poker chip\nA \"Skully\" logo button (the skull inside the \"O\")\nMore cool stuff  - check out the stretch goals!\nWe have a $15 pledge level that includes only the funvelope, for backers who are on a budget, and for anyone who would rather wait and buy the core game from their favorite game store.\nButton Men: Starter Set. The Button Men core game will include 48 characters on trading cards, 30 polyhedral dice, and the game rules. \nThe pool of 30 dice includes 20 light dice and 10 dark dice (most likely ivory and black), in sizes d4, d6, d8, d12, and d20. This is the minimum functional dice set, which allows you to play any combination of two characters against each other, although sometimes you may have limited choices for your Swing Dice. You can always add your own dice for more flexibility, but we chose this assortment to maximize gameplay and minimize cost.\nThe $35 \"Button Men\" pledge level includes the core game as well as the funvelope.\nThe Cards Alone: A few of our backers asked if they could get just the character cards, because they already have enough dice. We have added two inexpensive levels that include just the pack of 48 cards, and not the full starter set. One level is the card pack alone for $15, and the other also includes the funvelope, for $25.\nThis pack of cards won't have a box. It's just 48 cards in shrink wrap, not packaged for retail. If you would prefer to wait, you'll also be able to get this assortment of cards from our friends at Drive Thru Cards after the campaign has shipped.\nA Note on Production: We will print the game components in the USA, and use genuine Koplow dice (which are made in China). This is not the cheapest way to make this game, but the components will be of the highest quality, and we prefer it that way. You can read more about this decision in Update #7.\nAdding Factions: Do you love buttons? So do we! We're going to make individual pin-back buttons of the Fight City characters available after the campaign, but if you'd like to add a block of buttons to your pledge, we have four pledge levels that include one or more factions of 12 characters. The factions are:\nThe Core (art in Update #2)\nWest Side (art in Update #4)\nThe Delta (art in Update #6)\nUptown (art in Update #8)\nCustom Artwork: Our talented artists Cheyenne Wright and Nate Taylor have agreed to draw ten backers apiece! Backers at the original \"Drawn In\" level will receive everything from the \"Add Four Factions\" level, as well as a character portrait based on themselves (or someone they choose), both as an art print and a digital copy. You will also receive ten pin-back buttons featuring your character and unique Button Men recipe!\nBonus Levels: Two more Button Men artists have signed on to add to the Drawn In levels! Ryan Kinnaird and John Kovalic now each have their own Drawn In level.  You can read more about these artists in Update #5.\nNote: The Drawn In characters will not appear in the core set (the timing isn't right), but we just might be able to include them in a future set. Only if we have permission from the individuals, of course!\nAlso Note: Nate and Cheyenne will each draw ten backers for the original Drawn In level. If you have a preference for one or the other, we can't promise that you will get him, but we will give preference to those with earlier backer numbers.\nWe've crushed our initial funding goal, and now we want to make the game even better! Here are some stretch goals to help us take Button Men to the next level.\nFirst, an Announcement: After reviewing samples from China, we've decided to print Button Men in the US. This is what we usually do, but with all the dice in this game, we thought we would at least give China a shot. You can read more about what went into this decision in Update #7.\nAchieved! System Logo Button. We'll add a button to the core game so that people can show that they play! We talked about making this a simple \"Button Men\" button but there are some thoughts that this should be a playable character. Either way, it's a pin-back button in the game box, unlocked at $45k.\nAchieved! $50k: \"Mutton Ben.\" A few of you had a lively discussion about adding a new character, \"Mutton Ben.\" We'll make him into a trading card for the funvelope, unlocked at $50k.\nAchieved! $55k: Better \"Mutton Ben.\" We have Ben, now let's make him into a button for the funvelope. An upgraded Mutton Ben, unlocked at $55k.\nAchieved! $60k: Fight City Mapple Board. We have a clever little territory control game called Mapple. We'll make a Fight City board for it, unlocked at $60k.\nAchieved! $65k: Four More Cards in the Funvelope: Let's add four more bonus character cards to the funvelope. This stretch goal is more than it seems: at this point we also get to print these cards alongside the core game, so they will match the others in size and paper stock. That's actually a pretty big deal! Unlocked at $65k.\n\nNOT UNLOCKED (YET):\n$70k: Button Murderers: We'll release a set of 12 new Button Men on Drive Thru Cards, based on our favorite murderers from Kill Doctor Lucky and Doctor Lucky himself.\n$75k: Skully Patch: We'll add a  a 2\" embroidered patch of our wee mascot Skully (the \"o\" in Button Men) to the funvelope.\n$80k: Button Men Pairs: We'll create a new Pairs deck at Drive Thru Cards featuring characters from the new edition of Button Men, as well as a new game variant to go with it. This might even turn into multiple decks!\n$85k: Button Men Coin: We will add yet another goodie to the Funvelope: a 39mm metal coin. This coin will be similar to the coins we have made for other projects, with a Cheapass Games logo on one side, and a round version of the new Button Men logo on the other.\n$95k: Fight City Returns! We'll post the two original Fight City decks (with updated full-color borders) on Drive Thru Cards. And we'll post the rules for free at cheapass.com, of course.\nNote that we have expanded our original \"Drawn In\" levels, and we have also added new ones featuring Ryan Kinnaird and John Kovalic. Send us your photo, and you can become a custom Button Men character, drawn by one of these illustrious illustrators!\nOur main goal in this campaign is to get a new Button Men starter set produced for retail stores. If that succeeds, we can start making new sets of characters as 12-card booster packs, for a fraction of the cost of the old pin-back buttons. \nWe're already talking with some big-name game publishers, to license their characters and art for some interesting crossover sets. We'd love to do more characters in Fight City as well, perhaps in different time periods. And we have already announced a partnership with Dyskami Publishing to release the Sailor Moon Crystal Dice Challenge this fall!\nButton Men has been around for a long time, so there is plenty of material out there. Here are some new and not-so-new resources, if you want to learn more about the game:\nHow to Play Video: Created for this campaign, this video shows the basics of Button Men using two characters from The Core.\nCheapass Games: See the new trading cards based on the earliest and best Button Men sets, at our own double-secret website.\nButton Weavers: The original \"Button Men Online\" site is alive again at buttonweavers.com. Sign up to play, and help test the open alpha of this new site!\nBeat People Up: Our original Button Men information page is still online, with a fresh coat of paint. This is a great resource for more in-depth strategic analysis, and lists of the characters from the early days.\nDrive Thru Cards: Our friends at Drive Thru Cards have a unique resource that lets you create custom Button Men. Check them out and print your own playable characters.\nBoard Game Geek: The Internet's premiere resource for hardcore tabletop gamers actually has a few nice things to say about Button Men, where the game still ranks as #109 on the \"customizable\" list (and #2772 overall).

Over time, they have been revised and updated after plenty of feedback from the community, and now they're ready to be presented as a full-colour softcover book! Each is a full class, along with archetypes; plus the collection includes a selection of supporting feats, spells, items, backgrounds, and monsters to help make the most from them. And yes, that includes the Noble, the name of our \"Warlord\" class!\nThat's not all, of course. For those with a bigger appetite, you can also get 45 new subclasses. Scroll down for more information on that!\nFrom authors C. Richard Davies, Matt Roth, Josh Gentry, Mike Myler, and A. Nova; and illustrated by Nick Cramp, Ellis Goodson, Indi Martin, Sade, J.E. Shields, Phil Stone, Egil Thompson, Jen Tracy, and Shannon White.\nIn these pages you'll find:\nThe Alchemist: Scientific Sorcery. The alchemist uses an almost scientific approach to magic to make alchemical discoveries. Will your alchemist become immune to poison, or discover the Elixir of Life? Will you delve into the Science of Creation and build a homunculus, or research the Science of Destruction and devise explosives? We also expand on the alchemist class with three new Advanced Studies: the Science of Illumination, the Science of Mutation, and the Science of Regeneration. Also included are two new spells, and an update which gives the alchemist a little more \u201coomph.\u201d\nThe Cardcaster: Seers of Fate. The cardcaster uses a tarot deck to release magic, playing cards to cast spells\u2014although she doesn\u2019t always have control over what spells are currently made available to her by the winds of fate! Also included are three archetypes: the Knight of Swords, which embodies mental force and determination; the Page of Wands, which embodies the magical power of creation; and the Queen of Cups, with embodies the emotions. This class is also supported by new feats and new secrets, including the King of Pentacles, which pertains to thrift and wealth; and the Jack of Beasts, which unleashes the trapped spirits of monsters.\nThe Diabolist: Students of Darkness. Diabolists deal with forbidden secrets and dark entities, grasping for power through dark pacts. While they have things in common with necromancers and warlocks, diabolists are something entirely more\u2026diabolical! Also included are two Dark Paths: the Demonic path and the Devilish path. We also introduce some conjured horrors, such as the accuser devil, contract devil, and more!\nThe Feywalker: A Taste of Primal Chaos. The feywalker is a mysterious warrior with mystical powers. Feywalkers can teleport short distances, breathe in air and water, and enchant others with a glance. They can also choose from three primal spheres: beasts, plants, or entropy.\nThe Morph: Changing Faces. The morph is a shapechanging specialist, able to slide between different forms. Morphs have a choice of three Essences\u2014the Doppleganger, the Primordial Beast, and the Trickster\u2014and a selection of Morph Talents they can choose from and acquire.\nThe Noble: Chessmaster and Commander. Leader, tactician, and a source of inspiration, the full 20-level noble class is able to command and inspire through three paths: the Path of the Heart, the Path of the Brave, and the Path of the Tactician.\nThe Occultist: Freeing the Monster Within. The occultist allows you to play a monster, with a choice of three distinct paths: abomination, vampire, or werecreature! Delve into the dark and secret creatures of the night, cursed to exist as monstrous beings shunned by the world.\n     But That's Not All! Want 45 New Sub-Classes?\nThat's not all by a long shot! We know that folks love new classes, but they also love new subclasses for their existing favorites. And so, for those for whom 7 new classes just isn't enough, we have a bonus reward tier called THE FULL MONTY which gets you an enormous pile of 45 subclasses contained within a collection of 19 fully-illustrated mini-supplements in PDF format. Just look at them below! That's a LOT of material! \n19 mini-supplements containing dozens of sub-classes!\n Just select the FULL MONTY reward tier, and you'll get all of these along with A Touch of Class.

From veteran author Ari Marmell (Drow of the Underdark, Tome of Magic, The Goblin Corps, Thief's Covenant) comes this look at new player options for the bard, sorcerer, and wizard. The Bardic College of Names, the Dread sorcerous origin, and the Shadowcaller tradition for the wizard make up this first chapter of forgotten lore.\nThe Art of Peace. In a world of violence and vicious magic, monks of the Shifting Flow and the Watchful Gate audaciously dream of peace. The Art of Peace introduces two new monastic traditions, the all-new Envoy background, and 8 maneuvers for monks who value their karma. By Josh Gentry.\nA Paladin's Dark Vows. Not all paladins are good; some may stray from the true path, while others are pure evil. Josh Gentry presents new flaws and class features for dark paladins. When a paladin turns from the light, flaws of aggression, blind loyalty, and na\u00efvet\u00e9 provide corruptions of the virtues of bravery, loyalty, and wisdom. Additionally, paladins may take oaths of the Purge or Supremacy, or use the new Bloody Hands class feature. Illustrated by Scott Harshbringer.\nVolumes of Forgotten Lore: Divine. In the second of his Forgotten Lore series, veteran author Ari Marmell brings you new divine player options.

Goodman Games is pleased to be given the opportunity to mine the incredible stories of renowned author Fritz Leiber and adapt the people, places, and things of his tales for use in your DCC game. Within this boxed set, you will find everything you require to begin a DCC Lankhmar campaign or to take your DCC RPG adventurers through space and time to visit the world bubble of Nehwon.\nAn RPG boxed set based on the fantasy world created by the immortal Fritz Leiber!\n What Is This Kickstarter?\nGoodman Games, under official license from the estate of Fritz Leiber, is publishing a Lankhmar campaign setting for the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. The product will be a boxed set containing at least four books (possibly more depending on stretch goals), plus a map and tokens for the use of Fleeting Luck (a new rules mechanic). The page count of all books is estimated at 170 or more. The four books are:\nThe Compendium of Secret Knowledge: Rules Options for DCC Lankhmar\nThe Judge\u2019s Guide to Nehwon\nLankhmar: City of the Black Toga\nNo Small Crimes in Lankhmar (level 1 adventure)\nAll content is based on the works of Fritz Leiber, as licensed by the estate of Fritz Leiber.\nNingauble's Cave\nWhy DCC and Lankhmar?\nDCC RPG is a perfect fit for Leiber\u2019s world and the stories that chronicle it, perhaps more so than any other role-playing game to date. DCC RPG was specifically designed to go back to the classic sword & sorcery stories of Appendix N, the stories that inspired the original fantasy role-playing game, and provide judges and players with the means to replicate the feel of those tales for their own enjoyment. One could say that Leiber and Lankhmar are in the very DNA of DCC RPG, a crucial part of making the game what it is.\nNow, thanks to a partnership with the estate of Fritz Leiber, DCC Lankhmar presents the fans of DCC RPG with new role-playing material that comes directly from the tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. Herein are new lands to explore, new monsters to battle, unique spells to uncover, and a bevy of optional rules to make your DCC RPG game better reflect the adventures that fill Fritz Leiber\u2019s fiction.\nAll of us at Goodman Games are delighted by the opportunity to play with Leiber\u2019s most famous creation. His work casts a long shadow over the role-playing game hobby, influencing and informing some of the universal components of the pastime. Every shadowy thieves\u2019 guild, every teeming city filled with fog and danger, every scroll-reading rogue and slyly intelligent wererat skulking through the underworld owes a debt of gratitude to Fritz Leiber. It is safe to say that almost all fantasy cities in RPGs are muddied reflections of Lankhmar, whether or not we recognize it on a conscious level. Everyone involved in the DCC Lankhmar line is thrilled to be able to play in Lankhmar and to figuratively walk its foggy streets after dark. After playing in the shade of the grand city for so long, it is an honor to lay our hands on the very object that has thrown that long and influential shadow.\nWhile the DCC Lankhmar set contains all the basics a judge requires to get his Nehwon-based game running, it is far from a complete compilation of all things Lankhmar! Leiber penned more than forty Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories, novellas, and novels in his lifetime, incrementally adding to the world of Nehwon. Consider this set a mere aperitif, a sip of a fine vintage to wet your lips before consuming more. Each subsequent release in the DCC Lankhmar line will further explore Nehwon, allowing you to build your campaign piece-by-piece, much as Leiber did his stories. We hope you\u2019ll continue this journey of exploration with us and to further range across the world of Nehwon and delve into the twisting streets of the City of the Black Toga through the lens of DCC Lankhmar!\nFafhrd and the Gray Mouser. Art by Doug Kovacs.\nWhat is DCC RPG?\nDCC RPG is a stand-alone tabletop role playing game. DCC RPG debuted in 2012, and has generated five printings and spawned a movement. The game is based on a modern interpretation of the original D&D inspirations. Check out our web site and past DCC RPG Kickstarter for more information.\nDo I need to own a copy of DCC RPG to enjoy DCC Lanhmar?\nYes! If you are a fan of Lankhmar who has not previously played DCC RPG, we believe you will find DCC RPG very much to your liking. Support the Kickstarter by adding on a copy! (see Pledge Levels section below for more details on how to do that)\nSwords of Lankhmar: Same Book, Many Printings\nWhat is Lankhmar?\nLankhmar is a fictional city created by author Fritz Leiber. Fritz Leiber is one of America\u2019s greatest science fiction and fantasy authors, a writer whose works indelibly changed the landscape of imaginative fiction and influenced countless others\u2014both writers and gamers\u2014who followed in his wake. Leiber is best known for his stories of Nehwon, home to the legendary heroes, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and to Lankhmar, the City of the Black Toga.\nThe very genre of \u201csword & sorcery\u201d owes its name to Leiber. He coined the term to describe the types of stories that featured \u201cMiddle Earths and lands and worlds based on this planet, worlds which exist only in some author\u2019s vivid imagination,\u201d as Michael Moorcock described the genre. At the time of the term\u2019s coinage in 1961, Leiber had already been weaving stories set in fantastical Lankhmar and its environs for more than two decades. His first Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser story, \u201cTwo Sought Adventure\u201d (later retitled \u201cThe Jewels in the Forest\u201d) was published in 1939. Leiber would continue to explore Nehwon and the sword & sorcery genre for almost fifty years in more than forty stories and poems, publishing his final Fafhrd and Mouser story in 1988, four years before his death.\nLeiber\u2019s works played a significant role in the development of the tabletop gaming hobby. He is listed as one of the six most influential authors in the creation of Dungeons & Dragons in the famed \u201cAppendix N\u201d where Gary Gygax describes his primary sources for the game. The city of Lankhmar\u2019s DNA can be found in almost any fantasy role-playing city from Greyhawk to Waterdeep. His fiction is among the first to be officially licensed for role-playing publication, leading to a business relationship between Leiber and TSR Hobbies in the mid-1970s and beyond.\nLeiber was no stranger to the curious world of tabletop gaming, being an avid chess player his whole life. He and Harry Otto Fischer, the co-creator of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, had created a wargame set in the world of Nehwon (then called \u201cLahkmar\u201d) in 1937. Yes, way back in 1937. This game was played on a huge 5\u2019-by-2.5\u2019 board made of corrugated paper and could require an entire weekend to complete! Leiber would work with TSR Hobbies in 1976 to produce a smaller game based on his and Fischer\u2019s creation. This opened the doors for further projects, leading to the inclusion of the Nehwon mythos in Deities & Demigods (1980) and the publication of Lankhmar: City of Adventure (1985), an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons supplement adapting Nehwon, Lankhmar, and its inhabitants to the AD&D ruleset. Lankhmar and Dungeons & Dragons would remain intertwined for eleven more years, extending into the second edition of AD&D and ending with Fritz Leiber\u2019s Lankhmar: The New Adventures of Fafhrd and Gray Mouser in 1996.\nIn addition to his inspiring D&D and his licensed works with TSR Hobbies, Leiber also wrote an article for the premier issue of \u201cThe Dragon,\u201d contributing a piece entitled \u201cFafhrd & the Gray Mouser Have the Say\u201d (wherein Leiber attempts to explain wargaming to the Twain). His Fafhrd & Mouser story, \u201cSea Magic\u201d premiered in The Dragon #11. Gamers, both role-playing and war-, were thrilled to meet Leiber and Fischer when they attended Gen Con IX at the Horticultural Hall in Lake Geneva, WI in August of 1976. (If you own the Metamorphosis Alpha Deluxe Collector's Edition from Goodman Games, you can find a photograph inside of James M. Ward getting Leiber's autograph at that Gen Con!)\nDCC Lankhmar continues the proud tradition of keeping Fritz Leiber\u2019s contributions, be they literate or gaming, alive in the fantasy role-playing hobby. For those unfamiliar with Leiber\u2019s Lankhmar stories, an entire world of fantastical adventure awaits you and even the greatest fantasy role-playing supplement is no match for the original source material. This author suggests that eager students wishing to learn more of Lankhmar and Nehwon should begin their studies with the first Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser story, \u201cThe Jewels in the Forest,\u201d available in the collection Swords Against Death. Follow that with \u201cLean Times in Lankhmar,\u201d collected in Swords in the Mist, and complete their initial foray with \u201cThe Lords of Quarmall,\u201d found in Swords Against Wizardry. By then, their thirst for more of the Twain\u2019s adventures will lead them further into the wilderness of Nehwon and the dim, fog-cloaked streets of Lankhmar, where you\u2019ll find adventure, thrills, and even humor, at every turn. \nA fantastic world of adventure awaits you in the works of Fritz Leiber!\nShow Me What DCC Lankhmar Looks Like.\nGoodman Games has previously published three DCC Lankhmar preview titles. All of them had simple B/W covers and were intended to showcase the content that was being produced. The final boxed set will of course have full-color covers and be at even higher production value.

It has been in active design and playtesting for several years. This is not just a game \u201cdesign\u201d project, but a game \u201cplay\u201d project. The new rules have been playtested internally as well as by outside groups, in campaign formats and stand-alone convention games. Many, many hours of active play have gone into the product you will ultimately receive.\nThe lead author on the project is Michael Curtis; with additional design by Harley Stroh, Doug Kovacs, and Joseph Goodman; and additional writing contributions by Daniel J. Bishop, Bob Brinkman, Edgar Johnson, Brendan LaSalle, Terry Olson, and Harley Stroh. Lead project artist is Doug Kovacs.\nAs we attend conventions, we give updates on the progress of our projects.

Using a wide range of parts and a web-based application which requires no installation or design experience, Chibify will give users the tools to design adorable characters with ease!\n\nPick your facial features, hairstyle, outfit, and more. Capture your chibi's personality, then immortalize their cuteness in a unique, custom statuette, miniature, or charm.\nYour chibi made real!\nRecreate yourself, your friends, your family. Export images for profile pictures, order a full color Chibi Statuette for your desk, a Mini Chibi for painting or use in your favorite tabletop games, or a Chibi Charm to put on your key chain, charm bracelet, or necklace.\nWith successful funding we will launch with a large library parts, and we have even more planned--you can help us bring them to you sooner by reaching our stretch goals!\nWhat can I make?\nWe are launching with three main options: full color Chibi Statuettes, Mini Chibis, and Chibi Charms.\n\n\nWant more? For special, limited-edition, Kickstarter-exclusive materials and sizes, check out our Backer Tier Section for more info! Note that backer tiers including physical products ($20 and above) also include domestic shipping ($5 value) or $5 off on international shipping.\nHow to Get Them\nBecome a backer of this project and your support tier will have a set of rewards associated with it: you will essentially be pre-ordering our Chibi Statuettes, Mini Chibis, Chibi Charms, and/or signing up for more information when we launch. Once we launch our private Kickstarter-Backer Beta, you will receive voucher codes which you can redeem on the site for your custom chibis.\nSome tiers also include special limited-edition prints in precious metals, larger scales, or even offer the chance to submit your own designs for parts and features for our artists to add to the character builder--with your name featured in the description! For these special limited edition products, our team will be in contact with you following the Kickstarter to fulfill on your limited edition reward.\nThe Chibi art style is decades old and found some of its earliest mainstream expression with popular anime series like the Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, and Gundam franchises. Its unique take on anime characters became much beloved around the world for its hyper-cute charm. The popularity of the lighthearted style spread, inspiring and influencing art in Japan, America, and beyond. The cultural impact of this style is still seen today in many modern mainstream cartoons, toys, and collectibles.\nWe have always been inspired by the unique styles, motifs, and themes in anime. We love creating new, unique art in that style, and you will too!\nWe're so very excited to be offering our unique take on the chibi art style and bringing it to the third dimension first online and then into your hands. We plan to launch with over 400 part options spread across over fifteen different 'slots.' That means millions of different possible chibi designs right out of the gate, not to mention our 'slider'-based body customizer so you can hand-tweak your chibi's proportions and body type. In short, we want to provide the tools for truly deep customization so you can capture your creativity.\nChibify is more than a cute character creator\u2014it\u2019s a technological achievement! Using the latest in WebGL technology and our own special sauce, we'll let users design their chibi in full 3D right in their web browser, plug-in free! \nAnd how do we produce your custom chibis? Why, using the magic of 3D printing, of course! We've partnered with two of the biggest names in 3D printing for product fulfillment: Sandboxr, Inc. and Shapeways, Inc.\nSandboxr, Inc. will produce our color Chibi Statuettes!\n    Shapeways, Inc. will produce our Mini Chibis and Chibi Charms!\nMore About the Website\nChibify.com will use WebGL, the new standard for displaying 3D models on the web. WebGL has allowed us to develop a robust, responsive, interactive design experience which lets you create characters right in your favorite modern browser without downloading plugins or running any other programs. See beautiful, interactive models as you design, build, and pose them.\nDesign online in full 3D, right in your web browser. No plugins or programs to download!\n  We'll make your design real! Order custom prints of your figures!\nThis approach also allows us to add some fun, free features which we hope you\u2019ll enjoy: export high resolution screenshots of your characters. Create profile images for your favorite social media sites or crafting projects: the only limit is your imagination! You can also save and load your characters from your own private library and share your characters online with share links.\nExport screenshots like this, with your custom chibi and choice of background, for free!\nMore About the Statuettes, Minis, and Charms\nHow do we make the physical products? Using the latest and greatest in 3D printing! We have partnered with Shapeways Inc., and Sandboxr, Inc., two of the biggest names in 3D printing fulfillment, to turn your original designs into real-world statuettes, minis, and charms. We're thrilled to again be using some of the biggest names in 3D printing fulfillment to bring your unique vision to life. We will be launching with three products, each produced using different 3D printing methods:\nOur statuettes are made using cutting edge, full-color 3D printing technology. By solidifying and printing the models layer by layer with lasers, we can produce your unique statuettes to specifications.\nUsing the latest in cutting-edge 3D printing technology, we'll create truly unique collectibles true to your design!\nOur Mini Chibis are made using an SLA printing technology where a laser hardens paper-thin layers bit by bit out of a pool of photo-reactive acrylic liquid. Support sprues are then manually trimmed off, and the mini is complete.\nOur metal charms are made using layers of steel powder which are first lightly held together with an adhesive (this is referred to as its \u201cgreen state\u201d), then finished by infusing the model with bronze, replacing adhesive with solid metal binding, creating a 100% metal charm. The surface is then polished and finished with a plating of your choice. This provides its bright, shiny finish.\nSo, why us? Why, we love Chibi! Our team grew up reading manga and watching anime, and this shared cultural touchstone took root in our imaginations. Our team is made of up wonderful artists and programmers whose resume includes hit titles from the video game industry, television, cartoons, and feature films.\nWe\u2019re excited to use cutting edge technology in web design and 3D printing to make this project come to life. Sounds like a big undertaking, right? Luckily, we have done this before! Our past project, Hero Forge, harnessed similar technology to bring 3D printed custom tabletop miniatures to the world. After seeing how much people loved our fantasy character creator, we couldn't wait to do something new, building on the technology and adding new features and functionality. Chibify is the summation of that hard work! We plan to continue developing our Hero Forge project in tandem, but we also wanted to use that same technology and artistry for a new, super cute, super fun character builder.\nAs we said during our last Kickstarter campaign: \u201cWe believe our WebGL character builder will be a fun and useful tool. We just can't stop thinking of new uses for this technology, and we're sure you'll have some great ideas too!\u201d We hope to keep snowballing our growing tech base to add new features and creators, even rolling some new features back into existing projects. In fact, many of the recent performance and menu upgrades to Hero Forge were a byproduct of preparing for this project!\nAnd of course, Kickstarter helps us get the word out and connect with you. Your direct support and feedback also help us fund and deliver content based on the community's wants and needs, letting us produce even more parts and features for deeper customization. Kickstarter also offers the opportunity to go beyond basic funding, reaching exciting stretch goals so we can implement some of our plans earlier, and adding even more options for character customization.\nAnother way Kickstarter lets us connect with you is our limited reward tiers which offer you the opportunity to work with our artists and modelers to add content YOU want to see included. In summary, we wanted to give the community a voice in our product\u2019s creation, and Kickstarter is the perfect way to do that.\nWe want your help bringing these chibis to life. Your contributions will go towards making our chibi character builder even better.\nALL KICKSTARTER BACKERS receive the following digital rewards upon release of the final customizer:\nKickstarter Backer Base! Backers will have access to a special Kickstarter Backer Base for their chibi statuettes. This exclusive part will be permanently available to your account and will help commemorate your role in helping this project happen!\nKickstarter Backer In-App T-Shirt! Backers will have access to a backer-only Kickstarter Backer T-shirt so your chibi can proudly show off your support! (Just to be super clear: This T-shirt part is a part IN THE APP which you can add to your chibi and get printed on your statuette--not an actual t-shirt for your regularly proportioned human body!)\n\nALL KICKSTARTER BACKER TIERS ABOVE $5 receive the above AND the following additional rewards:\n\nExclusive Beta Access! Backers who pledge $5 or more will be provided exclusive access to our live, closed beta when it launches.\nDigital Art Book! Backers will also receive a twenty page digital art book with original concept art and high resolution images of our backgrounds and designs, and special commentary.\n\nALL ALPHA TEAM BACKERS receive the follow special limited-edition rewards. Note that these tiers are limited and will be given on a first-pledged-first-served basis!\n\nExclusive Alpha Access! Alpha Team will help us \"playtest\" our builder. They will receive links to early builds of the tool as we add more art and features. While we will not enable ordering until the tool is complete, you can get a head start on designing your chibi!\nExclusive Alpha Team Uniform!

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Ready for some old school fighting game action, but on a board? Then you came to the right place, welcome to...\nSelect your fighter! Round 1! FIGHT!\nWelcome to Super Chibi A.C.E., a limited edition game by MidKnight Heroes that pays homage to the old school 2d fighting games of old. You know the ones we're talking about, the games you would stand in line as a kid with your quarter on the machine for next game. The game that you would walk into the arcade and look for what would be a street fight, and with just a dollar run the place. Yeah, that game.\nThat game, along with others, bring back good memories, where you would just hang out with your friends and master the art of fighting. Well, we want to bring back those memories back and create new ones, with our game, Super Chibi A.C.E.\nA.C.E. is a new system that we designed to match as best as we could the experience of playing an old school 2d fighting game but locked in a mortal combat on a board. You use a 54 card deck we call the Control Deck to move your character, perform moves and create combos to defeat your opponent. The first to win two rounds wins the match, just like the old school games.\nControl Deck has Joystick and Button cards.\n So, do you have that killer instinct? Yeah, I bet you do. So, grab a friend, hop in the battle arena, it's time for a showdown!\nBoth players use a single or pair of a 54 card deck [Control Deck] to build special moves or perform combos to knock out your opponent. These cards are not only to use to make moves but also used to move your character across the game board.\nSuper Chibi A.C.E. Game Board\nEach character will have seven moves that they can perform with the right amount of cards. Each move will have a set amount of damage but the damage can be augmented by the button card or cards you play. \nCharacter Card: Shin player 1 side.\n  In A.C.E. there are three types of punches and kicks buttons cards, Fast, Normal and Strong and each has their own set of damage that can add to the move depending on what button you play.\nButton card examples, Kick and Punch\nMovement or Joystick cards are used to help form the moves together with the button cards. You have four types of Joystick cards, up, down, right and left. Put these cards together with the button cards to make moves the characters can perform.\nJoystick Cards examples, Right and Down\nWildcards\u2026well they are just what they say they are\u2026wild! These are the most powerful cards in the game and can change the outcome of a game in a hurry. They can replace any button or joystick card plus do other amazing things.\nThere is allot more to the game including combos, and conditions. What are conditions? Well, they add a special flavor to the moves to help you take out your opponent.\nSuper Chibi Ace will come with two default characters, Shin the Urban Ninja of Sector 7 and Absolute Valentine, the vigilante of Sector 7. Both will come with designed moves ready for play. Don\u2019t like those characters? That\u2019s ok\u2026 CREATE YOUR OWN!\nYep, that\u2019s right. Included in the rule book you will have a set of rules to create your own fighter from miniatures you already own. It could be ANY miniature, it does not matter. It\u2019s all up to you. Get your ideal fighter and make some moves and get ready for action!\nAll of the characters released by MidKnight Heroes will have designed moves right out of the box but that does not stop you from creating your own moves for them if you like. Our design is just a guideline; feel free to create your own.\nSo let get out there and start an old school fight. And thank you for your support!\nNatakue and the MidKnight Hereos Team\n  Super Chibi A.C.E. Pledge Contents\nUnlocked Characters: Core Characters \nSuper Chibi A.C.E. Character Progression\nBoth Shin and Absolute Valentine are considered core characters, meaning the will come with the box set. All other characters in the Kickstarter will be stretch goals. \nShin: Sector 7 Urban Ninja\nShin Concept art\n  Shin: Final Sculpt\nShin is the core character of Sector 7 and many stories revolve around him in that world. He is the first hero to stand up for what is right in the sector and because of that, he has inspired many others to follow in his path. Along with inspiring people he has created many enemies as he has been a thorn in their side for awhile now. Shin'spefered method of fighting? His parkour ninja style that he learned watching old school ninja movies on his VHS recorder. \nShin is a fun character that spans many worlds. His primary world is Sector 7 but you can see him in the novella series Super Chibi Clash Vol1 coming soon from MidKnight Heroes and Monolith.\nAbsolute Valentine:\nAbsolute Valentine Concept art\n  Absolute Valentine Final Sculpt\n Absolute Valentine is a special character in the Sector 7 world. He is special in the fact that not only was he not born there, or put there for any crime he committed but was transported there from another world. Stuck in Sector 7 now he has taken it upon himself to clean the streets of all the gang's crime. He is a force to be reckoned with and if I were you I would keep my distance. \nAbsolute Valentine is special to us as he is the first cross-promotional character between MidKnight Heroes and CPOP Productions. A joint venture that we will be exploring more as the range expands. For more on absolute valentine and his back story please check out the 1st edition of novellas from Monolith here. It's an amazing read full of action and adventure. \neBooks:\nSuper Chibi Clash and Super Chibi Origins: Sector 7\nIncluded in this Kickstarter, are two new eBooks from MidKnight Heroes and the Monolith: Super Chibi Origins Sector 7 and Super Chibi Clash.\nOrigins dives into the backstory of the two core characters, Shin and Absolute Valentine, as well as the setting and backdrop for the world of Sector 7. It will feature three stories written by Natakue of Midknight Heroes and Neuicon of theMonolith.\nSuper Chibi Clash is a new ongoing mini-series, set in the world of Super Chibi Clash and features the hero Shin from Super Chibi Sector 7 as well and a ton of characters that are in the Super Chibi Universe. This series will follow alongside the Kickstarter and give you a small story to go with Super Chibi A.C.E. Those who back the Kickstarter will get the first issue for free with their pledge.\nMobile App:  \nIn the core funding, you will also be funding the creation of or first ever mobile app. This app will have the rules for Super Chibi A.C.E. as well as all the special moves for each character in the Super Chibi universe. Also, note that the app will feature the back stories for our characters as well. In the future, we intend to use this app as a medium for all of our current and upcoming games. The App will be published on both Apple and Andriod platforms. \nStretch Goals:\nAll Stretch Goals in Super Chibi A.C.E. are add-ons. Each add-on can be added to your pledge for an increase of $7 for each stretch goal you want, provided that it's unlocked. Why do it this way? This way allows us to keep the stretch goal funding level very low and expand the character range for the Super Chibi A.C.E. experience while also allowing you to chose who you want to play the game with. \nWe have stretch goals that we call advanced stretch goals and they are add-ons as well. Advance stretch goals consist of miniatures that Midknight Heroes has already produced and extra card decks. \nStretch goals progression:\nSuper Chibi A.C.E. Stretch Goal Progression\n  Super Chibi Advanced Goals\n  Advanced Goals #2\nVideos:\nHere are few videos showing you a little more about the game. Something you need to know about these videos. They are of the playtest edition of the game. There are a few parts that are not here because at the time we created this set they were not designed. What are we missing?\nJumbo Character Cards\nCustom counter tokens\nAnd the two core miniatures\n   Here we have a review from Unfiltered Gamer on Super Chibi A.C.E. and he has our stretch goals all over the video.\nSpecial Thanks:\nCrushpop Productions\n We want to give a shout out to CPOP and the Monolith. Without them, this could not have happened. From game/rules-design, to publishing our eBook; they have been there for us since the beginning. Thank you for everything!\nWe would also like to thank JJOON from Newgrounds for allowing us to use his song IMPACT for this Kickstarter.\nWe would also like that thank Andrew Hordor Willis for the great work he did on construction our character progression picture. \nLast but not least, we would like to thank you to our artists Keiryuu Seo and Jansky for all the hard work they do for us.\n- Natakue\nShipping:  \nWe will charge shipping after the Kickstarter, based on the actual costs and weight. This will be collected after the campaign ends via our pledge manager.  \nIMPORTANT: DO NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO COVER YOUR POSTAGE PAYMENT IN YOUR PLEDGE AT THIS TIME.  \nAny funds collected through the KS system are reduced by 10% when Kickstarter collects their fees; this means that any funds collected to cover postage are 10% less than what is actually needed to cover postage, if the postage rates do not increase at the time of billing and shipping (postal rates have increased on us during our projects at least once prior to fulfillment; in one case, the rates increased twice).  \nAfter the campaign ends, backers will be able to select their rewards, via the pledge manager. Shipping costs will be calculated at that time. You will also be able to select additional reward options at that time if you wish.  \nPostage will be calculated by region when backers make their choices via our pledge management system. All postage fees must be paid before shipment can be completed. Rewards will be posted from the United States to all backer's addresses.  \nPlease understand that these are ESTIMATES ONLY and may change as we unlock more items or if shiping charges change.  \nUS $15.00 - $18.00 (1st Class or Priority Mail)  \nCAN / UK / EU $15.00 - $30.00  \nAU / NZ / ROW $20 - $35.  \nMidKnight Heroes is not responsible for any customs duties, taxes or fees incurred as a result.  \nUS rewards may be shipped via either USPS 1st Class or USPS Priority mail. All International Mail is shipped USPS 1st Class International mail.\n***Note: We have seen with our last set that it can be stuck in customs for a while.

We realized early in the project that our greatest challenge in bringing our vision to life, would be finding a great sculptor. We have done our research and found the best sculptor for the job. His name, Heriberto Valle Martinez.\n\nA big part of this Kickstarter is to gain the funding to pay for the sculpts and the overall production of the game. We have thoroughly researched the costs associated with sculpting, molding, production and shipping of the miniatures and what it would take to get our game produced. We are confident that we have considered all of the costs that will be associated with this project.\n\nOur biggest challenge will be the time needed to sculpt and produce the miniatures. As the sculptors have to do all of their work after the project funds, the time-frame following the Kickstarter may be longer than we initially wanted. Bear with us, these miniatures will be awesome and well worth the wait. We will keep you informed with regular updates on the progress of the project. We're not going to be idle while the sculptors are doing their work, however.

We\u2019re planning to release it on the PC in 2017 and then XBox One and PS4 in early 2018.\nGive MFL a test drive so you can see exactly where the game is in development. There are some bugs and game rules which are not working correctly (but you will still have fun playing). The User can play a single game against the computer or local multiplayer game against friends (2 to 4 players). Since the game is pre-alpha and not fully tested you may experience some issues based on different PC Configurations. We apologize in advance for any frustration.\n You will need an Official Xbox One or PS4 DualShock Controller to play the game on PC. Keyboard and Mouse are not supported yet.  \nPC Requirements\nWindows 7 or higher  \nIntel Core i3 or better  \nnVidia gForce 460 or better (with 1.5+ GB of memory)\n4 GB RAM or more\nIt's not cheating when it's The MFL-approved & officially licensed chainsaw.\nMutant Football League is an action football game where you pick from 14 Unique Teams or 3 All-Star Teams for online or offline gameplay, in solo, co-op, or head-to-head modes. Players can win by scoring more points than the opposition or by literally decimating the opposing team so they have to forfeit. The choice is yours! This is the next generation, spiritual successor to the classic retro game, Mutant League Football with beautiful 3D graphics and impressive gore effects.\nGenre:      Sports / Action\nPlayers:   1 to 4 players\nLength:     High Replay-ability\nRelease:   Oct 2017\nLanguages: English (will add additional languages if there is demand).\nHey, at least he got the First Down!\nOnline and offline multiplayer for 2 to 4 players - competitive and co-op - so you can laugh at your friends while you crush them under your cleats.\nOver the top visual and gore effects include blood splatters, comically horrific deaths, fire effects, exploding body parts, and dismemberment.\nExtremely dangerous fields are filled with diabolical traps and hazards \u2013 including explosive mines, toxic moats, lava flows and crazed fans cheering on their favorite squad of murderers.\nEach team has its own set of twisted audibles such as the classic \"Bribe the Ref\" where you payoff the referee to look the other way, or new additions like \"Chainsaw Massacre\" where your runningback pulls out a league-approved chainsaw and slices and dices the defense into submission, and \"Ginormous\u201d where your blitzer grows 5-times his normal size - have fun trying to block him!\nThese are your game breaking, wisecracking mutants who have special skills, abilities, weapons; They're players who can single-handedly win you the game. So you\u2019ll need to protect them because nothing hurts worse than losing your favorite all-star to a chainsaw or giant Orc.\nDeadHeads are an undead skeleton species who are balanced in all skill rating categories which makes them solid MFL players at almost all positions. Extremely dangerous, skeletons are not afraid of taking a heavy hit because they\u2019re already dead! Being undead also allows skeletons to heal faster than any other character species.\nWhen they were first introduced to the League, most were skeptical about these metallic monstrosities. As technology advanced, corporate teams started acquiring more Robots than any other species.  These updated robots have massive armor and come in different sizes. Some are built for speed, while others are built to withstand large amounts of damage.\nOrcs are big, brawny and breath-takingly dumb. Trolls are the most brutal species in the game (meaning they like to kill). What they lack in speed they more than make up for in brute strength, they can be punishing players that inflict heavy damage on opposing players.  With their strength and size, they are perfectly suited be linemen (blockers and blitzers).\nMore species to be announced soon!\nWith our initial goal demolished, it\u2019s now overtime for Mutant Football League. This is your chance to expand the game to include new combatants, more bloody thirsty action, and of course a lot more menacing ways to include much more mayhem.

Since then, gamers have grown to expect more in terms of characters, environments, animations and gameplay, welcome to the all new, Mutant Football League.\nA new beginning ...    \nMutant Football League is a completely new and totally original take on the monster mash-up sports genre, and comes loaded with attitude and comic violence on the playing field. The overall presentation of MFL has been re-visualized from it\u2019s predecessors, but the same sense of urgency that\u2019s an inherent part of a real-world football characterizes our game play. In short, the pacing of our MFL game is on steroids! \nAnd you thought orcs were big before\u2026\nThanks to fan suggestions and community prodding, we\u2019ve amped up MFL\u2019s humorous moments that can range anywhere from silly, and raunchy to politically incorrect, which our MFL characters have no problem expressing thanks to their over-the-top personal attributes and individual attitudes. You won\u2019t be disappointed with the characters, animations, and overall spirit of our game - unless you\u2019re one of THOSE people.\nDigital Dreams Entertainment is an independent game studio, founded by Michael Mendheim and Maxim Novikov.

With a credit list of over 130 games and a client list including Zynga, Microsoft, Sony, Electronic Arts, Capcom, Sega, Data East, Namco and many others. Brian has used his combined expertise and experience in music composition, sound design and his deep technical knowledge to further the state of the art in game audio and we delighted he is part of the MFL team.\nMutant Football League is a great gruesome, diabolically sinister game of maniacal proportions, but we need your help to finish it.  While there are a few spots that need some more polish, the primary goal of our campaign is to allow us to complete Online Multiplayer mode and then fine tune the rest. \nThere are many aspects to the game that we can lovingly improve but we have limited time and resources, so we need to know what is most important to you. We need your feedback and guidance on team balance, play modes, controls, humor, plays & formations, audio, player names, etc. Everyone who purchases the game will be involved in our Beta program.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to play the game and then provide feedback to us, let us know what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t so we can get every ounce of bloody fun possible.

Since its inception, MFL has been self-funded by the founders of Digital Dreams Entertainment LLC. All money raised for this Kickstarter campaign will go directly toward game production minus reward fees (estimated at 25%).\nWhat Remains to be completed?  \n This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny number of things can throw a project off schedule and while you try to account for everything, you simply can\u2019t predict everything.

We\u2019ve worked with large and small teams, on projects with multi-million dollar budgets and projects that require counting pennies. We\u2019ve seen a lot, created a lot, and love this game.\n\nThe game now is about 75% complete, fully playable, and thanks to some closed tests at different events, we know that it\u2019s fun.  So with multiplayer being the last major feature the game needs, we\u2019re also looking to add more content in terms of additional teams, \u201cdirty tricks\u201d and other fun Mutant-esque features. These systems have already been created and are in the game working.\n\nOf course, adding additional content can delay the final release date of the product depending on how much additional work is required. That being said, we are publishing the game ourselves, so if we need to delay the game for something we all agree we want then that\u2019s what we will do.

Somehow you escaped the Nightmare Forest before it was overrun by the undead. After that horrifying experience, you fortified your heart and appointed yourself the investigator of the strange, wild, and unexplained in and around The City.  \nRecently you saw strange lights hovering outside The City. You gathered a few trusted friends and headed back into the Nightmare Forest. There you discovered an Alien Expeditionary Force seeking to gather human specimens they can use to conquer the entire planet. You must defeat all the Aliens, without any of your friends being killed and collected, before the Aliens break out of the Forest and wipe out humanity.  \nCan you can survive another journey into the Nightmare Forest? \n  Click for MORE Aliens\n    Do you want to be a SPECIAL AGENT in the game manual?  If so, go HERE and read how you can be a Special Agent for Alien Invasion.\n    Nightmare Forest: Alien Invasion is a Cooperative game, where players must work together to cleanse the forest of Aliens before it is too late! Based on the number of characters, you will deal out a grid of Forest Cards. Each turn, every character will move around the Forest and decide which Forest Cards to flip over to potentially expose Aliens, fiendish Traps, useful Gear, or valuable Allies.  \nThere are four levels of cards, with higher challenges requiring that players choose whether to hope for a lucky roll or to combine their unique Abilities and Gear to improve their chances of defeating powerful foes.\nTo win, you and your friends must stay alive and clear the entire forest before the last turn. If any player is killed, or if the game ends before the Forest is cleared, then the Aliens overrun The City, and destroy humanity.\nThis is a stand-alone cooperative play style expansion of the Nightmare Forest game series. You do not need Nightmare Forest: Dead Run (everyone for themselves) to be able to play Alien Invasion.  \nAlien Invasion, while cooperative, has a great SOLO-PLAYER MODE as well.  \n                                                                          Undead Viking  Preview\n            Click to Read\n       Note: This Mat can be used with BOTH Dead Run and Alien Invasion (we will provide a FAQ about it)\n  Add $5 to your pledge to get one copy.\n        We believe so strongly in this project that we funded all the art for the game prior to Kickstarting. The game art will be complete prior the completion of the Kickstarter.  \nOnce the project funds we will need 2-3 weeks to make any custom character art from the \"Skulder/Mully\" backer levels, and the game will go immediately to manufacturing.    \n  GUEST ARTIST ALIEN 1 (+9 aliens)\n        Click to Read\n                                                                                                                                                    Review\n    Review\n  We like to support game stores around the world by offering the special pricing of the game to retailers during the campaign.

Or back the $2 Retailer reward level and we will contact YOU!\nRetailers will need to provide some documentation to validate retailer status.\nSolarFlare Games contributes just over $6.00 USD towards the shipping costs for ALL backers. For backers in the United States, this covers all shipping costs.  \nFor backers in other countries, we apply the same $6.00 credit to all international orders to help and support our backers. We bulk ship our international orders to the UK for fulfillment from the UK. This is done to reduce the shipping costs around the world and prevent VAT costs for EU backers. This makes the international shipping as backer friendly as possible.  \nThe chart below shows what shipping cost (up charge) will be added when you back to cover the balance of the shipping costs. \nThe first shipping up charge is listed for the Classified Files/Lone Gunman level, and the second amount is for the Special Agent level or higher (which includes the large play mat or multiple games).\n                                                                                                                                              Nightmare Forest: Alien Invasion was created and lead designed by Dave Killingsworth and will be published under the Brave Frontier Studios/SolarFlare Games umbrella.        \nThere is more information available about me in the Full Bio link.

In a fifteen minute interview we talk about our game, the Traveller IP, and the Kickstarter Campaign. Check out the link and give it a listen!\nhttp://crowdfundingcast.tk/crowdfunding-cast-episode-550-travler/\nTraveller is a card game adaptation of Marc Miller's classic Science-Fiction role-playing game. Players assume the role of ship Captains plying the mains of the Third Imperium.\nThe game has been designed to accommodate 2-4 players, but it also supports solo play and we anticipate releasing special solo play scenarios and game modes.  Single and two-player games should last about 30 minutes.  Three or four will go for 45-60 minutes.   \nTraveller is non-collectable. There's no random allocation of cards, and no rarities. Every product is a fixed set, so you always know exactly what you're getting.\nOur basic mechanics are an icon-driven race game, with ample opportunities to interact with, and even engage in piracy against, other players. All Captains must also contend with a hostile galaxy and the looming threat of insolvency.\nIn the graphic above, we illustrate an example of Contract completion. The Scout provides a Passage/Survey Capability, which may be used to resolve Contracts that require either Survey (as seen here) or Passage.\nRead on to see more details on our current backer rewards.  Please note that the final production versions may vary from the concept art.\nWe have calculated shipping costs into our campaign funding goal, so we are not charging any additional fees.  We have also committed to working with an EU-based distributor, to allow backers to save on VAT charges.\nHowever, while we are not charging extra for shipping, we have created two Add Ons specifically designed to defray the associated costs.  If you're interested in helping, please check out the Shipping and the Shipping & Handling promo cards.\n  A Ship Deck comes with 81 cards:\n1 Ship Card\n20 Adventure Cards\n60 Captain's Cards\nEnough cards to begin your Traveller exploits.  \nBackers may choose between one of four Ship Decks: \nScout\nFree Trader\nFar Trader\nSubsidized Merchant  \nEach deck is distinct, containing its own list of cards, though some may be common to multiple decks.\nThe perfect way to start your Traveller Customizable Card Game hobby, this box comes with two Ship Decks (Scout and Free Trader), 60 additional cards, a rule book and counter sheet.\nFor the discerning Traveller, we're proud to offer a Collector's Edition Starter Set.  It has the same two ship decks as the Two-Player Starter Set, but the ship cards come foil stamped.  There's also an additional 90 cards (the same 60 as the Starter Set, and then 30 more), rule book, special counters, and an exclusive Norah Wells promo card.\nProudly display your TAS card.

Between the two of us, we have six decades spent affectionately exploring the Third Imperium, and it seemed like a natural setting for a card game.   \nI quickly sketched out a basic framework for modeling the adventure, commerce and exploration inherent in Traveller, and it became clear that what we wanted the card game to feel like was something similar to playing the RPG.  Fast paced, high stakes exploits in a grounded, realistic universe.\nAfter tinkering with it for some time, I approached my friend Ian.  I had an idea.  I had a framework.  But I knew in Ian, I could find someone who could take those pieces and make them whole.  We started working in earnest on the nitty gritty of card game design.  \nWhat are the rules?  How does timing work?  What kinds of things do we like about card games, that we want to add in, and what should we avoid?  From those discussions, the game took concrete form, and we began to push what we had to playtesting.  As a result of playtesting, we improved.  We cut what didn't work.  We added what we thought was needed.\nIt's still being playtested, and always will be, progressing through internal playtesting of basic concepts, then specific sets, then specific builds and specific cards. Then pushing that process out to external playtesters, first in the local gaming scenes and then to the online community at large. \nWe're playtesting future cards, to see how they interact with current ones, and current ones to see how they can be made better and clearer for release.  We playtest during development.  We playtest during crowdfunding.  We will playtest during production, and after release, and after the next release, because card games are living things, that must be constantly managed. \nWhen we thought we really had something, we approached Marc Miller for a license.  It was a little intimidating, contacting the writer of one of our favorite IPs right out of the blue, but Marc took to the idea quickly, and we've been fortunate to benefit from his support and advice all through development.\nWhich brings us here.  We're honored just to have the opportunity to put this in front of our fellow gamers.  Your support has been truly humbling, and one of the best parts of the entire process.  \nThank You!\n                                             Who We Are\nJeff Yin (Lead Designer) is a gamer, writer, and attorney licensed by the State of California.

There are 52 cards in a standard deck. These 52 cards represent the 52 weeks in a year. The 52 cards are divided into 4 suits Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. These 4 suits represent the 4 seasons in a year. Each suit consist of 13 cards Ace through King. These 13 cards represent the 13 weeks in each season. \nStandard playing cards hidden calendar.\nThere are many more hidden variables that depict the correlation between the playing cards and the calendar. One of the most intriguing variables is when you total the value of each card in the deck you will find the sum to be 365, plus an extra joker for leap year. \nA celestial calendar with-in a deck of cards\nI have spent a great amount of time researching and designing CARDology to reveal this hidden calendar.\nThe deck I am kickstarting with is Celestial Edition. This is a 52 week celestial calendar, so you can anticipate these events from one week to the next\n    The back of the cards and the 2 jokers are original drawings by me.\n    CARDology uses each card to reptesent the 52 weeks in a year and explains major events to come. Celestial Edition, illustrates and explains astronomical events that will occur each week throughout the year. The dates of each event corresponds to the cards numeric value and suit that the standard decks consists of. \nThe 9 represents the 9th week and the hearts represent summer. Events for the 9th week of summer are revealed\n    The 9 represents the 9th week and the diamond represents the winter. The events for the 9th week of winter are revealed.\n  The Ace representing the 1st week of each season and the season, ending on the 13th week represented by the 13th card \"the King\". The order of the suits starts with spades as spring, then follows as hearts as summer, clubs as fall and diamonds as winter. The Ace of Spades begins the chronological order of events for the year.\nSpades represents spring.\n  Hearts represents summer.\n  Clubs Represents autumn/fall.\n  Diamonds represents winter.\nThe entire deck of the Celestial Edition will guide you through all of the major celestial events from the spring equinox on March 20, 2017 though the astrological year as earth makes its way around the Sun. You will know when to expect full moons, meteor showers, and planets approaching Earth. \nThis is not just a calendar, but is a tool to inspire curiosity in some of the worlds greatest mysteries. CARDollogy is exploring annual events in a scientific way, with this ancient tool.\n        Fishing Edition\n  Lunar Edition\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo design, market, and obtain Trademark, copyright and video production on my own has been a long process and very challenging. I have proven to myself that I am committed to CARDology and its success. Since the completion of CARDology Celestial Edition I have been excited to show my designs and see the public's reaction. I spent 9 months to see to it that the cards were complete before I introduce them to the world. CARDology101.com is a website I personally designed that offers a more detailed description of the scientific path that we want CARDology to stand for. I think the price is higher then I wanted to charge but to keep the shipping on schedule without problems this will cover the margin.\n\nWhen this kickstarter succeeds, I will explore other subjects as well,. one of of the most intriguing subjects I am working on is Phenology Edition. Phenology is the study of the ways plants and animals react to seasonal changes, such as nesting, blooming, spawning, migration, hibernation, estivation and how the world is connected through the cycles of life. \n\nOne of the most difficult decks for me to create has been the Planisphere Edition. A star and planet finder that animates as you flip through the 52 cards. Each card consist of a map of the sky during the time that correlates to the CARDology calendar. \n\nIn short, the challenges are high, but the risks are low. The rewards will be much more then a deck of cards.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Miss out on backing Fidget Cube?\n  What is Fidget Cube?\nFidget Cube is a desk toy for anyone who likes to fidget.\n        30 seconds of your time could make the difference in growing the Fidget Cube community. Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make Fidget Cube!\nWe can't do this without you!\n        Questions?\nAsk away! Shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer.\nFeedback?\nGot a creative idea you think we should implement with Fidget Cube? Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention. We have personally found that it helps us stay focused in boring meetings and while working on projects.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo. We've brought several Kickstarter projects to life in the past, and have learned from our experiences. While we have been relentlessly concerned with the details throughout designing, prototyping, and planning for production, there is always the chance that pesky Murphy guy may make an entrance with that law of his.\n\nIn the event that things don't go as planned, whether it's a delay in the manufacturing timeline, shipping date, or something else, we promise to communicate honestly with you and work around the clock until we correct the issue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Show Some Love", "descp": "You love the look of Fidget Cube.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Welcome to the reboot of the Super Chibi Round 2 Kickstarter by MidKnight Heroes.\nWhat's Super Chibi Round 2? It's the next step in the Super Chibi miniatures line. Super Chibi is a shared universe that spans four new and interesting worlds, created by MidKnight Heroes. Each world has its own style and flare but is 100% pure Chibi. The Super Chibi worlds have everything from mecha and cyborgs to monsters and even fantasy.\nSo, what can you use these miniatures for? Anything! They can be used for board games, role-playing games or simply collector's pieces. The ultimate goal is for the miniatures to have their own game, and this Kickstarter project takes important steps in that direction.\n The Super Chibi Round 2 Kickstarter introduces two more characters from the science fiction world in the Super Chibi universe. These characters are from the world of Super Chibi S.E.E.D., and can be used in any board game or Role Playing Game, as well as future game titles. In this Kickstarter, we are asking for help in creating these two new characters; Takata and Jaxx. This Kickstarter will cover the expense of taking them from mastered designs to completed molds and figures, and helps in providing us with funds to help produce additional figures, with an aim to populate the tech worlds of Super Chibi.  \nebook Story Book: Super Chibi S.E.E.D. Origins [Reboot Pledge only]\nJust like in our first Kickstarter, Super Chibi we will be including a book in Super Chibi Round 2 - Reboot , Super Chibi S.E.E.D. Origins. This time, it's not an art book. It's a storybook. The book will include three short stories that will explain the world, Super Chibi S.E.E.D. (Synthetic Enhanced Engineered Destroid) and the backstory of Takata and Jaxx. Just like the last book, it will be published by MONOLITH and after the Kickstarter will be sold on their site. This is something we want to do more of and you will be seeing more of this as we move forward.\nSo what is Super Chibi S.E.E.D.? S.E.E.D. stands for Synthetic Enhanced Engineered Destroid. In the world of S.E.E.D. Destroids are mecha that can either be worn as power armor or in some cases be much bigger and piloted by a human or cyborg pilot. At a certian point in the history of the world a young sicentiest created a synthetic computer to control these destroids to reduce the loss of life in the wars. Little did he know that he created more than just a computer but he created a brain. The new destroids were now aware of their sourndings and clamined that they were in fact alive. It became a heated issue and casued major termoil. A war broke out between Biologics vs S.E.E.D.s. In the end the S.E.E.D.s lost but there are still plenty of them out there casuing trouble and somehow they are increasing there numbers.\n*Note: Five random people that pledge at the Super Chibi Round 2 - Reboot pledge will get a printed version of the Super Chibi S.E.E.D. Origins book. \nNew Caster:\nWe always strive to be the best we can be and this time, this Kickstarter will feature a new caster. This caster has over 25-years of experience and has cast for companies like Reaper miniatures, Avatars of War and has even done work for Adepticon as well. We feel that they are a perfect fit for the Midknight Heroes family.\nEach of our miniatures will be scaled at 30mm, cast in resin and will require assembly and paint. All miniatures in this Kickstarter are intended for play in our upcoming Super Chibi A.C.E. game, launching via Kickstarter, next year. [See the bottom of this page for more info on A.C.E]\nCurrent Goal: $2,000\nCurrent characters seeking to fund:\nMe'Thule, The Robotic Knight [Unlocks at 2,000]\nINITIAL Funding goal: $1.250, FUNDED!\nTakata, the Cynobi assassin: FUNDED!\n    PLAY\n\n Jaxx, S.E.E.D. Special Forces Officer. FUNDED!\n     PLAY\n\n    Don't want both? That's fine, all core miniatures can be added to your pledge as an add-on, of $10 per character. Also, other add-ons will be allowed from our first Kickstarter, Super Chibi. Want a Midknight miniature? Get her. How about a Damien Kane? He's all yours! Just add an extra $10 to your pledge and they will be yours. Any stretch goal from Super Chibi Round 2 that's unlocked can be added as well in this manner. \n*Note: Any miniature that is purchased as an add-on that was part of the Super Chibi Kickstarter will be from our first cast and therefor not cast by our new caster. \n **Note: Chibi Elvia is not offered as an Addon, but if you chose the Mega Chibi Pledge she will be included.\n  Shipping:  \nWe will charge shipping after the Kickstarter, based on the actual costs and weight. This will be collected after the campaign ends via our pledge manager.  \nIMPORTANT: DO NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO COVER YOUR POSTAGE PAYMENT IN YOUR PLEDGE AT THIS TIME.  \nAny funds collected through the KS system are reduced by 10% when Kickstarter collects their fees; this means that any funds collected to cover postage are 10% less than what is actually needed to cover postage, if the postage rates do not increase at the time of billing and shipping (postal rates have increased on us during our projects at least once prior to fulfillment; in one case, the rates increased twice).  \nAfter the campaign ends, backers will be able to select their rewards, via the pledge manager. Shipping costs will be calculated at that time. You will also be able to select additional reward options at that time if you wish.  \nPostage will be calculated by region when backers make their choices via our pledge management system. All postage fees must be paid before shipment can be completed. Rewards will be posted from the United States to all backer's addresses.  \nPostage ESTIMATES by region: (please note these are estimates only; your actual shipping charge may be higher or lower depending on the rates at the time of shipping).  \nUS $4.00 - $15.00 (1st Class or Priority Mail)  \nCAN / UK / EU $15.00 - $25.00  \nAU / NZ / ROW $15 - $30.  \nMidKnight Heroes is not responsible for any customs duties, taxes or fees incurred as a result.  \nUS rewards may be shipped via either USPS 1st Class or USPS Priority mail. All International Mail is shipped USPS 1st Class International mail.\n***Note: We have seen with our last set that it can be stuck in customs for a while. IF this does happen there is nothing we can do out side of wait.\nSuper Chibi A.C.E. Playtest\nSo some of you are probably wondering what is this Super Chibi A.C.E.? Well, that's a good question. You see we just don't want to make miniatures, we want to make games as well. Super Chibi A.C.E. (formerly Super Chibi Clash the game) is our first step in that direction. Why bring it up now? Well these miniatures as well as our first Kickstarter miniatures will be apart of that game. Watch this quick video as we explain what Super Chibi A.C.E. is.\nWe want to say: Thank You!  \nThank you so much for your interest in Super Chibi, and doubly so for backing it if you chose to, as well! This can't be done without all of you. You're the ones who make MidKnight Heroes what it is today, and for that, we say thank YOU. If this campaign is funded, it will be because of your generous support and encouragement, and that means we get to not only produce it but also share it and make it available to the fantastic tabletop community. We want to give special thanks to, CPOP and MONOLITH they have been a huge partner and friend through this whole process.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur core development team is made up of artists, writers and game designers. This is the team that first started working on the project and has done most of the work to bring it to you. We realized early in the project that our greatest challenge in bringing our vision to life, would be finding a great sculptor. We have done our research and found the best sculptor for the job. His name, Heriberto Valle Martinez.\n\nA big part of this Kickstarter is to gain the funding to pay for the sculpts and overall production of the miniatures. We have thoroughly researched the costs associated with sculpting, molding, production and shipping of the first set of miniatures. We are confident that we have considered all of the costs that will be associated with this project.\n\nOur biggest challenge will be the time needed to sculpt and produce the miniatures. As the sculptors have to do all of their work after the project funds, the time-frame following the Kickstarter may be longer than we initially wanted. Bear with us, these miniatures will be awesome and well worth the wait. We will keep you informed with regular updates on the progress of the project. We're not going to be idle while the sculptors are doing their work, however. The rest of the team will be busy developing the future line of miniatures and finishing games for future releases.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Super Pledge", "descp": "Our many thanks for your help in getting this project off the ground; we couldn't do this without you.

In order to extend the total solution of our gardening multi-tool we will be making available, starting today, the ability to upgrade your pledge to include our brand new attachments for the multi-tool.\nIn order to upgrade your current pledge please add $20 to your pledge amount for a single additional attachment (not including the handle) of your choice or $35 for both of the additional attachments (not including the handle).\nNote* These are only mock images and not to the exact scale of the real product we will deliver.\nIf you already pledged to our campaign, then simply click \"Manage Pledge\", change your amount and then get ready for the best gardening multi-tool to be delivered to your door!\nIf you haven't pledged yet, please first purchase the Mulch Fork & Spade tool and then upgrade your pledge by choosing one of the NEW attachment rewards.\nThe Grain Scoop is the ultimate all-purpose utility attachment. It\u2019s easy to wear out your wrist and arm with repeated lifting of a normal grain scoop, especially if the load is heavy. We\u2019ve solved that problem with our attachment being locked into our patented ergonomic handle. Now you can do a whole host of tasks and chores without the stress and strain. Load up our Grain Scoop attachment with: Grain, corn, and chicken feed \u00b7 Potting soil \u00b7 Fine compost \u00b7 Bird seed \u00b7 Grass seed \u00b7 Fertilizer \u00b7 Rock salt and other ice melt \u00b7 Pea gravel \u00b7 Sand \u00b7 Mortar mix \u00b7 Charcoal brickettes\nThe Transplant Divider is the perfect tool for precision transplanting or dividing of delicate perennials. The size and shape is designed to slice cleanly through roots. The handle gives you power to push through the soil and leverage to pry the plant out of the ground. Now, you can even divide plants (like Hosta) during the growing season without crushing their foliage. A regular shovel requires you to step on it to get power (smashing the leaves), and a trowel is usually too small (no power). The Transplant Divider attachment is just right for anyone who wants to be a fine gardener.\nGarden Smarter, Not Harder\nThe Mulch Fork & Spade is an ergonomically designed one-arm gardening multi-tool for applying mulch and compost. It has an interchangeable spade attachment that makes it the perfect planting tool for perennials and annuals. Whether you are a backyard gardener or a professional landscape designer, the Mulch Fork & Spade is designed to relieve back and wrist strain typically inflicted from traditional gardening tools.\nFor anyone who struggles with the awkward and frustrating chore of mulching or composting their garden, The Mulch Fork & Spade brings ease and finesse because of its smart ergonomic design that allows for easy one-arm operation. The spade attachment provides incredible leverage and power to dig while keeping your wrist in a comfortable position for planting perennials and annuals.\nThe Mulch Fork & Spade\nRewards\nSteve Van Valin - Owner and Inventor of The Mulch Fork & Spade\nA graduate of Longwood Garden\u2019s continuing education program, Stephen Van Valin holds two Certificates of Merit in Ornamental Plants (I and II) \nOwner of Harmony Garden Design Group, specializing in garden design, consulting, and plant procurement\nInventor of the newly patented gardening multi-tool called The Gardenomic Mulch Fork and Spade\u2122 \nCo-author of The Garden Report read by Herb Clarke on KYW NewsRadio 1060 (formerly) \nHas made appearances as a gardening expert for WCAU Philadelphia affiliate NBC10 news Director and producer of The Garden View, a television gardening show pilot \nA graduate of the Nature Lyceum of Long Island, NY \nCurrently writing a book entitled The Nature of Creativity \n A graduate of Longwood Garden\u2019s continuing education program, Stephen Van Valin holds two Certificates of Merit in Ornamental Plants (I and II) Owner of Harmony Garden Design Group, specializing in garden design, consulting, and plant procurement \nA graduate of Susquehanna University, Steve maintains membership in The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, Longwood Gardens, The American Horticultural Society, The Hardy Plant Society, Garden Writers Association of America, and The Delaware Valley Water Garden Society.\nFAQs\nQ: I\u2019m left handed. Can I still use The Mulch Fork?\nA: Yes, absolutely. It works equally well with either hand. That makes it convenient if you get a little tired and want to switch hands, or you need access in tight spaces to mulch with your other hand.\nQ: I have a very short forearm. How do I know if The Mulch Fork is the right size for me?\nA: The Mulch Fork comes in one size that was designed for nearly all men and women. The unique design accommodates both short and long forearms.\nQ: Will I still need a regular long-handle pitchfork to do my mulching or composting?\nA: It depends. If you have mulch delivered in bulk, then a regular pitchfork is still a useful tool for moving it from the pile into a wheelbarrow. You can use The Mulch Fork exclusively to extract mulch or compost from the wheelbarrow to apply in your garden. It\u2019s just so much easier. If you buy mulch in bags, you may not need a regular pitchfork again. The Mulch Fork can easily extract mulch right out of the bag, or better yet, empty your bags into a wheelbarrow and lift the mulch from there.\nQ: How much faster can I apply mulch with The Mulch Fork?\nA: Because it is so much more maneuverable, you should find that The Mulch Fork is a lot faster than using a regular long-handled pitchfork (especially out of a wheelbarrow). I should save you a lot of time and effort if you\u2019re moving a lot of mulch. Plus, being able to apply exactly where you want it in the first time, saves a ton of time by not having to unbury plants or pull mulch away from tree trunks and shrub branches. \nQ: How much can you really lift with just one arm?\nA: We\u2019ve found that a man or women of average strength can easily lift a full heaping scoop of mulch or compost (even if wet). The ergonomic handle presses comfortably against your forearm and creates powerful lifting leverage. Plus, your wrist is positioned in a powerful posture that takes full advantage of your arm strength. A full scoop load of mulch weighs approximately 5 lbs.\nQ: Will I be able to lift fine textured compost without it falling through the forks?\nA: Yes. We designed the tines to be close enough to hold compost very effectively. Also, you\u2019ll be able to turn your compost pile even if it\u2019s inside a tight bin because of The Mulch Fork\u2019s compact size and maneuverability.\nQ: What if I find that I really don\u2019t like it. Can I return it?\nA: Yes. We are offering a full one-year guarantee. We want you to be thrilled with it. \nQ: How hard is it to change the different head attachments?\nA: The treaded collar is fairly easy to screw on and off. There is a metal tongue insert that fits into the handle that gives it stability and reinforcement. Although it is not as quick-changing as a battery powered toothbrush for example, it only takes about 45 seconds to take the tines off and put the shovel attachment on.\nQ: What is the handle made of?\nA: High Density Polyethylene. It is a strong and durable type of plastic.\nQ: What are the tines made of?\nA: Coated carbon steel.\nQ: Where is The Mulch Fork made?\nA: We are a USA based company, and are sourcing the product manufacturing in China. \nQ: When will we receive our products as a result of pledging on Kickstarter?\nA: We anticipate being able to manufacture, and ship to you for arrival in Mid-September. We will keep you full informed of the status and if it changes occur during the process.\nQ: What are the other attachments that will be available in the future?\nA: We plan to offer several other attachment options including: A flat-point shovel head (useful for dividing perennials, small shrubs and edging), A grain scoop (for flinging seed, sand, salt, and compost, etc.), A digging fork (a 4-prong fork for penetrating soil) A cultivator (A bent fork-like attachment for working up the soil)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFulfillment: We are planning to place the order to have The Mulch Fork and Spade manufactured immediately following our Kickstarter campaign once we reach our goal.

It\u2019s also just very nice handwriting, which perhaps shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise: Einstein\u2019s equations were beautiful, so it makes sense that their presentation should be as well!\u201d\n-Phil Marshall, Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at SLAC Stanford University\nThe image shows, the working prototype of the font.\nNice to meet you! We are Harald and Liz, the creators of the Albert Einstein handwriting font.\nWe would like your help to finish production of our invention: a font based upon the handwriting of Albert Einstein. The Albert Einstein font will be compatible with most digital devices, allowing you to \"write like a genius\" on your computer and phone. \nOur project honors Einstein\u2019s innovative style of thinking, which was imaginative, rigorous, and playful. The 2015 release is also coincides with the centennial of the General Theory of Relativity.\n\"Relativit\u00e4tstheorie\" (German for Theory of Relativity) - Used with permission of the Albert Einstein Archive, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nThe working prototype of the font is pictured here. With this Kickstarter project we are looking to raise funds to invest six-months into the design. Our vision is to make the font even more \"life-like\" and complete. This involves creating many variations of each letter, and also adding numbers, punctuation, and even mathematical symbols. Back this project with $15 or more and you will receive the Albert Einstein font.\nWhat is a font?\nFonts are the \u201csoftware\u201d that allow text (letters, punctuation, numbers etc.) to appear on your screen. Common fonts are Times, Arial, and Helvetica. Soon you can also use Albert Einstein's handwriting as a font too!\nTo answer common questions about how fonts are made and how they work, Harald provides a detailed tutorial below. \nProject History\nOriginal document and transcription in the Albert Einstein font.\nThe Albert Einstein font is collaboration between a typographer and a dancer: Harald Geisler, graduate of the University of Art and Design Offenbach in Germany, and Liz Waterhouse, BA Physics from Harvard and former dancer with the Forsythe Company in Frankfurt. \nThe collaboration began in 2009, over a series of coffees in Frankfurt. Liz remembers looking at a text written in a handwriting font (on her napkin at the coffee shop) and asking Harald if he could design one. The idea to make a \u201clife-like\u201d handwriting font from studying penmanship of innovative thinkers came next.\nThe choice to start with Albert Einstein\u2019s handwriting was aesthetic and pragmatic, even a bit nostalgic given Liz\u2019s memories of reading Einstein's nonscientific essays as a teenager. Perhaps it should come as no surprise that Einstein had beautiful handwriting. \u201cEinstein's equations were beautiful, so it makes sense that their presentation should be as well!\" says Astrophysicist Phil Marshall (at SLAC Stanford). Einstein\u2019s handwriting reflected movement with clear rhythm, even flow, and soft curves. Harald's task was to develop a font that preserved that feel. \nDetail of original document (written in German) with overlayed digital font.\nAfter six months studying examples of Einstein\u2019s handwriting from documents in the Albert Einstein Archives, Harald created a working prototype. Working with a digital pen to follow the rhythm of Einstein\u2019s movement on paper, Geisler\u2019s result had a pleasing and strong resemblance to Einstein\u2019s actual handwriting. In 2014 the Einstein Estate accepted the proposal for an Albert Einstein font.\nKickstarter\nHarald has had five successful projects on Kickstarter, including his annual Typographic Wall calendar (in 2010, 2011, 2012 & 2013) as well as his previous handwriting font, the Sigmund Freud Typeface (2013). By releasing the font via Kickstarter, the team hopes to extend the current state of the design and to share the invention with a diverse audience.\nBellow you will find the following\u2026\nRewards\nStretch Goals\nHow is a handwriting font designed? \nCurrent status of the Albert Einstein font\nBudgeting \nTime frame\nWhat is an EULA?\nCredits\nRewards\nRecognizing the potentially broad community of teachers, design enthusiasts, scientists, Einstein fans and scholars who may be interested in backing this project, we have created a diverse assortment of rewards that enable you to take-home and help-out.\nThe most important reward is the font itself!

The entry was made in Pasadena. The Text around the fish says (my translation from German to English):\n\"4. XII Open sea. Warm Sky White. Huge (1 meter) white-fishes play and jump above the water surface (Drawing) Paparazzi-plague verbally and telegraphic (!) But I am calculating on the law of motion. \u2026\"\nUsed with permission of the Albert Einstein Archive, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem\nThis image of the playful white-fish above the water surface stuck with me and I hope it will also make it on one of the postcards. If the campaign reaches 2222 Backers I am going to add drawings or dingbats (or emojis) to the font. Of course just drawings from Einstein himself like the one above. I am looking forward to your suggestions, head over to the Einstein Archive and browse the manuscripts - every suggestion from you I will try to add to the font.\nHow is a handwriting font designed?\nby Harald Geisler\nSo far I've published two handwriting fonts: the Sigmund Freud Typeface, based on Freud's handwriting, and Conspired Lovers, a font based on my own letter writing. \nIn the following tutorial I will use examples from the design process of the Sigmund Freud Typeface to explain different aspects of designing a handwriting font. If you are interested in more details, I have also written a more in-depth article on my process for smashingmagazine.com.\nLet's begin with a simple example. When I type the word 'look' in a regular font, the two 'o' look the same. Handwriting has a vivid character because one never writes the same letter twice. \nHow can a font look like handwriting? One approach to create the natural and vivid look of handwriting is to draw ligatures for frequently recurring letter combinations. Ligatures are drawings of a combination of two or more letters, for example th or re. Yet with this method all \"th\" and all \"re\" will look the same.\nIn my last Kickstarter Project about creating a Typeface that renders Sigmund Freud's Handwriting, I developed a new approach to the situation. Instead of creating one ligature for a specific pair of letters, I created four alternate versions of each letter that automatically \"rotate\" or \"switch\" as you type.\nI call this method polyalphabetic substitution. The term is borrowed from cryptology, because the algorithm in the font is inspired by the rotating barrels of an Engima encryption machine.\nThe font's algorithm is not encrypting the message but disguising its computerized origin and therefore creating a look nearly as vivid as handwriting.\nIn handwriting all letters are connected. How is this possible on a computer? Every writer has their own angle at which one letter connects to the next. Not all letters connect at the same angle, but there is an average. The green guides in the picture below show the average angle of Sigmund Freud's handwriting:\nThe design process starts with an research and analysis of the handwriting. I read all kind of different documents and mark certain letters that I find not necessarily beautiful but typical for the writers' hand.\nLetter from Sigmund Freud to his grandson. All manuscripts from Freud by the courtesy of the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna.\nThese I keep in a notebook:\nBy hand I digitize the selected letterforms using a cintiq, which is basically a bigger iPad with a very precise pen that allows me to draw directly into the design software.\nFor me it is important not to scan the image of the letters, nor simply to trace them with an automated software. By reproducing in this analog-digital way, I become familiar with the hand of a writer by copying characteristic letters. Learning the movement that a writer made to create a letter is essential to creating its digital counterpart.\nAnalyzing how another writer makes the bow of an \u201cl\u201d or the slope of a \u201cg\u201d also affects your own handwriting has surprising side-effects. Suddenly, I found myself writing my grocery lists with Einsteinian (or Freudian) loops and hoops.\nThe recorded stroke is then modified to render the effect of ink flow from the used writing tool. In this case a pen that creates thick down strokes and a thin upstroke :\nThis shape is then placed in a font creation software:\nThis process is repeated for all letters and alternate letters used in the font. How often? For example the Sigmund Freud font has 1467 Glyphs to render text that comes very close to actual handwriting.\nCurrent status of the Albert Einstein font\nCurrently the Albert Einstein font has 432 Glyphs. \nWith this campaign I want to extend the current set of letters to at least four complete sets of lower and uppercase letters, numbers, punctuation and accented letters for international communication.\nSince Einstein was a physicist and mathematician I would also like to include some of the signs necessary to write mathematical equations. With the physicist reward, experts can help by making suggestions-- taking a step towards towards reproducing the complex formulas that Einstein wrote in his notebooks. \nTime frame\nFingers crossed:\nJune campaign succeeds: send out the prototype font to backers.\nDesign Phase I \u2022 Summer 2015, design 2nd alphabet\nEnd July 2015 first pre-release to backers with two altering alphabets\nDesign Phase II \u2022 Sept 2015, design 3rd alphabet\nEnd September 2015 2nd release to backers  with three altering alphabets\nOctober: Other typographic project: Typographic Wall Calendar 2016\nDesign Phase III \u2022 Nov 2015, design 4th alphabet  \nEnd November 2015 final release to backers with four altering alphabets\nRelease Party \u2022 Early December 2015 final release of font to the public. (If stretch goals are reached this will of course delay the final release of the Typeface.)\nShipping \u2022 by mid-January 2016 finishing design of prints and customized rewards (framing, packaging, shipping).\nBudgeting \u2022 How will the Funding be used?\nA Time & Design. Most of the effort will go into drawing the different alphabets and putting them together into the font file. The more funding directed towards this, the more beautiful the result will be for all backers. Funding will cover studio-rent and  bills during the six-month development phase as well as a stipend for the creative work. It will also support reaching out to the Kickstarter community and communicating to Press about the Project.\nB Licensing fees\nC Production and shipping costs. Physical rewards (e.g. a framed picture from Einstein, Einstein Posters, Swiss Chocolate)  include shipping and production costs. Shipments from Germany to world wide destinations can be very pricey. An amount of the funding will be spent on sending out the rewards from Harald Geisler's Typographic Studio in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.\nD Kickstarter fee\nE Stripe payment processing fee\nEULA \u2022 What is an EULA?\nEULA means End User License Agreement. Since a font is not only design but also software we need to agree on many things for example what are my responsibilities and what can you expect from this software. You can read the EULA for the Albert Einstein and all my other fonts right here.\nCreators Biographies\nAlbert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on March 14, 1879. As a child, Einstein revealed an extraordinary curiosity for understanding the mysteries of science. In 1905, while working as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, the young physicist Einstein obtained his Doctorate degree and published four of his most influential research papers, including the Special Theory of Relativity. In that, the now world famous equation \u201ce = mc2\u2033 unlocked mysteries of the Universe theretofore unknown. Ten years later, in 1915, Einstein completed his General Theory of Relativity and in 1922 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. It also launched him to international superstardom and his name became a household word synonymous with genius all over the world. Einstein was a founder of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and bequeathed his intellectual property to the institution upon his death in 1955. Recognized as TIME magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Century\u201d in 1999, Einstein\u2019s intellect, coupled with his strong passion for social justice and dedication to pacifism, left the world with infinite knowledge and the legacy of pioneering moral leadership.\nHarald Geisler was born in Frankfurt am Main and his work is situated between art and typography. His latest font design, the Sigmund Freud Typeface, became the first typeface to be featured in the Wall Street Journal. He is also the publisher of the recent reissue of the Swiss design classic \u201cDesigning Programms\u201d by Karl Gerstner, with Lars M\u00fcller Publishers Z\u00fcrich.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Sitting Ducks Gallery is a hysterically fun, stick-it-to-your-neighbor, line manipulation game invented by Keith Meyers. Sitting Ducks is reminiscent of the classic carnival-style, midway shooting galleries, where players are trying to take out as many ducks as possible. Players move ducks and targets, take aim, and eventually eliminate other players\u2019 ducks using a variety of humorous Action Cards, while trying to keep their own safe.  The goal is to be the last duck in the pond!\nSitting Ducks Deluxe will have all new ducks!\nIntroducing: Customized Ducks! You can now make your Sitting Ducks Deluxe uniquely yours by choosing your own ducks for the Duck Deck! Customize your game by adding on (see Add-Ons) a set of 6 (matching) ducks of your choosing - and play with different ducks each game!\nMore new ducks just added!\nNew! Hula Duck\nYou can even add your own text to the card, to make it truly unique. Add your name, a friend's name or family name or give it as a gift! There is no limit to the number of customized ducks that you can add.  \nFor example, if you\u2019d like to play with Duck Vader, you can Add On a set of 6 Duck Vaders, and, if you\u2019d like, add your name (or some other text) right onto the card (a). So, for our example, pretend your name is John and you\u2019d like your Duck Vader Cards to read, \u201cDarth John.\u201d We\u2019ll put that on your specialized cards for you! Or just leave it without the text (b).\nAnother great aspect of the Customized Duck Deck cards is that they allow you to add more players to the game! Add one set to play up to seven players, and add a second set to play up to eight!\nIn Sitting Ducks, each player gets their own group of ducks. Those ducks are shuffled together and form the Duck Deck, which then become the Duck line.\nThe Duck line is always in flux - when a Duck is removed; the other ducks move forward to fill the gap.  Certain cards can move the line forward, backwards or rearrange ducks in the line in your favor or your opponents. With the right cards, players may also move and manipulate targets to try to keep their own Ducks safe.  \nEventually, you\u2019ll get caught snoozing and you will surely lose some of your ducks. \nLose all of your ducks, and you can no longer win the game.  But, one of the most fun aspects of Sitting Ducks is when all of your ducks have been eliminated from the game. Although you won\u2019t win, you\u2019ll still get a chance to exact revenge on the opponents who took you out and play Action Cards for the rest of the game! The last player to have a duck in the water is the winner!\nHere's a quick video explaining the gameplay:\nPLAY\n\nSince its original release, Sitting Ducks Gallery has received great reviews and international attention. The Game has received high honors including awards such as Major Fun, Golden Geek and Fairplay!\n\"The game (for 3-6 players, ages 10 and older, with 20-30 minutes to devote to something significantly fun) is humorously illustrated and well-made. We loved the look and feel of the cards and were taken by the cleverness of the simulated shooting gallery... \n\"It\u2019s most definitely a competitive game. Basically, you\u2019re trying to shoot everyone else\u2019s ducks, hoping, in the mean time, to duck everyone else\u2019s shots. One of the things we appreciated most about the game was that even if all your ducks get shot, you still get to stay in the game, shooting merrily away at your opponents until only one player has any ducks left. \n\"Despite all the different kinds of Action Cards, game play continues to be elegant, enjoyable, and essentially ducky. It is easy to learn, and remains fun to the very end. Major FUN.\" - MajorFun.com\n\"High production values, a fun theme, and bright cheerful atmosphere make Sitting Ducks Gallery one of my favorite from its genre...\n\"It's fast and fun; and while there's a smidgen of tactics in the game, it's mostly just a way for up to six people to blow off steam and laugh, while shooting at other folk's ducks.\" - Tom Vasel\nNow, for the 10th year anniversary and with this Deluxe Edition of Sitting Ducks Gallery, we have added unique ducks, introduced hilarious new action cards and we have developed new mechanics to modify the gameplay. We want to increase the ability to have more players and include all of these great additional cards to the game with hilarious references and images by Randy Martinez.\nBackers at various support levels will be thanked with a variety of rewards:\nWhen we reach certain levels, we will begin adding cool stuff to the game, including a board, more cards, and other additions that will upgrade and modify the game! \nBackers may feel free to add on as many extras as they like - just be sure to include in your pledge enough to cover the purchase and shipping, and explain in your backer survey what you'd like to add.  \nTo purchase this add on, include an additional $35 to your pledge. Unless your pledge level already requires shipping, add $9 for the US, $20 for Canada and $25 for international.  If your pledge already includes shipping, please include an additional $6 for US, or $5 more for Canada and international.\nTo purchase this add on, include an additional $20 to your pledge. Unless your pledge level already requires shipping, add $9 for the US, $20 for Canada and $25 for international.

Among these hallowed pearls, a black pearl formed and fell away into the sea\u2014unseen and obscured. The shadowy isle of Kagejima was thus born into the world shrouded in darkness, moonlight and magic.\nThe first explorers of this mystical land immediately felt the island\u2019s influence. Hardy and rugged explorers, far from the powers of the Imperial Court and fiercely independent, the people who made Kagejima their home were touched by the island\u2019s magic and the six mystical powers: Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, Spirit and Void.

Creating cross-overs of every ninja clan, Hero, and Ronin in Ninja All-Stars would run counter to the very exciting plans we have for the Wandering Monk Mountain region of Super Dungeon. However, just like our fans, we could not resist the idea of brave Heroes battling ninja in beautiful temples and mist-haunted wilderness. So we created the Super Dungeon: Ninja Pack. \nNot final art.\nThe Ninja Pack includes a new Elemental Affinity mechanic. This allows players to choose an Elemental Affinity for their ninja at the beginning of the game, granting them new and interesting abilities. This mechanic allows you to easily represent any (or every) Ninja All-Stars clan in your games of Super Dungeon. The Hero profiles and Elemental Affinity allow you to choose any Ninja All-Stars Hero or Ronin model to represent your Master or Mystic. \nSuper Dungeon Ninjas includes: Wandering Master and Wandering Mystic Heroes, Elemental Affinity reference card, Oni mini-boss, Elemental Shrine paired spawning point, Classic and Arcade Mode Chunin, Kunoichi, Madoushi, Kaiken, and Yajiri cards.\nThe Super Dungeon: Ninja Pack is included for free with your All-Star pledge!\nKarate Fight is a fast-paced, speed matching card game in the tradition of Slapjack, Egyptian Ratscrew, and Snip-Snap-Snorem. Karate Fight already has a popular Takoashi University Edition, but we couldn't resist making a Ninja All-Stars version, so our adorable and awesome ninjas could battle it out!\nKarate Fight: Ninja All-Stars Edition is available as an optional purchase in Shojo's Shop for $10.\nShipping will be charged after the campaign through our store-based pledge manager, based on the actual cost to ship your pledge and the additional rewards you select. We only charge the actual cost to ship. We do not charge any additional handling fees.\nWe are happy to say that we have secured fulfillment options in multiple countries to reduce your shipping costs significantly. We will have shipping hubs in the United States, Canada, UK, Germany, Hong Kong, and Australia. This means that you will not be required to pay the customs or VAT fees usually incurred by shipping from the United States.   \nOur current estimate for shipping costs are (in USD): UK $10, US $15, Canada $20, Europe $20, Australia $25, Rest of World $30. Please note that these are estimates only and may change as we unlock more items or if you purchase additional rewards. \nThis Kickstarter has no exclusive models! Every ninja, Ronin, and Hero we unlock will be available in some form at your friendly local game store or the Soda Pop Store. You and your friends can play the complete game no matter when you discover it.\n\nSo what do you get for backing? You will help make Ninja All-Stars a reality. Funding also determines how many models and new units we can produce. That's right, your help will make Ninja All-Stars have more models, more art, and a bigger world far sooner than we could without you. You also get a ton of models early, at incredible Kickstarter prices, in a swank Kickstarter Edition game box. That's pretty fantastic!\n\nShrines are pieces of terrain that players can place on the game board before each challenge. When a shrine is placed on the game board the player decides one status effect that the shrine radiates. Curse, Poison, and Slow are detrimental status effects. Haste, Lucky, and Protect are positive status effects. When a ninja moves within one space of a shrine that radiates a detrimental status effect, they must make an affinity test. If they fail the test, the ninja suffers the detrimental status effect. When they move within one space of a shrine that radiates a positive status effect they may make an affinity test. If the test is successful they gain the benefits of the positive status effect.\n\nThe Ronin Yagyu Jubei is available for hire at Shojo's Shop. \nThe Hero Akkorakamui is added to the Clan Ika Box.

Easier to attain Stretch goals now start at $50K!\nThe Pumm'ler is IN!  Thanks Backers!\nThis is the initial release of this BRAND NEW version of Tumblin\u2019 Dice -- developed especially by Creator Rick Soued of Eagle-Gryphon Games and game designer Randy Nash. You'll get a new, multi-colored board made of high-quality, light-weight wood, with newly-designed dice, pegs and legs -- and all for the sensational price of $60!\nTumblin\u2019 Dice is a dexterity dice board game consisting of a multi-colored playing field with four sets of colored dice that a player can slide, roll, and flick down its stepped surface. After each person or team has thrown their 4 dice, points are tallied and totaled.\nA player can score a multiplier with each die roll, gaining up to 1x, 2x, 3x, or 4x depending on which area of the board the dice rest in. (Dice which land in the 0x region are immediately removed from play.)\nJust like shuffleboard or curling, high scoring rolls can become targets for opponents who may hope to knock the die out of the game. Four rounds are played and the player with the most points wins!\nUnique Gameplay! \u2013 Bring the fun of yard game classics to your living room. Perfect for a rainy day or an evening in!\nGet a great price! Only $60 for KS backers. When this game is released for sale to the public, it will retail for $79.99.\nStretch Goals - Will be included to make your Kickstarter version of the game, and this deal, that much better. \nBundled Deals! - ADD-Ons with TERRIFIC prices on other Eagle-Gryphon games featuring DICE can be added to any pledge of $55 or more.\n Tumblin' Dice includes:\nHigh Quality multi-layered and multi-colored wooden game board with Four Interlocking Pieces\n7 Legs and 12 bumper pegs\n16 six-sided Dice in 4 Colors\nRulebook\n BRAND NEW VARIANTS for Tumblin\u2019 Dice have been created, including:\nTumblin\u2019 Cricket: Score with each side of the die four times. Rolling a die face on the same-numbered multiplier step counts as scoring multiple times (e.g. Rolling a two on the 2x multiplier step would count as rolling a two twice; while rolling a three on the 3x multiplier step would count as a three thrice; etc.)\nOh-One: Start with a score of 101, 201, or 301, etc. Subtract each round\u2019s points from your score until one player has exactly 0 points.\nTumble Down the Stairs: Score each side of the dice in each zone once. First to score all possible combinations wins.\nTumblin\u2019 Baseball: Each die is a batter for your side. Each multiplier is a single, double, triple, or home run. But be careful, if you roll a 1 or a two, your batter is tagged out by the fielding team. Player with the highest score after 9 innings wins.\nTumblers & Liars: A combination of Liar\u2019s Dice and Tumblin\u2019 Dice. Each round the player with the lowest score loses a die. If a player knocks another player\u2019s die out of the game, they can steal one die. Last player standing wins.\n\n  How do I add something onto my pledge?\nYou simply add the amount of money needed to purchase any of the add-ons below to your pledge!  You can always change the amount of your pledge (while the KS project is active) by using the \"Manage My Pledge\" button.\n\nWhere or how do I indicate the specific item(s) I have added-on?\nAbout 7-14 days after this KS project ends we will send you a survey and ask you to indicate exactly how to allocate your pledge between the base game and the add-ons offered here.

Cool Stuff, Inc will handle fulfillment of this Kickstarter!  By popular demand, Cool Stuff will arrange to have pick-ups at both GenCon and BGG.Con possible for Backers of this game.  The fee for this service will be $5, please add that amount to your pledge if you expect to pick up at either GenCon or BGG.Con (you will need to indicate your shipping destination is Antarctica to get this $5 option and then change that when you fill out your survey to your proper address).\nThis is a big box (with packaging it will be 18\" by 16\" by 6\") and it requires protection as well. Packaged, it will weigh about 6.5 lbs. (3 KG).  So shipping is not cheap but we will do the best we can to find group opportunities in various countries which might reduce shipping costs.  We will ship US orders from Florida; Canadian orders from Ontario; Australian orders from Canberra; and Asian orders from China (mainland).\nTumblin' Dice will ship to many places in the world, but not to Europe--sorry!  U.S. shipping will be added automatically by Kickstarter as follows:\nOne copy = $18 to USA destinations (exception AK and HI = $34).  For two copies of the game in the US, shipping will be $27 (AK and HI = $60). We will offer a pick up service in the US at both GenCon and at BGG.Con for a $5 service fee--you will need to indicate your shipping destination is Antarctica to get this $5 option and then change that when you fill out your survey to your proper address.\nThe terms of our contract to produce Tumblin' Dice prohibit us from selling the game in the EU, or Europe in general, sorry!  To purchase a version of this game in Europe, please contact our good friends at Ferti Games (www.ferti-games.com) in France.\nFor most all other countries, the shipping is automatically added to your pledge. Internationally, we pay for shipping from China; customs and government fees and taxes; dock fees; transport to warehouse expenses; warehouse fulfillment charges (including handling and materials) and the postal rates charged by your country. If your country shows $0 (that would be impossible for us; or $500 (that would be impossible for you) then please send us a Message (not a Comment please) and tell us what you want and where you want it shipped to.  Thanks!\nIt has been our experience that many people (including sophisticated Kickstarter Backers) frequently confuse \"shipping\" expense and \"postage\" expense. What we try to cover with the above fees (in part) is shipping expenses, not just postage. Postage is the actual charge your country's postal service (or UPS, FedEx, etc) charges us to deliver a package within that country. Shipping is far more comprehensive and includes: getting the container shipped to the US, or Australia; the Customs and VAT (or equivalent) and other import fees and taxes; the drayage from the port to the warehouse (not cheap!); the warehouse fees to unload and sort out and prepare packages; the materials and labor involved in the last item; fees to the warehouse for their service to us, and only after all of that, the postage! We need to cover all of those costs--and they really add up. Frequently they cost as much or more than the game(s) did to produce. When we combine a low margin price (such as this one we are offering on Tumblin\u2019 Dice) with this shipping expense, we do not make any profit if we are not very careful. The shipping we are charging for this project is as low as we can make it and still stay in business.\nInternationally, for two or more games, get in touch with us and tell us the total of how many games you want and which ones; and where you would like them shipped.  To get in touch with us, please send us a Message (not a Comment please) using the \"Contact Me\" button at the top.\nWe will not ship to Russia, the Ukraine and select other places except for specially-made arrangements wherein the Backer takes the risk involved in getting the package actually delivered.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEagle-Gryphon Games stands by our products, but sometimes issues do happen.

We will obtain tracking information when it is possible, but sometimes it is not. We cannot guarantee that there will not be shipping problems, as we cannot guarantee the service and reliability of the various postal/delivery services involved around the world. You will have to assume that risk along with us.\n\nEagle-Gryphon Games has completed 42 Kickstarter projects to date. 37 of those projects have completed delivery.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Exploding Kittens is a highly strategic kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.  \nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). As a rough estimate, the game will cost about $10 to ship in the USA and to Hong Kong, about $15 to Australia, about $15-$25 in the EU and Canada, all the way up to $50 to Singapore and South America,  but this may increase or decrease based on the quantity of stretch goals we might unlock and your carrier choices.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities  We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project but instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 15th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\n\nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is July 2015, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely - we've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, and will begin shipping Wrath of Kings and XenoShyft soon.\n\nWe have four ongoing projects currently: XenoShyft, which is in the final stages of production, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, and The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there.

However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible.

Just remember, time is running out, and you and your neighbors are competing for the same resources. If you are going to survive, you will need a healthy mix of strategy and flexibility as available supplies change and events unfold.\n Players start with a Homestead card and very limited currency and food.

Currency and item cards used get placed back into the player\u2019s discard pile and can be used again as they come up in a future hand. As Item cards are purchased, Event cards can appear at any time and can have grave impact on gameplay.

Shipping internationally is very expensive for such a large game, but we'll be subsidizing at least $12 of the shipping cost.\nShipping costs for the Team pledge is free to the US, EU, and the rest of the world. If you add any add-ons, shipping increases by $10 for EU and worldwide shipping.\nShipping costs for the Lite pledge to the EU and Canada is $16 and $28 to the rest of the world.\nShipping costs for the Razor and Butcher pledge to the EU and Canada is $36, and $58 to the rest of the world.\nI'm sure we all know that shipping rates increase frequently. Don't worry, though. We will cover any shipping rate increases between now and when we ship. Your shipping rates won't change even if ours do.\nEven though this will be difficult for a small startup company like us to absorb, we want to help get Slaughterball into as many international hands as possible.

The rulebook is still being edited and playtested, and we'll continue to tweak it until production starts.\n\nThe biggest risks for Slaughterball include: \n\u2022 Unexpected production issues. We're working with Magicraft Co. Ltd. They have a great team and I'm sure they'll be able to minimize production risks. However, there could be unanticipated issues that might impact the production schedule. \n\u2022 Shipping delays. Depending on the production run quantity, shipping could be delayed to coincide with other shipments so as to fill an entire cargo container. Other shipping delays might also arise (weather, regulations, pirates, giant sea-monsters, icebergs, time-travelling interlopers, etc.). \n\u2022 Customs delays. Slaughterball is so exciting that I wouldn't be surprised if Customs officials want to pop open a box and play it themselves before passing it on. Well, maybe not. But it is possible that the shipment could be stuck in Customs if some random inspector wants to give it a thorough twice-over. \n\u2022 General peril. If Mt. Rainier erupts, there's a good chance fulfillment will be delayed. Injuries or illnesses can also cause delays, but I try to avoid hungry bears, rooftop parkour, zombie outbreaks, and other perilous situations.\n\nRisks for the stretch goals and add-ons include all of the above, plus possible artist issues (such as illness, injuries, family emergencies, and so on). So as not to delay delivery of the base game, stretch goals and optional stuff will ship later (aiming for Q3-2015).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #148", "update_userinfo": "Slaughterball inventory reduction sale! 50% off!!", "update_content": "Hi!\nA friend of mine has a quick little Kickstarter campaign for his new dice tower.

Also, please remember, you guys were not charged anything since this was unsuccessful. \nWe are currently in talks with a couple different manufacturers, and we believe we can get the same quality of game with a significantly lower goal. We will send details to all backers in an update when things are more set in stone. \nWe are looking to relaunch early next year, likely sometime in January. To keep up with us and be alerted when we are going to be relaunching, check out our website and follow us on Facebook and/or Twitter.\nThanks! We'll get this in your hands somehow! Stay tuned! \nIn addition to the main game, Kickstarter backers that pledge at the GUMSHOE level or above will receive a Kickstarer limited exclusive detective card, Andrew \"Golden Boy\" Jastry.\nBackers that increase their pledge level to the SLEUTH level or above will also receive two Kickstarter limited exclusive witnesses (The Songstress and the Snitch)!\n\nBackers that further increase their level to the PRIVATE EYE level or above will receive the full Kickstarter version of Private Die that includes one extra detective (Silver-Tongued) and two extra witnesses (The Benefactor and the Cynic)!\nPrivate Die is a perfect filler for any game night due to its quick play time and streamlined rules. You start with one clue and a detective card which details your ability. Once you have 15 or more clues at the end of a round, you have solved the case and the game is over.\nEach round begins with rolling the witness die and revealing a witness card. The die represents the amount of stress a witness can take in questioning before they crack under pressure. The card details the witness' personality and applies a modifier to the round. On your turn, you choose to roll one or more of your questioning dice. Your goal is to be as close to the witness die value without going over. \nIf you are getting nowhere with a witness, you may feed them a clue to roll an additional questioning die, hoping to jog their memory. Be careful though! If you push a witness too hard, they'll crack under the pressure and feed you false information, setting back your investigation. If you play the witness just right and match the number on their die, they have a sudden moment of clarity, providing you another clue. Once you are satisfied and decide to end your investigation, play continues to the next detective in turn order.\nFor a more detailed overview of Private Die, watch the video below.\nCheck it out for yourself! See the work-in-progress rulebook for yourself here. Keep in mind this is just plain text, void of images or fancy formatting. We will be actively updating this link, so please provide feedback or ask questions!\nPretty simple, right? There's more to it than that, though. The game is always exciting due to the witness effects, detective abilities, and cases you can undertake. This filler packs a punch!\nWant to play with friends or family who aren't game-savvy? No problem. Part of the beauty of Private Die's design is that the complexity can be scaled down. Remove the cards from the game and play it \"bare-bones\" at Thanksgiving or a birthday party. Once they get the hang of it, you can re-introduce the cards one set at a time, so they have a smooth transition into what may be unfamiliar territory.\nHere's what reviewers have to say about Private Die:\n\"If your group is into dice-rollers, you should definitely check out Private Die for a fun little twist on the genre!\" - Theology of Games\n\"It's not just luck, there is a strategic element to it.\" \"Good to bring to a group of friends who are not as seasoned in games.\" - Jonathan Estis and Will Keeler, Roll For Crit\n\"Rarely do we finish a new game and then both immediately reset everything for another game.\" \"Jen and I got so into the game that we didn\u2019t realize that Jen had won about 3 rounds previous.\" - Herb Freeman, Game and a Curry\n\"Rounds are fast, and the combination of lucky rolls and smart maneuvering makes Private Die more than the sum of its parts.\" - Matt Paddock, Dice. Card. Go!\n\"I was quite impressed with it, it was pretty fun, it was easy to pick up, and I really think that people will enjoy to play.\" \"It was a really fun game to play. Very quick and easy to learn. I think if you have a party and want something to do to kill a little time, it was a lot of fun.\" - Melwheezy and DJedi, Geekly Podcast (37:40)\n\"Very light, very fast filler that serves up some neat little decisions.\" - Bob Rademaker, BGG reviewer.\nTop 10 on The Meeple Mechanic's Kickstarter Badger.\n\nMore reviews to come!\n\nWant to pledge even more towards Private Die?

The rulebook will tell you how to play and what your goal is, but the Case Files will tell you who you're playing, what's really behind the case, who helped make this happen, and what to do if a round ends with one player at 15 clues and another player at 12 but the player with 12 is the Genius detective. Get what I mean? Let's take a deeper look.\nDetectives: You'll get to really know the detectives. We're going to include their backstories so you can know the man behind the badge.\nCases: The cases in the game will have some detail, but the Case Files will fill it all in. This is where you'll get all of the details of the case so you know what kind of criminal you're dealing with.\nBackers: We can't do this without you. Backers who pledge at the INFORMANT level and above will be listed under their respective categories.\nErrata: We will include any errata and F.A.Q.'s. We know that players will always have questions about a specific rule or ability, so we're aiming to provide one convenient location for players to get answers.\nThe case files will be available for download from our website.\nHelp spread the word about Private Die!

Please share the word about our Kickstarter and unlock some cool bonuses while you're at it!\nSocial media avatar:\nMystic Ape Games is made up of three guys from St. Louis, MO. While we all share a passion for games and work on the designs, we have specialized roles to fill within the company.\nJacob: Arts and Media. Jacob has a bunch of toys; he covers his apartment with inspiration from board games, comic books, video games, movies, and T.V. shows. He lives in the art world. Along with his degree in Animation and job as a Graphic Designer, he serves as our all-around art person. This keeps him extremely busy, though you wouldn't know it from his art; he does not cut corners.\nAustin: Innovation and Concepts. Austin is one of those guys that really loves board games. It's kind of all he talks about; which is great when it comes time to dissect rules and mechanics. One of his large responsibilities is writing the rulebooks and keeping the game balanced. Often referred to as a \"no-man,\" he puts lots of thought into the designs and cuts almost as many ideas as he adds.\nSam: Technology and Operations. Sam is a nerd, but not in the fun, quirky way. He takes care of all the computer and operations stuff for Mystic Ape. This includes our web and mail server, website, social media, manufacturer communications, business paperwork, and countless other odd jobs. He spends a lot of time keeping Mystic Ape viable, and giving the other two reality checks. Because of this Sam likes to drink. In fact, he considers \"craft beer\" and \"whiskey\" to be hobbies.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many risks and challenges associated with board game projects. We have been doing our best over this past year to offset those risks before launching this campaign. Throughout the past year we have worked diligently on both the design of the game and the logistics of running this campaign. After thorough testing we are confident that we have made a game that people will love, and would not present you with a game we are not proud of.\n\nAs for logistics, this is our first campaign, so we have looked to the knowledge of people who have run successful campaigns. This includes everything from reading blogs, attending panels at conventions, working with manufacturers, and speaking directly with professional game designers. Through these means we have gathered a surplus of knowledge and resources that will prove to be invaluable once we successfully fund.\n\nMost importantly, we have structured our timeline and funding goal based on this information. We are striving to deliver PRIVATE DIE by the estimated delivery date, and worked to get our funding goal as low as possible while providing you with a quality product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Mystic Ape Games\n3 created \u00b7 60 backed\nMystic Ape Games is a St. Louis based board game company.

The time-pressure and limited communication mean the Usual Co-op Problem (of the best player telling others what to do) simply does not manifest; even if the Communications Satellite is out there's no time for that sort of nonsense.\" - R. Eric Reuss, Massachusetts, USA (BoardGameGeek)\n \"If you like real-time games (and you know I do), here\u2019s a quick one\u2014each game of Meteor lasts 5 minutes or less. There\u2019s a swarm of meteors headed toward Earth, and you have to cooperate with others to build and launch rockets to shoot them down. One of the trickiest parts of this game is that you can\u2019t talk to each other. Well, there\u2019s a technology card, the communications array, that lets you start talking, but until then everything is done with gestures and raised eyebrows. Even when you can start talking, it can be a pretty tricky game to beat.\" -GeekDad.com\n\"Meteor is a time-limited cooperative game for up to 5 players. The game starts with a set of meteor cards in the center of the board and players are given only five minutes to destroy them all. Players play rocket cards and then power them with one or more types of three resources so that they can be launched at and destroy the displayed meteors.\nIn addition to rockets there are some special ability cards. Some important ones even allow players to start discussion options among themselves. Yes, at the game start players aren\u2019t even allowed to talk. Each game uses a small set out of a large number of meteors, most with special abilities, giving the game plenty of variability.\" -Matt Carlson (OpinionatedGamers.com)\n\"Meteor is...a Blast for me (OK, I could have said Meteor...Rocks! or Meteor...is Rock Solid or Meteor is...Out of this World). It's a fun Coop filler game that plays in 5 minutes and is easy to teach. As far as I know this is the only coop game that is also filler. I love the constant tension during the game, the simultaneous player action and the interaction between players.\" -Gabriel Ouimet, Ottawa, Canada (BoardGameGeek.com)\n Set Up:\n1.Shuffle the Small Meteor cards, the Medium Meteor cards, and the double-sided 6 and 7 Meteor cards together. This creates the Meteor deck.\n2.Create the Meteor Field by dealing out the number of Meteor Cards according to the number of players.  Place the cards face down in the center of the play area. Spread them out so that each Meteor Card be seen by all players.\n3.Place the Altitude Zone Cards in descending order (5 on top, 1 on the bottom) in one stack near the Meteor Field.\n4.Place five Sand Timers near the Altitude Zone Cards. Make sure Sand Timers are ready for play.\n5.Shuffle all the Resource Cards together to create the Resource Deck. Give each player the number of Resource Cards according to the number of players shown on the Set-Up Chart below.\n6.Choose one player to be the Timekeeper, ideally the player most familiar with the game. \nTimekeeper: The Timekeeper is the player that keeps the game moving forward by performing Altitude Zone Changes and ensuring that a sand timer is always active during game play. When a sand timer runs out, the Timekeeper needs to Change Altitude Zones as follows:\nChange Altitude Zones:\n1.Remove the active Sand Timer from the game.\n2.Remove the top Altitude Zone Card from the game.\n3.Start a new Sand Timer for the new Altitude Zone.\n4.Each player draws new Resource Cards according to number of players.\nMeteor Size: At the beginning of the game, the Meteor cards are placed face down. The back of the Meteor card provides an approximate size, so you have a general idea how big the Meteor is but you do not know the exact size until the Meteor Card is revealed. The exact size of the Meteor indicates how much damage the Rocket needs to inflict in order to destroy the Meteor.\nIf the Meteor Card is face down when you launch a Rocket, flip the Meteor Card over to reveal the exact size of the Meteor. Leave the Meteor Card face up for the remainder of the game.\nThere are three different ways a Rocket will interact with a Meteor:\n1.If the damage of the launched Rocket EQUALS the exact size of the Meteor, the Meteor is destroyed. Place the launched Rocket in the discard pile and remove the destroyed Meteor from the game.\n2.If the damage of the launched Rocket is LESS than the exact size of the Meteor, the launched Rocket has no effect and is placed in the discard pile. The Meteor is unharmed and stays in the Meteor Field.\n3.If the damage of the launched Rocket is GREATER than the exact size of the Meteor, the Meteor is destroyed. Place the launched Rocket in the discard pile and remove the destroyed Meteor from the game. Note that the player just caused an Overkill.\nThere are some Meteors that have unique Traits. The Meteor Traits may affect how a Rocket interacts with a Meteor.\nOverkill: Overkill is a big explosion caused by an overpowered Rocket. This big explosion blasts the remaining Meteors one Altitude Zone closer to earth. The Timekeeper Changes Altitude Zones immediately. If an Overkill occurs in Altitude Zone 1, the remaining Meteors are blasted into earth and players lose the game. If the players Overkill the only remaining Meteor in Altitude Zone 1, the players win the game because the Overkill destroyed the Meteor.\nMultiple Overkills: It is possible that the players can work together to destroy more than one Meteor at the same time. If this happens and more than one Rocket creates an Overkill, then you are still blasted forward only one Altitude Zone. Overkill does not stack. If the players manage to destroy all the remaining Meteors at the same time, they win the game even if it would have caused multiple amounts of Overkill.\nGame End: The game ends when one of the following happens:\n1.The Meteors are at Altitude Zone 1, the Sand Timer has run out and the last Meteor has not been destroyed. The meteors smash into the Earth and the players lose.\n2.The players destroy ALL the Meteors and win by saving the Earth.\n3.The players Overkill a Meteor in Altitude Zone 1 and it is not the last Meteor. The Meteors blast into the Earth and the players lose.\n Mike Young: Designer & President of MDC\nMike has designed many games and expansions over the years, but this is his first time working with our Mayday Games Team.

I want to make sure this is very clear so am including this on the top of the page.  What you actually receive are PDF papercraft files, not a finished product.  While I did all the hard work designing the files so it is simply print and cut and glue, I want to be certain people are clear. \nInspired by retro video games I took a slightly different approach to the gritty realistic tiles that are often offered. These are all hand designed graphics that are meant to inspire the fun of those classic themes. \nThe tiles are designed to print on standard US Letter with 25mm squares.  The prototype tiles are shown printed at standard quality for my printer with no adjustments on cardstock. The following picture shows a single print run, no duplicate prints.  \nFull Set\nClose-Up A\nClose-Up B\nClose-Up C\nClose-Up D\nExploded Tiles\nBackers of the Supporter level will gain access to all Dark Castle Tiles that are unlocked over the course of the campaign (which will later be bundled as a separate expansion).  Also all Supporters will get a free PDF with all the Blue and White checkered floors done in Red and White as a thanks for your support. \nRed and Blue Checker Sample\nHere is a preview of the tile set so you know exactly what to expect.  (If you click on it you will get a PDF of the file)\nDark Castle Preview\nSerpent Caverns Add-On +$6\n Here is a preview of the Serpents Caverns tileset.  It is still a WIP but I am pretty happy with how it is turning out.  I'd love your feedback though.  As much as this is my project, I want my backers to be involved. \nSecond Pass on the Serpent Caverns\n Here are some built preview tiles for the Serpent Caverns, these are not final tiles, and I may do some adjustments still, but I needed to print and build them to get a nice feel for them.  \nSerpent Caverns Overview Sample\nClose-Up A\nClose-Up B\nClose-Up C\nStretch Goals\nThroughout the kickstarter if things go well we'll add some Stretch Goals, maybe even entirely new tilesets. \n$125 - Unlocked - Dark Castle Water Rooms - These will be a series of halls and rooms which have flooded or water features.  Flooded sections will also have non-flooded corresponding sections.  \nPreview of the Flooded Hallways\nWater Tile Preview\n$150 - Unlocked - Dark Castle Corruption Tiles - Dark Magic is corrupting the castle causing rifts between this world and another.  From this void comes all sorts of unspeakable and indescribable horrors.  These tiles will let you transition back and forth between that realm and the normal.  \nCorruption Previews\n$175 - Unlocked - Dark Castle Specialty Rooms - This set will include a few larger multi-page rooms, as well as some that are more unique or unusual.  I also hope to include a few puzzle style items.  Like Push Button puzzle components, and some other small props. \n$200 - Unlocked Add-On- $6 - The Serpent Caverns Tileset - The Serpent Caverns tileset is a completely new set of adventures in the fiery caverns of the serpent lords.  With a warm earthy cavern feel and beautiful stone serpent pattern inlaid into the floors it is an excellent alternate setting to the more cold dungeon of the Dark Castle.  This is not a free goal like the previous ones, it is an entirely new tileset, I am still charging the same low price of $6 for this set though, and it will include all Serpent Caverns Expansions for free!\n$250 - Unlocked - The Serpent Caverns Lava Expansion - Adding flowing lava to the Serpent Caverns these tiles will make the heroes quest even more perilous. \n$325 - Unlocked - Photo Tutorials - As the 2.5d dungeon layout is new for many of you, I'll be grabbing some help and doing a photo tutorial for the best ways to build these dungeons. It will also include tips for building your own additions, like how to add jars, pillar and such from simple supplies at the craft store.  \n$400 - Unlocked - The Serpent Caverns Room Expansion - Even more interesting rooms for the Serpent Caverns.  These will be more along the lines of puzzles and challenges for the heroes.\n$475 - Unlocked - Props - I will add a series of 2.5d props, this isn't fully fleshed out yet, so would appreciate your feedback! My current ideas are maybe some really simple fountains, doors and statues.  I want these to be very simple builds more like figure flats than full projects in their own rights.  The beauty of this project was simplicity, so I want to keep it that way. \n$600 - Unocked - Forest Temple Add-On - $6 - The forest temple will add another entirely new set.  This being a heavily overgrown vine covered temple. \n$800 - Unlocked - Digital Tiles - Scaled for use with D20Pro(and hopefully similiar programs) these lower resolution files will be chopped up into exact dimension tiles so they can be quickly added to your D20 Pro games.\n$1,000 - Unlocked - Notched Door Fittings - These small hall pieces are designed to fit the Twisting Catacombs doors.  It will require a more specific cut, but it will allow their Standard Width Double Doors to fit into the dungeons perfectly.  This is basically a free sheet, one per tileset.\n$1,200 - Unlocked - Random Dungeon Generation Cards for the Dark Castle - This is a simple Card deck with small images of the dungeon tiles on them.  This will let you simply draw what room or hallway to place next.  (due to the designs this will not be perfect, you may need to tweak what rooms you use to prevent your dungeon from being one room long)\n$1,500 - Unlocked - Forest Temple Courtyard - This will add a series of courtyard tiles to the Forest Temple set.  \nAbout Us\nAdventureCraft Dungeons are a series of pdf files that are designed to build your own 2.5d dungeons using some foamcore (or cardboard), a gluestick, and these files. \nAll miniatures shown are from Impact!

It is a game of murder, accusations, deceit and mob hysteria.\nTown of Salem takes place in the era of the Salem witch trials in an alternate universe version of Salem, MA. \nMobile, Steam and Localization \nTown of Salem is currently operating as a free-to-play browser game. Since the launch of the Alpha version our fans have been clamoring for 3 things:  \nWhen is the mobile version coming out?\nWhen is the Steam version coming out?\nWhen will there be support for non-English speaking players?  \nThat is what this Kickstarter is all about. We need help from the community to be able to tackle all of the difficulties and challenges that will come from doing the mobile and Steam ports, as well as the localization support.\nHow To Play\nThe game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught. \nRoles\nTown of Salem has 29 unique roles ensuring a different experience each time you play. \nBefore a game starts, players are put into a lobby where the host can select what roles will be in the game. Players are then assigned roles at random from the list of chosen roles. Players have an in-game role card that explains their role's abilities and alignments. For an in-depth look at the abilities of each role please visit: www.blankmediagames.com/roles\nGame Phases\nNight\nThe night phase is when most roles use their abilities. For example, Serial Killers stealthily murder people, Doctors heal people who are attacked, and Sheriffs interrogate people for suspicious activity.\nDay\nThe day phase allows the Town members to discuss who they suspect of being an evil role. Once the voting phase starts a majority vote from the town will put someone on trial. \nDefense \nThe defense phase is when you plead your innocence to the town. Have a convincing story or find yourself facing the gallows! \nJudgement\nDuring this phase the town will vote on the fate of the defendant. Players can vote guilty, innocent or abstain. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes the defendant is sentenced to death by hanging! \nRewards\nDonor Rewards\nSponsor Rewards\nBenefactor Rewards\nPatron Rewards\nPhilanthropist Rewards\nHumanitarian Rewards\nCustomization\nPlayers are able to choose many of their own customization options:\nCharacters\nHouses\nMaps\nPets\nDeath Animations\nIn-Game Name\nThese customization options are displayed to everyone else in the game unless you decide to hide them.\nPlay With Friends\n Town of Salem has an in-game friends list that lets you easily play with your friends!\nAchievements\nTown of Salem has over 200 achievements with an in-game browser to check out which cool achievements you have earned!\nEarning achievements grant Town Points which are used to purchase items from the shop.\nRaving Reviews\nWe have already been Steam Greenlit!\nWe were on the front page of the of the June issue of Indie Game Magazine.\nhttp://www.indiegamemag.com/igm-june-issue-now-on-sale-cold-nights-warm-blood/\nReviewed by SourceFedNERD via Indiecent Gaming\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L-y3ia5nIg\n#1 Best Rated Indie Game on Gamejolt (at the time of writing this)\nhttp://gamejolt.com/games/strategy-sim/town-of-salem/23303/\nStretch Goals\nPeople who backed our last Kickstarter and also back this one will receive an awesome unique 'Angel' lobby icon!\nAngel icon", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTown of Salem is already a complete game.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "It all started with a 3 year old and some demo gears. From her excitement, the original Gear Lab Kickstarter was born. In the three years since then, Gear Lab has gone to many Maker Faires, Gaming and Steampunk Cons and art shows. They have been built for schools and science museums, but everywhere we went, people would say \" I wish I had enough space to have that at home\".  From that desire and our love of puzzles and games, GearLab,Jr was born. \nPLAY\n\nAfter some at home play testing and a few prototypes, we took it to the 2014 Steampunk World's Fair to get in more play testing and take a few pre-orders. \nThe reaction both pleased and excited us. Everyone had suggestions of where we should try to cut deals and how to mass market it. Cogbots Studio is poised to launch what we believe will be a breakout product, but to support it, we need to expand our manufacturing capabilities. Like all Cogbots gears and kinetic kits,the GearLab Jr puzzle game will be made in America from cabinet grade plywood.  Each kit takes approximately 10 hours to cut, so to meet demand, we need to expand beyond our single CNC machine.  \nWith this Kickstarter, you will be funding extra equipment to manufacture the game, as well as the needed infrastructure to support the equipment. With this growth, we will be able to cut between 15-25 kits per week, instead of the 5 we can currently cut now. \nThe first of the pre-orders have shipped, but the item will not be added to the Cogbots web store until all of the Kickstarter orders have been cut and shipped. This means about a 10 month delay in adding the game to the store, or in cutting any bigger deals. We believe we owe that to our backers who are funding the capital outlay that will help us grow US Manufacturing. \nWhat you get:\nCogbots sells kits that are unfinished and some assembly is required. \nThe instructions for how to put it together and tips for sanding and finishing are here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg2bhP0aPlWSIPOhqan8DpEdLRw8lkzKg\nThere are a few reward levels that include finished kits, these are a special item and the product will NOT be sold as finished when it is released in the store. \nKickstarter Special Editions:\nFolks at the Steampunk World's Fair and others who have play tested since have already started asking for more and so we have started planning expansion packs and add-ons for more interesting play. The Kickstarter Special Edition rewards will include a special gear set combination that will NEVER be offered in any other venue. This is a one- time only special collector's set that is added to your base GearLab Jr game. A future update will include the images of these add-on gears, as the design team is still making choices. \nA Gear Puzzle Community:\nBecause the base kit is customizable, we are also launching a community for you to share and challenge each other. The kit comes with a download-able PDF of  the starting challenge cards. Cogbots will be adding new challenges to the community site each month, but there will be a forum where you can add your own challenge and game styles as well. Will you paint on a path to be completed, bonus point markers to be battled over?  Will you play solitaire or head to head competitions? We are excited to see what cool combinations you can add in an open source game rules community.

We chose an all or nothing model for the Kickstarter so that we did not end up in a situation where we did not raise enough to expand as needed to meet demand in a reasonable amount of time. \nThe game has been designed, play-tested and refined. There are a few lucky souls out there who already have one in their hands. \nThe only thing that would delay us from making these when we get funded would be something catastrophic, and we carry insurance to help cover those cases. \nWe are being careful and conservative in the games we promise for Christmas- which is why there is a premium on those. After that, the orders will be shipped in a first in/first out queue. \nCogbots has been cutting and shipping functional wooden gears around the world for almost 5 years now, so this is an expansion of existing capabilities, not an attempt at something never tried.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Nan Braun\n2 created \u00b7 119 backed\nI have a passion for creating and helping others create.

I have very high standards of quality control and utter dedication to getting it right for my customers. I've also had to overcome a massive challenge in the form of the Dragon model that I also now manufacture in-house. This last one has taught me a massive amount about the vagaries of resin casting and I am supremely confident that after the Dragon, anything else will seem simple by comparison.\n\nI already did a test run of castings for the NetherLord in April that have exposed where the main problems lie (most of them with the NetherLord face, arms and legs ripping the moulds!) so I am aware of what issues to watch out for and which areas of the model may cause problems during production, etc and have altered the models to mitigate this. \n\nThe main challenge with this project is how much time it takes to make the moulds and cast the parts, and the fact I have to cast 140 dragons between now and Christmas before I can start casting the rewards for this project. Doing multiple sets of moulds will take quite a bit of time but will make the production run much faster, so it should balance out. If this campaign goes well I will even be able to hire some help to speed things up!\n\nIf the project gets enough funds I will be able to first of all take a few weeks off from the \"regular\" orders to concentrate on casting as much of the Dragon queue as I can to clear the decks for the time needed to make the dozens of production moulds for the models featured in this Kickstarter. or, if there's more funds than that and I can find the right person to help out, buy more pressure casting equipment and hire a new minion to train up in resin casting to overcome this.\n\nRegardless, I should be finished the current dragon queue by Christmas if things proceed on schedule, so I'm estimating that shipment of the NetherLords and Azaroth models can begin in late January after the Christmas Break. if I manage to get a staff member thanks to this campaign, that will help things move faster. Fingers crossed!\n\nThe worst that could happen is that it takes a bit longer to get all the monsters moulded up and ready to production cast than i thought, but I'm allowing a fair amount of time in the shipping dates. If all goes as hoped Dragon-wise, I will be able to start proper production casting and shipping in the third or fourth week of February 2015, but if not, it will be March at the latest when things start going out.\n\nI've got a reputation for utter honesty with my customers, and so if anything does go a bit wrong you'll be kept informed at every stage. Equally if things go well and stuff starts shipping early, I'll be sure to let you know right away! I'll keep constant updates on here and on my Facebook and Twitter feeds, and a regular update on my site and blog, too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "B'Hakoth The Destroyer and NL2 shipping out, midway through them...", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Not much left to get finished.

In  about 20 percent of the remaining 99 pledges from the pledge manager , you're probably waiting for Madame.

You are a master chef, just graduated from the city's most prestigious cooking school.\nAnd so are your enemies.\nFish Cook is a game about cooking fish. You vie to become the best chef in France by earning money, prestige, and the respect of your peers. (And since it's based off of a tabletop game, prestige and respect are conveniently measured in money.)\nFish Cook is originally a tabletop game by James Ernest, and has been well-received since its publication in 2013, with favorable reviews from Gaming Bits, Push Your Luck, The Dice Tower, Dice Card Go, and Blog Critics.  And now we are excited to bring to you the digital version of Fish Cook, including gorgeous upgraded art, fun chef avatars, AI opponents, and remote multiplayer support!\nConcept of how local multiplayer will work, with one screen displaying public information and private screens for each player to keep track of their private information and inventory\n\nThe game takes place over several \"days,\" which are divided into a morning and an evening. In the morning, you take turns buying ingredients from the markets, and in the evening, you take turns cooking recipes. You can cook your own secret recipes, or you can copy good ideas from the recipes that have been cooked before. \nThe strategy of the game revolves around spending your money wisely. The market price of each type of ingredient goes up as it becomes more scarce. So you need to make buying decisions that get your ingredients as cheaply as possible. There is also risk management: you can use a bigger fish for a smaller recipe, but you might have paid too much for it. And if you don't cook a fish by the end of the day, you have to throw it away. Is it worth the risk to buy a big fish first, and possibly waste it on an inferior dish? \nIf you want to know more about the history and development of Fish Cook, James has written a designer's diary.\n16K: Kaja and Phil Foglio are the amazing duo behind the fabulous, award winning Girl Genius web comic.

For each God, we want you to answer this question:\nIf this God was to help you on your journey through Purgatory, what buff or gameplay advantage would they give you?\nTell us in the comments!\nBaldr, the God of light, purity, joy and innocence!\nFreyja, the God of love, beauty, fertility, war and death!\nLoki, the treacherous God of fire and mischief!\nTyr, the brave and courageous God of law and heroic glory!\nHel, daughter of Loki and lord of Helheimr, the resting place for those who have died of disease and old age!\nFreyr, God of virility, prosperity, holy judgement and sacred kingship!\nBragi, the Norse God of poetry, wisdom, bards and the power of speech!\nHeimdallr stands on the burning rainbow bridge that leads to Asgard, protecting the Gods from the jotun. His mighty horn, Gjallarhorn, signals Ragnar\u00f6k and the death of the Gods!\nNj\u00f6rd is an ancient God of the Vanir, father of Freyja and Frejr. He is God of the wind, of the sea and of wealth!\nThor is the slayer of giants and wielder of Mj\u00f6lnir. He is the mighty God of thunder, oak trees, strength and the protector of mankind!\nFrigg, Queen of Asgard, is the prescient God of motherhood, childbirth and constellations!\nOdin is the God of war, battle, victory, death, wisdom, poetry and magic. He is the Allfather, patriarch of the Gods and ruler of the nine worlds!\nThank you for sharing your gameplay ideas and we'll see you in purgatory!\nYou can download all the Norse Gods here!\nIn Jotun, you play Thora, a Norse warrior who has died an inglorious death and must face the challenges of Viking purgatory to prove herself to the Gods and enter Valhalla.\nJotun's core loop revolves around collecting Runes to summon and fight the jotun, gigantic Norse elementals. The game focuses on the balance between atmospheric exploration and ferocious combat. Imagine the mysterious romantic mood of Journey mixed with the scale of the boss fights in Shadow of the Colossus in top-down 2D.\nThe world is randomly-generated and filled with different areas to explore and environmental puzzles to solve. Traveling to the far reaches of Purgatory is key to finding Runes, Shrines to the Gods and many more Viking mysteries.\nThe combat in Jotun is fast-paced and brutally hard. Using only your massive two-handed axe, you take on foes that are hundreds of times your size. Every hit from a jotun's attack will take out a huge chunk of your health.\nFeatures:\nBeautiful 2D hand-drawn art style\nEpic boss fights against the mighty jotun\nA vast and mysterious randomly-generated world to explore filled with environmental puzzles based in Viking culture and mythology\nAn overarching story to discover for both Thora and Purgatory itself\nShrines to the Viking Gods\nAn amazing musical score, specifically composed for every gameplay moment\nWOW, we were Greenlit in under 6 days!!!\n Which means we'll be on:\nJotun's gameplay is a love letter to classic games such as The Legend of Zelda. It has simple controls, action-packed boss fights and a mythic Viking world to discover. Jotun is not a \"hack-and-slash\" RPG. We prefer to avoid numbers and text when possible: there are no experience points and few stats. Like the Vikings, you must prove your valor to the Gods using only your wits and your skill in combat.\nControls\nJotun can be played with a keyboard or a gamepad. Your basic actions are attack, move and dodge. You control Thora from a top-down perspective and can explore the world in any direction. Thora has both a fast and a \"charge-up\" attack; the attack's power is determined by how long you hold the attack button. Dodging is crucial to avoiding traps and incoming attacks from the mighty jotun.\nCombat\nInspired by the mechanics of The Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls, the combat in Jotun is fast-paced and organic. Fighting the jotun requires the ability to dodge projectiles, use proper positioning and attack at the right moment. The jotun have several attacks and defenses. Recognizing them is key to executing your strategy. When in combat, the camera zooms out to give you a full view of the battlefield.\n More details on combat:\nJotun's music is core to the game's experience. Every gameplay moment is accompanied by an appropriate piece. Whether it's a fight against the mighty Frost Jotun or a peaceful contemplation of a beautiful vista, the music is an integral part of Jotun's mood, atmosphere and experience.\n\"When the prospect of writing the music for Jotun came along, I was filled with excitement at the idea of putting the vast universe Thora will explore during her journey into song. The characters, landscapes and story behind Jotun have already inspired many musical themes that I can't wait to bring to life!\" - Max LL\nWe chose Kickstarter because we want to involve you in the development process. We want your feedback, comments and critiques. Whether you love or hate Jotun, we want to know why. We want to build a community of passionate people all rooting for the same cause. We want you on board with us for the entire journey!\nJotun was born from our love of mythology and epic literature. From Greek mythology to Beowulf, we've always had a fascination for centuries-old stories. Jotun is a tribute to Viking mythology and to classic, honest gaming. We are a passionate and experienced team who can bring the game to fruition. We hope that you'll join us, connect with the game and that you'll enjoy your time with the Jotun family! \nFrom left to right:\nWilliam Dub\u00e9 - Design, business, code - http://willdube.com/\nAlexandre Boyer - Animation, art - http://vimeo.com/user8478050\nMax LL - Music - https://soundcloud.com/max-ll\nWe will be adding another full-time programmer to our team when the campaign is successful!\nCollaborators:\nAlex Mass\u00e9 - Code\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bilodeau - Sound Effects\nFrom left to right:\nJo-Annie Gauthier - 2D artist - http://www.jo-annie.net/\nAnnejulie Painchaud - 2D artist - http://antilamon.carbonmade.com/\nDarnell Lysius-Dicette - 2D artist - http://glitch-this1.tumblr.com/\nMarianne Vincent - Logo design - https://www.behance.net/mariannevincent\nVideo Team:\nMaude Plante-Husaruk - Director, editor - http://husaruk.com/\nJames Dub\u00e9 - Camera man\nOur goal is to reach alpha within six months, beta within nine months and full launch within twelve months.

Take control of the zombies and and go!\nWelcome to the \"Walk in the Park\" kick starter.\nThe goal at the beginning was to accomplish a few things\n1: A simple game. No rule bloating.\n2: A fast paced and entertaining game.\n3: A line of miniatures that could be used with almost any modern style game.\n4: A game where players could be the zombies for once :)\n5: Finally, and most importantly, a game that is both affordable AND flexible.\n6:  A large graphics pack with printable props suitable for any table top game included with rules.\nTo that end, we present: \"Walk in the Park\". What sets this apart from others is the fact that you do not need miniatures to play along with some dynamics not found in other games of this type! Provided in the rules are printable tokens for those who don't like to have crates of figures for every game :)\nThe Game:\nHumans Vs Zombies\nPlayer Vs Player with players controlling both sides, including optional rules for human vs human combat.\nMultiple Scenarios with Bonus figures for the scenarios as needed.\nNo Need for miniatures! Tokens are included with game as well.\nBoards and grids are optional. Movement can be done with ruler if you don't want to use the grids/maps.\nThe games setup and scenarios invite role playing into the mix. This will be expanded on next release. Some of the role playing aspects will be added in this release as a stretch goal! Once funding is met, player sheets with bonus abilities will be added.\nSimple turn based combat, scenarios to spice things up, and of course a clear goal for each team with scenarios changing the game regularly.\nNOTE: Scenarios can make it or break it for EITHER side.\nPlayers controlling the zombies, the dinner bell has rung- GO!\nPlayers controlling the humans...You know the drill.\nThe  Graphics pack:\nThe graphics pack is another feature we are offering with the rules and provides many more options for table top play. Including props such as billboards,buildings,vehicles,crates and containers to make game play [and in some cases scenarios] more interesting and ever changing.\n*There is almost as much time into the graphics pack as there is the miniatures\nAlso included are blank grids for designing and creating your own custom maps and skirmish fields.\nThe added bonus for the graphics pack is they are all being offered at 300 dpi. [high res] Meaning they are easily editable, will print nicely, and can be scaled for use in any game where cost is an issue where terrain is concerned.\n*for personal use only please.\nBelow are some samples of what you will receive in the graphics pack. additions will be posted as the campaign progresses.\nI plan on adding something new every few days. We need to make sure you, as a contributor are getting real value for your money.\nA few of the printable tokens included with rules.\nA few of the 3d props that can be made with the graphics pack.\nOne of several building fronts.\n included with the buildings are different color coded roofs that will set the rules for usability / safe passage.\n\"The Gauntlet\" A printable quick skirmish map included with the rules\nMore props will be added soon!\nThe Miniatures:\n The goal here was to give the undead a little more personality than most games without going the route of extreme mutations. Modern, and in some cases amusing. It's also fair to note, these figures are suitable for almost any game needing some fresh meat on the table!\nScale: 30 to 35mm average. We didn't do them all the exact same size to reflect the fact that in real life...People aren't all the exact same size.\nThe figures are being produced in Troll Cast\u2122 resin with an option for white metal [pewter] by Troll Forged Miniatures.\nThe Zombies: Varying levels of decay, compound fractures, rips and tears, exposed muscle and lots of fun gory stuff.\nThe Humans: From thick to thin, all types of weapons from baseball bats to homemade arm cannons.\n3 of the 6 scenario figures included with game\nI've decided I will post the goal/stretch goal figures for people to see. the order in which they will unlock has already been determined.

Read more now!\nImportant updates, in case you missed them:\nSTRETCH GOALS #1: What we can do if we reach $5,000,000!\nT-SHIRT DESIGNS: Three limited-edition designs to choose from! \nADD-ON REWARDS: Instructions for adding more rewards!\nORIGINAL DVDs: Now available as reward add-ons!\nHi. LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

Ganging up?\nAll this and more are packed into this tiny game, each with its own card and effect on the game making this:\nBut this title isn't entirely accurate. Even though it was initially created as a silly exercise in game design, when those elements we all love to hate were combined, I realized I'd stumbled upon a game that is QUICK to play, EASY to learn, and a ton of FUN!\nWant to see for yourself? Print out the Print N Play version and give it a try\nwww.siadek.com/worstgameever.pdf\n(Rules in Pig Latin and English)\nWorst Cards Ever\nComplete Card List at bottom of page\nAn example of how this game takes something that can be a drag like \"Deck Searching\" and makes it fun is that instead of one person reading all the cards, the deck is split up so everybody gets to search. This way there is no downtime except for the player who played the card but they get their pick of the searched cards and the player who picked that card gets one of the rest.\nIf you would like to get a properly printed game, it is going to cost somebody some money so we can publish it.\nWhen we reach the goal of one dollar, I'll have enough money to print out the game on my printer as a hand made prototype with 50 cards in it. I fronted the dough for the snazzy logo and art for 9 of the cards. You can be part of bringing this collection of pet peeves to market. Every dollar we get makes this game that much more professional.\nThe stretch goal of $3k will allow us to actually going to press with a real printer.\n$500 Logo - REACHED\nI'll get a professional logo for the card box and card backs.\n$1,000 Actually Printing the Game\nREACHED!\nThis would be a pretty weak printing. I'd go to kinko's and run it on fairly stiff card stock and cut it myself on a cutter. It would be a step up from the prototype but not far.  If we don't get to this level, you're all getting prototypes that I hand-make from \"Cannibalism\" cards leftover from my first printing of Lifeboat.\n$3,000 Chinese Printing\nREACHED!!\nThis will be a quality printing in a telescoping box that frankly is better than this game deserves but as a valued backer YOU deserve this and more!\n$4,000 Art on all of the Cards\nREACHED!!!\nWe can pay the artist to do art for all of the cards except the ones with too much text.\n$5,000 Fifty more cards\nREACHED!!!!\nI don't know what these cards are yet. I'm assuming based on the fact that everybody I've playtested with has had an idea for a card that we'll find plenty of material. The low hanging fruit is gone but I know of some games that expand into thousands of cards. Even if you don't back the game please add your peeves in the comments section.\n$10,000 Die, wooden cubes and Plastic winks included in the game\nIt took me a while to figure this out but if we get to this level, I can put a die, some wooden cubes and plastic winks included in the box.\n$30,000 Custom Die included in the game\nAt this point, I'm just grasping at straws. Nobody needs a custom die but I want to somehow justify the fact that I'm getting $30 Grand for the worst game ever. I hate custom dice because you can't tell whether the special face is a 6 or a 1. This die will say \"Worst Game Ever\" on one of the faces. I haven't decided whether it will be the 1 or the 6. Both?  Maybe we'll do a poll for that.\n$50,000 Celebrity Endorsement\nI'll find somebody more famous than me to say this is the worst game ever.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "I've been sculpting these figures in the scant spare time I get from commission sculpting since December last year. A great deal of imagination has been put into each figure and a great deal of time in figuring out how to make a range of great looking unique characters that are in almost all cases single part figures so you can have less time prepping the figure before painting and more time gaming! The figures will be cast in either white metal or resin depending on how you want to receive your reward. \nWith my new line of \"Tooth & Sword\" Chibi adventure miniatures I'm seeking to expand what Meridian Miniatures will have to offer the gaming community. I've had a lot of fun learning to sculpt in this style, it providing a perfect counterpoint to my \"Steam & Aether\" range in both technique and mood. I've have a great deal of enjoyment developing this menagerie of adventuring animals and now the time has come to unleash them. I've sought to cover a fairly wide spectrum of adventuring classes and animal species, something that proved quite challenging when I came to combining the two factors! The first eight figures that I'd like to make available are very loosely grouped as \"lawful\" and well, less than lawful but they needn't be played that way by RPGers or wargamers! \nImportant, these \"neutral\" figures are now unlocked and can be pledged for ONLY by choosing the relevant metal or resin pledge level. As individual figures they are available a in resin as usual.\nThese fun looking figures should inspire imaginative players to create their own player characters and fantasy skirmishers alike. With several companies now producing figures in the Chibi style I feel that players have the opportunity to create their own immersive game play with a wide range of figures. With this in mind I've set out to bring my own unique animal adventurers to life, they can easily slot into place in your favourite fantasy world and will become part of my own \"Tooth & Sword\" players resource setting. I've come to Kickstarter as I've built up quite a range of characters to produce and need to raise funds to cover the moulding costs, artwork and game resource development. With your funding I can get the figures into production and onto your tabletop quickly and in one wave rather than in dribs and drabs over a year or more. Should the figures prove highly successful I'll be able to produce even more goodies to say thanks to you all. \nHow it works.\nThe miniatures have been grouped into two sets for casting in white metal: \"the good guys\" and \"the wicked ones\" these sets are the most affordable way to receive your reward and the most cost effective way for me to produce the figures. The moulding and casting of these white metal sets is being handled by Griffin Moulds Ltd, some of the very best mould makers in the UK. You can choose to receive one or two sets at the applicable reward level. For those of you that only want a specific figure or want to mix and match I am offering high quality resin figures as an alternate reward, simply select single figure reward level and set your pledge at a multiple of the level depending on how many individual figures you want. You can even add additional figures to your metal sets by adding to your pledge level\nStretch goals.\nOnce we reach \u00a33500 I will be giving EVERY BACKER a set of free stickers to say thank you, this is enough on top of the goal to realistically to cover the printing costs, if there's chance I will add more stickers as the campaign goes on.\nFREE STICKERS AT \u00a33500\nI'm planning on making art prints and more to give as freebies too but all will depend on backer support, more details will come as the campaign progresses. If the demand is there I will sculpt a timed exclusive figure to add as a stretch goal, this can be discussed as the campaign goes on. \nAdd ons.\nI will be making the various art prints and post card available as add ons during the campaign as well, so long as all goes well. To add anything extra to your pledge just adjust it by the appropriate amount. I will find out exactly what you pledged for when I send out the surveys after the campaign finishes. \nNew add-ons!\nAdd on the resin Hippogryph model for \u00a312 per figure. Picture shows work in progress, check back for updates.\n I am offering these pieces of artwork as high quality A3 prints to anyone that would like to add them on to their pledge, this isn't something that I'm really going to be making profit on, as the postage costs are unfortunately high but I can't not offer them as I'm so happy with the artwork and I'm sure a few of you are going to really enjoy having them up on the wall of your gaming room! If you would like an A3 art print and you are in the UK then just add on \u00a310 for EACH print (lion/mouse or wolf/bat) that you would like. If you are in the rest of the world then please add \u00a314 for EACH print that you would like. These will ship separately to the rest of your pledge and the rates for international postage are especially high for postal tubes\nCHARACTER POSTCARDS IN PROGRESS.\nThe future.\nI've got an extensive range of figures planned along with a whole setting  to explore, I've no current plans to release a game system but will be making all sorts of gaming resources available for free.

One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions\u2019 leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace\u2026 but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.\nPlayers are going to be working together, managing threat and attempting to keep up with the evolving Turn Deck.

Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nWhy YOU should back Tiny Epic Defenders on Kickstarter:\nBesides it being a epic good time, without Kickstarter, and more importantly YOU, the game would not be produced. So waiting around to find it at your FLGS or favorite online retailer would NOT even be an option!\nWe need people to back it on Kickstarter to get it made. So, here are the incentives we've offered:\n\u2022 36% discounted from MSRP (on an already super cheap game). $16 on KS instead of $25 retail.\n\u2022 FREE US Shipping + Discounted International Shipping\n\u2022 Get *Kickstarter Limited Exclusive content through the Deluxe Package.

Kickstarter has a very supportive and enthusiastic community that we've grown to love.\nOur experience with Kickstarter began as a project creators. I, personally, had not backed a project prior to making my own, that quickly changed. The philanthropy demonstrated by the backers that so generously supported our projects became contagious. We're not just project creators anymore, we are backers now and we love it! Backing a project is a little bit like being Santa Claus in helping make dreams come true! Then getting it in the mail later is a lot like being a kid on Christmas day! It's a win, win.\nThere's more than one way to fund the publication of a board game and even within the crowd-funding concept there are several options but none that compare to Kickstarter. Without the wonderful community of Kickstarter we would not be where we are today. That is why we feel it is important to give back. Kickstarter has changed our business and our lives in a big way and if we can play a small part in changing someone else's life in a big way we will!\nWe have worked very hard to bring Tiny Epic Defenders to this point. Many people have put a lot of hard work into this game but entering production is very expensive and unfortunately outside the limitations of our resources. The game has been enjoyed by so many and some awesome memories have been made. With your help, we can make this game a reality and share the unique experience within with a lot of people.\nThank you Kickstarter and thank you backers!

It is prone to many mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have experience in successfully fulfilling multiple board game projects.\n\nHere are the steps we are take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 75% completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing again, the same manufacturer I have used to create of Rise!, The Lost Dutchman, Dungeon Heroes, Fantasy Frontier, the Fantasy Gaming Figures,the GIANT Meeples and Tiny Epic Kingdoms. We have a great relationship with their entire team. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. Together we have created some great games and products and we hope that Tiny Epic Defenders will be our next!\n\n3. Professional distribution is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They were responsible for having fulfilled the shipments of Rise!, Dungeon Heroes and Fantasy Frontier. All were delivered on schedule with professionalism and reliability. Ship Naked also handles our pledge management, as well as defected parts and missing pieces. They have proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project won't experience mistakes, they happen to everyone but it does show that this road is familiar to all parties involved.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, we are dedicated to 100% backer communication.

I'll be left with $280,000.00 to achieve my goals after Amazon and Kickstarter each take 5% commission. My initial Kickstarter campaign had a total of six game units, which I had estimated would require an expense of $100,000.00 or more to process for manufacturing and distribution. However, it was brought to my attention that I should start my campaign with less unit and request a lesser amount.\nI do understand that it is an exceeding amount to ask for, but I am not interested in licensing the game to a toy manufacturer. I am currently looking to venture into this endeavor on my own. It all starts with a vision and like all dreams of success, you must first take the initial steps into achieving that dream. I see Kickstarter as my first steps into my dreams of success since without your financial backing i am unable to fund for my own project.\nCurrently, I do not have a professional prototype to show, but as a graphic designer I am able to provide a design for this product. Hopefully, you will be able to understand the creative concept behind Pegasus Gaming Units from its Game Rules and Game Designs that are provided below. My intent as the license holder and sole game creator is to use your funding to seek manufacturing and distribution for the following game editions;\nPEGASUS: PRO EDITION\nPEGASUS: MINI EDITION\nDOMINUS: A PEGASUS EDITION\nI am here because I believe in this game since it is a new abstract strategic game that was developed from three other classic game concepts like, Draughts (Checkers), Reversi (Othello) and the legendary game of Chess. It is only with your assistance and generosity that this vision will be achieved. So, it is through my humble words and great honor that I present to your attention, Pegasus Games.\nPEGASUS -PRO EDITION\nPegasus is a two player strategic game where each piece must be placed on the game board. The Game is a 10x10 pegboard; each user has 50 pegs black or white; Each peg or pawn has a bottom and top, the top is the game player's home color, the bottom is the opponents' color. The objective is to jump your opponent's pawns and take over his army.

Below are some probable designs that will be included as an accessory for this product.\nConceptual Development: Pegasus is a new strategic board game. This is a modern game that helps build situation awareness and decision making; No dice or assembly required. The idea for this game was developed from the Pencil and Paper game, Dots and Box and Peg Solitaire.

It is the precursor to the title of lords, sire and sir.\nOfficial Pegasus Dominus Logo -Copyright(c)2014\nBACKER REWARDS\nA select number of Pegasus Games is offered in return for your generous pledge. You will be the first to own this game before it reaches the stores. All rewards will delivered no later than December 2015. I do not want to exceed anyone expectations with rewards that I could not fulfill. I know if this project is successfully funded then a fully developed game unit will be the easiest and most earnest reward that I could offer. Thank you all for believing in my game concept and helping me bring Pegasus Games into production. You can expect to be updated along this journey, until it is finally launched to the world.\nHow To Game Test At Home Without Prototype:\n 1. Study the Game Rules Carefully.\n2. Right Click on Image, Save Image As...Onto your computer.\n3. Open Image on any Photo-editing software, like Photoshop, Microsoft Paint or online at Picasa.com\n4. Crop All Four Game Pieces, Black and White Boxes\n5. Copy and Paste Game Pieces with Each Move\n6. Fill in White Circles to Keep Track of Game Pieces that remain on Homeboard. Remember, Moves from Game Board do not count, since Game Piece is already out of Homeboard.\n7. Keep track of the development of the Game, as the appearance of the Game Board will be constantly changing as the game progresses...\n* Abstract Strategic Game Factorial; 100! = 9,332,621,544\u00d710e157\nThis means there's 157 Zeroes after the larger number, which is also the exact calculation of permutation for the possible combinations of 100 pegs on a 100 pegboard. This is the amount of combinations possible on both Pegasus and Dominus game board. The game is never at constant since we are always manipulating the formation of the pawn as the game prolongs.\nHowever, the odds of winning is undefined, because I'm not that advanced in Combinatorics. It would take a robot to test each permutation until revealing all the probable winning combination. The average Chess Game has a factorial of 64! or a total of 1.26886932 X 10e89 strategic combinations for capturing a game piece.

We are so grateful and humbled for every donation, every share, every \u2018like\u2019 that has brought us to crossing our goal of $180,000 in just 25 days! With 5 days left for our record-breaking campaign, we are excited to announce what is referred to on Kickstarter as a Stretch Goal. Our campaign goal of $180,000 will cover all of the costs of Filming the documentary - Crew, Equipment, Sound, and Transportation. Whatever we are lucky enough to raise beyond this until June 1st will go towards the Post-Production of the film including Editing the film, Original Music by incredible GRAMMY Nominated Artists (who are ready to go - amazing!), and Distribution efforts including Film Festival Submissions and getting this film In Theaters Worldwide so Team Lizzie can see what we did together!\nPLAY\n\nIn 1989, a young girl named Elizabeth \u201cLizzie\u201d Velasquez was born to two excited first time parents, Rita and Lupe. Doctors soon discovered that Lizzie was one of only three people in the entire world who possess an extremely rare, unnamed syndrome, which prevents her from gaining weight. Lizzie\u2019s parents were told not to expect much physical or mental advancement from their daughter. Now, at 25 years old, 58 pounds, and with more accomplishments than most achieve in a lifetime, she is ready to share her full story.\nAt 17, Lizzie found a video on YouTube calling her \u201cThe Ugliest Woman in the World.\u201d The video, made by an online bully, also attracted some of the cruelest comments anyone could ever imagine; the very first of which said she should \u201cdo everyone a favor and just kill herself.\u201d Lizzie decided shortly thereafter that she was not going to let someone who had never met her, bully her \u2013 much less, define her.\nLizzie had dreams of graduating college, becoming a motivational speaker and publishing a book. With hard work and a wildly resilient spirit, Lizzie accomplished her goals and is a graduate of Texas State University, one of the most sought after speakers in the world (her TEDxAustinWomen talk has garnered over 9 million views to date) and is about to publish her third book in the Fall of 2014. Now, Lizzie has a bigger dream to accomplish: to make the online community a more positive place than when she found it. Or, rather, when it found her.\nThis summer, we set forth to make a documentary about Lizzie\u2019s extraordinary life and her story of adversity and proud survival. We follow her on an incredible journey to address online bullying and inspire a trending movement to change it for the better.\nIf nearly 10 million people have become her champions from 13 minutes, imagine what 90 minutes can do.\nCheck out Lizzie's Interviews since we launched our campaign!\nThe View    \nE! Online\nYahoo's Trending Now\nMTV Act\nWe believe that we can\u2019t ask of you what we wouldn\u2019t ask of ourselves. We\u2019ve already invested our own money and are looking for your help in securing the rest of the budget to get the film made and distributed to as wide of an audience as possible. For those new to Kickstarter, if we fall short of our goal by our 30-day deadline, we will lose all of the money raised and the opportunity to make this film.\nOur goal is this: to raise $180k to fund the crew, lighting, sound, transportation and many other aspects that are necessary to complete physical production and shooting of the movie over the course of 10 weeks.\nWe don\u2019t want to presume that we can raise ALL of the funds necessary for shooting the film all the way through to distribution, and we are very aware that few documentaries and films that have set a goal in our range end up raising the full amount. We are honored to be a part of the Kickstarter community and sincerely value each and every person that has viewed this page, and are grateful for however close we can get to our end goal of raising enough for our entire production and post-production.\nKickstarter is the best example of what can be accomplished when a community comes together.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Endless: Fantasy Tactics is a tactical miniatures game designed by On The Lamb Games. With a focus on boutique anime style miniatures and an art aesthetic harkening back to the golden age of JRPGs, you can build your own custom team of knights, wizards, and monsters. Equip them with items and pick their abilities. Fight it out in story scenarios, or recreations of your favorite games. A standard game takes about 20 to 30 minutes to play with 5-10 miniatures, uses a D6 pool-based system of gameplay, and is meant for 2+ Players.\nHere is a full gameplay video:\nThis is a follow up campaign to our previous Kickstarter in November 2012, we hope to expand the number of available models and fund the art costs for EFT\u2019s first campaign supplement entitled \u2018The Miasma War\u2019. This story based campaign provides new & old Endless gamers with new scenarios to play, new and variant stat cards, and more insight into the world of Terra. During the course of the campaign, players will gradually expand their party to build an army to take on the forces of The Miasma.\nLong time fans of OTLG know that we often struggle with being able to provide enough art in our books, and with this Kickstarter we\u2019ll be able to fill the book with great pieces of art from our talented artists.\nAbout the Miasma War \nThe Miasma War is an expansion for the core EFT Rulebook.\nAdventure Mode - New rules for Single Player and/or Co-Op play, allowing you to do battle against the table itself with AI parties (1+ players).\nA full story campaign with scenarios appropriate for playing with the AI Parties or in 'Classic' mode with an opposing player.\nNew units to add to your parties.\nTaisen Mode - Rules for playing large battles.\n'Player Avatar' - The ability to create your own character.\nDownload the Miasma War Sample Scenario here.\nAbout the Artists\nWe'll mainly be using two artists for the Miasma War: Noah Page (Brushfire, EFT), and Heath Foley (Brushfire, EFT, Deadzone, Dreadball, Counterblast, Blackwater Gulch).\nHeath is responsible for the majority of the art in the core books for Endless: Fantasy Tactics and Brushfire. Noah did the Miasma War banner shown in the KS Icon, and several of the classes in EFT.\nAbout Fals & Rewards\nTo make reward selection as easy for you as possible, this Kickstarter will use a 'picking' system. Each pledge level provides a certain amount of \"Fals\" (the fictional currency of Endless). Each miniature or other item will cost a number of \"Fals\", starting at 1 for normal sized miniatures (25mm Base), with larger miniatures (50mm+ Base) costing 2 or more. This way you know from the outset how many miniatures or items are coming with your pledge level, rather than having to wait for your chosen bundle to get more added to it.\nThis is the \"Fals\" icon, in the chart below the available models are broken up into different sections based on how many Fals they'll cost you and if they are unique for gameplay purposes.\nClick Here for a High Res version of the above chart.\nClick Here to access the Pledge Calculator. Currently there are 50 Fals worth of items available, 47 of which are miniatures.\nIn Update #4 we created several party suggestions to help new players with what sort of models to pick. Feel free to send us a message, or post a comment if you have any questions about selecting rewards.\n Further Goals will add additional Miniatures for you to select from, along with funding more art for the campaign book.\nThe miniatures will be sculpted by Patrick Keith (Bombshell Babes, Counterblast, Reaper Miniatures), Sean Bullough (Warmachine/Hordes), and Bob Naismith (Warhammer 40k, Kings of War, Brushfire). Bob did the majority of the sculpting for our previous Kickstarter; and Patrick has done the Dragoon [F], Lyra Cosine, and Crusader [F] models for us.\nPatrick Keith will be sculpting the Lunarian, the Barghest, Chain (Heroine of Time), the Rune Fencer, the Rhapsodist, the Berserker, and Rin Azel.\nSean Bullough will be sculpting the Mandragora, the Kappa, the Gargoyle Demonite, Zebolg, the Deep Troll, and the Fire Troll.\nExample Miniatures\nDragoon [F] sculpted by Patrick Keith.\nBeastmen Laborer & Engineer sculpted by Bob Naismith\nThe Crusader, sculpted by Patrick Keith\nAll models are supplied with a 25mm (or larger) Square Base and a stat card. Models are cast in resin, and require assembly and painting.\nWork in Progress, Not Finished of the Lunarian by Patrick Keith..\nAbout the Game\nEndless is a Tactical Miniatures game that recreates the playstyle and feel of classic 90\u2019s console RPGs on your table top. To get ready for a match of Endless, you will need to follow these steps:\n1. Create a Party - Select which Models you want to bring in your adventuring party.\n2. Select Commands - 1 and 2 Crystal Models may only take a limited number of the Commands listed on the back of their card.\n3. Select Items - From your deck of item cards, select which items are carried by which Models.\n 4. Play! - The following is just an excerpt of the basics, the full rulebook will give you more information.\nA normal play area is between 10\u201dx10\u201d and 20\u201d x 20\u201d with a square grid. You can easily find RPG game mats at gaming stores or build your own boards with 1\u201d squares. Tactical RPGs have multilevel battlefields, where the elevation of certain squares can change a battle. If you are designing your own map, make sure to include changes in elevation. Using a dry erase/wet erase marker on a square, you can mark the height of the square if you are unable to build a three dimensional battlefield.\nCreating a Party\nThe basic Party size is determined by the scenario being played. If two players simply wish to have a skirmish, they can agree upon a Crystal Limit to play a game. In such situations the standard Limit is either 5 Crystals or 10 Crystals. The Crystal cost for a Model is often shortened to \u2018C\u2019 as in 1C for a Squire, or 3C for Lyra Cosine.\nCrystal Icon\nAn Example party for a standard match could be:\nMandragora x3 (1C each), Cleric x1 (2C), Rune Fencer x1 (2C), and Chain x1 (3C)\nVS\nDark Knight x2 (2C each), Zebolg x1 (3C), and Yulea Seablade x1 (3C)\nSelect Commands\n1C and 2C Models have Command Lists on the back of their cards. These lists include check boxes that can be marked off, while the card is in a protective sleeve, using dry erase markers. Alternatively, you can use scratch paper. The commands you mark off are the only ones the Model can use in battle. 1C Models select 2 Commands, and 2C Models select 4 Commands. 3C+ Models have a fixed Command List, but placing them in card sleeves will still help with tracking HP and MP.\nParty Restrictions\nModels on Red or Purple backed cards are considered Unique. All Unique Models may only be taken once per Party. As they are Unique, with their own histories and personalities, their Command List is fixed, and they have all of their available commands.\nFor more information on how to play, download the free Quickstart Rules here.\nRewards\n$10 Conscript - Get any and all digital rewards, including the Miasma War PDF & EFT Rulebook. Conscript is included with all other levels.\n$15 Squire - Get 1 Fals worth of Item.\n$40 Scholar - Get softcover books for both the EFT Rulebook & MW Expansion Book.\n$50 Knight - Get 5 Fals worth of Items.\n$85 Sergeant - Get 10 Fals worth of Items.\n$175 Commander - Get 25 Fals worth of Items.\n$325 General - Get 50 Fals worth of Items*.\n$3,000 Rhapsodist - Get 25 Fals worth of Items, and more*.\n$5,000 Hero - Get 50 Fals worth of Items, and more*.\nSkykadia Pledge Calculator - There are currently 39 Fals worth of items available.\n*See Below for more details.\nThis level is digital goods only.\nDigital Rewards Currently Include:\nEndless: Fantasy Tactics Rulebook.\nThe Miasma War Expansion Book.\nStat Cards for all units included in EFT & TMW.\nAI Cards for all units included in EFT & TMW.\nAs with all On The Lamb digital products, you will need to have an account with WargameVault to receive the PDFs.\n While this level starts off with getting a lot of repeats (Nothing wrong with getting 50 Mandragora), this will get you enough Fals to cover all currently planned stretch goals should they unlock.\nThis level includes the Commander level, netting you a bunch of EFT models, but also includes getting your own custom Class, Monster, or Character (Including a Mini & Stat Card).\nThis level includes the General level, netting you a ton of EFT models, but also includes getting your own custom Hero (Including a Mini & Stat Card) made after you and having them depicted fighting Zebolg in a piece of art in the campaign book. You'll also get a print of this art piece.\nAfter the campaign is over we will use a survey or pledge manager to determine what models you're getting.\nAdd Ons\nAdd-Ons may be added to your Pledge of Sergeant, Commander, General or Higher. You may add the cost of these addons to your pledge while the campaign is active by using the 'Manage My Pledge' button, or you may add to it after the campaign ends by using our Pledge Manager.\nExtra Fals! - You may add any number of Fals for $6 per Fals to those listed levels.\nFor Example:\n10 Fals = $60\n15 Fals = $90\n25 Fals = $150\nPrinted Books - While we're including PDF copies of everything, we know a lot of folks prefer to have their rulebooks in dead tree format. Printed books may also be added to the Knight level.\nEndless: Fantasy Tactics Rulebook (138pgs, Color, Softcover) - $20\nThe Miasma War Expansion Book (~140pgs, Color, Softcover) - $15\nShipping Times\nThe delivery section of the Kickstarter is an estimate, and almost never accurate.

Why crowdfunding? We where inactive between 2011 and late 2013 due to several personal issues that are now solved, and because of the high interest in our models and several requests from old customers we are now redoing our original line of miniatures.

The Precision Cooker circulates water around the pot, ensuring a consistent temperature throughout. AND, the Precision Cooker Connects to your phone, allowing you to cook amazing meals by simply touching a button. The food is amazing, tender, and moist, every time.\nWatch Chef Ming Tsai talk about the Anova Precision Cooker and precision cooking / sous vide:\n    Background on Precision Temperature Cooking (Sous Vide)\nOnce limited to the world's best restaurants, precision temperature cooking (sous vide) is now the fastest growing kitchen appliance category. Last year was a huge year for precision temperature cooking, as it was the first year that precision temperature cooking devices became very affordable for home chefs. The Anova Precision Cooker represents the next evolution of precision temperature cooking technology, making it easy and affordable for anyone to reap the benefits of this type of cooking.\nDid you know that precision cooking (sous vide) is used in the majority of high-end restaurants?\nMost people don't know how pervasive precision cooking is, but it's now used by a majority of high-end restaurants. It's also used at chain establishments, such as Chipotle.\nWhile high-end restaurants have been using precision cooking for years, the technique has only become popular with home chefs in the past four to five years with the advent of reality cooking shows. \nDespite the publicity from these cooking shows, until last year, most sous vide devices were still too expensive for home chefs, as models cost between $500 and $1,000. Anova was the first company to begin selling an affordable device for the home chef, with a price of only $199. Now, precision cookers / sous vide devices are the fastest growing kitchen appliance category.\nWhat does sous vide mean?\nFor years people have called this type of cooking \u201csous vide,\u201d which is French for \"under vacuum.\" This refers to the process of vacuum sealing food and putting it in a water-bath. However, that's a bit of a misnomer. You don't need to vacuum seal your food to cook sous vide. \nInstead, this technique is really about bringing food to a very precise temperature and holding it there for a period of time. A better name for this technique, then, is \"precision temperature cooking\" or \"precision cooking\" for short. That's why we've named our system the Anova Precision Cooker.\nHow it Works\nPrecision cooking is extremely easy. It usually involves these three simple steps:\n1. Attach the Precision Cooker to a pot and set time and temp. Use the simple interface to set the time and temperature. Or, you can use the app to find what you're cooking and just hit \"start.\"\n2. Put food in a ziplock bag and then you clip it to the side of the pot. Simply put your food in a sealable bag. The circulator moves water around the pot, ensuring a consistent temperature throughout\n3. Finish by sear, grilling or broiling. Some people like to finish their cook by searing their food, throwing it on the grill, or by broiling it. This gives the food a nice look.\nThe Advantages of Precision Temperature Cooking\nPrecision cooking produces results that are impossible through any other technique. Precision cooking gives important advantages over traditional methods, including the following benefits:\nConsistency. Because you cook your food to a precise temperature for a precise amount of time, you can expect very consistent results. \nTaste. Food cooks in its juices. This ensures that the food is moist, juicy and tender.\nWaste reduction. Traditionally prepared food dries out and results in waste. For example, on average, traditionally cooked steak loses up to 40% of its volume due to drying out. Steak cooked via precision cooking, loses none of its volume.\nDon't worry about overcooking. Traditional cooking can require your constant attention. Precision cooking brings food to an exact temperature and holds it. There is no worry about overcooking.\nPrecision cooked steak vs. traditional steak\nSteak cooked via precision cooking is done perfectly edge to edge. In the image below, you can see that the steak on the right appears smaller. That steak was pan-cooked. In comparison, the steak on the left was cooked by the Anova Precision Cooker and it is consistent from edge-to-edge.\nPrecision cooked eggs vs. eggs cooked traditionally\nPrecision cooking eggs allows you to control how eggs turn out. Traditionally cooked eggs are a bit of a crap shoot. It's very difficult to time them perfectly to get the desired result.\nSalmon cooked traditionally vs. precision cooked salmon\nMuch like steak, fish cooked by the Anova Precision Cooker is done perfectly, edge-to-edge. When pan cooked, the surface temperature of the pan is higher than the ideal cooking temperature, resulting in the edges being overcooked.\nEverything Tastes Better When Cooked Perfectly\nIt's not just steak, fish, and eggs that come out better when cooked with the Anova Precision Cooker. Chicken comes out moist and tender. Vegetables are bright and flavorful. Pork is tender and juicy. The Anova Precision Cooker can be used on a wide variety of foods and the results are delicious and healthy.\nOur Story\nJeff Wu has been using immersion circulation technology since the age of 13. While still in college, Jeff became an engineer for a scientific equipment manufacturer and started working with classmate, Natalie Vaughn on designing and selling scientific equipment.  \nJeff has always been obsessed with two things: (1) designing and building laboratory equipment and (2) cooking. He had no idea that two could go together until on a visit to Harvard in 2007, he saw two grad students using laboratory-grade circulators to cook. Not long after that visit, Jeff tried to build his own device to cook sous vide-style meals. He also began using lab equipment to cook sous vide. \nJeff became determined to build a sous vide device for the home chef. In 2010, he did just that and created an early proof-of-concept of an affordable home sous vide.\nThe Proof-of-Concept\nAnova I\nIn 2013, Jeff teamed up with Natalie to launch Anova Culinary, LLC. The first product, was the Anova 1. At $199, the Anova 1 became the first affordable immersion circulator for the home chef.\nThe reception for the first commercial unit was overwhelming. . . .\n\"So is it amazing? Yes. I\u2019m kind of hooked.\" - TechCrunch\n\"If you're looking to get into sous vide, the way to go is the Anova sous vide circulator.\" The Sweethome\n\"[Anova] is the one to beat\" - WIRED\n\"The Anova Sous Vide Immersion Circulator is an easy to use device that both beginners and pros will enjoy.\" - CNET\nWe Can Do Better\nDespite the popularity of the Anova 1, we wanted to do better. We felt we could improve upon the following three major areas:\n(1) The price. We think this type of technology should be affordable to everyone. We want to work to produce a unit that is extremely affordable.\n(2) The unit must be more flexible. One of the limitations to current systems is that they require tall pots, which limits the type of equipment you can use with the device and makes its use somewhat cumbersome.\n(3) The Precision Cooker should be a connected device. The interface should move to the iPhone, making the device even easier to use. People shouldn't have to search for hours for time and temperature settings. They should be able to hit a button and start cooking. \nThe Redesign\nIn addition to our three chief goals (low-price, flexibility, and connectivity), we also wanted to incorporate many suggestions from our users. The result is a redesigned system, specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of the home chef. It\u2019s simple, yet powerful, flexible and accurate. It\u2019s incredibly light, weighing only 2.5 lbs. Its small, and easy to store. It truly represents a breakthrough in precision temperature cooking devices.\nThe Clip\nWe\u2019ve redesigned the clip, so that it\u2019s detachable from the system. It\u2019s secure, but flexible. You can use the device with virtually any pot or container.\nVectoring / 360 Degree Pump\nThe clip allows the unit to turn, which means you can point the pump flow to any direction This gets water to flow around the pot, ensuring a consistent temperature throughout\nInterface\nThe interface is completely new and incredibly easy to use. You slide the wheel up and down to change the temperature. Then you press start.\nBluetooth Connected\nThe unit is Bluetooth enabled, which for the first time ever allows you to cook perfect meals with your smartphone.\nRemovable Skirt\nAnova has a removable skirt, which allows you to take off the bottom and clean it in the dishwasher.\nMaterials\nThe unit is made of polycarbonate and stainless steel. Stainless steel parts prevent rust and corrosion and last for ages.\nConnectivity and Apps\nThe iPhone App makes it incredibly easy to cook with Anova. You simply find the food you\u2019re cooking, adjust the settings if you\u2019d like, and hit start. There\u2019s no need to search for time and temperature settings. It will all be programmed into your phone.\nWe\u2019re going to release an SDK, so that people can develop their own apps to work with Anova. We anticipate people will make nutritional apps, apps that make it easy to share what you\u2019re cooking with others, recipe apps, and time and temperature apps.\nWe want you to be able to input what you\u2019ve got in the fridge and simply touch a button to begin cooking the perfect meal.\nWatch Kenji Lopez from Serious Eats interview Jeff about the Anova Precision Cooker:\nWhat Others Kindly Say\nPricing, Availability, and Specifications \nPricing & Availability:\nProduct Price: $169 \nEstimated Availability: October 2014\nFinish: \nBlack (Brushed / Machined) \nWhite (Brushed / Machined) \nPerformance:\nTemperature Range: 77\u00b0F to 210\u00b0F \u00b1 0.01\u00b0F / 25\u00b0C to 99\u00b0C \u00b1 0.01\u00b0C \nPump Speed: 1 - 1.2 GPM 7-8 LPM (still optimizing) \nDirectional Pump: 360 degree directional pump \nTank Capacity: 4-5 Gallon 15-19 Liters \nTimer: 99 hours Max \nSafety: Bi-Metal Fuse \nPower Input: 110-120VAC (220-240V EU) \nHeating Power: 800W \nBluetooth wireless \nEstimated Weight and Dimensions:\nLength: 2.75 in / 6.98 cm \nWidth: 2.75 in / 6.98 cm \nHeight: 14.75 in / 36.8 cm \nImmersion Depth: 7.25 in / 18.415 cm \nMax Clamp Opening: 1.25 in /  3.175 cm \nMinimum Immersion Depth: 2.5 Inches / 6.35 cm \nWeight: 2.5 lbs / 1.1 kg \nSensors:\nWet Sensor\nAuto-shut off\nTemp sensor \nDisplay and Controls:\nLED Display \nTemperature Display C & F readout \nTimer HH:MM \nScroll wheel Increment/Decrement \n24/7 display\nMaterials:\nBody: Polycarbonate \nSkirt: Polycarbonate/Stainless in Late Q4 \nTransparent bottom piece: Polycarbonate \nCleaning:\nRemovable skirt\nDishwasher safe skirt\nEasy twist disassemble \nIn the Box:\nPrecision Cooker\nCord\nManual\nOur Mission\nEverything we do is to make this type of technology and this cooking technique accessible.

Since that time, we've gone through several product iterations to get to the design that we feel is ideal for the home chef. We've completed the design and engineering and created a prototype, using our own 3D printing machines. \nWhat's left\nTo complete this project we need to finish our injection molding and begin final production of the units. We need to finish development of the connected device which will allow for the machine to communicate with smartphones via Bluetooth.\nWe need a Community to Realize Our Goals\nWe're extremely thankful for the support we've received from customers. But we need even more support to make sure that we can continue to provide a product that is an amazing value. \nThanks so much!\nOur Extended Team (With Our Thanks and Gratitude)\nGet Fresh (Full-Service Agency)\nStephen Svajian, CEO, Get Fresh, and Kickstarter Producer\nColin Day, Video, Get Fresh\nAaron Sananes, Design, Get Fresh\nNicole Van Zanten, Social Media, Get Fresh\nStephen Thorpe, Audio Engineer\nFernando Camarena, Camera\nAlbert Lopez, Video Editor\nChef Nicole Poireer, Chef\nKara Tsuboi, On-Camera Talent\nCredit\nUse of restaurant video footage was provided under a Creative Commons license by the following: \nCanlis Restaurant\nRistorante Caff\u00e8 Vittorio Emanuele\nSepia Restaurant and Wine Bar\nStretch Goals\n                                   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAnova has a team with extensive manufacturing experience. Specifically, our project benefits from the following key facts:\n- We have a history of designing and manufacturing quality products in-house\n- The Anova Precision Cooker is the result of detailed and careful planning\n- We have previously designed and manufactured a precision cooker\n\nDespite our expertise and careful planning, there are risks to the project. We've identified and outlined the following key risks to our project below:\n\n1. RISK DUE TO PROBLEMS WITH THE INJECTION MOLD:\n\nInjection molding is a process that can often set hardware products back. We're fortunate to have experience in injection molding, but in the event that there is a problem with the injection mold, our project could be set back several weeks.\n\n2. RISK DUE TO EXCESS DEMAND:\n\nWe're fortunate to do our own manufacturing. Should we receive support in excess of our anticipated demand, there could be delays in backers receiving their products.\n\nIf demand is extraordinary, we could be forced to open a new manufacturing facility, which would further delay our project. \n\n3. RISK DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE AND THE CONNECTED DEVICE: \n\nOur team has experience building and developing connected devices. Specifically, we've built devices that connect to software via Bluetooth. However, development of our connected device is currently in progress and is largely conceptual. Despite the proficiency of the team, it is possible that the development schedule could slip and we will not be ready to release source code to developers in time for them to build apps for backers.\n\nFurther, our schedule could slip to the point that there is no app for the initial batch of units to use, as we believe it is important to ship units as they become available, which could pre-date final delivery of apps.\n\n4. RISK DUE TO SUPPLIERS:\n\nWe have long-standing relationships with our suppliers. In addition, we have a very robust supply chain for components. However, it is not impossible that our project gets delayed due to problems with a supplier.

Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nFor two years I have been looking for a great dice game.\nDRAGON SLAYER is that game.\nDragon Slayer has everything I wanted in Indie Boards & Cards' first dice game:\nIt's fast playing, games take 15 minutes, so you can play while waiting for friends to arrive, in line, or over and over again all night long.\nIt has dragons that you are trying to kill.\nIt has dragon dice, dragons that are trying to kill you.\nIt's a \"press your luck\" classic, roll till you stop, go too far and you'll die.\nDid I mention that your friends are trying to get you killed?\nThat\u2019s right, it is a dice game with a twist \u2013 real player interaction! Think your friend pressed his luck too far \u2013 challenge him to keep going. If he does, he can score big \u2013 but if he fails or worst yet doesn\u2019t take the challenge, he\u2019ll lose points and you get some.\nDragon Slayer plays 2 - 5 players, but we are including everything you need to play with 6 in the box.\nFast, Fun and Full of spite \u2013 what more could you ask for?\n Dragon Slayer is a great game, but you can\u2019t know that yet. So if you are getting a reward from our recent Coup Reformation project, then we can add Dragon Slayer to your Reformation rewards and pass along the combined shipping savings to you. A great game at a fantastic price is good deal for everyone. Didn\u2019t back Reformation? Dragon Slayer is still a great game, and you can add extra copies at the same price. And you\u2019ll help us reach our stretch goals.\nIt\u2019s a dice game with 12 custom dice, nice art, detailed rules and six challenge tokens for 7 bucks \u2013 so you know that we can\u2019t get crazy. But I would like to give backers a few extras in addition to a fantastic price. And since this is mass produced, we need to make a minimum number to be able to offer special items.\nSo stretch rewards are based on number of backers (not counting those that aren\u2019t getting rewards, just counting those that are in at the $7 level and above)\n1000 Backers \u2013 Metallic Ink Dice: It looks cool, it is cool. Everyone will know that you got the special edition as soon as you take them out.\nAchieved!\n3000 Backers \u2013 Foil Box: We all like shiny, and a nice shiny game box is a great way to get your friends to play. We can\u2019t understand why, but we all know that it happens. So help us get more backers and we\u2019ll get a box that screams \u201cPlay Me!\u201d \nAchieved!\n4,000 Games - Battlemat: The Battlemat is a convenient way to track your turn during the game. It's been designed to help you quickly learn and teach the game by emphasizing the core game rules and steps in your turn.\nAchieved!\n5,000 Games - Score tracker:  a compact scoreboard with small cubes to track each player's progress and tokens to remind everyone what color they are!\nAchieved!\n6,000 Games - Score tracker for 6 players & and a 2nd copy of the Battlemat: Even though we are listing the game as supporting 2-5 players, there is no theoretical maximum number of players. We are including challenge tokens to support up to 6 (or have an extra if you lose one), so it makes sense that we could also include scoring markers for that 6th player as well. If we get 6000 committed games in this project, we will include the 6th player in green.\nACHIEVED!\nALL STRETCH REWARDS UNLOCKED!\nNote - These stretch goal upgrades won't be included in the retail version of the game that is sold via distribution.\nNick Hayes (a full time game designer, as well as a illustrator & graphic designer) did a great job on the box and game component art as you can see here:\nAs you might have expected in a PYL (push your luck) game, there are dice! 12 dice, 10 different with only the 3 warrior dice repeated. Each of the dragon dice have different head, wing and tail designs that really add to the \"wow\" factor. And yes these are molded dice - not silkscreened, so they will be durable. Also in the box are the challenge tokens - enough to support games with up to 6 players, though we are listing on the box that this will play 2-5.\nGame designer David Mortimer really made this game shine - creating a new PYL game is a deceptively difficult challenge, and he did this one right.  The rules can be found here. Like all great PYL games, the rules are simple, format of repeating the Dragon Hunt until you decide to stop. The very interesting twist is the player challenges. The ability to challenge, and rewards for passing or failing when challenged, add a dimension to everything that you do on your turn. What order do you go after dragons? When do you stop? When do you challenge? Who do you challenge? How do you get others not to challenge you?\nDon't get me wrong, it is still a classic PYL game with rules that are easy to learn and teach - it is just that the challenges really do add something very interesting to the genre and nicely complement the rest of the great design ideas that David has incorporated in Dragon Slayer.\nI really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the Indie Boards and Cards, and be able to offer this fantastic deal to those that helped us blow the roof off the Reformation project. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nThank you for supporting us!\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where it is ready; your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages. In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools and in 2013 we added Coup and Snowdonia to our portfolio. Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards currently has another project that is due for deliver (Coup Reformation expansion), that game will be produced at the same time as this game. As the artwork is already done for both games this should not present a great risk.\n\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the game - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you.

We are going to be including Kickstarter Exclusive playable cards into every Minion base set. These cards will only be printed for the Kickstarter backers and never again. \nKickstarter-inator - Item Card\nKickbacker - Spell Card\nMore details on the exclusive cards soon! :)\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nOur tentative ship date has moved up to November 2014 (Day TBA) no longer July 2015. With our team of artists doubling we are now able to produce all the cards at a much faster pace. We are aiming for a much earlier date than we previously specified in the reward tiers! Our goal is to have the game out before Christmas! :)\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nThe object of the game is to play your Minions in order to amass a powerful force and defeat your opponent.  But don't worry, when minions themselves are not enough, you can call on a wide assortment of amusing items and terrifying spells to lay low your enemies!\n120 UNIQUE cards in the base set. No wasteful mana/currency cards!\n2-4 players with an average play time of 30 minutes\nNo booster packs required!\nAffordable expansion packs that can be combined with the original core set in order to change the game mechanics and add more flavor!\nSimple, easy-to-understand rules and gameplay\nEpic, humorous fun for all!\n120 UNIQUE cards\u2026 oh wait, we said that already. No duplicates!\n  Product varies depending on pledge amount. The Collector's Edition design and contents shown is a prototype and may differ from final product.\nWith an amazing art style brought to you by the award-winning artists behind World of Warcraft TCG, Airmech, Legends of Cryptid, Galaxy Saga and more, Minion is beautifully illustrated with a grandiose and humorous feel.\nEvery single one of the 120 cards in the base set are uniquely illustrated - no duplicates anywhere! And speaking of 120 cards, that's all you'll need to play!\n*UPDATE* April 16, 2014 - New Card Design & Layout\nLet's check out the anatomy of a card!\n Check out some of the cards!\nAll them Minions\nItems, Spells, Enhancers & Traps\nHere they are in person! (PAX Prototype deck)\nPAX EAST 2014 Prototype Cards\nSo how do you play? We're glad you asked!\nEach turn you have $3 to spend and a fistful of cards. Play your Minions and Items, then tilt them to take advantage of their attacks and abilities.\nEvery card has a play cost. This usually ranges from free to $3.  Each player has $3 to spend per turn, although sometimes this can increase or decrease based on other cards in play.  Each turn you may play as many cards as you can afford.  Make sure you spend your money, you cannot save it up between turns!\nCheck back soon for some gameplay videos from PAX East!\nShared Deck\nAll players share and draw from the same deck - this makes it easy to travel with the game, and allows a ton of freedom in game mechanics. Take cards right from your opponent's hand and play them, or maybe your opponent will snag up the card you just discarded. The possibilities are limitless!\nTwo Draw Piles\nNot one, but two draw piles - one face up, one face down.  Whenever you draw cards, you get to draw from either pile - but beware, the face up pile has traps and you won't want to hit those!\nCard Flipping\nEver feel like your cards are too hard to protect?  A Pretty Overpowered Laser from your opponent is all it takes to nuke down your Brobarian. Fear not - use the Flip mechanic to flip your cards face down and protect them for a turn.  But wait, what if your opponent is the one with the Brobarian? Go ahead and use flip on his card to flip it face down and make it unusable next turn! This dual purpose mechanic has a ton of flexibility both offensively and defensively.\nExample of the play zones\nWe're different.  We don't want to sell you booster after booster - we don't want to reel in all your cash.  Our business model is simple: one box, that's all you need.  No more random booster packs with none of the cards you wanted.\nBut wait, 120 cards isn't enough for you?  We have stretch goals to create expansions and additional core sets of Minion - but always keeping with our core values: charging a fair price with no gambling on which cards you get.\nWe're going to PAX!  On April 11th-13th we'll be exhibiting at PAX East in Boston to launch the Minion Kickstarter! Come check out our awesome booth at the entrance to the tabletop section - right as you exit the video game show floor, look for us across from the WOTC floor!\nStop by and play a game to get a copy of our PAX Promo card!\nPAX EAST 2014 Promo Card\nDon't forget Addons!\nMinion Overlords, we\u2019re pleased to announce exciting new Stretch Goals!

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Find us at KitchenGoose.com after this Kickstarter Project ends!!!\nIf you've enjoyed some of the many culinary innovations lately, you may be aware of a rare treat known as \u2018the golden egg\u2019. Most people have never tasted the exquisite flavor of an In-shell Scrambled Egg. \n'Golden Eggs' can be enjoyed hard or soft boiled, deviled or in egg salad, fried, pickled, atop noodles, or as a surprise on Easter Sunday. There are many preparations yet to be discovered, perhaps you will be the first to invent a new recipe?\nGolden eggs are known to be a delicacy, but you'll have trouble finding a restaurant serving them and there are no utensils designed to create Golden Eggs... until now!  \nIntroducing the Golden Goose\nThe Golden 'Goose' is a low-tech, hand-powered kitchen gadget. It has been meticulously designed and tested to smoothly scramble the contents of a shell egg. The device uses \u2018centrifugal force\u2019 to scramble an egg without breaking the shell.\nIt works by alternating the rotation of an egg back and forth. This mixes the white and yolk inside the egg-shell without introducing outside air. It is easily used at any angle. The flavor profile is fresh and delicious, and there is no 'whipping' or bowl needed if you enjoy scrambled eggs on the stove.\nThe Goose was developed with the home cook in mind, but can just as easily be used by anyone. In fact, some users have suggested it's a good way to store scrambled eggs in a restaurant kitchen.\nCreating with the Goose\nWe've made some delicious treats and shared them to the amazement of our friends.\nI had never eaten soft boiled eggs until now.\nIf you're feeling creative, you can substitute golden eggs anywhere regular hard boiled eggs used to be.\nI think we might actually be the first folks to eat a fried golden egg!\nGolden eggs go nicely with salads too...\nBut let's switch gears and talk about how we arrived at the final Goose design.\nDetails of the Goose:\nThe Goose features lightweight & recyclable materials, comfortable handles, and the highest quality 1/8\u201d\u201d abrasion resistant cordage system. The Goose main shell is hinged during manufacturing, as part of the Polypropylene shell, to provide ease of use and keep the halves together. The ring turns 12 degrees to securely lock the shell together with an audible 'click'. The Goose features an elastic food-safe & dishwasher-safe 'egg cradle' designed to fit the variable sizes and shapes of eggs. It features specially designed fins to balance the egg and adjust the center of gravity providing smooth and efficient motion.\nWe never intended to develop a Goose. In fact, when we first heard that it was possible to scramble an egg in its shell, we were so curious that we stayed up until 4-am breaking every egg in sight. \nThe following day I was reminded of an old Victorian Era toy that rotates back and forth, so I stole the shoelaces from my tennis shoes and combined them with a plastic jar to create the first rough prototype.\nWe knew there had to be a better way for us to make Golden Eggs without struggling, and that\u2019s when Y Line Product Design hatched a plan to create The Golden Goose!\nThe design process took months of careful exploration and testing. We did loads of sketches and built functional and aesthetic models by hand and on the computer.\nSome of the prototypes worked better than others, so we incorporated the use of computer aided modeling and 3D printing to refine our performance criteria and eliminate unnecessary features. We eventually dialed-in the performance, feel, and look of the Goose.\nThe Goose is designed to be effective, and easy to use:\n It only takes a minute to learn, and even kids like doing it.\nNest an egg in the cradle\nClose and turn the ring until you hear a click\nSwing, then pull the handles to spin it until you hear the egg scramble\nPurpose:\nThe Goose is for Fun. It\u2019s not going to change the world. The Goose is a kitchen utensil that empowers the user to create new recipes, and hopefully creates unique and enjoyable experiences. \nIt would be cheaper to manufacture with other materials, but we chose Polypropylene, Nylon, and TPE because they meet our criteria, and are recyclable.\nThe Goose is easily assembled & disassembled. This means that we save cost and energy in the making of a Goose. We did extra work to ensure it can be easily taken apart so folks could wash or replace parts easily. We hope that users will be empowered to recycle the Goose many years from now when it reaches the end of its life cycle.\nThe Rewards:\nHonkers: Pledge $10 or more\nDon\u2019t need any more kitchen gadgets, but still curious? We\u2019ll still send you the Recipe Guide, and the Illustrated Instruction manual to satisfy your curiosity.

Little golden treats...Yum!\nCup Cup Goose: $260K\nIf we've actually come this far, then we should probably supply you with a Quail-egg cup so you can enjoy the Goose's little buddy!\nBirdShot: $290K\nLet's face it, this is a whole Kickstarter project of its own. We're shooting for the Moon with the BirdShot! This little gadget is the perfect accessory to the Goose. \nThe Birdshot is a 'Rapid Infuser'...using the same forces required to scramble an egg, the Birdshot infuses 1.5 ounces of liquid with the essence of the user's chosen ingredient. \nUse it for flavoring vinegar and anything else you can imagine! \nSpecial thanks to everyone for honoring us with so much attention!\nWho is responsible for this Goose?!\nGoose is created by designer Geraint Krumpe. He is an innovator with more than 15 years of experience in the Design field. In his professional career he contributed to more than 60 Design and Utility Patents. His work is awarded, and featured in the press, blogs, magazines, for sale, and in homes.\n-\"It has been hard work and long hours, but anybody who is curious at heart is going to have fun!\"\nI've recently \u2018hung a shingle\u2019 in Chicago with the introduction of a small design studio, Y Line Product Design. In my 'free time' I'm a 3D printing enthusiast, so I want to share the Goose with other enthusiasts. That's why we are offering, as a reward, the option to download and print your own Goose!\nMore on the egg itself:\nWhat does it taste like?\nThe short answer is \u2018scrambled\u2019, but that\u2019s not entirely accurate. The flavor is rich and subtle. If you are a fan of eggs, and a fan of scrambled eggs, then there is no better way to enjoy them. The science behind it is based on how proteins and fats react to each other inside of the egg without the intrusion of outside air.\n\nThe texture is silky, and depending on how long you boil, or at what temperature, you can create a range of flavors and characteristics. In addition, it is a great way to scramble eggs without dirtying a whisk and bowl, and golden eggs poured directly into the frying pan taste better than any scrambled eggs you've ever had...\nHow else can I prepare a Golden Egg?\nKnown methods include hard-boiled, soft boiled, deviled, scrambled, egg salads, Scotched, served with Ramen Noodles... and so on...but there are dishes yet to be discovered by the intrepid explorer!\nOK, so how do we produce it?\nThe Golden Goose is not a product, so we have to make it a reality by investing in manufacturing tools & materials. We need to fund both the manufacturing and assembly of each Goose. The design is finalized, and we have quotes from manufacturers domestically and in Asia. The plan is to mold the Goose parts in Asia and assemble them in the US.\nHere is a breakdown of our target time-line:\nJune: Pilot production samples and proofs\nMid-June: Shipping schedule and assembly procedure\nJuly: Travel to factory for pre-production confirmation\nMid-July: Final samples approved\nAugust: Pilot Production run\nMid-August: Shipping to US\nSeptember: Product received & Assembled - Bumps receive rewards!\nMid-September: First production run rewards shipped\nEarly October or Late September: Second production run rewards shipped\nThese are general targets for production and shipping, but we will get the rewards to you sooner if possible. All non-manufactured rewards will ship ASAP. \nEither way you slice it, your donation will help us achieve a concrete goal, and you will be rewarded with gold!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKickstarter is the world\u2019s most successful funding platform, but that doesn't mean there aren't inherent risks involved in a project. \n\nNothing is for certain, but I can guarantee that there are experienced and smart people working to make the Goose project a success. \n\nInjection molding is far from an exotic manufacturing technique, and our design has been carefully crafted to be produced efficiently and assembled quickly and easily.\n\nAs we encounter challenges or setbacks we will address them methodically and creatively. When we reach our funding goal, we are going to do everything humanly possible to ensure the Goose takes flight!\n\n8 Iterative rounds of prototyping and design refinement have culminated into the production ready model. We have secured competitive bids from two of the largest and most reliable manufacturers in Asia, and we have been promised lead times of 40 days or less.\n\nThe parts produced will be made from high quality materials.\n\nWe will confirm our pilot models prior to committing to production, and I will personally inspect the production samples for quality before committing to manufacturing the rewards.\n\nWe'll package your Goose with care, and maximize the density of Geese for shipping to further reduce fuel use and our environmental footprint.\n\nY Line Product Design has invested a great deal of time and energy into the development of the Goose. We've nurtured it as long as we can, and now it is ready to leave the nest. We\u2019re hoping you will weigh the risks involved in supporting our project and decide to help us give the Goose wings!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "The Golden Goose V.1 shipped a year ago today!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "The Goose Upcoming TV Appearances", "update_content": "The Butter Boss is Universal!\nWe forgot to mention that the Butter Boss can be loaded with any butter!\nPlus, you can customize your butter for serving, cooking, or grilling!\nIt's easy and effortless and gives you the power of culinary creativity..."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "A Golden Anniversary!", "update_content": "Dear Gooser,\nWe had a pretty good first day over at Butter Boss!

For these questions, look below at the examples.\nFor a look at the rules, here is the Rule Book we used during most of our play testing time (Note; some things obviously aren't in there, like art... and specific set-up rules, but trust us, they will be in the finished product) Play Test Rule Book\nProject 13 is a MOBA and ARTS inspired Tabletop Arena Game that allows players to select one of the competitive Game Modes and then battle back and forth between their \u201cSupers\u201d and their Towers, hoping to take control of the board and reality.\nEach Hero and Villain in Project 13 is designed and created by Chris, then brought to life through past inspirations and the amazing styling of local Artist and Rare Find Games teammate, Tessa Schram or Erin Simenson. \nArena Mode: 2 - 10 Players  approx. Time - 30 minutes per Match\nFind all the details about Arena Mode HERE.\nConquest Mode: 2 \u2013 6 Players approx. Time \u2013 30 Minutes to 2 Hours (3v3 or possibly 5v5)\nIn this game mode, teams of 3(Possibly 5) will attempt to take down the other side's Obelisk! Each side can be made up of both Heroes and Villains.\nThe full Game Board Setup\nThe Game Board shown above will be in 8x10 Game Board Tiles, allowing for the 2 sides of the map to be interchanged. This also allows us to expand on the game board as time goes on or via Stretch Rewards, scaling the game for more players and different Terrain.\nThroughout the game, Players will upgrade Powers and purchase Enhancements to further their attempts at defeating the opposing team. Minions will continue to spawn and advance, hoping to give momentum to each team, much like a MOBA or ARTS game would function.\n- 8 (10x8) Map Tiles (2- Sided)\n- 20 Unique Supers (3 Cards  and a Dry Erase Character Sheet Each), 18 Enhancements (6 Each)\n- 20 Hero Tokens\n- 12 Tower Tokens  \n- 2 HQ Tokens\n- Minion and Jungle\n- Health, Endurance, Status and Destruction Tokens\n- 12 Combat Die (6 Green Physical Die, 6 Red Power Die)\n- 1 Full Color Instruction Manual\n- 1 Full Color Scenario Book\n- 1 Conquest Setup Sheet\nPrinting. That\u2019s it. Honestly the game has been play tested beyond measure, the art is almost done (We have some minor rulebook art and such to finish). We simply want to print the highest quality game possible, which means we need a big professional printer, the kind that prints games like Magic; The Gathering, and to do that, we need far more capital than we have. \nSo each dollar we get will go towards that, and then after the goal, improving the game and adding to the Season 1 Set \u201cCrisis\u201d, so be sure to check our Stretch Rewards and Goals Below!\n Stretch Rewards!\nWhen we set out to do the game we had worked to balance the game with more than the original 20 Heroes and Villains in the game, so above all we want to get to the point where we can add them in, look below;\n$4,000: We are FUNDED!!! and we appreciate all the love and support you guys gave!\n$6,000: Super Revealed!

As for delivering you a box, well, while we would love to stop by your house in the UK, sadly we can only make stops in the Continental US and some parts of Canada (Sorry Hawaiians).\nSo lets break down Shipping for you guys,\nUnited States: Free Shipping\nCanada: $5.00 That's it. Add that for shipping to Canada. We have shipped things in and out of Canada with day jobs and have that part down pretty well.\nInternational Backers (UK and Europe): For you, it's approx. $30.00 dollars to send it out to you guys for us, depending on the place, so just add that to the donation and we will be set. For some reason parcel services hate Americans sending anything out of country. if you guys have suggestions, we would absolutely find time during this time to explore them, but until then, it's $30.00.\nAs for our Launch Event?

People have a tendency to overestimate their ability to create fire under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, cold, windy locations or darkness. Humidity, time of year, and altitude are also conditions to consider as well. Likewise, material selection is a key prerequisite to successfully building a sustainable fire. Even then there is no guarantee it can be accomplished in a survival situation.\nThe most vital component of fire is its  ability to provide heat to dry wet clothes and to regulate the body\u2019s core temperature as maintaining body temperature is vital for survival. The most common cause of death in the wild is hypothermia. Even in desert scenarios, freezing night temperatures have been known to claim lives.\nAside from the above mentioned physical aspect, fire can offer mental comfort as the light and smoke can be used for signaling rescue and it can be used as a predator and insect deterrent.\nFire will also contribute greatly to food and water preparation. The heat will kill the majority of parasites and bacteria when cooking game, fish, insects and wild edibles. The smoke will dry and preserve food for later. Having a hot meal can also boost the mental state giving you a psychological edge\n                                           DID WE MENTION,\n         550 FireCord is also WATERPROOF!\nSimply deploy your 550 FireCord to meet all of your parachute cord needs. When you need the fire tinder simply remove the inner strands, light just like any fire tinder and build your fire.  After the inner strands are used the outer shell can still be utilized as before - for lanyards, keychains, zipper pulls or emergency lashing. \nHow does 550 FireCord differ from other emergency fire starting gear? \n550 FireCord: \n\u2022 ignites with ease\n \u2022 burns very hot \n \u2022 long burn times per volume\n \u2022 waterproof \nThis product will revolutionize the outdoor gear industry as well as your use of paracord forever.\nAlthough we have proof of concept and know the product works, we need to scale up in order to increase our production volume.\n*** The Paracord WILL be rated at 550 Lbs + ***\nYour support in funding 550 FireCord will assist us with Manufacturing & Production, Packaging, as well as Sales & Marketing.\nADD-ONS\n(Note: For Add-Ons, a minimum $25 or higher pledged amount is required)\n1 Ferro Rod to use with your 550 FireCord - $3\n1 Live Fire Sport Compact Fire Starter - $5\n1 Live Fire Original Emergency Fire Starter - $10\nAdditional 25 feet of any unlocked color 550 FireCord - $25\nSet of 5 Live Fire Sport and Ferro Rod Kit reward levels - $25\nSet of 3 Live Fire Sport and 2 Live Fire Original and a Ferro Rod - $40\nAlways Prepared Kit: Includes 1 Live Fire Sport, 1 Live Fire Original, 25ft of 550 FireCord (thin red line only), Ferro Rod - $45\nAdditional 50 feet of any unlocked color 550 FireCord - $50\nSet of 5 Live Fire Original and Ferro Rod - $55\nSet of any 3 Unlocked color selections of 25ft lengths (total of 75 feet of cord!) - $75\nAdditional 100 feet of any unlocked color 550 FireCord - $100\nSet of 5 Unlocked color selections of 25ft lengths (total of 125 feet of cord!) - $125\nThank You!

Adam was quite impressed with the product and gave it a fair and positive test and evaluation.\nBoth Roger and Adam stayed in contact and in 2012, Adam received a new product from Roger to review called Live Fire. Live Fire was Roger\u2019s latest fire starting invention. After Adam reviewed the product, not only did he become a fan of it, he found himself becoming an advocate of the technology as well.\nEventually Roger and Adam discussed some new ideas and casually brainstormed about expanding into other fire gear products.  Although Adam's relationship was initially established as a consultant, some of the different project ideas that were beginning to be developed required more time and focus.  Adam and Roger both realized that they made a great team as the synergy of their efforts started to produce great results.\nKnowing the two survivalists could revolutionize the survival industry, they quickly found themselves discussing and eventually forming a partnership in Live Fire Gear LLC, established in 2013.  550 FireCord represents the first of many new products currently in different phases of development. With this technology and their joint experience in the outdoor gear development community, Adam and Roger look forward to many more successful endeavors.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough we have proof of concept and we know the product works, we have to scale up to be able to increase the production volume.

From our previous projects, Bombshell Babes, the Maelee Special Edition Set, and the Scout Ship Kit, we have built a process to deliver miniatures to our backers on time with care and personalized service.

A software engineer by trade he enjoys the creative process even more than the end product (usually). When the opportunity to join Airlock Games came up he decided to take the leap into game development and publishing. Previously, he was part of the team that produced \"Secrets of the Third Reich\", providing background material and rules development assistance. An award winning painter and sculptor, Brett really enjoys doing miniatures conversions and playing any type of game whenever he can. Brett is the lead developer for Airlock Games.\n___________________________________________________________________________\nPatrick Keith is an award winning sculptor and painter who has provided work since 2006 for companies such as Reaper, Dark Sword, Privateer Press and many, many others.

As Bombshell Miniatures we successfully completed three Kickstarter campaigns and with each one we've improved our production capabilities, fulfillment process and on-time rate. Our most recent project helped us streamline backer reward selection and made international shipping more economical for our friends abroad.\n\nEven with all our previous experience we are still a small company dependent on a few people to do a lot of work. We know backers expect to be treated fairly and receive their rewards in a timely manner, so on-time fulfillment and backer satisfaction has been and always will be our top priority. That's why we decided early on to have the core set miniatures sculpted and ready to go to mold as soon as the project completes. In addition, we're providing a preview copy of the rules during the campaign so everyone can get a feel for game play in the Counterblast universe. In short, we want you to know exactly what you'll be getting from us as a backer of this project and that we are very serious about making Counterblast happen.\n\nDespite our best efforts the unexpected can occur. We are dependent on outside manufacturers to produce our products and delays can sometimes happen. Fortunately, we have established good working relationships with our main suppliers and do not anticipate any delays.\n\nOne of our goals is to attend GenCon this year with brand new Counterblast product in hand. That's why our \"Early Bird\" levels are not at a discounted price, but at an earlier fulfillment target. We didn't want to risk being victims of too much success and letting some of or backers down if we went to GenCon before sending out everyone's rewards. We feel we can get rewards in the hands of a limited number of people before GenCon and to everyone else soon after.\n\nThe last risk has to do with our reward levels and stretch goals.

You can also subscribe to our mailing list to get the latest news on Chaos Reborn developments.\nThank you all backers for supporting Chaos Reborn - do not disbelieve!\nCreature skins are backer exclusive rewards for Wizard Lord level (noble skins) and Wizard King level or above (royal skins).\n'I\u2019m excited about Chaos Reborn because it turns out to be a smart and interesting game even in this early, prototype form \u2026 it feels much more like the work of a smart young design-punk than something feeding on the sour blood of nostalgia.' - Alec Meer, Rock, Paper, Shotgun\nChaos Reborn is a game with nail-biting decisions and twists of fate. Every battle is different, every realm is unique, and there is always something new to discover.\nBased on my cult classic ZX Spectrum game \u2018Chaos\u2019, first published in 1985 by Games Workshop, Chaos Reborn is part sequel, part re-imagining of that original game brought up-to-date with high quality presentation. \nThe magic combat system remains true to the original Chaos. It is all about summoning a host of weird and mythical creatures, moving and fighting with them, and using your wizard to attack, defend, buff and de-buff with large array of spells. It is highly tactical and fast paced. But Chaos Reborn expands considerably on this by offering multiplayer modes, a single-player RPG system and co-op play.\nThank you for your support, and I hope to be playing Chaos Reborn with you soon.\nThe Rewards\nOur reward levels give player the opportunity to play some interesting roles in the game from the start. It should be emphasised that there is no pay-to-win situation since every player begins with a level 1 wizard and a meagre selection of spells, and any player can ascend through the ranks from Wizard Lord to God - given some effort and tactical ingenuity. Backers, though, will have some social safety net and will get some aesthetic perks, such as their special Wizard Auras. Check the FAQ and the detailed section on rewards below.\nStretch Goals\n$200k pledge level reached - Localisation of game text - at a minimum French, German, Italian and Spanish, plus a small selection of other languages to be decided based on demand and costs.\n$240k pledge level reached - Android/iOS platform support - a full version of the game available for mobile phones and tablets. The game will be a free download from app stores, and if you are a Kickstarter backer you will be able to unlock the full version without any additional cost (i.e. it will be a true cross-platform game).\nIn the beginning, the gods promised power and immortality through the gift of magic. In a short time the corruption and greed of humankind plunged the magic kingdoms into conflict, unleashing the forces of Chaos. Powerful beasts were summoned into the realm of men, and potent magic warped the landscape. Eventually the world was rent asunder, fractured into island realms split between planes of existence. The Gods of Law regained the upper hand and brought order to the realms by installing Wizard Kings to control the knowledge of magic. But the Gods of Chaos conspired with their devotees, and hid within the realms powerful magical artefacts for Chaos to rise again.\nAt the start of the game you are an apprentice wizard hoping to build your spells and equipment in order to become powerful enough to ascend the ranks through Wizard Lord, Wizard King, Demigod and ultimately God,  where you can influence the fate of the cosmos.\nAt the core of Chaos Reborn is the battle between wizards, fought in an arena with a limited selection of spells. The last wizard standing is declared the victor. Features include: \nQuick playing, turn-based combat. Battles typically last 10-30 minutes. \n80 unique spells, including 24 creatures - from dragons to goblins - fully animated in the 3D Unity Engine. \nClassic spells from the original Chaos - including the Gooey Blob, Raise Dead, and Magic Wood. \nBluff and deception - summon creatures as illusions for 100% success, and use Disbelieve spell on suspected enemy illusions. \nManipulate the balance of the Cosmos between Law and Chaos to your advantage. \nProcedurally generated 3D battle arenas with various types of terrain, and different levels of elevation. \nMultiple game modes, including Classic Chaos mode - fully random battle set-up with random selection of spells. \nThe original Chaos was always renowned as a great multiplayer game that could mix up human and AI wizards for a truly exciting battle. Chaos Reborn builds on this, adding several new features: \nMultiplayer online matches - asynchronous or live \nOffline multiplayer battles on one machine (hotseat mode) \nOnline rankings and league system \nTournaments with prizes \nExtensive co-op options, for multiplayer matches - 2 vs 2, or human co-op vs AI players \nGuild system with guild rankings and guild tournaments \nTrade items and equipment with your friends or guild members \nA major innovation in the Chaos system is the vast single-player RPG experience called the \u2018Realms of Chaos\u2019. You start as a new wizard with just a few spells and you must explore the Realms of Chaos, defeating the Wizard Kings that rule them in order to build your power and magical knowledge. \nWhen you enter a Realm you must seek out and defeat the Wizard Lords, the loyal minions of the Wizard King. As you travel the Wizard King will build his power and reinforce his Wizard Lords, so efficient exploration and effective combat are the keys to success in the Realms. You will discover things to help you and hinder you along the way, and you will build your spell knowledge and equipment as your progress. Once all the Wizard Lords are defeated you can challenge the Wizard King, and if you are victorious you are certain to win valuable treasures and potentially rare or unique artefacts. Here are some of the features of the Realms of Chaos mode: \nNew realms to explore each day - procedural generation system can create a near infinite variety of adventures\nPlayer generated realms - if you are a Wizard King you can design your own realm for other players to explore\nHundreds of different types of equipment to collect in your adventures - including staffs, body gear, headgear and magical artefacts \nBuild your spell knowledge by acquiring Spell Books through combat or trade \nWin gold from battles to spend on sea passages, teleports, mountain passes, realm maps, spell orbs and more. \nLevel up your wizard to gain access to higher level Realms \nLevel up individual items of equipment by entering their \u2018Inner Realms\u2019 - a series of dungeon like levels with unusual guardians \nCo-op mode - invite a friend or guild member to help you fight a battle in the realm you are exploring \nShare Realm Maps and your own experience of Realms with your guild members \n The RPG system in Chaos Reborn is very flexible. Your wizard\u2019s abilities and stats are entirely determined by the equipment given to him, so by using different configurations of equipment and spells you can personalize your wizard and play style, and try to optimise your tactics in battle. The equipment also determines how your wizard will look.\nWizard equipment consists of a staff, headgear and body gear. The staff has a special ability which can be activated after the staff is powered up during battle. For example, a staff might be able to unleash a lightning storm over a wide area, or flip the balance of the cosmos from Law to Chaos, or clone any creature in the arena.\nEach item of equipment may be levelled up individually, but you may only equip an item which has an equal or lower level than your wizard level. Thus your wizard level actually represents your mastery of magical technology. As equipment levels up, it\u2019s powers increase, thus increasing the power of your wizard. You can use equipment in Realm Quests and in multi-player online battles, if the battle rules permit it (\u2018Classic Chaos\u2019 mode, for example, does not allow equipment use). Equipment can be traded with other players for gold or other items, or it can be purchased in special locations inside Realms, or won as spoils of war in battle.\nExtra copies of the game for $15\nYou can add extra copies of the game to your reward for $15 each. Extra copies include early access to playable versions of the game but no other rewards (no art book, game guide, etc.). If you backed at the Apprentice tier or above, for each extra $15 above the price of your tier, you get an additional copy of the game. To do this you have to increase your pledge by multiples of $15 without changing your selected reward. For example, if you backed the game at Wizard Lord level for $50 and you increase your pledge to $80 you will get two extra copies of the game. I will send a survey out at the end of the campaign to check with you exactly what you required with your increased pledge amount. Please note that you can only buy a maximum of 8 extra copies this way.\nReward Tiers\nIf you back the project at Apprentice tier and above you will have access to early playable versions of the game before the official launch, and you can participate in the design process through the Chaos Reborn website.\nWith the Forgemaster tier and above you get to design and name a set of rare equipment items. The game has a procedural generation system for equipment with wide variety of visual designs and game effects, but in this case you will get to design your own equipment and its visual looks using an equipment editor program. Your wizard will start with your equipment, but it will be possible for other players to find more copies of the equipment you designed - with your author tag attached. \nIf you select the Wizard Lord tier or above, you have important status within the wizardly realms, and an extra play mode that allows your wizard to act as an NPC for other players to encounter in their realm exploration. In order to do this you have to go online and configure your wizard by choosing equipment, spells and battle tactics. While you are offline your wizard will be controlled by AI and may be involved in multiple battles. When you go online you may review these battles, which can then help you refine your wizard configuration. Your wizard will earn experience points and gold by using this mode. \nIf you choose the Wizard Lord, Wizard King, Demigod or God rewards, your wizard has status, but still begins as a level one wizard. In order to be effective when deployed as an AI controlled wizard in realms you still need to go adventuring in the Realms or play multiplayer battles so that you can level up your wizard and equip him properly. In other words, you have no initial advantage over other player except access to an exclusive game mode.\nOther players can still ascend the ranks from Wizard Lord to God, with a lot of time, effort and ingenuity. They can also be demoted from these positions to make way for better players. However, if you backed the game at a certain level you can\u2019t be demoted from that level. For example, if you back the game at \u2018Wizard King\u2019 level you will always be at least a Wizard King - you can\u2019t be demoted to Wizard Lord, but you could become a Demigod or God. Also, the special wizard auras are unique to backers - other players don\u2019t get them, even if they ascend the ranks through game play.\nT-Shirts\nThe design features a black T-shirt with the Chaos Reborn logo on the front and a special message on the left sleeve reading '30 YEARS OF CHAOS 1985-2015' and the gooey-blob sprite from the original Chaos, which is my personal avatar. It is an Anvil Jersey T-shirt made from pre-shrunk combed ringspun cotton (meaning it's very soft and comfortable). Shipping is included for US residents. Please add $5 shipping for delivery outside the US.\nNOTE: If you have backed at $250 or higher, you will automatically get a T-shirt included in your reward at no extra cost!\nAt the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will be sent a survey for you to provide information for your mailing address and T-shirt sizes. T-shirts will be delivered to backers before the end of May 2014. However, we will endeavour to be as quick as possible with this delivery, so I hope you will get them sooner.\nAdditional T-Shirts\nIf you want additional T-shirts, please add $30 for each additional T-shirt you want to your existing pledge level. Shipping in the US is included in the price. For delivery outside the US, please add $5 per T-shirt.\nI have been working on Chaos Reborn for over a year, refining the game design, creating a playable prototype and building my team. With your help I will use the Kickstarter funds to put my small but talented team to work full time on Chaos Reborn with the objective of completing the game by May 2015. I have set up a new development company called Snapshot Games Inc., and the development studio will be established here in Sofia, Bulgaria, where I have been living for the last eight years. I will use my extensive experience as a designer and producer build a highly effective and creative development studio. Snapshot Games will be solely dedicated to working on Chaos Reborn until completion.\nThe Team\nApart from myself I have a core team of five experienced developers, each with 7-10 years experience in game development. I also have input from expert freelancers, who have already contributed to concepts, animation and modelling. I intend to keep my core team small and focussed, based primarily on talent and expertise. My personal experience both as a designer and game producer will help keep the project on track for delivery.\nIconic and distinctive creature design is one of our main objectives. The colour schemes reflect alignment - cool colours for Law, hot colours for Chaos and earthy colours for neutral.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChaos Reborn has a lot of online and co-op features which means that we need very robust server-side code and infrastructure. I will devote a lot of attention to this during development. We have teamed up with a local middleware developer, Game Cloud Continental, to provide the bulk of our game server systems, and we will work closely with them to develop any specific, proprietary features we need.\n\nOn the game design side we will be relying a lot on procedurally generated content. The algorithms for creating arenas, realms, NPCs and equipment need to be very good in order to provide players with a rich and diverse experience.

Heroes are pitted against the evil Dark Consul in a fast-paced dungeon battle game. Gather powerful loot, customize your Heroes, and defeat the dungeon's boss in fully cooperative Arcade Mode.

The Heroes must journey through the dungeon and destroy all of the spawning points in order to summon and defeat the dreaded dungeon boss. The Consul must destroy all of the Heroes before they succeed.\nOver the course of a game the Heroes and Consul take turns activating models. As monsters are destroyed the Consul will spawn reinforcements from spawning points. This power is not to be used lightly. Each spawning point has a finite amount of power and every spawn will drain its energy, and the Heroes will attempt to hasten their destruction with all their skill and strength.\nWith each spawning point\u2019s destruction a powerful mini-boss will spawn. One by one the Heroes will seek to defeat them earning loot, treasure, and valuable princess coins. Once the last spawning point is destroyed the dungeon boss will spawn and an epic battle for the fate of Crystalia will commence!\nPlay how you want!\nForgotten King features two game modes: Classic and Arcade.\nIn Classic Mode, one player assumes the role of the Dark Consul and opposes the other players.

Under the curse of the vampire lord, Von Drakk it is a deadly one. The land has grown sick. The once healthy moors and wetlands have become disease infested, their ancient burial grounds disturbed by grave robbers, witches, and dark creatures. The miserable inhabitants lead miserable lives, knowing that even death will not release them from their service.\nLong ago the inhabitants of the Glauerdoom used pumpkins to carve jack-o-lanterns to trick the restless spirits of the moor to pass by their homes at night. In time the spirits grew wise to this deception and decided to play a trick of their own. Now pumpkin patches are grim, haunted, places where the creatures that go bump in the night lurk, waiting for their prey.\nThe Mistmourn Coast is a dangerous place even for the natural inhabitants of the Fae Woods. Outsiders fear the troll tribes of the Mistmourn, but those familiar with this perpetually shrouded wood know that the fae creatures are the true danger. Primal and unearthly, what motivates these creatures is unknown. Shamans bind them to pillars of salt to stay their wrath or do their bidding. Yet these magics have a dark consequence. When the spells of binding are broken the magics of the formerly bound fae are trapped with the shattered salt pillar. Their essence infuses new life within the Salt and they are reborn as elemental golems. Driven only by blind instinct these Salt golems lash out at any who are near.\nThe Claws of the Wyrm enforce the Dragon Priests' will among the unruly Kobolds and bring death to their enemies. The Dragon Blades are sworn foes to all draconic creatures. They are ruthless foes and particularly skilled when facing their most hated foe\u2014dragons. \nWhat happens when a good soda goes bad? Tricked into imbibing a cursed Shadow Soda the Dark Consul has captured a shard of Candy's essence and spun it into living shadow. Now this dark Nether Shadow terrorizes Crystalia, sowing discord and confusion wherever she goes.\nDungeon Tiles! Add even more variety to your games of Super Dungeon Explore with this pack of six, all new, double-sided dungeon tiles! Featuring stunning art and 12 unique layouts, the Dungeons of Crystalia tile set is designed to look fabulous no matter which monsters lurk within its depths!\nThis is another much requested item\u2014unique treasure and loot art! Once we reach $475k all treasure and loot cards will feature unique art representing the card's equipment. We mean all of it, including the treasure cards from previous expansions and mini-bosses that will be included in the upgrade decks. You'll be swimming in new treasure art just like a certain wealthy duck through treasure!\nNever underestimate an angry creep swinging an onion! Wherever Goro is there is sure to be a pack of Giri. Like their capricious master, Giri are at times both blessing and boon. It is said that a crop blessed by Giri is sure to be plentiful as long as their bellies are full. Unfortunately, like most creeps, Giri tend to come in packs and it is not uncommon for their feeding to devour the entire crop no matter how plentiful it was. Many farmers choose to not invoke these spirits at all, and place shrines and offerings to Goro and Giri on the edge of the Fae Wood, hoping to keep the spirits within its borders.\nThe Emerald Valley is a difficult place to find even among the inhabitants of the Fae Wood. It is home of the dragon, Glimmerwing and she protects her realm with powerful glamors and fae magic that conceal it from the rest of the Crystalia. Glimmerwing rarely leaves her secluded vale preferring to spend her time among the Kodama and Kinoko that flourish there. Her reclusive nature should not be mistaken for a desire to live peacefully. Indeed, she guards her domain and its borders ruthlessly. She is often known to leave the Emerald Valley to strike out against any who journey too near, even if the travelers do so unknowingly.  \nThe Silver Chevaliers have long sought glorious causes across Crystalia. Finding and destroying Glimmerwing proves to be just such a cause. After all, what gallant knight could resist the lure of traveling deep into an enchanted forest to slay a dragon?\nYou've all asked for it, so now it's time for some Dark Heroes to join the cause of Crystalia! No one truly knows what motivates these desperate individuals. In truth, it matters little so long as they remain loyal to the party for the adventure at hand.\nWith a new Dungeon Boss on the loose, Heroes are sure to need lots of wound counters!\nThe forest spirit Goro has always been a mercurial and fickle creature. Even in times of peace Goro has relished challenging mortals with puzzles, tricks, and cunning traps. That these tests and pranks occasionally turn deadly is of no concern to Goro. Whispered to be as old as the Deeproot Tree itself, it is likely that Goro does not even truly comprehend mortality.\nKeep track of your potions in style! \nThe Lunar Elves were driven from their ancestral home in the Dragonback Peaks by the dragon Starfire. Now, scattered across Crystalia they earn their living as best they can as sell-swords and entertainers. \nSlime Time! Creeps are an ever present threat in a dungeon. Based on the Explore Card you draw when entering a tile you may encounter one or two creeps or an entire Creep Factory! Slimes like to get close and personal, oozing onto their favorite colored equipment and preventing its use.  \nThe Royal Wardens are charged with maintain the King's peace, as well as executing his warrants, and collecting outstanding taxes. His powerful crossbow combined with his ability to hold felons immobile and pull them to him, ensures none can escape the King's justice.\nKingdom Death's, Twilight Knight Pinup, comes to Crystalia! No stranger to battling evil the Twilight Knight has joined the brave defenders of Crystalia to banish the Dark Consul once and for all.\nThe fickle nature of the fae creatures of the Mistmourn Coast makes them difficult to control and it requires powerful spells cast upon crystals of salt, which are naturally anathema to all fae, to bind them to the Consul's will.\nThe Deeproot Wolf Riders patrol the dangerous borders of the Fae Wood. Their spirit wolves are renowned predators of the Mistmourn Coast. Only the bravest and most skilled Deeproot Elves can hope to befriend one to carry it into battle.\nA dungeon can be a dark and scary place, and that's why even Brave-Mode Candy never travels without her intrepid sidekick Never-Lost Cola. His magical compass allows the adventuring party to redraw their Explore Card when entering a new tile\u2014Super! \nTabbybrook Mages are powerful water mages. Their ability to manipulate this vital element is unparalleled, able to use it to heal their allies, push back opponents or even unleash it in deadly lances of scalding heat or numbing cold.\nPets are an all new unit type. At the beginning of the game the adventuring party can add six pet cards to the treasure deck. If a pet card is drawn, you've rescued the pet! A Hero can then become the pet's master, gaining the pet's help through the rest of the adventure.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSoda Pop Miniatures has been involved in a number of successful Kickstarters, from which we have learned a great deal about managing the scope of large projects.

No assembly required, all miniatures come pre-assembled!\nHere's everything in the Guildmaster pledge for $100!\nIn Arcadia Quest, players lead guilds of intrepid heroes on an epic campaign to dethrone the vampire lord and reclaim the mighty Arcadia for their own. But only one guild may lead in the end, so players must battle against each other as well as against the monstrous occupying forces. Through the branching scenarios of the campaign, the heroes gain awesome new weapons and abilities, and the game remembers the heroic deeds of players from one session to the next, unlocking exciting new possibilities in future scenarios!.\nArcadia Quest is a miniatures boardgame for 2-4 players.  Each player controls a Guild of 3 Heroes, competing to be the liberators of the city of Arcadia and, more importantly, becoming the richest Guild in the land!\nArcadia Quest is a lot like a World of Warcraft raid on a hapless NPC city, with Heroes working as a team, except that you're not the only Guild after the loot!\nGameplay Features  \n2-4 players\nEach scenario plays between 45 to 60 min\nNo Game Master, everyone gets to play the Heroes!\nPlay with 3 Heroes as they fill their boots with monster Gold!\nModular campaign system - Multiple linked scenarios will eventually see the Guilds reclaiming the city of Arcadia. \nLevel Up and customize your Guild between scenarios with Loot and Equipment! \nPlayers are able to choose the path their campaign takes, navigating through six out of eleven available scenarios, so each time the campaign is played it can have a different configuration of scenarios. As the campaign progresses, the heroes are able to acquire new weapons, equipment and abilities that give them powerful options to tackle the obstacles ahead. Furthermore, by fulfilling specific quests in a scenario, players unlock exclusive features in subsequent scenarios.\nScenario objectives. Go Pandas Go!\nThe rules in Arcadia Quest are fast and furious, and every player can focus on using their heroes\u2019 abilities and equipment to achieve their goals, without the need for anybody to get stuck with the role of solely controlling the monsters.\nMonsters are \"aggroed\" when Heroes attack them or come too close to the areas they are guarding. Once activated, monsters then follow simple rules and are controlled by the player on the right.  This gives the perfect balance between an automated environment with a little intelligence, without bogging down the rules with complicated \"if-then\" game logic, or requiring a Game Master.\nA Guild of Heroes (?)\nJogando Offline's Arcadia Quest Gameplay Video:\nInformative Gameplay Updates:\n1.

Ignore the sword. Watch the girl.\u201d CHOP! WHACK! HACK!\nAs a young Guildswoman, Sonja heard about the renowned Armor of Invulnerable Offense. It was said to convey superior protection to its wearers, and had helped more than one warrior woman to achieve fame and glory. Sonja relentlessly sought this legendary suit of armor, and eventually tracked it to a dungeon not far from Arcadia. But, when she found it, she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes! It was little more than a golden chainmail bikini! \nIncensed and annoyed, she figured she might as well try it on. Alas, the Armor of Invulnerable Offense proved all too true to its name. The cursed armor could not be removed! Thus, Sonja discovered the true secret: The worst defense requires the perfect offense. Many years later, she has proven the truth of these words. \u2026 Though she\u2019d still really like to get rid of that armor.\nThe Nameless Campaign\nLord Fang fled and the victorious Guild threw their Heroes a party (and let the losers attend to drown their sorrows). The party went long. Perhaps, a bit too long. For, when they all awoke after a drink or ten, they\u2019d been banished! The sun was gone once more! And monsters stood on the walls and jeered.\nThe Nameless' plan was simple: drug the enemy with strong spirits and bedazzle them with festive party favors. The Nameless\u2019s mighty horde descended from the mountains and piled the snoozing heroes beyond the gates. Eternal Night fell once again!\nNow, in this darker time within the darkest time, the heroes must face this despicable Nameless Threat in yet another Arcadia Quest!\nMore monsters! More loot! More glory! (And, perhaps just a nice dinner party afterwards this time, hmm?)\n6 exclusive figures and rules - an alternate boss and minions for your Arcadia Quest campaign!\nThat's a sexy wand you have there fella...\nShipping information - Please take note\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship.  We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign concludes.\nThis is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.  \nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world).  As a rough estimate, the game will cost about $11 to ship in the USA, about $20-$25 in the EU (due to VAT), and $11 to Hong Kong all the way up to $40 for Australia, but this may increase or decrease based on the quantity of stretch goals we might unlock and your carrier choices.\nOptional Buys\nIf you'd like The Beyond the Grave Campaign, just add $48 to your pledge by clicking Manage Pledge from the Arcadia Quest Kickstarter page and we'll sort it out after the Kickstarter ends with our pledge manager.\nBeyond the Grave is an expansion to Arcadia Quest that takes place after the overthrow of Lord Fang.

While our current product line has slowly grown to include more than 30 Character Meeples, we have received tons of requests for more!  Rather than releasing only a few of the ideas at a time, slowly over the course of the next few years, we want to work together with you, our backers, to make far more characters available right away!\nWith your help, we can make all of this meeply awesomeness happen! We started this project with an amazing 50 characters, but the potential was there to unlock even more choices via our stretch goals, which is exactly what we did! As a backer, you've had a say in what some of those extra characters would be!\nWith rewards from simply one set of your absolute favorite character, all the way to levels that include a complete 8-piece set of EVERY character released in this Kickstarter project, we have something for everyone!\nDown below are the Character Meeples that you can currently choose from, when filling out the backer survey at the end of the funded project. Any unlocked characters from the many stretch goals will give you even more to choose from. Or don\u2019t choose. Just get \u2018em all! :-)\nThis number DOES include the \"Character Germs\", but not the TEK tower token, as it is not part of the pledge level choices. Nor does it include meeples from our existing inventory, as they were released long before this Kickstarter.  Backers at the 1-of-each and 8-of-each pledge levels have seen their reward value go up with each unlocked stretch goal! :-D\n\nWhat about the characters that already exist?\nCheck out Update #17 to see which Character Meeples from our existing stock can be chosen as your reward for this Kickstarter project.  There is also a list of which ones are not available in this way, due to limited stock.\nPLEASE NOTE: As these Character Meeples were not released in this Kickstarter, they are not included in the \"1-of-each\" or \"8-of-each\" pledge levels.  If you want these as well, you can do an add-on based on which ones / how many you want. Thanks!\nCan I add-on 1-of-each of these 25 Character Meeples from existing inventory?\nDefinitely! It is actually convenient to do so, as there are 25 of them, and we already offer an add-on for any 25 individual meeples. You will have an option in the backer survey to simply state \"all 25 from MeepleSource.com\", instead of having to name each one separately.\nWhat are Character Meeples used for?\nAnything you want! Our 8-piece sets are the most popular size because that is how many meeples each player needs for a standard game of Carcassonne. Our Character Meeples are used to upgrade pawns in countless other games, representing workers, warriors, and more! How many games do you have that have some kind of marker for each player?\nDon\u2019t be \u201cgreen discs\u201d, \u201cyellow cylinders\u201d, or \u201cred tetrahedrons\u201d. Be pirates and princesses! Be zombies or werewolves! Be anything you want. Also, I know that many of you already have Character Meeples lined up on your desk at work. Because you can.\nHow big are Character Meeples?\nSimilar in size to our \"Mega Meeples\", they are approximately 19mm tall. Characters do vary some, particularly those with hats, wings, etc. As we have stated on our website since the inception of the Character Meeples, we have no intention of offering these characters in the smaller, \"standard size\" (16mm) meeples. The level of detail that we are able to achieve on 19mm meeples is very difficult, but impossible at a 16mm size. Thanks for understanding!\nRisk-Free Guarantee! \nIf for any reason you would like to return your Character Meeples, you\u2019ll have 30 days after receiving them to do so and get a full refund. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nYou Can Influence Characters That Are Still Undecided/Locked!\nAlthough we could have selected every character ourselves, we didn\u2019t, because we know how much you love to get involved in the process! As a backer you can vote on characters that are not yet determined, and be involved in other choices along the way.\nMore Pledges Help Everyone Unlock Even More Characters! Even after the project is funded, continued support will unlock more and more stretch goals, which will give all backers more Character Meeples to choose from. We will continue to add stretch goals as long as you continue to support us by pledging, spreading the word about this project, and participating by voting for our backer-chosen characters. We can\u2019t thank you enough!\nWe Need You! We have worked very hard to get this far, and we couldn\u2019t be more proud of our finished art.

We regularly collaborate with our loyal customers, bringing to market their own ideas as well as our own. We want to take great games and upgrade the boring bits to impressive ones, enhancing the player experience.\n If you are not already familiar with our existing line of Character Meeples, you may be wondering how close to the original art (pictured above) will the actual wooden bits be? We elaborate on this question in the FAQ down at the bottom, but here are a few recent comparisons from our existing product line that can demonstrate this.\nWe had the pleasure of meeting many of you at BGG.CON this past November, and despite already having over 30 different Character Meeples, we received many requests for more! Once we added your suggestions to the growing list of our own ideas, we realized that there were way too many great concepts for us to release in a single year. Heck, maybe not even over several years.\nThis is what led us to our first Kickstarter project.

The overseas factories that we have used in the past are now very familiar with these type of pieces, as we have over 30 Character Meeples in our existing product line.

We can't edit this page after the campaign closes, so here's a link to the Pairs page at cheapass.com.\nIf you're new to the project, please check out the FAQ at the bottom of this page. Thanks everyone, for your support on Pairs!\nUnderstanding the Rewards: \nThis campaign is very simple. There will be no add-ons and no post-campaign shopping cart, just the pledge levels listed on the right. Aside from the various freebies, every level gives you a certain number of decks. You can adjust your pledge as long as the campaign is active, but not after.\nYou can choose any unlocked deck for each deck in your reward. You'll make your selections after the campaign is over.\nIn early April, we will send you a backer survey that asks for your mailing address, and which decks you want. There are eleven versions of Pairs, as well as one completely different game, FALLING.\nIf you don't get them here, you might not be able to find these decks anywhere else. You will certainly be able to buy Pairs decks of some kind in the Fall, but some of the decks from this campaign will be made in limited quantity. Here's a small preview of each one:\nThe core deck is the Name of the Wind deck, by Shane Tyree, followed by the Fruit deck, by James Ernest. Next are the Pirate deck by Brett Bean, and FALLING by Val Mayerik. After that, we have the Modegan deck by Shane Tyree, the Barmaids deck by Echo Chernik. and the Goblin deck by Pete Venters. \nThe next decks are two by Nate Taylor: The Princess and Mr. Whiffle (it looks like a kid's book, but it's a bit grisly), and the Faen deck from The Name of the Wind (which is slightly NSFW). You can read more about the content in the Faen deck on Pat's blog.\nNext, we have the Professor Elemental deck by Cheyenne Wright, and an adorable Baby Cthulhu deck by John Kovalic.Our top deck, unlocked at $200k, is a deck of Muses (from the Girl Genius universe) by Phil & Kaja Foglio. Please look below for details and preview links. Or check out the Pairs page at cheapass.com.\nPairs is a new pub game by James Ernest and Paul Peterson. It's a card game for 2 to 8 players, and it plays in about 5 minutes. \nThe deck is very simple: Just the numbers 1 through 10, with each card appearing in proportion to its rank. That means there is 1 x 1, 2 x 2, 3 x 3, and so on, up to 10 x 10. That's 55 cards, packaged in a compact card box, and it's everything you need to play. For complete rules (the free beta version) click here.\nThe artwork for the core Pairs deck will be drawn by Shane Tyree, and based on The Name of the Wind, by Patrick Rothfuss. That's the first book in his best-selling \"Kingkiller Chronicle,\" a high-fantasy series that also includes The Wise Man's Fear.\nRothfuss is a gamer, and his respect for gaming shows in the way that games like Pairs are integrated into his world. Turns out, he's also a fan of Cheapass Games! So he was happy to lend us his world for our game.\nPairs doesn't appear in those books, because we just invented it! But we decided to create a deck of cards that could easily belong in that world. And who knows, Pairs just might show up in future stories.\nWhat's in the deck? The Name of the Wind deck is not finalized, but we think it will contain: (1) Tinker; (2) Amyr; (3) Royalty (based on Pat & Sarah); (4) Courtesan; (5) Moneylender; (6) Farmer; (7) Seven Calamities; (8) Bandit; (9) Beggar; (10) Ruh. [Sample Art] [More Sample Art]\nPlaying Pairs is easy. The most important rule is that points are bad. Also, there is no winner, just one loser. For example, In a 4-player game, the loser is the first player to score 16 points. The complete rules are at cheapass.com. Or, you can watch our How to Play video, right here.\nThe reward levels for this campaign are pretty simple: How many decks do you want? We have 12 different decks all together, including one completely different game (FALLING). After the campaign is over, you'll receive a survey asking you to choose one deck for each slot, and there are no restrictions on which decks you can get. \nDecks: Each Pairs game will contain 55 bridge-sized cards and a small rule book, in a compact tuck box (just like a normal deck of cards). The cards will be printed on high-quality playing card stock, by Carta Mundi USA. We are very particular about playing cards, and we will make these cards extremely nice!\nAfter this campaign is over, Pairs will go into retail stores, but some decks maybe very hard to find. We will decide which decks will be printed in large numbers, and which won't, after the survey results come in.\nCoins: Campaign Coins made a handsome 39mm metal coin for our Get Lucky campaign, and it's been so popular that we decided to make another one for Pairs. Our preliminary design is shown below, along with a photo of the Get Lucky finished coins, to show what the finish will look like. The Pairs coin is included in the backer rewards at the $40 level and above.\nCut Cards: We will include one sturdy white plastic cut card with each deck. This is similar to the cut card in the How to Play video, except that it's thicker and white. It's a handy tool for covering the bottom of the deck, which is important in Pairs since you often deal all the way down to that card. This cut card will not be part of the retail product, so it's a nice backers-only perk.\nStickers: Our original plan was to include one small round Pairs logo sticker for every backer, but we've grown this to a 2 x 3.25 sticker, perfect for decorating the cut card, and we will include one sticker with every deck. The upgraded sticker will be a Kickstarter exclusive, featuring two exclusive designs: one version for the Pat Rothfuss decks, another for everything else. [No Sample Art Yet]\nCompanion Booklet: Every deck comes with a small rule book. The companion booklet is larger, and it will be a collection of all the Pairs variants from this set, like Calamities and Pieces of Eight, and alternate games, like Blackstone and Hawthorn. It will also contain some Pairs history (both real and fictional) and artwork from the game. One copy of the booklet will be included at 5 decks or higher.\nPAX Pairs Party: Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) is a huge gaming convention held every year on Labor Day weekend in Seattle. This year\u2019s dates are August 28-31. One evening during PAX, we will find a venue in Seattle (perhaps even a pub) and throw a party to celebrate the release of Pairs. (You do not need a PAX badge to come to this party.) We\u2019ll have Patrick Rothfuss, Shane Tyree, James Ernest, Paul Peterson, and other special guests TBD. Backers at the $1200 level will receive 2 tickets to the PAX Prime Pairs Pub Party (that\u2019s P5 for short), as well as everything from the $120 level. More details will follow after the campaign, once we know how many guests we have.\nCheapass Games is a tiny game company in Seattle, run by designer James Ernest. We specialize in low-cost games that are funny and fast. Many of our games, including Pairs, are available in free print-and-play versions at cheapass.com.\nSo far, we've had three successful projects on Kickstarter: Unexploded Cow, Deadwood Studios USA, and Get Lucky. We're learning a little more with each one, and we can't wait to bring you another one as soon as Pairs is off to press!\n$20k Unlocked! Shane Tyree will do some extra art for the Name of the Wind deck, putting seven different pictures on the 7's. These pictures are various \"Calamities\" like floods, fires, plagues, and so on, exact list TBD. And, we'll include a variant rule in the deck, that makes the 7's behave in an appropriately calamitous fashion.\n$25k: Fruit Deck. Our second deck is the Fruit Deck, which is the deck from the videos. This deck has yummy artwork of fruits and vegetables (Pears, Peaches, Cherries, Blueberries, Grapes, Pumpkins, Mushrooms, Lemons, Peppers, and Onions). [Sample Art]\n$30k: Cut Cards. Backers will receive one plain white plastic cut card with each deck. These cards are simply for covering the bottom of the deck, as illustrated in the How to Play video. We will not include this card in the retail version, so it's a nice backers-only freebie.\n$35k: Starbase Jeff. Once this campaign is over and the smoke has cleared, we'll add a full-color version of Starbase Jeff as a print-and-play game at cheapass.com. Starbase Jeff is a gambling / puzzle game about building a space station, designed by Jim Geldmacher. \n$40k: Pirates. Avast! Brett Bean's magnificent Pirate deck has now been added to our collection. This is a third complete Pairs deck, containing a special variant rule: \"Pieces of Eight.\" [Sample Art] [More Sample Art]\n$50k Juggling Video: The Edema Ruh card in the core deck features a portrait of James Ernest in his renfair garb. This image is based on a video of James juggling at the Washington Midsummer Renaissance Faire. Now that we've passed the $50k level, we've posted the video of this unmemorable performance for your mocking pleasure.\n$55k FALLING: This is not a Pairs deck; it's another entire game, with exactly the same size deck. FALLING is a real-time card game, a frenzied 90-second game about falling and fighting, where the object is to hit the ground last. We will print a new edition of this game, with all-new art by Val Mayerik. [Sample Art] [More Sample Art] [More about FALLING]. You can read more about FALLING in Update #11.\n$65k: Modegan Deck. This is the second Patrick Rothfuss / Shane Tyree Pairs deck. The Modegans are a distant and isolated culture, and their Pairs deck will look quite different from the first. In addition, the Modegan deck will contain the rules for an entirely different game, called Blackstone. (Rules in Update 6.) [Sample Art]\n$75k: Rules for Tak. Tak is an abstract strategy game featured prominently in The Wise Man\u2019s Fear. It has aspects of chess, go, and other traditional strategy games, but it\u2019s entirely new. James Ernest and Pat Rothfuss will take a crack at writing it, although we might or might not get it right. If we get somewhere, we will give you, our faithful Pairs backers, access to the closed beta test. Wahoo!\n$85k: Echo Chernik\u2019s Barmaids. Echo Chernik is one of the most talented illustrators working today, and she will draw a set of ten barmaids for this very special edition of Pairs. Each barmaid is carrying the appropriate number of drinks. (Note: These samples don't have numbers yet, but the final cards will) [Sample Art] [More Sample Art] \n$100k: Pete Venters' Goblins. We asked celebrated Magic artist and goblin specialist Pete Venters if he'd like to make a Goblin Pairs deck. Instead of just 10 fantasy goblins, he has decided to give us a \"Goblins Through the Ages\" theme, with everything from Cave Goblins to Goblins in Space. And now we've unlocked this deck too! [Sample Art] [More Sample Art]\n$105k: Bookplates. We will include one bookplate, autographed by Pat Rothfuss, for backers at the $80 level and above. This will be an archival quality, self-adhesive, cream colored 3\" x 4\" bookplate. It will have artwork by Shane Tyree, and will be signed by Patrick Rothfuss. [Sample Art]\n$110k: Rothfuss Laughing Ringtone. For all you Patrick Rothfuss fans, what is more charming than his self-deprecating laugh from 3:15 in the project video? We\u2019ll create two ringtones from this sound bite: one that\u2019s just the laugh, and the other with Pat muttering \u201cGod Damn\u201d at the end, which didn't make the final cut. Chose your favorite, or grab them both!\n$115k: Princess and Mr. Whiffle Deck. The Princess and Mr Whiffle is a very dark little story by Patrick Rothfuss, masquerading as a children\u2019s book, and the characters are perfect for a Pairs deck! If you\u2019re keeping track, this is the third of four Patrick Rothfuss-related decks. This deck will be lovingly illustrated by Nate Taylor. [Sample Art] [More Sample Art]\n$120k Rothfuss Outtake Video: If the ringtones aren't enough for you, check this out. We\u2019re going to cut together the highlights of Pat\u2019s raw Kickstarter video footage for your viewing pleasure. He took a few stabs at getting it right, and he\u2019s been gracious enough to let us show you all the ways he got it wrong.\n$125k: Stickers Upgrade. Originally, we offered a small round logo sticker as part of every reward level. Now, the sticker is growing to 2 x 3.25 rectangle, just the right size for the cut cards. Also, we\u2019re giving you a sticker with every deck. The sticker that comes with the Pat Rothfuss decks will feature Shane Tyree artwork from the Name of the Wind deck. All other decks (including FALLING) will come with a Cheapass Games / Pairs logo sticker. Both stickers will be Kickstarter-exclusive designs. Hooray for freebies!\n$130k: Faen Deck. This is another Patrick Rothfuss deck, the fourth in the set (and the third from the Name of the Wind series). The Faen deck will be illustrated by Nate Taylor, and contains images of ten Faerie characters, including Bast (sketch below). We\u2019ll release more sketches from this deck as we get them, including a very sexy Felurian (meaning PG-13). This deck will also have a great new gambling variant, Hawthorn, which is explained in Update #12. [Sample Art]\n$140k: Veronica Belmont Cameo. Veronica Belmont, host of Sword & Laser, has agreed to go cavorting with the Fae! We will include Veronica as one of the Mortal Guests in the Faen Deck. Will she be dancing, making music, or getting hit on by Bast? We're not entirely sure, but we know it will be glorious.\n$150k: Hank Green Cameo. Award-winning YouTuber and internet entrepreneur Hank Green wants to be seduced by Faerie women. At least, on a card. And he's fine with showing a little skin. In fact, he demands it. We're putting Hank on a card in the Faen Deck,  as a mortal guest at a Faerie revel. *sizzle*\n$155k: Professor Elemental Deck. Artist Cheyenne Wright will bring Professor Elemental and his many minions to life in this exquisite Pairs deck. Cheyenne has worked with Cheapass Games for many years, illustrating games like Unexploded Cow, Freeloader, and James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game. He is also the colorist for the Girl Genius web comic. Professor Elemental is a \"Steampunk flavoured mad Professor\" whose amazing work you can check out right here. [Sample Art]\n$170k: Baby Cthulhu Deck. John Kovalic is best known as the creator of the comic strip Dork Tower, but he's also done some work with Cheapass Games. This Pairs deck from John Kovalic is based on his favorite theme, tiny little baby Cthulhu monsters. We're calling it the \"Shallow Ones\" deck. [Sample Art]\n$200k: Foglio Muses Deck. Are you keeping count? This is number twelve. That's as many different decks as we can reasonably print, and we've saved the best for last. Phil and Kaja Foglio are frequent collaborators with Cheapass Games, but they are best known as the creators of the Girl Genius web comic. For the Pairs deck, Phil and Kaja will draw a set of ten Muses, who are ancient and powerful clanks (sort of like robots) from the world of Girl Genius. [Sample Art]\n$250k: Companion Book. Each Pairs deck already comes with the basic rules, and many of them will contain a unique variant as well. Now we can also produce a separate, pocket-sized collection of all the rules and variants, as well as some artwork and information about the history of Pairs (both real and fictional). We will include one copy of this companion booklet for backers at the 5 deck level and above. It will also be available in the Fall (price TBD), and the contents will be free online.\n$300k: Laughing Video. Can we make it this time? This was a popular stretch goal from our last campaign, though we didn't quite make it that time. If we reach $300k, James Ernest will post a video of himself laughing all the way to the bank.\nWhat's Next?\nIf you want to be a part of the final hours of this campaign, James Ernest (@cheapassjames) will be tweeting from the end-party in Las Vegas. We have reservations for 7:30 Friday at an undisclosed steak house. If we reach $299k, James gets lobster.\nSometime in early April, we will send you a survey asking which decks you want, as well as your shipping address. We should be able to show you all the art, or at least a decent cross-section, and we'll know a little more about which special rules go into which decks. Your choices will help us decide how many of each deck to print. So please answer your survey promptly!\nThanks again for your overwhelming support, and special thanks to all the artists and contributors who helped make Pairs happen! This game seems poised to be a phenomenon: not just a successful Kickstarter project, but a popular evergreen game. Thanks to everyone for an amazing campaign!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPairs is actually our easiest project to date, but it has the potential to grow very large, with the addition of many different artists and deck designs.

I became very aware that my clients did not have time, with their demanding work schedules, to learn about the life altering effects of organic superfoods and plant based items. In fact, it isn't easy to research what exactly a superfood is and how to incorporate them easily into each meal. Many of us get stuck eating and drinking the same foods out of habit with no variety and severe lack of nutritional content. Even our workouts become boring with stagnant exercise routines.\nDiet Dice\nI've developed Diet Dice to make organic superfoods, plant based items and workouts fun and easy with an abundance of smoothies, juices, salads, wraps, sandwiches and exercise combinations and measurements. The key is adding variety to your nutrition plan and workout regimen. One test tube of ten Diet Dice gives you over 190,000 combinations with over one million combinations for all five Diet Dice test tubes.\nGo ahead people ...

I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE ALREADY ADDED THIS AMOUNT THANK YOU AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN COMPLETING THE SET YOU CAN NOW JUST IN CASE WE DON'T MEET OUR FINAL STRETCH GOAL***\nThere are a lot of dice out there but most of them are really boring. We have created a line of dice that are both beautiful and fun to use. You can see what we are trying to do in the pictures and video but please keep in mind these are mould-metal prototypes. The finished products will be in a different types of metal and finishes and look 100% better than the prototypes you see here.\nRhythm Metal Dice Collection\nRhythm is a new line of metal dice products from Darkness Sequel. We are working on a bigger project which we are planning to bring to Kickstarter soon but while we are working on that we also wanted to launch a line of amazing dice and unique bags and cups to use with them. These dice are sturdy enough for everyday gaming and attractive enough to collect.\nRhythm Metal Dice, Bags and Cups Collection\n Our plan is to sell them at a reasonable price through gaming stores. In order to do that we need to mass produce them -- allowing high quality at a lower price than if we made them a few at a time. The finished product will be solid metal, matte antiqued with corrosion effects. We chose to go with metal casting for our designs because casting allows us to add details and textures which you can't get through either 3-D printing or precision machining. As a result our dice have a character and elegance you can't find anywhere else.\nThe Dice Line Up\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n SOLID METAL POLYHEDRAL DICE ADD-ON\nSolid Metal Polyhedral Dice Steel\nAdd $8 to any pledge to get a Metals 20-Sided Die in Steel\nAdd $26 to any pledge to get Metals 7-Die Set (D4, D6, D8, D10, D1%, D12 and D20)\nYou can add-on color from the second color list (copper, gold, nickel and bronze)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRhythm metal dice are custom designed dice made with bronze/brass material. They will eventually come in multiple colors, but we have decided to start with popular colors that aren't often seen in metal dice like- antique gold, antique pewter, antique bronze, antique copper, antique gold, black nickel and silver corrosion . We are also investigating the feasibility of offering a variety of other simple colors -- gold, copper, bronze, silver and other colored dice as options.\nNote: Even though we will be making the dice smaller if we reach our stretch goals you will still have the option to chose the 25mm size as well.\nStretch Goal Dice Add-On\n$10,000 - UNLOCKED If we reach this goal all the backers that pledge $17 or more and above we will give you one d4 polyhedral dice in zinc alloy in copper color or you can pick the color of your choice.\n$11,500 - UNLOCKED If we reach this goal we will be able to make the d6 dice smaller than the 25mm prototype and make it available in 22mm\n$13,000 - UNLOCKED If we reach this goal all the backers that pledge $17 or more and above we will give you one d6 polyhedral dice in zinc alloy in gold color or you can pick the color of your choice.\n$14,500 - UNLOCKED If we reach this goal we will be able to make the d6 dice smaller than 22mm and make it available in 18mm.\n$18,000 - UNLOCKED If we reach this goal all the backers that pledge $17 or more and above we will give you one d8 polyhedral dice in zinc alloy in green color or you can pick the color of your choice.\n$22,500 - UNLOCKED If we reach this goal all the backers that pledge $17 or more and above we will give you one d10 polyhedral dice in zinc alloy in red color or you can pick the color of your choice.\n$25,000 - UNLOCKED If we reach this goal all the backers that pledge $17 or more and above we will give you one d10 decader polyhedral dice in zinc alloy or you can pick the color of your choice.\n$29,500 - UNLOCKED If we reach this goal all the backers that pledge $17 or more and above we will give you one d12 polyhedral dice in zinc alloy in blue color or you can pick the color of your choice.\n$35,000 - LOCKED  If we reach this goal all the backers that pledge $17 or more and above we will give you one d20 polyhedral dice in zinc alloy in red color or you can pick the color of your choice to finish off the set of 7 dice.\nIn order to produce metal dice, we need all of your help here on Kickstarter.

Molten material can flow into very small sections so that intricate shapes can be made by this process. As a result, many other operations, such as machining, forging, and welding, can be minimized or eliminated.\n2. It is possible to cast practically any material that is ferrous or non-ferrous.\n3. As the metal can be placed exactly where it is required, large saving in weight can be achieved.\n4. The necessary tools required for casting molds are very complex and expensive.\n5. There are certain parts made from metals and alloys that can only be processed this way.\n6. Size and weight of the product is not a limitation for the casting process.\nStorey Dice\nNote:This beautifully crafted Storey Dice as you can see it has a pearl colored loose ball inside to make the dice roll faster which will be a red ball in final production.\nLimitations\n1. Dimensional accuracy and surface finish of the castings made by sand casting processes are a limitation to this technique. Many new casting processes have been developed which can take into consideration the aspects of dimensional accuracy and surface finish. Some of these processes are die casting process, investment casting process, vacuum-sealed molding process, and shell molding process.\n2. The metal casting process is a labor intensive process\nDragondie in Progress\nDragondie in Progress\nNote: As you can see the numbers on the Dragondie Dice prototype are a little bit hard to see so in mass production they will be on top of the dragon and larger so it's easier to read.\nThere are plenty of custom dice out there. Dice also are simply just fun little tactile toys. Metal dice are somewhat less common as well, and these designs just seem to really work well in metal. I believe these designs to be unique and appealing, fitting with games that have a mechanical theme. I'd love to have some of these dice in my collection, and I'd love to get them to other people who might be interested as well. So, I'm bringing these designs to Kickstarter to see if we can put together a sufficiently sized order to make these Rhythm Metal Dice happen at a good price point.\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019m very confident and dedicated to this project we have tested and re-tested all of the products and determined most of the problems are overcome.

They're free agent athletes (some call them mercenaries) who play for the highest bidder in the slaughterdomes across the world. Mavericks frequently break game rules just by entering the pit, and so they get special licenses from the Global Slaughterball League (GSL). For example, GSL rules specifically disallow any team from having a psyker on their official roster. However, the GSL has granted maverick licenses to Toccata and Fugue. Hypocrisy? You betcha! But the fans love it when Fugue mentally dominates or Toccata magnetically intercepts. And if the fans love it, you can bet your best neopet that the GSL will let the fans have it.\nJust like with the teams, stretch goals will unlock even more mavericks.\nThe 700mm x 700mm (about 27\") double-sided Slaughterball game board is made of 157gsm art paper on 2.5mm greyboard. Yes, I said DOUBLE-SIDED. One side is the Octagon, for 2- or 4-team games. The other side is the Hexagon, for 3-team games. How many games come with double-sided boards giving you two different arenas to play in for 2, 3, or 4 teams? This high-quality board is comparable to the board in Merchants and Marauders.

Click here!\nGame rule overview video.\nYour turn\nAs a coach, you control six athletes. On your turn, you get three onslaught tokens to assign to three of your athletes, each of whom can take two consecutive actions.\nThere are six actions to choose from:\nMove\nPass\nShoot\nChop (attack an opponent)\nSpike (throw the ball at opponents to knock them down)\nSpecial (special actions are many and varied, and come from skills, such as Help Up which lets you stand up an adjacent prone athlete)\nRolling the dice\nIf you like rolling dice, you'll love Slaughterball. The game comes with 20 custom six-sided dice, plus an eight-sided scatter die.\nThe six-sided dice have a variety of symbols on them. The number of knives you roll determines how successful the athlete was.\nFor example, to try to shoot a goal, roll the shooter's Accuracy dice. To get the ball into the goal, you must roll a number of knives equal to the number of spaces between the thrower and the goal. If you do, you score that many points.\nTo chop an opponent, it's an opposed Brawling test. Both attacker and defender roll Brawling dice. Whomever gets more knives knocks down the opponent. If you get more extra knives than the opponent's Toughness trait, the opponent is injured and sent to the Slaughter Box.\nThat's it. No dice conversions to memorize or confusing tables to consult. Just compare your knives to the opposing roll, or to the number of spaces you want to throw. Pretty simple.\nThe other dice symbols are used for skills. For example, if an athlete has the Star Thrower skill, he can count star symbols as knives when he throws the ball.\nSlaughterball comes with 20 engraved 16mm custom six-sided dice plus one 16mm standard scatter die. These are comparable to the dice in Euphoria. 16mm is the standard size of dice, like you use in Yahtzee or Monopoly. These are not the smaller dice you see in some other games. I wanted big dice in my game, because real gamers roll big dice!\nStrategy cards\nEach coach gets a hand of strategy cards. These range from simple dice bonuses, to penalties, to extra movement, to interrupts, and more. Synergies exist between various skills and cards, so don't throw away that Interrupt card if your razor has the Interrupting Throw skill! Various card combos also work well together, such as Repeat Strategy and Inspired Coaching, or Epic Fail and Lost Momentum. The specific cards in your hand can help you determine your game plan for your turn. If you hate your cards, you can refresh your hand at the start of your turn.\nWatch out for Penalties! If an athlete commits a foul, another coach can play a Penalty card and send them to the Penalty Box.\nThe 70 strategy cards in Slaughterball are high-quality, blackjack-sized (63mm x 88mm) playing cards using 300gsm casino cardstock. These are comparable to the cards in Mice and Mystics.\nEdge tokens\nIn exhibition and league games, the teams might not be balanced. To help weaker teams, an underdog bonus gives them Edge tokens. These provide benefits during the game, such as healing, extra cards, and rerolls.\nThe athletes\nSlaughterball athletes are genetically-engineered to exacting specifications and comply with all GSL regulations. They are designed to be larger, stronger, faster, and more athletic than humans. However, most teams don't spend much on personality and social aptitude, instead concentrating on aggression and brutality. For that reason, you won't see many slaughterballers wandering the streets of the metroplex.\n3d renders of some of the athletes\nThere are four athlete types, although each team has gengineered variations in appearance and aptitudes:\nRazor (round base): Four-armed stars of the team, razors are swift, accurate, and fragile. Keep them out of danger and let them shoot goals.\nCleaver (pentagon base): Masters of strategy, these guys aren't the fastest or strongest, but they can provide coaches with more options.\nSlasher (hexagon base): Pitiless machines of sporting carnage, slashers excel at hunting down and mangling opponents. Choosing the right skills can even make them a threat to a butcher.\nButcher (square base): Juggernauts in the pit. These guys are the biggest, hardest hitting, and toughest athletes in the game. They can't handle the ball very well, but for sheer brutal force they can't be beat.\nSkills\nIn exhibition and league games, the athletes enjoy the use of skills, such as Interrupting Chop, Fakeout, Immaculate Reception, Pit Strategy, Awesome Brute, Resilience, Savagery, and so on. There are 50 skills to choose from, providing a wide range of abilities like extra dice, movement, opponent manipulation, extra damage, less damage, extra cards, and more. In a league, you can spend your winnings between games to buy more skills for your athletes.\nScoring\nThere are three ways to score in Slaughterball:\nOpen the goals: The goals are shut tight at the start of the game. The first team to run the ball over the dangerous meat grinder scores 2 points and opens the goals. After that, any team can score in any goal.\nGoals: Throw the heavy steel ball into any goal and your team scores points equal to the distance between the shooter and the goal. That's right, risk-based scoring adds another layer of strategy to the game. Do you go for the easy 2-point shot, or try for a risky 5-pointer to take the lead?\nSlaughter: Fans love to watch the athletes inflict maximum carnage. To encourage that, teams score points for knocking down or injuring opponents. Of course, taking out a looming butcher scores the most points, but that's nearly impossible. Cleavers are the best victims, since they're worth 2 points and aren't that difficult to injure. You don't score any points for hurting a razor, because that's not very challenging, is it?\nThree ways to play\nScrimmage games: Your first couple of games should probably be scrimmage games, to get you up to speed on the basics. In these games, each coach uses the same scrimmage athlete reference sheet, so all the teams are identical. Also, no skills, edge tokens, or support staff are used.\nExhibition games: Choose a pro team and wreak major havoc! In exhibition games, you have more options and freedom, deciding where to start your athletes and choosing which Edge tokens (if any) you'll use. Athlete skills will help determine your strategy, but won't hinder you from surprising opponents with different ploys.\nLeague games: You choose a team and then select eight athletes (two sit out each game) to play in a series of 10 consecutive games. After each game, you can spend your winnings to hire support staff or improve your athletes with skills or trait increases. At the end of the season, the four best teams clash in the SlaughterBrawl! The winner is the season champion!\nSupport staff\nIn league games, you have the option to hire support staff, such as a physician, mascot, assistant coaches, and cheerleaders. Each provides you with a benefit that comes in handy during a game.\nI'm a big board game fan and I've always wanted to make my own. With Kickstarter, I have a chance to get enough funding to make it a reality. Without Kickstarter, I cannot afford the factory tooling and production costs. So, with your help, I can get Slaughterball produced and into your hands!\nI've said it before and I'll say it again. My artists are the best, and they've created art that really immerses you in the brutal, bloody, sexy world of Slaughterball. This stuff really evokes the futuristic glitz and savagery of the game. Blood and steel never looked so good!\nMIKE BOWDEN -- Concept and line artist (cover art, rulebook art, athletes, mascots, cheerleaders)\nMike's first interest in drawing started with a copy of How To Draw Comics The Marvel Way. After years of trying to break into the industry, he got his first break on DC Comics' World of Warcraft series, becoming a regular penciller. Since then, Mike has worked on Flash-Retroactive, Cartoon Network Action Pack for DC, Avengers Season One for Marvel, and Bubblegun for Aspen Comics. Mike was also lead storyboard artist on Sony's crossover fighting game: Playstation All Stars Battle Royale.\nALONSO ESPINOZA -- Colorist (cover art, rulebook art, athletes, mascots, cheerleaders)\nAlonso is a digital artist who dreams a lot and never practices enough... a particular living mixture of flesh, bones, rgb, pixels, brushes, layers, and lots of coffee. He actually works in comics, doing coloring, graphic design, and photo-illustration.\nTOM EDWARDS -- Graphic design (team logos, game components)\nTom is a professional concept artist and illustrator working in the games industry. He is devoted to his work and loves trying new styles, genres, and ways of working in an attempt to improve and gain more knowledge along the way. His favorite genres to paint are sci-fi and fantasy. He would love to create his own fantasy-themed graphic novel.\nANDREA TARABELLA -- 3D modeler\nProbably born with a pencil in hand in 1989, Andrea spent entire days drawing characters from his very first memories. At 18, he decided to move to the next level by bringing his characters from 2D to 3D working with Zbrush, which he considers to be a tool that is very close to traditional sculpture. Passionate about fantasy, role-playing, and video-games, one of his dreams is to be a tough, bearded dwarf that smashes his foes with a war hammer. Since he hasn't yet managed to achieve this dream, he continues working with concepting and sculpting.\nFRANCESCA MUSUMECI -- 3D modeler\nPassionate about art, design, music, cooking, gaming, and two-handed axes, Francesca graduated in graphic design, but ended up working as a 3D modeler for characters and props.\nWith the help of Zbrush, she sculpted her first miniatures for an indie board game. Now she specializes in creating dynamic poses for the models using many Zbrush features like Transpose Master.\nANDY MONKS -- 2D/3D modeler\nAndy grew up in various cities along the east coast of Australia and spent most of the time in the car drawing monsters and trying not to get motion sickness. He always had a desire to be an artist, even though most people told him he would need to get a \u2018real job\u2019.\nAfter college, Andy went on to become a 3D modelling and animation expert, leading him eventually to a senior role as part of the Academy Award-winning team of \u2018Happy Feet\u2019, working under director George Miller.\nFor the past 7 years, Andy has built a successful business as a freelance illustrator, modeler, and artist.\nAndy uses a variety of traditional and digital techniques in 2D and 3D. He has been exhibited around the world, has a sketchbook in the Brooklyn Art Library, worked on TV/film, computer and board games, publishing, mobile apps, and virtual worlds.\nI've been playing role-playing, board, card, console, and PC games for decades. I've written two sourcebooks for Dungeons and Dragons: Arsenal and Factory, contributed to Dungeon magazine and Deadlands Rascals, Varmints, and Critters.\nI've written three novels and several other books under the pen name Derek J. Canyon, including Dead Dwarves Don't Dance, which is set in the same universe as Slaughterball.\nI've designed several games, but just for personal use. Slaughterball is my first game that I'm taking to production (if we hit the pledge goal). If this is successful, I have about 9 more board games in my head waiting to escape.\nMy wife Shari graciously supports my board game geekhood, even to the extent of starting up Frog the What Games, committing thousands of dollars for seed money, helping with editing and business stuff, and much more. All in the hopes of getting a board game manufactured.\nShipping to the United States is free. For other countries, please add the following amounts to your pledge. These rates apply to the RAZOR and BUTCHER pledge levels (I\u2019m still waiting on DOUBLE BUTCHER shipping cost info).\nUnited States: Free\nCanada: $15\nMexico: $49\nAustralia, New Zealand: $56\nFor the following EU countries, rewards will be shipped from within the EU:\nUnited Kingdom: $20\nIreland: $23\nBelgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands: $22\nDenmark, France, Germany: $28\nItaly, Spain: $44\nCorsica, Greece, Portugal: $46\nAustria, Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland: $49\nRest of World: message for rates  \nI was lucky enough to find a great team of international artists to help with the look of Slaughterball. You can see their bios above. Below, you can see a lot of their art. I'll add more as we go along.\nThe athletes were lined by Mike Bowden and colored by Alonso Espinosa.\nGraphic design of the game components is by Tom Edwards.\n3d renders by Andrea Tarabella, Francesca Musumeci, and Andy Monks.\nSimba Khan render by Andrea Tarabella and Francesca Musumeci\nCarnage butcher render by Andy Monks\nCheerleaders will be made available as add-ons if we achieve stretch goals\nStretch goal team: Gruesomes slasher", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMasters and digital files for all of the following base game components are ready to begin production: 2D artwork, dice, tokens, plastics, cards, and reference cards. The rulebook is still being edited and playtested, and we'll continue to tweak it until production starts.\n\nThe biggest risks for Slaughterball include:\n\u2022 Unexpected production issues. We're working with Panda Games Manufacturing, veteran manufacturers of many excellent games, including Mice and Mystics, Pandemic, Merchants and Marauders, etc. They have a great team and I'm sure they'll be able to minimize production risks. However, there could be unanticipated issues that might impact the production schedule.\n\u2022 Shipping delays. Depending on the production run quantity, shipping could be delayed to coincide with other shipments so as to fill an entire container. Other shipping delays might also arise (weather, regulations, pirates, giant sea-monsters, icebergs, time-travelling interlopers, etc.).\n\u2022 Customs delays. Slaughterball is so exciting that I wouldn't be surprised if customs officials want to pop open a box and play it themselves before passing it on. Well, maybe not. But it is possible that the shipment could be stuck in customs if some random inspector wants to give it a thorough twice-over.\n\u2022 General peril. If Mt. Rainier erupts, there's a good chance fulfillment will be delayed. Injuries or illnesses can also cause delays, but I try to avoid hungry bears, rooftop parkour, zombie outbreaks, and other perilous situations.\n\n\nRisks for the stretch goals and add-ons include all of the above, plus possible artist issues (such as illness, injuries, family emergencies, and so on). So as not to delay delivery of the base game, stretch goals and optional stuff will ship later (aiming for Q1-2015).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Frog the What Games\n2 created \u00b7 75 backed"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Three great reviews and we're funded!", "update_content": "Hi!\nYes, we're funded and aiming for our first stretch goal: tiger-man team Fury!\nI just wanted to let you know that the reviews for Slaughterball are starting to get published!

At your turn, you can take a total of 4 actions.\nIf there are no zombies in your area, you can move: It takes one action to move to the next tile, or to go in or out of a building.\nWhen you are in a building with no zombies, you can take one action to Search for new weapons or equipment. A quick search lets you draw the 3 top cards of the Search, but that puts you at risk of accidentally stumbling on zombies. Alternatively, you can do a careful search, by looking one by one at the cards in the discard pile until you choose one to keep.\nRevealing and taking a scenario token from the board also takes one of your four actions.\nYou can fight zombies in your area by decreasing the ammo (or durability for non-firearms) of a weapon, and removing as many zombie figures from the board as the damage value of the weapon. If you're using a noisy weapon, one of those zombies joins the Horde. You can fight multiple times if you like, but each attempt costs one of your four actions.\nWhether or not there are any zombies sharing your space, you can spend one action to use an item.\nAfter spending your four actions, you must be able do fend off zombies around you with one of your weapons; if the Fend Off value of your weapon is lower than the number of zombies in your area, you lose a Life Point.  \nEvery 60 seconds, a zombie growl can be heard in the soundtrack. Whenever you hear a growl, draw the top card on the Zombie pile to find out how many zombies you must add to the board on the street section of the active player's tile. If you draw a Horde card, add all of the (very hungry!) zombies from the Horde box to that tile!\nEach scenario features different objectives: running through the city, pursuing a target, holding a fortified place, searching for useful resources\u2026 If you complete the objectives before the soundtrack is over, all of the players win the game. If you fail, or if at any time all of the heroes are unconscious, you all lose the game!\nWhile other zombie games generally let you think calmly, discuss the problem, and plan through every situation, Zombie 15' simulates the stressful and frantic experience of being chased by zombies. The players have to act fast and think even faster. Cooperation and tactics are decisive, but so is keeping a cool head.\nIn addition, Zombie 15' features an immersive universe, with an original and compelling storyline and awesome heroes.\nSee for yourself with this actual play video: the game starts slowly, but the tension and pace are really rising as the minutes go by. You can activate the Close Captioning by clicking on the CC icon on the lower right corner of the video window.\nIELLO is a seasoned worldwide games publisher. Our game catalog includes Richard Garfield's award-winning King of Tokyo, Carl Chudyk's Innovation and Bruno Faidutti's The Dwarf King. As a successful publisher, we are willing and able to pay for production costs for our games, even for games with lots of extremely high quality components like Zombie 15'. However, designing Zombie 15' was unusually expensive, even before we began production. The game features dozens of pieces of awesome artwork for heroes, zombies, weapons and equipment, and the configurable board tiles. We also hired a professional composer for the soundtrack (since it is such an important part of the game), and had several miniature molds created. Those development costs have a direct impact on the retail price, making the game much more expensive for our customers.\n\nBy selling games directly via Kickstarter, we will be able to more quickly recoup some of the development costs. This way, we can charge less for the game, since the development costs won't have to be included in the retail price. And since we anticipate that this campaign is going to be very successful, it means we can put even more goodies in the box: new heroes, new zombie minis, new scenarios, new tiles, etc.\n\nWe really want Zombie 15' (and everyone who plays it!) to benefit from this Kickstarter campaign. If this campaign is as successful as we expect, the game will be better (and less expensive) for everyone, both backers and retail customers alike! It is not our intention to create Kickstarter exclusives, as we think the game is original and awesome enough to be an incentive all by itself. We sincerely hope you'll think the same!\n\n\nHere's the deal we are offering you:\nYou get the game for less than its retail price ($70 instead of $79) and by doing so you make it even better for everybody!\nYou will get the game before anybody else, so you can claim bragging rights!\nIn exchange we get to sell a great game with lots of extra content, for less than what we would have had to sell it for without your help ($79 instead of $99).\nEverybody wins!\n  As this campaign has already been so successful, we'll be adding a few \u201csweeteners\u201d to be sent with the games to our backers, as small tokens of gratitude.\n \n1. 8 Hero miniatures\n2. 8 Hero sheets\n3. 100 zombie miniatures \u2014 33 cops, 33 secretaries, 33 thugs and 1 Alpha Zombie\n4. 32 double-sided Terrain tiles\n5. 33 Scenario cards\n6. 56 Search cards\n7. 18 Special Item cards\n8. 48 Zombie cards\n9. 25 Ammo/Durability tokens\n10. 15 Life Point tokens\n11. 40 Search tokens\n12.

We make fun, original games, with a focused emphasis on great artwork, high quality production, extensive replayability, and excellent value. Our catalog include worldwide award-winning hits such as King of Tokyo, Innovation and The Dwarf King. www.iellogames.com\nTHE DESIGNERS\nGuillaume L\u00e9mery & Nicolas Schlewitz are two French gamers (and now designers) living in the Lyon area. They came up with the idea of Zombie 15' while playing a zombie video game. The development of Zombie 15' has certainly benefited from the hundreds of boardgames in their (impressive) personal collections. They posted a short video to tell you how they came up with the idea for this game!\nTHE ARTISTS\nHeroes, zombies and cover \u2014 Biboun is a French artist living in Montpellier. He works mainly on character designs for video games, board games, anime and comics. www.biboun.com\nItems \u2014 Alexey Yakovlev is a young Russian artist living in Yekaterinburg. His previous works include the arsenal and cover artwork for the boardgame Titanium Wars. kypcaht.deviantart.com\nTerrain tiles \u2014 Anthony Wolff is a French artist/roughman/storyboarder working for video game/publishing & advertisement. www.waart.net\nIcons \u2014 Igor Polouchine is a French artist, art director and game designer (Croak!). He works for Origames, a game design and graphics studio he co-founded in 2010.\nTHE COMPOSER\nEros Cartechini is an Italian soundtrack composer and arranger, with much of his work being used in video games. www.eroscartechini.com\nDuring the duration of the campaign, we'll publish regular updates, focusing on a hero, a type of weapons or equipment, a component, or a rule from the game. These updates are also how we will show you more details on the new components unlocked with the Stretch Goals.\n\nOur US team will read all your comments and will answer as often and as soon as we can. We will also regularly compile all the new questions asked in the comments or questions section and answer them in the updates, for quick reference by everyone. We will also include those questions in the FAQ so that they are easy to find.\n\n\nThis Kickstarter campaign is only for the English version of the game. The purpose of this campaign is to pay for development costs (art, molds, soundtrack\u2026) that are not language-dependent, which means that any version in other languages will include any extra content unlocked here. The French version will be produced and released at the same time as the English version, and we're already discussing other languages with our international partners.\nSince we fully expect this Kickstarter project to be successful (and are determined to publish the game no matter what), we already asked our manufacturer to produce some of the components. The remainder will start as soon as the goal is reached (without even waiting for the project to end). We\u2019ll be putting all additional bonus content into production as soon as that content is unlocked.\nFor those reasons, the game should be fully produced very soon after the project ends! Depending on shipping time to their location, we expect backers to start receiving their games in May 2014, a couple of weeks before the games hit friendly local game stores worldwide.\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!\nSAI FON AVATAR (click for larger image)\nSNOW AVATAR (click for larger image)\nTREVOR AVATAR (click for larger image)\nVANCE AVATAR (click for larger image)\nHAZEL AVATAR (click for larger image)\nJOSH AVATAR (click for larger image)\nWILL AVATAR (click for larger image)\nSEVERITY AVATAR (click for larger image)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince this project is not meant to fund the production of the game (but instead to make the game better and less expensive by helping to cover the development costs), the risks here are very limited.\n\nIELLO is an experienced publisher, and we absolutely know what we are doing when it comes to creating boardgames. Our games are recognized and renowned for their excellent value, and feedback for our customer service has always been extremely positive.\n\nAs for possible delays, production has already started, so we are confident that our backers will get their games in the Spring of this year. The production of additional components could hold back shipping a bit, but no more than a couple of weeks.\n\nOur previous project, Guardians' Chronicles experienced some delays due to unexpected production challenges. We also made some last minute changes (adding in a stretch goal that wasn't met, and upgrading to engraved dice) that we decided to include after listening to our backers.

A 4x MicroGame!\nClick here to visit TEK on GamelynGames.com for more information!\n\"Tiny Epic Kingdoms is the best bang for your buck on Kickstarter!\"\nWhat does 4x mean!?\nIt means eXpand, eXplore, eXploit and eXterminate and usually only shows up in games that cost $50+ and take 2hrs+ to play. Well not anymore! Tiny Epic Kingdoms has all the strategy of a traditional 4x game without the cost or the long playing time. Tiny Epic Kingdoms is only $16 and takes only 30-60 minutes to play.\nIn TEK, you are a tiny kingdom with big ambitions. You want to expand your population throughout the realms, learn powerful magic, build grand towers, and have your neighbors quiver in fear at the mention of your name. The conflict? All of the other kingdoms want the same thing and there's not enough room for everyone to succeed...  \n*Watch a gameplay video below in the Reviews & Videos section*\nThis mock-up image includes all the unlocked stretch goals! \nAll THIS for only $16!\nGet even MORE with the DELUXE PACKAGE! Don't miss out!\nFor the purpose of distinguishing them from the reward tier descriptions, \"Gifts\" are NOT considered \"Stretch Goals\"\nEach player starts with a unique faction, a small territory, and a technology tree to grant them unique faction-specific magical abilities as the game progresses. Players will collect resources, explore other territories, battle each other, research magic, and work to build a great tower to protect their realm. The final round of the game is triggered when a player maxes out either their Magic Level, Population, or Tower.\nThe Factions: Magic Levels & Kingdom Resources\nEach player will choose a faction. This will be the persona taken on by that player. If played properly, it can lead them to victory!\nEach faction has a unique set of skills known as Magic Levels. Players can unlock these abilities by Researching Magic during the game. The abilities stack, eventually creating a very powerful entity.\nIn addition to Magic Levels, each player will have access to their Kingdom vault where they will manage and track their resources. Resources are used for several aspects in the game; researching magic, expanding population, building towers, and battling opponents. \nThe Human Player is currently benefiting from Magic Levels 1 through 3. He/She has 3 Mana, 5 Ore, and 6 Food.\nThe Orc Player is currently benefiting from Magic Level 1. He/She has 1 Mana, 2 Food, and 4 Ore.\nThe Elven Player is currently benefiting from Magic Levels 1 through 4. He/She has 1 Ore, 4 Mana, and 7 Food.\nThe Dwarven Player is currently benefiting from Magic Levels 1 and 2. He/She has 2 Food, 2 Mana, and 8 Ore.\nThe Territories & Population\nEach player will be the landlord of a unique Territory. They will Expand their population across the regions and even explore into other player's regions. This is done to gather resources and/or block their opponent's resource supply. They will also battle each other for position and/or fortify their Kingdom's defense.\nThe Elven Player is gathering Mana from the Forest and the Orc Player is gathering Food from the Heartlands\nThe Dwarven Player is gathering Ore from the Mountains. The Human Player and the Orc Player are either battling or cohabiting... most likely battling. =)\nCohabiting is when two players create an alliance and share the benefits of that region. The alternative would be to battle, in which one player will lose his meeple and the other player's meeple will remain. War is resolved through a resource bidding system.\nThe Orc Player is gathering all 3 resource types.\nThe Elven Player is fortifying the Forest so that no other player may enter. However, she is gathering 1 Mana, not 2. The Human Player is gathering 2 Food.\nThe Tower & Improved VP\nEvery player will be competing to build a great Tower. They will keep track of their status on a community Tower Card. Because the Tower does not offer any immediate benefits, it is worth additional Victory Points in the end.\nThe scrolls on the right indicate the VP value of that tier.\nThe Action Selection Card & Exploitation\nThe Action Selection Card is the driving engine in Tiny Epic Kingdoms. The players share a community Action Selection Card and even community actions. During a turn, the active player selects an action by placing a gray cube next to it. He may either perform the action he selected OR perform no action at all. Now, the other players, in order, must perform the action that the active player selected OR gather resources. \nThe number of resources gathered is based on where a player's cubes are placed on the Territory Cards. A player gathers 1 resource per region that he has at least 1 cube in. The type of resource gathered is based on the type of region occupied. \nIt is now the next player's turn, he is now the active player that is selecting the community action. He may not select an action already chosen in previous turns, this is tracked by the gray shields. Once all the gray shields have been placed, they will wipe on the following turn. That active player will now have a clean slate to choose from.\nPlayers are able to use the Action Card to exploit other players by selecting actions they know their opponent(s) can't afford to perform.\nRules of Play\nYou can download the prototype rules below. This version of the rules has not yet received the wonderful treatment of the graphic artist.\nClick HERE to download the TEK Rules of Play (prototype)\nPlease see update #21 for details on this package.\nEndless hours have been poured into Tiny Epic Kingdoms in effort to make it the best possible game it can be, but with your help it can be even better! \nAt $15,000 we are able to produce a high quality board game that is sure to hit your game table time and time again. If we are fortunate enough to raise funds above and beyond that goal we can really improve upon this great little game.\nThe most effective way to assure we reach these upgrades is to share this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, blogs, etc. Share this project with EVERYONE!! \nTelling your friends, family, and gaming communities to jump in on this great game will make everyone's game better as all stretch goals are production wide!\nSpeaking of social media, here is an incentive for getting involved:\nSOCIAL MEDIA STRETCH GOAL! UNLOCKED\n1,000 Facebook Likes! Once the Gamelyn Games Facebook page reaches 1,000 likes, ALL the cards in the game will be UPGRADED to a larger, more formidable size; 88 x 125 mm. This IS a sleevable size!\nNow, onto some other exciting stretch goals!\nAll material upgrades will be included in the final retail version of Tiny Epic Kingdoms, unless otherwise noted. However, it may be the case that not all factions, additional maps or the mini expansion are included in the final version (they will be included with the every KS copy). Any factions, maps and the mini expansion left out of the final version will be available via the BGG store, conventions and/or other outlets.\nPrior to launching on Kickstarter, we sent out tons of prototypes of Tiny Epic Kingdoms. Some to established reviewers and some to gamers who like to write reviews. Both crowds received the game so well, that I had to reach out further and see just how far the excitement for TEK went. So, I released a FREE Print 'N Play of the game and within two weeks it had already been downloaded over 1,500 times! I encourage you to read these reviews and see just what people are raving about!\n                                                                                               BoardGamegGeek Review Forum (14 reviews)\n\"Tiny Epic Kingdoms is a win in my book. Microgames and 4X games are two of my weaknesses, and this manages to combine both together in a tidy package.\" -Craig Imprimis\n\"For us, many 4X games are simply inaccessible due to their over-production of rules, mechanics and sometimes graphic layout. There were none of these obstacles in Tiny Epic Kingdoms and we felt like we were expanding, exploring, exploiting and exterminating. Finally, there is a 4X game that we can play and want to play.\" -Sarah Reed\n\"It's a nice game some people can fit in a lunch break, has fast setup and take down, and benefits from smooth paced turns.\" -Justin Lowmaster\n\"TEK manages to capture all the depth you'd expect to find in a 4X game\" -Legend Montgomery\n\"Having a game of this caliber in a very portable size is rare. I can bring this anywhere and pull it out nearly anywhere. The game plays quickly so it doesn't over stay its welcome. I\u2019m so glad this game found me.\" -J.

Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nWhy you should back Tiny Epic Kingdoms on Kickstarter.\nApart from TEK being an AMAZING game!!??\nAlright, here's the thing, without Kickstarter the game would not be made at all. So waiting around to find it at your FLGS or favorite online retailer would NOT even be an option!\nWe need people to back it on Kickstarter to get it made. So, here are the incentives we've offered:\n\u2022 20% discounted from MSRP (on an already super cheap game)\n\u2022 FREE US Shipping + Discounted International Shipping\n\u2022 *Kickstarter Exclusive content! Including extra Factions and Territories!\n*Kickstarter Exclusive - Will never enter regular distribution channels but may become available in limited quantities via contests, conventions, and/or the BGG store.\nWhy we use Kickstarter.\nWe choose to use Kickstarter because of the people. Kickstarter has a very supportive and enthusiastic community that we've grown to love.\nOur experience with Kickstarter began as a project creators. I, personally, had not backed a project prior to making my own, that quickly changed. The philanthropy demonstrated by the backers that so generously supported our projects became contagious. We're not just project creators anymore, we are backers now and we love it! Backing a project is a little bit like being Santa Claus in helping make dreams come true! Then getting it in the mail later is a lot like being a kid on Christmas day! It's a win, win.\nThere's more than one way to fund the publication of a board game and even within the crowd-funding concept there are several options but none that compare to Kickstarter. Without the wonderful community of Kickstarter we would not be where we are today. That is why we feel it is important to give back. Kickstarter has changed our business and our lives in a big way and if we can play a small part in changing someone else's life in a big way we will!\nWe have put endless hours into bringing Tiny Epic Kingdoms to this point. Many people have put a lot of hard work into this game but entering production is very expensive and unfortunately outside the limitations of our resources. The game has been enjoyed by so many and some awesome memories have been made. With your help, we can make this game a reality and share the unique experience within with a lot of people.\nThank you Kickstarter and thank you backers!

The two (2) cities with the most votes will get the special screening! The voting will end once the campaign is finished, so hurry up!\nTickets to the event is sold separately. The screening will take place after the Kung Fury release. \nUPDATE #1\nSorry for being unclear regarding shipping and the rewards. You won't have to pay for shipping, regardless of where in the world you are! All of the rewards from $20 and above will include the digital download, sneak peak and access to the production diary, Unfortunately we can't edit the description for the rewards. \n--\nKUNG FURY is an over-the-top action comedy written and directed by David Sandberg. The movie features: arcade-robots, dinosaurs, nazis, vikings, norse gods, mutants and a super kung fu-cop called Kung Fury, all wrapped up in an 80s style action packed adventure. \nDuring an unfortunate series of events a friend of Kung Fury is assasinated by the most dangerous kung fu master criminal of all time; Adolf Hitler, a.k.a Kung F\u00fchrer. Kung Fury decides to travel back in time, to Nazi Germany, in order to kill Hitler and end the Nazi empire once and for all. Kung Fury is a visually spectacular action comedy that has it's foundation in 80s cop movies.\nWhen I started this project over a year ago I was driven by a strong will, love for the 80s and action movies to create a unique movie that the world has never seen, which has taken to a finished trailer and enough material to create a 30 minute long film. This with help of friends and giddy days. This movie has been made on a very limited budget. At the beginning of this project I took $5000 of my own money and just started shooting whenever I and my friends had time. \nKung Fury takes place in a variety of exotic locations; 1980s Miami, Asgard and Germany in the 1940s, to name a few. With a limited budget to work with, we had to solve this by shooting most of the scenes against a greenscreen backdrop. \nShooting on greenscreen means that we have to recreate these environments digitally instead. The advantage of shooting on greenscreen is that it doesn't require expensive sets or locations to shoot, it is very simple and only requires a small crew, which helped a lot in keeping the costs down. However, once you're done shooting a movie like this, there's a massive post-production phase that requires a lot of time and effort by talented visual effects artists.\nWhen I started this project I knew that I had the skillset required to make a movie like this, since I have a background in visual effects. Now I need the manpower to finish it.\nHence kickstarter and the wish for you to get involved in this project, where all my dedication remains and where my goal is to finish this movie and share it with the world. \nWith the kickstarter funding we'll hire a team of 7 visual effects artists who will work closely with David Sandberg on the post-production for a period of 6 months to complete the film. Pretty much every shot in this film requieres some form of visual effects treatment so there's a lot of work to be done. Apart from creating all the environments digitally, there's a lot of CG animated characters such as dinosaurs and robots that requires talented people and lots of time. To hire these artists we need to be able to pay them a decent salary. Money will also go to hire an exceptional artist to create the artwork for the movie poster. It will have that classic, illustrated 80s style that you rarely see anymore. Costs will also go to the rewards, such as printing costs for posters and stickers, t-shirts, blu-rays etc.\nWe're open to all the help we can get, so if you're a 3D artist, 3D animator, visual effects artist, compositor, or if you feel like contribute to this movie in any way not mentioned here, please contact us at: laserunicorns@gmail.com\nNo man should be left empty handed, so we've put together packages of exclusive rewards for each donator, all from t-shirts and posters to the soundtrack by Mitch murder and Lost years. Find more about the rewards on the panel to the right.\nIf this kickstarter campain is successful, we will release this 30 minute film online, for free. We want everybody to be able to watch and enjoy this film. It is our dream to be able to expand this into a full feature film. And if we were to exceed our kickstarter goal that something we want to look into.\nThis film was shot entirely on the Canon 5d, with the exception of the slow-mo scenes which were shot with the Sony FS700.\n CAST & CREW\nDavid Sandberg has worked closely with the production company Lampray (www.lampray.se) from the start. The company is run by Linus Andersson and Martin G\u00e4rdemalm.\nRecently the production company Salmon Fox (www.salmonfox.com) got onboard with the project. With the Academy Award nominated producer Mathias Fjellstr\u00f6m. David and Mathias share a love for the 80s and that will reflect in the final film.\nBecause this film has been shot on the span of over a year, there's been a number of talented cinematographers involved. They are:\nMartin G\u00e4rdemalm, Linus Andersson, Jonas Ernhill, Mattias Andersson (www.anderssonmattias.com) and aerial cinematography by Henning Sandstr\u00f6m (www.vimeo.com/henning). \nStarring: David Sandberg as \"Kung Fury\", Joanna H\u00e4ggblom as \"Viking Babe\", Leopold Nilsson as \"Hacker Man\", Andreas Cahling as \"Thor\" and Per-Henrik Arvidius as \"Chief\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKUNG FURY is a very ambitious project to say the least. The good news is that we've already shot most of the film, so that eliminates a degree of worry right away. There's so many man-hours that has went into creating this, that it is just not an option to give up at this point. It is currently the funding that is holding us back and finding money for a movie is hard, especially for a crazy project like this. We can only hope that you feel as excited about this project as we do and join us to create the most epic and hilarious 80s adventure this world has ever seen. \n\nWe have also already teamed up with a qualified partner to print and handle the reward products.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "MIAMI 1986: A YEAR LATER", "update_content": "Hi Everybody,\nIt's been exactly a year since we released Kung Fury to the universe! \nAnd finally, after an insanely long amount of time we have our Blu-Ray and DVD version of Kung Fury ready to be manufactured and shipped soon to our backers and to be sold on shop.kungfury.com if you missed out.

And a hand of ingredients that allow them to manipulate their mixing line, or add ingredients to the stew from every mixing line.\nOn a cooks turn they may sample the stew, taking one ingredient of their choice from the stew into their hand.  Or they may spend an ingredient from their hand to divide their cooking line, gaining access to more of their ingredients, or to add ingredients from their line into the stew, but be wise because if you add an ingredient that other cooks are ready to add, they too can add to the stew on your turn.\nWhat if multiple cooks are done at the same time?  Well, every good Burgoo cook knows, \"Ingredients in the hand are better than 12 in the stew.\"\nHOW TO PLAY BURGOO VIDEO (Prototype Components Shown)\nPLAY\n\n     Burgoo will be printed to TMG's typical quality standards.  The ingredients that make up Burgoo are:\n96 ingredient tokens (16 of each Beef, Carrots, Onions, Celery, Potatoes, and Herbs/Spices)\n1 Rulebook\n1 Baggie to hold everything.\nStretch Goals\nWith more funding, we are able increase the size of our print run which means that we have a lower cost per unit.  This means that we can in turn make the game better for all!\nUNLOCKED! - @$12,500 - Upgrade the thickness of the Burgoo titles to 2.0mm from 1.5mm.\nUNLOCKED! - @ $20,000 - Upgrade the thickness of the Burgoo tiles to 2.5mm from 2.0mm\nAt TMG, we REALLY love games and publishing games. Towards the end of 2012, we wanted to be able to provide fantastic micro games. Not just micro components and a micro footprint, but also a micro price.\nIt wasn't until about September of 2013 that we figured out a viable method for providing games like these at a quality level the fans of TMG have come to expect.\nSo, we have embraced a pay-what-you-want methodology with one modification, a minimum support level which covers our costs. At the suggested pledge level of $5, then we (TMG and the game designer) make a decent amount from your pledge.\nMost of all, we want to be able to bring these great tiny games to you, your friends, and your family. If this project goes well, then we will be able to bring more like this to you in the future as well. So, please share this project with your friends.\nHello everyone! Thank you for taking the time to check out my game called Burgoo! It is one of my favorite designs and I thought I'd give you a bit of history about the game: \nThe game of Burgoo started out as a design challenge that I proposed for my local game design group way back in 2007. The challenge was simple: \"Design a game using only glass beads. The quantity and color are up to you. No board, no paper and pencil, nothing but the beads\". Restrictions like that always get my creative juices flowing and I got to work. \nThe resulting game was something that was portable, simple to teach, quick, and fun to play! Everybody loved it and I ended up winning that challenge hands down. After many playtests and a lot of feedback, I felt it was the time to pitch the game publishers. Unfortunately, publishers at that time weren't ready for the concept of a micro game - \"too small to publish\". So, I decided to try my hand at publishing my own game. \nI made around 50 copies of that game and sold them at the BGG.CON flea market under the poorly-titled name \"Chains of Fenrir\". The game sold out, and I was happy leaving the game on a positive note to pursue other designs.\nI thought that that was the end for the game. So it lied dormant, or at least it tried. The game kept popping up. Friends were teaching friends. People were making their own copies. I thought maybe it was time to give it another go with the game. After coming up with the perfect theme (soup, of course!) I showed it to the great guys at Tasty Minstrel. They loved it and thought their \"pay-what-you-want\" would work perfect for a game of this size.\nI am really looking forward to you trying out Burgoo because I know you and your friends will enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you for your support!\nDan Manfredini is the designer for the games Island Siege, Venture Forth, and Monkey Lab. For the past five years, he has run a charity game convention called \"Give to Game\" to raise food for local pantries. He lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife and two board game loving sons.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are pleased to be bringing you the game Burgoo. As the game only has a couple of punchboards of tokens and the artwork is already complete the risks associated with this project are low.\n\nTo date, TMG has delivered numerous games throughout the world. Some that were funded on Kickstarter and some that were not, at this point in time, we are confident that we know how to deliver the product.\n\nThe major risks here are delays due to pre-press errors, materials editing, and some other potential issues.\n\nPREVIOUS PROJECTS...\n\nDungeon Roll Winter Promo is currently being manufactured and we expect to be able to deliver this small and simple project on time to backers. The risks here are low.\n\nCoin Age, and Templar Intrigue are in a situation similar to the Dungeon Roll Winter Promo Pack in that it is a small and relatively simple product to deliver. It is a handful of cards. We have extensive experience getting a product like this produce. The major risk here is if people will like the game.\n\nCity Hall and Captains of Industry are both currently in the pre-press/manufacturing process and we expect to be able to deliver by our targeted time in the project of May 2014.

D20 Entertainment wanted this same team to write the script for this project and have creative control. It is our goal, first and foremost, to bring the characters that the readers have known and loved to the screen and to remain faithful to the spirit of the comic strip. So what can you expect to see? Well \u2014 much of it is going to depend on the level of funding. The more that comes in, the more we\u2019ll have to work with. What you won\u2019t be getting is a simple rehashing of material from the magazine. Instead, you will see all new material. Of course, we do plan to draw from the wealth of material presented in the monthly magazine over the years. The two will be massaged, reimagined, rewoven and combined into an episodic story that flows together seamlessly on the big screen. Readers have come to rely on getting the best story for their buck every month in the strips, and as supporters of this Kickstarter project, you can be assured of getting the best screen adaptation possible. Everyone involved is passionate about the comic and getting it right. Again, just what that story turns out to be depends on our backers. This is where you come in.\nAt $60k, we will produce a short theatrical format picture around 60 minutes long. This will include more appearances by more familiar characters from the KODT universe. \nAt $125k, we get to make dreams come true and enter a whole new frontier. This will mean that the producers (with full creative control by the D-Team) will be able to fully make the movie they\u2019ve been bouncing around for the past six months. Viewers will be able to enjoy not only the classic characters, but also more of their favorites, perhaps even the lovable Squirrely. We have a very exciting story blocked out and would love the opportunity to bring it to life. \nEvery portion of this production will be under the watchful eye of Kenzer and Company and the creative control of the KODT development team who have been extremely protective of their creation over the last twenty-five years. Rest assured, the spirit of the Knights will be faithfully recreated. As funding increases, so can characters be added, and let\u2019s face it, everyone has a favorite character that they want to see on film. We need your help. All we ask is that you download the free comic and share it with your friends to entice them to visit and consider pledging. Help us spread the word. Share and post about the project frequently, and keep checking back for updates every few days. \nBelow is a list of movie props that you can add to your reward/war chest.

All original stretch goals unlocked!\nUpdate: Pledges of $20 or more will now also receive the Ultimate GM Screen II from our friends at Fat Dragon Games!\n\"Honestly, we wouldn't have been able to tell the stories we wanted to tell in Pathfinder without the Advanced Bestiary.\"\nF. Wesley Schneider\nEditor-in-Chief, Paizo Publishing\n\nIn 2005 Green Ronin Published the Advanced Bestiary for the d20 System. It was a monster book that took the idea of templates and ran with it. The Advanced Bestiary featured over 100 new templates and sample monsters built using them. It was a terrific toolkit and added value to every monster book GMs already owned. For years people have been asking us to do a Pathfinder version of the Advanced Bestiary and with your help, we are going to do it!\n  The rules revisions are already well under way. The question is, what will the book\u2019s final format be? We are starting with the assumption that the book will be a 264-page hardback with a black and white interior like the original, and that we\u2019ll keep the book\u2019s existing art. Really though, we want to give you a full color hardback with all new art! That\u2019s built into the stretch goals of this Kickstarter, so the final format is up to you all!\n\nUpdate: Full color printing and all new art are unlocked! \n\nYou Can\u2019t Eat Accolades! \nThe Advanced Bestiary got great reviews as soon as it was released. This was in the later days of the d20 era, when it was harder to impress people and much harder to have a hit book. The critics loved it and sales were solid. Mission accomplished, right? Well, no, as it turned out. The Advanced Bestiary and two other titles (The Black Company and Egyptian Adventures: Hamunaptra) had the misfortune of coming out when our fulfillment company (Osseum Entertainment) was dying and stealing money from our sales to stay afloat. Those three big, expensive-to-print products all sold pretty well\u2014and we saw not a dime of that money. We were, of course, still on the hook for all the associated bills: writing, editing, printing, art, etc. What should have been a triumph thus turned into a disaster. I remember figuring out at one point that for every dollar we paid the designer, Green Ronin lost three dollars. The \u201cOsseum Debacle,\u201d as we came to call it, nearly killed Green Ronin Publishing. We managed to survive though and slowly paid down all of our associated debts. \nThe fact that the Advanced Bestiary became a cornerstone book for Pathfinder development has thus always been bitter sweet. We were certainly flattered that Paizo used the Advanced Bestiary in so many of its own books and we were glad players and GMs got so much use out of it. You can\u2019t eat accolades though, so for years I had hoped we could bring this book back and actually turn a profit on it. \nEarlier this year we did a highly successful Pathfinder Kickstarter for our Freeport city setting. Last month I hired Owen K.C. Stephens to be our Pathfinder developer for Freeport and more. I believe now that the Stars are Right for the return of the Advanced Bestiary! Let\u2019s make it happen, Pathfinder fans! \nThe Stretch Goals \nAs I mentioned, we want this book to be full color and featuring all new art. We\u2019ve baked that into the stretch goals and we are revealing them all so you can see what we ultimately hope to achieve with this campaign. We are also keeping expansion of the book fairly limited by design because we want to have the finished product out to backers next July. The more we might add, the longer this would take, so we are capping the new material at 32 pages. Note, however, that there were originally five web enhancements to the Advanced Bestiary and we\u2019ll be including all of those in the new book. \nd20Pro Add-on\nd20Pro is a Virtual Table Top (VTT) program that allows pen-and-paper gaming groups to play online and now you can buy d20Pro files for the Advanced Bestiary for only $10. Simply add $10 to your pledge and you'll get the files when they are released. They will be available to the public later for $15, so this is a great deal for d20Pro Users.\nFantasy Grounds Add-on\nYou also have the option of Fantasy Grounds support for the Advanced Bestiary! Fantasy Grounds is an application acting as a virtual online gaming table. If you'd like Fantasy Grounds files with your Advanced Bestiary, just add $10 to your pledge!\nThe Rewards\nHere are the reward levels for the Advanced Bestiary!\n\nHISTORIC BEAST: You get a PDF of the original (3.5 d20 rules) Advanced Bestiary.

I have requested more samples to touch and determine full range of options.\n----\nHelp enhance a global icon.  Throughout the world, the classic six-sided dice (d6) symbolize not only gaming, but also play and luck. \nSome say dice originated from the ankle bones of hoofed animals. But once the die developed into the pipped cube, the d6 stopped evolving.\nIsn't it time for a new spin on a classic? By making the d6 a dodecahedron, the die will not only roll better, but be more weight-balanced as opposing sides have the same number of engraved pips.\nDoublesix Dice can also be the perfect gateway accessory: Swap in your Doublesixes for the stale dice in your non-gamer friends' games (like Monopoly and Backgammon), and soon they will be wanting to take on Advanced D&D.\nIf you pledge to get your own Doublesix Dice and help this humble intiative, I pledge to provide you, in return, detailed transparency of the process, and satisfaction guaranteed (or your money back).\nWe will start with Black engraved pips on Ivory. Other colors will be added as stretch goals.\nHere are some preliminary details:\nWhy $3246?\n\nProduction: $2000\nShipping: approx $1000\nFees (Kickstarter at 5% and Amazon at about 3.2%): $246\nNot included:\nLogo design: $299 (via 99designs.com, where you can help vote for the final design)\nAdvertising on Boardgame Geek: $500\nGift to Ronald Larson (expired patent holder): $300\nVirtual Assistance: $300 +\nPRODUCTION\nThese 19mm ivory-colored acrylic dice will be custom molded with engraved pips painted black. Current likely producer: Ningbo Lijia Industry Co (they specialize in game components) http://www.cnlijia.com.cn/\nCost of mold: $1300.\nCost of minimum production run (10k units): $700\nCost per dice (first 10K including cost of mold): $0.20\nWholesale cost per dice: $0.40\nMSRP: $0.80\n\nI used the wholesale cost to calculate the reward tiers.\nPer order of 12 dice:\nCost for dice: $4.80\nCost per envelop (bubble mailer): $1.49\nCost to ship in US: approx $2.50\nCost to handle (ie. pack and label): $0.25\nKS and Amaz fees: $0.82\nTotal cost: approx $9.86\nSHIPPING TO CANADA AND MEXICO: Kickstarter groups Canada and Mexico in their \"to ship Outside the US\" additional cost in the reward tiers, though it is cheaper. I plan to compensate Canadians and Mexican somehow (likely extra dice).\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThough I thought of the idea myself, I discovered an expired patent (filed in 1982) on the exact same idea:\nhttp://www.google.com/patents/US4465279\n\nAs a measure of good faith, I had originally planned to donate 10% of the Kickstarter goal amount ($300) to the original patent holder, Roland Larson (or his charity of choice), if we were successful.  EDIT: Turns out that Kickstarter forbids this, so this will not be happening.\nBecause the patent is expired, no one, including myself, can patent the idea again, so it is fair game to all.  Therefore, others can start producing d2x6, and probably will.  However, there will be the one and only original brand: Doublesix Dice.\nPROTOTYPES\nThanks to Eric (http://www.ericharshbarger.org/) for making the prototypes for the video (he used blank dice from Chessex manufacturing and engraved them with a laser cutter).\nClick Kicktraq image below to track this project's trending.\nADD-ONS and COLORS:\nWill be $5 for a 6-pack.

We look forward to seeing its progress throughout the year!\nWhen we announced PopCon was coming to Indianapolis from May 30 - June 1, 2014.... we anticipated a modest response for our first year.  Instead, you completely blew us away.  The excitement and passion we've seen from our fans has been intense and we are humbled and honored to have the support of so many.  The outpouring has been so great that we find ourselves wondering if we can't do more.... which is what this Kickstarter is about.\nWe are not a mega corporation.  We are a group of gamers, geeks, nerds, and collectors who want to do something cool.  After seeing the positive response, we now want to raise funds to get a second hall for the convention so that we can expand our space, double our programming, and offer more guests, artists, and vendors than we'd previously hoped.  If we can raise the funds for the second hall, we have tons more flexibility to give you more guests, bigger cosplay contests, video game tournaments, a 24-hour board/tabletop gaming area, larger panels, and more.\nThink of this Kickstarter as a pre-sale event that will help us determine how big we can go.  If you give us your support and we meet our goals, you'll be an intricate part of making PopCon 2014 Bigger, Better, and Geekier than we could ever hope to do on our own.\nIndy PopCon will be held in the Indianapolis Convention Center on May 30 - June 1.

Children love the outdoor setting of the products and bring their energy and unique view of the world to the framework created by the game atmosphere. The Fishing Away board game appeals to both boys and girls in their early learning, cognitive and developmental ages. It's all about a child's first fishing trip and how they must collect all the items that they need for fishing before arriving at the dock and starting their fishing adventure.\nOur team of professionals are poised and waiting to get started. Deborah has spent many years searching and assembling the very best team available, each having many years of experience in his or her own field. These individuals' talent, their extended resources and other corporations to fulfill the needs of the DAB-A-DEW product line has been well worth the wait.  \nOur goals\nRaise the money to produce our first video production.This video will be oriented around teamwork and how to deal with everyday social issues. Raise the money to finish development of our second and third themed set of products. Establish a foundation that will provide a place for disadvantaged children and single parents to get education and skills that allow them to change their lives and future.

Check out Jiayin the Mystic and the other models in our Fantasy Update!\nProxy War is bringing tabletop gaming into the 21st century, letting gamers create fully custom models online, and then get them 3D printed in ultra-fine detail. Log onto a database of parts, select chassis, torsos, limbs, weapons, mutations, powers, and technology, and clip them together into a unit that is uniquely yours. You can also partner with our design staff to create a custom unit entirely from scratch. Our service lets you make anything you can imagine\u2014from RPG characters to whole wargame armies.\n3D printing is going to revolutionize miniature gaming\u2014and that revolution starts now!\nClick on the two videos below to see examples of Proxy War\u2019s two types of fully custom models\u2014original and personalized.\nFine Detail is currently the best resolution material available for 3D printing. With better than 25 microns of resolution, the detail on these models is superior to current finecast models. Compatible with traditional model painting supplies.\nAdvantages: Gorgeous, affordable, takes paint well.\nDisadvantages: Unavailable for Huge and Titan scale models.\nRegular Reinforced is an incredibly strong material. At a recent con, we played catch with our tanks, tossing them to volunteers and passer-bys. Despite being dropped many times, they never once suffered any visible damage. Compared to current modeling resin and plastic, they're functionally indestructible. Resolution is roughly equal to current non-finecast miniatures.\nAdvantages: Good detail, damage resistant.\nDisadvantages: Somewhat less detail than Fine Detail. Material requires wash before painting.\nColored Sandstone is exactly what it says on the tin\u2014artificial sandstone, mixed with dye when it\u2019s still in the liquid phase and then 3D printed in 256 colors. With Colored Sandstone, you can not only paint your minis online, but add designs, patterns, icons, etc, to be printed right into the material.\nAdvantages: Comes in full color. Has a much more solid feel than plastic. Perfect for titans and buildings.\nDisadvantages: Slightly lower resolution than standard tabletop models.\nWhen you order a personalized Proxy War model, you log onto our database of parts and grabs torsos, limbs, chassis, mutations, powers, equipment, and technology. You then clip them together like lego to create an entirely custom model you can pose and personalize to your tastes. Personalized models can be 3D printed in any of our three materials.\nProxy War has four levels of personalized models:\nRegular models, which are printed in any material and are up to 28mm tall (or on their longest axis).\nHeavy models, which are printed in any material and are up to 50mm tall (or on their longest axis).\nHuge models, which are printed in sandstone or regular-reinforced plastic and are up to 120mm tall (or on their longest axis).\nTitan models, which are printed in sandstone or regular-reinforced plastic, and are up to 240mm tall (or on their longest axis).\nAll of our models are fully customizable to every detail, and can be printed in alternate materials by request. We can also print terrain pieces on all of the above scales. Below are examples of every level of unit, as well as of our personalization options.\nWhen you order an original Proxy War model, you partner with a three man design team: a character artist, an illustrator, and a 3D modeler. They work with you full time to go all the way from a concept to a finished high-detail prototype. We then help you share your creation with the community, putting it up on our website and giving you full credit.\nProxy War original models are made with a six step process:\nBundled free with models, the Proxy War tabletop game combines all the flexibility and creativity of RPGs with the quick-paced tactical depth of tabletop wargames. Our point-based unit creation system lets players field any sort of army\u2014from swarms of units rallied by powerful leaders, to small squads of elite adventurers facing down numberless hordes. RPG players will find all the flexibility in character design they expect, now realized in a tabletop wargame, while wargamers will find a quick and simple system that offers endless combinations of special abilities and tactics.\nStep 1: Create or Select Units\nUnits can be created on the spot or brought in from elsewhere. Our unique \"scramble phase\" army-generation system ensures that you're never defeated before the game starts just because you brought the wrong army. Using a simple point buy system, combine base stats with special abilities to put together any unit imaginable, generating your army in waves in response to your opponent's recruitments. A fundamentally balanced core system provides room for hundreds of different types of effects without making any one overpowered.\nStep 2: Fight!\nBalanced custom armies face off against each other, vying for advantage and crushing the opposition. Advantages and special abilities change the way the game plays constantly, so no two battles are the same. Specialists, Hordes and Heroes take actions in turn until one player emerges victorious. The Proxy War tabletop game supports squads of everything from five-hundred mooks to five elite heroes. An innovative impact-based rolling system ensures turns never run long or feel inconsequential.\nStep 3: Victory\nIt's not about winning, it's about having fun. But you know what\u2019s fun? Winning. Proxy War offers any number of ways to win, from crushing your opponents forces to completing key mission objectives. Different game modes support everything from 2 to 6 players, in competitive or cooperative battles.\nMore on Proxy War\u2019s unique D6 system and unit creation rules will be released in project updates over the course of the Kickstarter.\nAll our reward levels are awesome, but there are a few we particularly recommend!

The back of the token lists stats, letting you use them to track spells, powers, or special abilities in any RPG or tabletop wargame. Fans of the Proxy War tabletop game also get a new playable faction, the Xenolight Consortium.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge Proxy War faces is not whether or not we succeed- but the timeframe in which we do. We\u2019ve spent nine months building a team and dev structure geared toward making a database of modular parts and creating an Original unit service designed to get players exactly what they want as effectively as possible. The simple fact is, we are committed to seeing this to the end and equipped to do so, but creating original models takes time. If we get orders for dozens or hundreds of fully original models, it will take time to integrate them all into our database, and that could delay release.\n\nTo make sure this isn\u2019t a problem, we\u2019ll be taking the following steps:\n\n1) We will start work on original models the day after the Kickstarter finishes, prioritizing game devs and other people who need their original models urgently.\n\n2) We will focus on integrating widely used content\u2014like steampunk parts or starship minis\u2014before more obscure content, like historically accurate revolutionary war uniforms. This will let people ordering personalized models order them early.\n\n3) If we get more orders than our current printer setup can handle, we will be buying 3D printer time from an industrial print shop with a capacity of over 10,000 units per month. This ensures that there will be no delays in getting the models printed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Proxy Army Games\nFirst created \u00b7 11 backed\nProxy Army Games is a Miniature Games Company Based out of Durham, NC.

We've taken on a new partner, new artists, and a new design team, and come January, we will be back!\nYour support has been overwhelming, but you've also had criticisms. You want to see more models, a better listing of what's in our database, and lower prices\u2014and we've heard those concerns. After the new year, we'll have a better selection, a much bigger database on display, more terrain options, cheaper personalized models, pre-painted figs, and more.

Full Add On list is found further down.\nThanks for your support in helping Dawn see the light of day!\nDawn: Rise of the Occulites is the first game in the Rise of the Occulites Saga. The Saga covers the evolution of the Occulites from small tribes fighting for survival to great civilizations with massive armies spreading out across and ruling the world.\nDawn takes place at the very beginning of the Occulite\u2019s evolution. At this time, the Occulites roam the lands in small tribes, moving from cave to cave, collecting the precious Sungems to keep them warm during the Long Dark. They fight over territory and resources in the struggle for survival.\nI wish you as much pleasure playing this game as we had creating it. Welcome to Dawn.\n- Ben Boersma, September 2013\nIntroduction to Dawn\nDawn: Rise of the Occulites is a miniatures board game. Each player chooses an Occulite tribe and competes against each other, whether by recreating pivotal moments in their short history, or by leading the tribe through its evolution, watching it grow and advance over a series of games. Based on the information gathered by the honorary professor Charles-Darwin over thirty-odd years, this game recreates the struggles that the Occulite Tribes faced in their early days, when they were still small and scattered across the land.\nNOTE:  Most cards have been redrawn with new and improved artwork and layout in the past 60 days!  So if you think you've seen it all before, look again!\n4 Minute Designer Video\nAn Overview of this Kickstarter Project\nThis Kickstarter project is best thought of as having two distinct goals. Our first goal is to raise $25,000 as soon as possible and get started on the molds and printing needed for the basic game. With this $25,000, we will be able to produce the basic two person Dawn game which will have a total of 28 figures, including 15 unique sculptures: 5 unique figures of each of the Palaudis and Hydris tribes and 5 unique Luftles (there are 18 total Luftle figures). The figures in the basic game, which you will receive for your pledge at the Tribesman levels, will be solid-colored, paintable PVC plastic (the Palaudis are green, the Hydris blue and the Luftles brown).  Your pledge at the Tribe Chief levels will get you the basic game, described above, with all 28 figures painted, as pictured below. The basic game is just full of components.  Check out the list below.\nThe second goal of our Kickstarter project is to raise (at least) another $20,000, or a total of $45,000 if possible! This will give us the funds needed to produce the next three expansion tribes: the Floris, Ignis and Nimbus. We will create add-ons as we reach the plateaus of $35,000 (and add the Floris tribe); $40,000 (and add the Ignis tribe); and $45,000 (and add the Nimbus tribe). Each tribal expansion (see their contents in the lists below) adds the possibility of playing with another player, or having even greater two-player choices. When we reach $45,000, we will create two new pledge levels so that you can obtain these three new tribe expansions in either painted or unpainted forms.\nShowing both Prototypes AND factory-painted figures of all tribes\nNote that the above photo shows all the prototype figures that designer Ben Boersma obtained and painted a year ago (they have the bigger, more fully-rounded bases in the back row) compared to the figures that our factory prepared and painted during the past 2-3 weeks (in the middle row with the less well-rounded bases).  The middle and front row left pieces represent the pieces you will obtain if you pledge for painted figures (eventually there will be 5 different members of each tribe plus 5 different Lufltes--pictured in the front row).\nLots more information is available below but this covers the basics. We really appreciate your interest and support for Dawn: Rise of the Occulites.\nFREE to all who pledge at the Tribesman Level or higher--The Timed Release Wymbrix Scenario--\nThe World of Crepusculum: A setting as similar to Earth as it is different .............\nCrepusculum (Latin): Partial Light; Dusk; Twilight\nThe World: Crepusculum is a vast, ancient world, covered in everything from steamy jungles and arid deserts to verdant fields and snowy peaks. Its climate is varied but not radically different from our own. Theories of pockets and irregularities in the atmosphere\u2019s ozone layer could help to explain the radically different environments existing in close proximity. This means that you may have jungles only several kilometers away from vast tundra, or wetlands only a stone's throw from ochre-colored deserts. The cycle of day and night on Crepusculum is very different from our own. Due to the planet\u2019s orbit around the Occulites' sun, a day lasts around one hundred earth days, as does a night. Because of this, during the nights it grows bitterly cold. So cold, in fact, that all living things must find shelter, including not only the creatures of the world, but also its plantlife. I can hear you asking, \"But if the night is so long, how could any plant survive without sunlight?\" Well, my friends, though Crepusculum is similar to Earth, it is still very different.\nComponents of the Basic Game  (reached at our goal of $25,000):\n  1   64 page Rulebook for all basic and advanced game play\n28   Miniature Figures:  10 Occulites and 18 Luftles\n  1   36\" by 30\" Game board\n18   Terrain Overlays\n  1   Natural Selection Deck (108 cards)\n10   D10 Dice numbered 0 through 9 (0 counts as zero)\n12   Sungems (Red Acrylic Crystals)\n10   Individual Character Boards\n50   Pegs (25 each in Green and Blue)\n  2   Tribe Reference Boards\n10   Tribal Tokens (5 cardboard disks for each tribe)\n18   Luftle Reference Cards\n20   Luftle Health Tokens (10mm)\n  1   Condition Track Marker (Orange Acrylic Crystal)\n81   Tokens\n  6   Nymphlet Directional Tokens (Triangular Colour Wedges)\nContents of Each Expansion Tribal Set (now that we have reached our secondary goals of $35K, $40K, and  $45,000):\nFloris Tribe Expansion (add-ons added at $35,000):\n1 Tribal Rulebook + 2 new scenarios\n5 Miniatures ( 5 Floris Occulites )\n2 predator tiles\n3 Terrain Overlays\n5 Individual Character Boards\n25 Yellow Pegs\n1 Tribe Reference Board\n5 Tribal Tokens\nIgnis Tribe Expansion (add-ons added at $40,000): 1 Tribal Rulebook + 2 new scenarios,  5 Miniatures (5 Ignis Occulites), 5 Heat Tokens,  2 Terrain Overlays, 5 Individual Character Boards,  25 Red Pegs,  1 Tribe Reference Board,  7 Tribal Tokens\nNimbus Tribe Expansion (add-ons and \"official\" pledge levels added at $45,000):  1 Tribal Rulebook + 2 new scenarios, 5 Miniatures ( 5 Nimbus Occulites ), 2 Terrain Overlays, 5 Individual Character Boards,  25 purple Pegs, 1 Tribe Reference Board,  5 Tribal Tokens\nNote that all Miniatures come pre-assembled!\nSUNMASTER LEVEL (official  now that we have reached $45,000).

Local game stores provide unique insights into which games to buy, and they frequently offer play space in those stores to play games. We applaud this dedication, and we want to support it. We have created a RETAILER only level as part of this Kickstarter project. Kickstarter limits the number of games that any given retailer may purchase. For this project, that limit is one case. More can be purchased directly from Eagle Games. When you pledge, please contact us to go over purchase and shipping details. You may have found this Kickstarter project on your own, or your customers might have alerted you to it. In either case, please pledge at the retailer level and let us know who you are. If you want us to, we will add your name to a list that we will create right HERE:\n-------\n-------\nYour customers can tell you that they would like to pre-order the game and have the credit for the sale go to you (WITH any and all of the Kickstarter goals and benefits shipping out to you as well). Of course you will need to apply to be a member of the FRED network of stores and go over purchasing and shipping details with our staff. Please give us feedback on this new pledge level and this attempt by us to include retailers in this project in a meaningful way. Thanks!\nEagle & Gryphon Games are committed to producing games of the highest quality, both in production and game play.

We will give you a $15 credit (mentioned below) towards all international shipping.\nWe will ship internationally only to select countries on the following lists. We are subsidizing this shipping by $15 which is reflected in the amounts quoted below. This is the amount we are subsidizing for \"free shipping\" in the US. Please add the amount indicated below to your pledge depending on the country you want us to ship to. The amounts quoted are for only one Dawn: Rise of the Occulites game to be sent to you (this game weighs approximately 8 pounds). For multiple copy or \"Bundle\" shipping rates, you will need to contact us and let us know your country and what quantity and games you are pledging for.\nKeep in mind that bundles and greater quantities will always save you money on international shipping.

Even so, there are always unpredictable events that can occur that might delay our projects. We will do our best to avoid them, but there is always the risk that the project might be delayed. Shipping can be a particularly difficult challenge when it involves destinations outside the US (and sometimes even within the US as well). We will obtain tracking information when it is possible, but sometimes it is not. We cannot guarantee that there will not be shipping problems, as we cannot guarantee the service and reliability of the various postal services involved around the world. You will have to assume that risk along with us. We have been producing board games for over 10 years and we have a good reputation for the quality of our productions because we visit and choose our Chinese partners/factories carefully. However, mistakes happen occasionally that we cannot control--such as missing or defective components and hang-ups in Customs. When they do, our customer service department will work with you to take care of production problems that might arise.

Children love the outdoor setting of the products and bring their energy and unique view of the world to the framework created by the game atmosphere. The Fishing Away board game appeals to both boys and girls in their early learning, cognitive and developmental ages. It's all about a child's first fishing trip and how they must collect all the items that they need for fishing before arriving at the dock and starting their fishing adventure.\nOur team of professionals are poised and waiting to get started. Deborah has spent many years searching and assembling the very best team available, each having many years of experience in his or her own field. These individuals' talent, their extended resources and other corporations to fulfill the needs of the DAB-A-DEW product line has been well worth the wait.  \nOur goals\nRaise the money to produce our first video production.This video will be oriented around teamwork and how to deal with everyday social issues. Raise the money to finish development of our second and third themed set of products. Establish a foundation that will provide a place for disadvantaged children and single parents to get education and skills that allow them to change their lives and future. We recently experienced a family tragedy that has inspired us to wish to establish a foundation that will allow our servicemen and servicewomen easy access to much-needed PTSD counseling.  \nMeet our Team:\nPaul Arsenault - Business and Marketing Advisor                          parsenault123@comcast.net \nBrandon J.

We have invested significant family resources in developing a line of products, including games, books, puppets, screenplays and other products. We need investment from outside to keep it all going.

Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the Heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new Loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!\n\nAn exciting campaign system allows the Players to visit local frontier towns between adventures, spending their hard-earned Loot and building their characters from game to game! As players find fantastic Gear and Artifacts to equip their Heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the Hero\u2019s path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their Hero to fit their own play style.\n\nSo load up yer\u2019 six shooter, throw on yer\u2019 hat and poncho, and gather the posse, the darkness is coming, and all hell\u2019s about to break loose... in the Shadows of Brimstone!\n Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients Core Set\nContents\nRule Book\nAdventure Book\n16x Six-sided dice\n1x Eight-sided die\n1x Special Peril Die\nFull Color Die-cut Counters\nOver 220 game cards\nEnemy and Hero Record Sheets\nLarge Adventure Reference Cards\nCD Soundtrack\nMap Tiles\n8x Unique Room Map Tiles\n4x Standard Room Map Tiles\n6x Passage Map Tiles\n18x Map Tile End Caps\n6x Map Tile Gate End Caps\nMiniatures\n1x US Marshal Hero\n1x Bandido Hero\n1x Saloon Girl Hero\n1x Gunslinger Hero\n12x Void Spiders\n6x Stranglers\n6x Tentacles\n3x Night Terrors\n1x Goliath\nShadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Death Core Set\nContents\nRule Book\nAdventure Book\n16x Six-sided dice\n1x Eight-sided die\n1x Special Peril Die\nFull Color Die-cut Counters\nOver 220 game cards\nEnemy and Hero Record Sheets\nLarge Adventure Reference Cards\nCD Soundtrack\nMap Tiles\n8x Unique Room Map Tiles\n4x Standard Room Map Tiles\n6x Passage Map Tiles\n18x Map Tile End Caps\n6x Map Tile Gate End Caps\nMiniatures\n1x Law Man Hero\n1x Preacher Hero\n1x Indian Scout Hero\n1x Rancher Hero\n12x Hungry Dead\n6x Hell Bats\n6x Tentacles\n3x Slashers\n1x Harbinger\nIn the Optional Add-Ons Menu, we've just added a whole New Other World for players to explore! Learn more about Trederra in this new video:\nThe Miniatures\n    In Shadows of Brimstone, players name their heroes and give them personality, making choices along the way to tailor the character to their liking.  We wanted to be sure that the miniatures had the characterful detail to match!  We also know that many players will want to paint their figures.  Increasing the scale of the figures to the new industry standard for high quality, high detail, easily paintable miniatures was an obvious choice.  Our new Shadows of Brimstone figures are 35mm to the top of the head to match the scale of amazing figures from Games Workshop, Privateer Press, and others.\nWhy Kickstarter?\n    When we started working on Shadows of Brimstone several years ago, we knew that it had the potential to be a really big and fun project.  'Dungeon Crawl' style games live and breathe on variety; the more monster types you can fight, Heroes you can play as, map tiles you can explore, the better!  With that in mind, we knew we wanted to make an entire product range, not just a single, one-off board game.  So that is the approach we have taken throughout development - World building and designing all manner of characterful and unspeakable creatures and demons to terrorize the Heroes, and fantastic new worlds to encounter!  That being said, developing a full product line takes a lot of resources and a lot of time.  It\u2019s usually the kind of thing that you do over the course of several years.  In our case, we could have simply put a single basic core game through production and released it, then worked on it a bit here and there, releasing new expansions over time, slowly building on the world in the background as we continued releasing other new games and products.\n    But\u2026Kickstarter offers us the unique possibility to jump in with both feet, and get the support of the community to bring all of these cool and fun ideas to life straight out of the gate!  With this Kickstarter Campaign, you don\u2019t have to wait years to get amazing new content for this exciting Cooperative Adventure game!  It allows us to produce TWO stand alone Core Box Sets to start with instead of just one! To flesh out the product line with tons of great new monsters and creatures to roam the dark mines and pour through the shimmering portals into our world! And to dive into several fantastic Otherworlds to explore as your Old West Heroes step through those shimmering portals to another place and time!  It gives us the opportunity to create loads of different Hero Character Classes to play as, each with a unique feel and play-style and with multiple options for the figures you can use to represent them in the game!\nWith your help, we can redefine what a 'Dungeon Crawl' game can be with a fresh new Old West Horror setting, fun and streamlined mechanics, and infinite possibilities for adventures to unfold!\nHow Does the Game Play?\n     Shadows of Brimstone is a fully-cooperative, Dungeon Crawl adventure game!  That means that all of the players form a posse and are working together against the game itself, venturing down into the deadly mine shafts on different missions.  You may be searching for a local farmer\u2019s lost son, carried off in the night by demons, or you might be desperately trying to find a way to seal a portal to another world that creatures are pouring out of!\n1-4 Players (or up to 6 Players if combining both Core Box Sets) create their Heroes by selecting a Hero Class to play, such as the Gunslinger or Saloon Girl.  That Hero Class defines your basic character stats - how much Health and Sanity you have, how good you are at hitting enemies with your six shooter (or with a right hook), how good you are at solving puzzles or dodging falling boulders, etc.  It also defines your basic starting Gear - do you start with a Six Shooter, a Satchel of Dynamite, a Shotgun and Sheriff\u2019s Badge?  Also, any abilities that all characters of your Hero Class share (a Saloon Girl\u2019s Comforting Presence for example).  Each Hero also starts with a Random Personal Item that gives them a bit more \u2018character\u2019, and they get to choose one of three Special Upgrade Abilities unique to their Hero Class.  This gives players a chance to start guiding their Hero\u2019s development right from the outset!\nOnce your posse is ready to go, the players roll (or decide) what Mission they have taken on and the game begins!  Each Hero is represented by a figure on the game board and all of the figures are placed on the Mine Entrance Map Tile to start the game.  All of the Card Decks are shuffled, each Hero gets 1 Grit Token, and the Depth Track is setup with the Hero Party\u2019s marker on the entrance and the Darkness marker deep in the mines (at the opposite end of the track).\nAt the start of each turn, the Hero with the Old Lantern rolls 2 dice to Hold Back the Darkness!  This roll needs to be equal to or greater than the number listed on the current stage of the Depth Track.  If the roll is passed, the Heroes carry on without delay.  If the roll is failed, the Darkness moves one step up the track toward escaping the Mines!  But beware, if the Darkness marker ever reaches the entrance space on the Depth Track, it has escaped and the Heroes must flee, failing that mission.  As an added element of danger, if the Hold Back the Darkness roll is ever doubles (1-1, 3-3, etc), this instead triggers a random event from the Depth Event Chart equal to that number!\nHeroes now take their turn in order of Initiative, with the highest going first.  During a Hero\u2019s Activation, they roll a die and may move up to the amount rolled.  If a 1 is rolled, the Hero also recovers an extra Grit Token.  Grit Tokens are used for a number of things in game.  A Grit Token may be discarded to Re-roll any number of your dice just rolled (though no die may be Re-rolled more than once), or a Grit Token may be discarded to move an extra die roll worth of spaces during your Movement.  A Grit Token may also be used to activate certain powerful character abilities.\nAfter moving, the Hero may attack if there are any enemies on the board, or if they have ended their move in a space adjacent to a doorway (an open exit from the map tile you are on), you may look down the hall and draw a random Map Card to place the next Map Tile, connecting it to the doorway you are looking through.  Each time a new Map Tile is placed, you must also move the Hero Party\u2019s marker one step forward on the Depth Track, as the Hero Posse delves deeper into the Mines.  This is important because as the Heroes go deeper underground, it becomes harder and harder to Hold Back the Darkness (the number required to roll gets higher, the deeper the Hero Party has gone).\nNewly placed Map Tiles are always either a Room or a Passage.  Passage Tiles have open doorways on all ends and can often split the path in front of the Heroes.  They do not, however, contain Encounters for the Heroes to deal with.  Room Tiles, on the other hand, always come into play with an Exploration Token on them.  As long as there is an unrevealed Exploration Token on a Map Tile, Heroes may not look through Doorways on that Map Tile (you can\u2019t explore further than that room with the unrevealed token).  At the end of a full Hero Turn (after all Heroes have been Activated), if there are one or more Heroes in a Room with an Exploration Token, that token is revealed!\nWhen revealed, an Exploration Token tells whether the Heroes have been attacked or if they have come across one or more Encounters (needing to draw an Encounter card).  The token also has information for how many exits there are in the room and if any of those exits are actually open gateways to another world!  Exploration Tokens also sometimes have information on them related to finding clues toward completing your mission.\nEncounter cards will usually require one or more Heroes to take a Test using their Skills (such as Agility, Luck, Lore, etc) and will describe a situation that the Heroes have found themselves in.  Perhaps they have found the sight of a Massacre and must carefully pick their way through the gore, or they may have come across a lost prospector wandering the mines; will he help them, or does he hold dark secrets of his own?!\nWhen an Attack occurs, the Heroes must draw an Enemy card to see what they will face!  There are three Enemy Decks of increasing Threat Level (Green, Yellow, and Red).  The Hero Party generally draws a card from the Threat Level based on the number of Heroes in the Party (1-2 Heroes=Green, 3-4 Heroes=Yellow, and 5-6 Heroes=Red), though occasionally this will change based on what caused the attack or if you have found your Mission Objective!\nAt the start of an Attack, Enemies are placed on the board and will move and fight based on a simple set of guidelines.  Fights are handled in Initiative order, from highest to lowest, and Enemies always go first where Initiatives are tied.\nOnce all of the Enemies are defeated by the Heroes, each Hero is allowed to draw a Loot card for each Enemy Threat card that took part in the fight.  These Loot cards will give the Hero Money, shards of rare Dark Stone, or even let them draw a piece of useful Gear or a powerful Artifact.  Heroes also gain Experience for every Enemy they defeated (or for Wounds that they caused to larger Enemies) and the Heroes are allowed to Catch Their Breath, recovering a small amount of Health and/or Sanity.\nAny Heroes that are Knocked Out during the Fight, are not generally killed, but rather at the end of the Fight must roll on the Injury Chart (if Health 0) or on the Insanity Chart (if Sanity 0).  This usually recovers some amount of Health/Sanity for them, but they may have a longer lasting penalty for their injuries.  It also moves the Darkness marker up the Depth Track a bit.  If all of the Heroes are ever Knocked Out at the same time, the Mission is automatically failed!\nThe Mission the Heroes are currently on details what they need to do to complete their objective!  Often times, this simply requires the Heroes to find enough clues (through Exploration Tokens) to find the Objective Room and defeat a small horde of Enemies, rescue someone, or recover an occult artifact!\nWe will go into more detail on Fights, Enemies, and the Campaign system between adventures shortly.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an established game company, Flying Frog Productions has been around making high quality, fun games for the last six years (though we have been working on most of these games for well over a decade, and have been in the industry for over twenty years)!

There are always hurdles to overcome and challenges to face, especially in manufacturing, but this is something that we have experience in doing.\n\n Some new challenges that we have already encountered include the sheer volume of figures in the game, both as concepts as well as sculptures. For the first time we are integrating 3D Digital sculpting as well as traditional sculpting to create a fantastic line of figures that are both dynamic and versatile. This is a growing trend in the industry and the figures we already have going for Shadows of Brimstone are looking amazing! There is also a tremendous amount of artwork needed to create all of the extraordinarily detailed map tiles and passages, not only of the Old West Mine Shafts, but also for all of the exotic and wondrously alien Otherworlds that the Heroes can cross into! Each Otherworld has its own feel and depth to it, as well as its own themes, encounters, and its own terrifying enemies to face! The amount of material needed to bring all of these ideas to life is staggering, which is why we have already been hard at work on pre-production for Shadows of Brimstone for nearly three years.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Kickstarter campaign for Combat Armor Mecha will create a set of new, 1/285th-scale pewter mecha miniatures which appeal to wargamers and hobbyists alike. The models are designed to be played at 1/285th scale, resulting in a physical size of around 40-45mm tall. Some models may be shorter due to the particulars of the torso and leg assemblies.\nThe Combat Armor Mecha product line will make available two different kinds of miniature model: \"Combat Armors\" and \"Multi-Role Fighters.\"\nCOMBAT ARMOR \u2013 modular miniatures\nThe Combat Armors are designed with modular ball and socket style construction and universal joints, allowing you to mix and match heads, arms, legs, and accessories with whichever torso you choose. This modular approach to the models will allow you to create your own, unique mecha units. Some accessories may not fit every joint on every model (because certain combinations of heads and arms may interfere) but at the same time creative modelers will be free to devise new, unexpected combinations.\nMULTI-ROLE FIGHTERS \u2013 multiple forms, multiple models\nThe Multi-Role Fighters (MRFs) are a series of mecha models compatible with the most prevalent Mecha combat games of this time. An MRF has three distinct models, each representing one of the three modes that the mecha can be played in: Fighter Mode is based on modern and future aircraft; Mecha Mode is based on the awesome concept of giant fighting robots with a variety of weapons; Hybrid Mode is a mix of the two, combining some of the strengths of both.\nTalented artists are working on this project. The MRF-RT1 was designed by MSW, who brings an interesting and dynamic new style to your tabletop gaming. Most of the mecha in the product line are being designed by Benjamin Wright, whose designs have previously been published in the Mekton roleplaying game from R. Talsorian Games. His original mecha designs make for versatile and fun modeling projects. \nMRF-RT1 - $30\nSet of three models; one for each mode.\nCAM-1RA - $10\nComplete set of parts, plus weapons.\nAdd-Ons:\n$10: Additional CA \nAdd a single Combat Armor of your choice (which is currently unlocked) to your order.\n$30: Additonal MRF\nAdd any Multi-Role Fighter model (which is currently unlocked) to your order.\n$20: Parts Bag\nThis will give you a random mix of Combat Armor components. I'll take as many figures as I can, break up the parts, mix them up, and then grab the weight equivalent of two Combat Armors. This is random, meaning you may get a bunch of legs, or arms and weapons, or even just torsos (though that shouldn't happen, it might). It's a great way to ensure that you can make some unique mecha models. I won't accept requests for specific parts in a $20 Parts Bag, so please don't ask.\nWhat would a Kickstarter campaign be without Stretch Goals? If the base funding is exceeded more new models can be brought to light \u2014 models which wouldn't make it otherwise. There are many more MRFs and CAs waiting in the wings to be rolled out, as well as optional components that can be added in. There is also a series of alien mecha that can be brought out if we do really well. \n$5k EXPANSION GOAL: CAM-T1 ($10)\nComplete set of parts, plus weapons.\nIf this Kickstarter campaign raises $5,000 in funds, a new model will be unlocked and made available for sale. The CAM-T1 is a defensive unit with devastating long range weaponry. It is very useful on evenly-surfaced areas, where its treaded leg-base grants it superior stability and allows it to function well as a self-propelled mobile weapons platform.\nEven though the models in this product line are modular, components will not be split up beforehand and sold individually. (At least, not at first.) This means no ordering, for example, a CAM-1RA with the torso of a CAM-T1. At this point such custom parts ordering would be impractical. However, in the future the possibility of offering components separately should open up. The better this Kickstarter campaign does, the faster that will happen.\nIt's also important to note that if this Kickstarter effort is very successful, and a lot of stretch goals are met, shipping will likely be delayed. More funding will result in more models to produce, and more production takes more time. However, more models also means more goodies to buy and enjoy, so your patience will be well rewarded.\nFinally, a note on fulfillment: Order fulfillment will be done based on the models I have. Assuming I get the MRF-RT1 in first, orders consisting of just that unit will be shipped first. Then, as the other figures come into stock, I'll fulfill orders that use them. So if you order a little of everything, keep in mind that your order will probably be shipped later than one which consists of 10 copies of the models that were designed first... even if your order consists of less models. It's just an economic thing. This approach will improve total shipping time and get models into the hands of everyone as quickly as possible. I won't be able to provide shipping in waves (even if you pay for the extra shipping costs) because the shipping is being done solely by my wife and I; adding complexities to the shipping will make errors far more likely.\nThanks for understanding these potential issues. I'm trying to be upfront and honest, as I've participated in Kickstarters where these issues have been vague and confusing.

Provided we reach our funding goal. \nIt will substantially reduce our development risk. \nThe visual art style of Mutant Football League will be completely different than Football Heroes (MFL will be much grittier).\nThe game mechanics of Football Heroes is designed for casual fun. The AI in MFL game will be closer to Madden than Football Heroes. \nThis video of gameplay from Football Heroes is only a stepping stone of where we want to take the game (it\u2019s our first step). The Art Direction for MUTANT FOOTBALL LEAGUE WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT FROM FOOTBALL HEROES. It will be a much grittier art style.\nUpdate 3 \u2013 Team Spirit\nUpdate 2 - The Press Takes Notice!\nCheck us out in the October issue of Gameinformer!\n\"Sega Genesis fans no doubt remember EA\u2019s cult classic Mutant League Football, a title that blends well-crafted football game with macabre monsters, booby-trapped fields, a satirical sense of humor, and comic violence.  Released in 1993, the game offered an oddball take on the sport that drew in both fans of Madden and gamers who generally didn\u2019t play sports titles.\"                                        - Written by: Matt Helgeson\nThe October 2013 issue features an interview with Michael Mendheim\nJoin Gameinformer's, Andrew Reiner, Matt Helgeson, Kim Wallace, Ben Reeves and Jason Oestreicher in the Replay studio to watch them play a game of the original Mutant League Football.\nUpdate 1 - PC Version of the game\nAn all-star team of talent has been assembled to breathe new life into one of the video game industry\u2019s most beloved, and downright brutal, sports-hybrid genres. Michael Mendheim, the original creator and lead designer of the original Mutant League Football & Hockey, is driving the effort to resurrect this classic gaming genre with a brand new game, entitled Mutant Football League\u2122. With fan support, and a successful Kickstarter campaign, Mendheim is planning to release his Mutant Football League game on PC / Steam, Xbox LIVE, PSN, as well as on iOS and Android tablets.\nMy name is Michael Mendheim and I was the creator and lead designer for the original game, which I pitched to studio executives at Electronic Arts in late 1991. The game was released in 1993 and went on to become a #1 hit and was nominated for best sports game of the year by Jeff Gerstmann, Electronic Games and Gamepro magazines. \nMutant League also spawned a syndicated television series, a comic, a toy line and a sequel called, Mutant League Hockey. Then the game was suddenly cancelled and Mutant League was no more. \nWe want to create a new and very different game that pays homage to the original game.\nMutants take the field to battle it out in the most violent game ever played in this hilarious and brutal parody of professional Football. Mutant Football League pays homage to the classic Sega Genesis game by building a great playing action football game with deep strategy, creature customization, over-the-top violence and of course laugh-out-loud gross out humor.\nMutant Football League can be played as a single or multiplayer game online or off. You can choose which Mutant Football League team you wants to play as from a variety of teams with different characters, play styles, strengths and weaknesses. Once you decide you can either jump right into the savagery of the sport or you can customize the game to your own individual tastes (quarter lengths, brutality level, play modes, etc). You can also create your own team, your team colors, name and logo. You can pick the players on your team (species types and positions they play), give your players names, adjust their ratings and select your coach. Once teams and options are chosen, the carnage can begin. \nGame View:\nThe game is viewed from a Tecmo style camera angle to capture the look and feel of a real televised NFL Football game. The camera will dynamically zoom in or out based on the on field action. You\u2019ll be able to see all the action down the entire field or get up close to the bloody smears that used to be your team mate.\nPlay Modes:\nYou can either play a single exhibition game without worrying all the \u201cextras\u201d or you can enter into a Season Story Mode or Playoffs in a quest to ultimately win the Mutant Mayhem Bowl and bring home the beloved Monster Cup to your screaming fans.\nTeams and Characters:  \nMutant Football League will put you into an action packed sports game and will introduce you to some of the wildest, most bloodthirsty superstar players to ever strap on shoulder spikes. Races include: Mutants, Monsters, The Undead, Battlebots, Enforcers, and more!\nThere will be at least 30 vicious teams to choose from (some of these teams will be unlockable). The teams are split into two conferences: The Mutant Conference and the Monster Conference.\nOffense and Defense:\nThe game is played with eight (8) players on each side. A forfeit happens when one team cannot field a team of at least four (4) players or if they run out of Quarterbacks. Here\u2019s how positions break down on the field:\nForfeit: \nThe Offense must be able to put at least 2 blockers, 1 QB, at least 1 Runner (or Receiver) on the field. If it cannot meet this requirement it will forfeit.\nThe Defense must be able to field at least 4 players of any combination. \nPlaying Fields : \nThe game is on a standard football field \u2013 yet no two fields are the same. Each field will be \u201cpersonalized\u201d with obstacles and hazards to suit the playing style of the home team. Certain fields will have sidelines that are free and clear for cowardly receivers to run out of, others will be stacked high with barbed wire making running out of bounds to stop the clock impossible.\nScoring:\nThe object of the game is simple \u2013 either score more points than the opposition by the time the final war horn sounds or kill as many opposing players as you can so they forfeit! But remember, you still need to keep your own team and superstar players intact because you\u2019ll have to forfeit if you can\u2019t field a team of at least four Players.\nYou can score in a variety of ways \u2013 from the standard \u201cold-world\u201d touchdown, to the rare and spectacular \u201cClusterF#$@!!!\u201d play (which can be worth a total of fifteen points), to one of the many bizarre interpretations of the classic \u201cfield goal\u201d like my personal favorite \u2013 \u201cdrawing and quartering\u201d \u2013 with a screaming fan spectator strung up between the posts. \nDirty Tricks and Death:\nYou will also need to decide when to use the Dirty Trick Play, which will often inflict death and injuries on the opposition. Each player will have a Health Bar that appears underneath him when highlighted. As they take heavy hits, the combatants will start to tire. A player\u2019s Health Bar starts out full red and as his health is diminished, the red health will empty out to reveal black. When a player\u2019s health bar is almost completely black, he will be a prime candidate to get injured, lose an arm, or even get killed. If the health bar turns completely black, it\u2019s lights out for that player \u2013 he\u2019s deader than the free world economy. It is important to always keep a full roster so that players who are tired and beat up can be sat on the bench, where they can start to recharge their devastated health levels. Managing your stars and reserves is the key to being successful in the Mutant Football League. It\u2019s where the intellectual chess game is played and managing your resources well is what separates great strategic players from the rest of the crowd. When a player gets killed his body will remain on the field as a testament to his abilities until it rots away (usually a few plays later). While a body is on the field it is considered an obstacle (like a rock) and player need to avoid it or they will trip and fall over it.\nExperience and RPG Elements\nAs the players on the team gain more experience they earn points and these points can be used to upgrade players. Before or after each game you can upgrade individual ratings of your players so that they are better, faster, and stronger.\nRules of Engagement :\nThere are very few rules in the League and very few penalties given during a game. In fact, a team can often get more penalties for doing nothing if there is a dishonest referee than it can from slaughtering an entire team. Fights will often break out during games and will last until only one player is standing. Remember \u2013 punching, stomping, chopping, blowing up, or vivisecting a player will not get you ejected in this league \u2013 but it could earn you an MVP along with a lifetime contract. It\u2019s up to you to lead your team through a season of sacrifices (only some of which are for personal enjoyment) toward the ultimate championship game of the most vicious sport in the galaxy \u2013 The Mutant Mayhem Bowl! If you live, you will be drinking type O Negative from the Monster Cup and celebrating with the remains of your compatriots. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll still be there next season \u2013 as a permanent part of the astroturf! Oh and last thing, if you have a problem with the ref you can still kill him.\nHelp us design the game you want to play!!!\nYou can help us decide what kind of creatures, teams, weapons, fields, and obstacles will be in the final product. That\u2019s right, be part of the design team! There will be a private online design community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the development team. You can let us know your thoughts and feelings about the project and even vote on key design and marketing decisions such as weapon types, team & player names, dirty trick plays and the visual look of the characters.\nBlitzburgh Screamers All-Star Blitzer: Troll Palapain\nOur plan is to deliver you a fun and hilarious game in 14 to 18 months or die trying (seriously - we will do our best to get the game out on time but what's most important is to deliver you a great playing football game).\nBecause this game was loved and still is to this day and the fans deserve it.  Because no game publisher will take a risk on the idea after ten years of trying.  The only way this game is going to get made is if YOU HELP US MAKE IT HAPPEN!\n In return we\u2019ll put together an incredible team and give this project everything we have to deliver you a great playing football game with deep strategy, buckets of blood and plenty of off-the-wall moments that will make this game one of the most fun and memorable experiences you will ever have playing a  sports video game.  This is my promise to you... Now get out there and help us win one for the ripper!\nThis is the talent who are on board now. If this game becomes a reality because of your generosity, there will be more incredible talent joining us. Stay tuned and watch who gets unveiled in the coming days.\nMichael Mendheim will be Directing & Producing the project. He will personally oversee all aspects of game design.\nDave Devries will be working with Robomodo to define the visual art direction of the game including characters and stadiums. \nRobomodo will be helping to define the games art direction as well as create and produce art and visual effects assets for the game.\nDave Elliott will be working with us to create and define the Mutant Football League universe and it's characters.\nJay Lender will be co-writing the story of the game as well as helping shape the universe. Jay is also the guy making sure the game is going to make you laugh with tongue through-the-cheek gross out humor.\nMicah Wright will be co-writing the story and helping us drive game & character design. When Jay's joke's get stale, Micah takes over and keeps everything fresh (just kidding Jay).\nDetailed overview of all Mutant Football League Reward Packages.\nWe're just going to focus on hitting the main goal. We absolutely want to put the game across all next gen systems.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe project team behind this project has extensive experience in videogame design & development producing a magnitude of unique titles across different hardware platforms including, XBox 360, Playstation3, iOS and Android. We've learned from both our successes and failures on what to do and not to do. Going into this development, it is critically important to keep the product extremely focused and not implement too many different features. Our strategy is to deliver a fun and humorous game and then to gradually build on the engine and add more features it over time. Developing a Football game engine is very difficult and takes a lot of time. The core development leads have already developed numerous sports titles and understand the challenges they will face. As Creative Director and Producer of the project, Michael is hard at work building a small team of developers who have a wealth of experience engineering football and sports games and is in negotiations with several different companies concerning licensing an existing sports engine. Deals will be put in place and moved on, if our funding goals are reached. There is simply no better way to reduce development risk than to build the game on an existing and proven Football game engine.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Michael Mendheim\n2 created \u00b7 31 backed\nMichael Mendheim is an Executive Producer and Creative Director in the videogame industry.

MAI will foster collaboration between art, science, technology, and spirituality, bringing these fields into conversation with long durational work. MAI will provide an educational space to host workshops, lectures, residencies, and research.\n(Video directed and edited by Milica Zec)\nIf successful, this Kickstarter will cover the first phase of MAI's development: the design process. Your pledge will contribute to early MAI programming, office operations, and schematic designs of architectural elements, including building structure, lighting, acoustics, and AV. Given that MAI is the first of its kind, its early design phase demands an innovative approach. Leading this process are world-renowned architects Rem Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), whose unique vision will help MAI to create new ways for audiences and performers to interact.\nCurrent interior of 620 Columbia St., Hudson, NY\nIn total, $20 million is needed to complete renovations of the institute and begin operations. Marina has paid for phase zero of this development process. She purchased the building for $950,000 and donated it to the institute. She funded the budget of the MAI office for six months and commissioned the architectural concept. As of now, Marina has paid $1.5 million out of pocket towards the early stages of MAI. \nA single person, no matter how successful or passionate, cannot single-handedly fund and sustain a cultural institution of this size. She hopes that an equally passionate public will join her in contributing to phase one.\nWe aim to create a global community of collaborators and want you to be part of it. \nBy inviting the broader public to contribute to our early development, Kickstarter helps to affirm and build the engaged community necessary for sustaining MAI into the future. We have designed rewards that encourage backers to engage with time-based and immaterial works. With your contribution, you become a founder of the institute not only financially, but also conceptually, by partaking in the very experiences we hope to create.\nMarina with MAI Model \u00a9 OMA\nA primary aim of Kickstarter is also a major theme of Marina's forty-year career in performance art: to close the gap between artist and audience. Here, Marina and MAI can connect directly with the institute's future visitors, who can then share in the process of its creation.\nIf this initiative succeeds, backers will have helped to found both the largest cultural institution ever to get off the ground using Kickstarter, as well as the only project of its kind in the world.\nContributions to this project are 80% tax deductible due to MAI's non-profit 501(c)3 status.\nMarina Abramovic, The House With the Ocean View (2002). Duration: 12 days. Photo: Steven P. Harris, Courtesy Sean Kelly Gallery and Marina Abramovic Archives\nMarina Abramovic is a New York-based, Serbian-born performance artist who began her career in the early 1970s. Her four decades of work explore the relationship between performer and audience, the limits of the body, and the possibilities of the mind. During her most recent performance, \"The Artist Is Present\" (2010), Marina sat motionless in MoMA\u2019s atrium, offering her gaze to anyone willing to sit across from her. Over the course of three months, she stared into the eyes of more than 1,500 visitors.\n(Video directed and edited by Milica Zec)\nIt was during this 736-hour performance that Marina became aware of the public\u2019s immense desire to slow down and connect to themselves and to one another in a live setting. Long durational works facilitate this type of connection, but currently there is no space solely dedicated to them. MAI will be this space. \n(Video directed and edited by Noah Blumenson-Cook)\nMAI will be a platform for long durational work. A long durational work is any work (of performance art, dance, theater, film, music, opera, and others) whose performance exceeds six hours. The history of long durational works is varied and rich. Click here to read about some extraordinary works, including Christian Marclay's The Clock (24 hours), John Lennon and Yoko Ono's Bed-In (168 hours), John Cage's Organ2/ASLSP (As Slow aS Possible) (639 years), Michael Siffre's Biological Clock Experiments (5670 hours), Mata Amritanandamayi's hugs (32 million hugged), and Tehching Hsieh's One Year Performance series (1978-1999).\nIn order to fulfill its mission, MAI will:\nInvite artists to propose, present, and premiere long durational works of performance art, dance, theater, film, music, opera, and more. \nProvide space and other resources for art and science residencies to develop new and collaborative long durational projects. \nHost lectures, workshops, community outreach initiatives, public programs, and continuing education classes, as well as an extended library of time-based and immaterial works. \nInvite visitors to participate in the Abramovic Method, which will prepare them to experience long durational work.\n\n\n(Drawing by Cassandra Long)\nMarina will personally thank all those who contribute to the creation of MAI by hugging every backer of this Kickstarter at a live event called THE EMBRACE. This event will be held in two undisclosed locations, one in New York City and one in Europe, with exact dates and times to be announced. MAI Founders who are unable to attend these events will be offered a special reward in lieu of a hug from Marina.\nDigital MAI 8-bit Videogame by Pippin Barr\nPippin Barr is a video game designer who created the viral \"The Artist Is Present\" 8-bit video game. He\u2019s teamed up with us to create a game that serves as a digital tour of the institute as well as an entertaining and challenging experience. At this level, you'll receive early access to the digital institute, as well as three Abramovic Method games: rice counting exercise, stepping on grass, and complaining to a tree. To read a review of these games from Dirty Mag, click here. To play the entrance to digital MAI, click here! \n(Drawing by Cassandra Long)\nMarina will teach the Abramovic Method water drinking exercise via exclusive live stream. You, Marina, and the other backers at this level will then perform this exercise simultaneously. You may document your performance in any way you choose and opt to include this documentation in MAI digital archives! The goal of this reward is to create a large performance of slow, conscious water drinking that encourages both participants and passersby to slow down and exist more fully in the present.\n(Video directed by Noah Blumenson-Cook with music by Tristan Allen)\nThe Abramovic Method trains audience members with the skills to observe and perform long durational works. Through a series of exercises, participants are encouraged to become more aware of their mental and physical experiences in the current moment, increasing ability to feel their own presence and make empathic connection to others. These exercises come from a belief that everyone can benefit from being more present with themselves and others. Over the course of Marina's career, she has dedicated herself to creating and experimenting with these exercises, and institute is an environment where others can experiment as well. \n(Still from rice counting exercise animation created by Arianna Vairo)\n\nWe have partnered with a number of artists and collaborators to create a beautiful Kickstarter-exclusive DVD that includes the following: a series of short films of Marina demonstrating the exercises in nature, an animation of the rice counting exercise, five Abramovic Method games: rice counting exercise, stepping on grass, complaining to a tree, looking at the colors, and stopping the anger (created by Pippin Barr), rare workshop images from the archives, and a few special surprises.

If you back at this level, you\u2019ll receive pre-registration for a ride in the compatibility racer (a project by Lauren Silbert, Jennifer Silbert, Suzanne Dikker, Matthias Oostrik, and Oliver Hess). On top of that, you'll receive a package of digital materials that includes: long media clips of Marina\u2019s brain activity while performing in Measuring the Magic of Mutual Gaze (by Suzanne Dikker and Matthias Oostrik), scans of journals handwritten by Marina and other participants during the experiment, and a few neuroscience-related surprises!\nNote: The compatibility racer is currently a traveling installation. This reward pre-registers you for a ride in the compatibility racer at an as-yet undetermined location.

The traveling MAI Prototype and one-off events are no substitute for having a fully operational arts center. We face losing momentum for the project during the two years it will take to renovate and build the institute. We risk losing your patience while we wait to move into our home, but the mission is alive and active. \n\nTo keep MAI\u2019s heart beating while the architects, contractors, and construction crews work toward completing the building, there are plans for community outreach projects in Hudson, public long durational performances such as marathon readings and forums for supporters and critics alike to discuss the project as it evolves. Your feedback is more valuable than you know. Ongoing dialogue is a crucial part of the development of MAI.\n\nWell before construction is complete, Marina and a distinguished curatorial team will use their expertise to shape the highest quality of exhibition and program offerings. We hope to invite artists across disciplines present to and premiere long durational works. We have already reached out or plan to reach out to a variety of artists, including but not limited to Damien Jalet, Sidi Larbi, Lynsey Peisinger, Rebecca Davis, Paula Garcia, Ragnar Kjartansson, Leandro Erlich, Maria Jose Arjona, Davide Balliano, Nico Vascellari, and Lotte and Till Steinbrenner. MAI will also establish educational partnerships to expand the institute\u2019s potential.\n\nWith experimental art comes yet unknown logistical restrictions. As plans for the building are in development, MAI and OMA are working closely to design and build a facility that will establish a number of flexible layouts for performance and rehearsal spaces, giving artists the greatest possible freedom to produce groundbreaking new work. \n\nMAI is located in a small town, which limits access, and not everyone who wants to visit the institute will be able to. Paying for a train ticket, a flight if necessary, even the admission fee alone, may be unfeasible for some. To enable the most visitors to experience MAI firsthand, we aim to develop programs such as the following: \n- A membership program with discounts and exclusive offers. \n- Designated hours when MAI will not charge admission. \n- Working with local businesses and partnering with well-established institutions to implement programs which offset the cost of travel to and within Hudson. \n- Sponsoring visitors based on need and merit through grants and stipends whenever possible.\n\nMAI, a very small team, is also in the midst of a flurry of activity. Seeking government and foundation support, planning quality programming and exhibitions that are in line with our mission, expanding our audience, specifically youth audiences and those with less exposure to performance art, are just a few of our ongoing initiatives. \n\nWe ask for your patience while we personally handle reward fulfillment and deeply appreciate your support of for this project.

The premium at this level will be special hands for everyone from the $15 level and above. Hope we make it!]\nThe Final Thrust...\nI am a little overwhelmed... and very pleased. Iron Mask Miniatures has now exceeded its goal and is well on its way toward the $12,000 mark! Now we are down to the last six hours. The Europeans have gone to bed and the Aussies are just starting their work week, but North America is just entering prime time. Now is the time for one last push, with the stretch-goal bonus figure of Jussac the Ogre Captain hanging in the balance.\nEveryone who pledges now at the $59 level and above will receive five bonus figures: the Limited-Edition Dwarf in the Iron Mask, the King, the Cardinal, M Roquefort, and Milady de l\u2019Elfe. And if we reach $12,000, you will also receive Jussac. You can see the concept art for these figures below.\nThanks to everyone who has pledged so far. Please spread the word for this one last thrust.\n-g\nOnce more unto the breach, dear friends, once more...\nThank you. Thank you, everybody, for putting Iron Mask Miniatures past our goal. Your response has been terrific. I am delighted that nearly all of you will get the Dwarf in the Iron Mask limited-edition figure. I am equally delighted that most of you will also receive the amoral, scheming, dangerous Cardinal.\nThank you once more for your interest and support.\nAll for one and one for all\nWe are now 80% funded with four days to go, so this is a good time to sweeten the pot. And what better way than with free figures? These bonus figures should be ready to ship in December of this year.\nThe Dwarf in the Iron Mask Limited-Edition Figure\nIf we reach our funding goal, everyone who pledged $30 and higher will receive the limited-edition Dwarf in the Iron Mask figure.\nThe Dwarf in the Iron Mask will be limited to a production run of 200 copies. For Kickstarter backers only, each figure will be packaged with a card-sized reproduction of the Dwarf in the Iron Mask concept art, individually numbered and signed by the artist, Colin Upton. The number you get will depend on the order in which your pledge was received.\nThis limited-edition figure will have an integral head and separate hands including empty hands (good for prisoners) and sword and dagger (good for prisoners who are tired of being victims). As an additional bonus, he will come with two prototypes from the set of special hands planned for a February 2014 release: a right hand holding a hand crossbow (this one for you, Helen) and a left hand holding a lantern (and this one for you, Daniel). These hands, of course, are interchangeable with any of the first-release dwarf duelist hands.\nLimited-Time  Bonus: The Dwarf Cardinal\nIf the project is fully funded before Saturday, 3 August, everyone at the $59 pledge level and higher will also get the Dwarf Cardinal. This single-piece casting bestows a blessing with his left hand while, behind his back, he crosses the fingers of his right hand.\nAnd, of course, you will receive the limited-edition Dwarf in the Iron Mask as well.\nSpread the word.\nThe Story\nThe archetypal cassocks, plumed cavalier hats, and broad-topped boots of the King\u2019s Musketeers are synonymous with adventure, intrigue, and swashbuckling derring-do. But the deeds of the Dwarf Musketeers in the King\u2019s service have been long neglected. The mission of Iron Mask Miniatures is to correct this historical oversight. The Dwarf Musketeers are here!\nWhen not on duty protecting the King, these fearless fighters eagerly serve as duelists or pistoliers in your fantasy miniatures army. You can recruit them as heroes, hirelings, or life-saving NPCs in your RPG adventure. As avatars in your dungeon-crawling expedition, they are the equal to any human, elf, or Cardinal\u2019s Guard Ogre.\nThe money from your pledge will cover sculpting fees and production costs for the first release of the Iron Mask Miniatures range.\nThese are wonderful figures, full of character and delightfully animated. They are brought to life by the exceptional talents of sculptor John Pickford and cast in white metal with bottom tabs. This makes them decidedly old-school, compatible in size and heft to the classic 28mm-scale dwarves of the \u201880s and \u201890s. Each dwarf is 24-26mm from boot soles to top of head. The Cardinal\u2019s Guard Ogres will be in the 34-36mm range.\nYou can find out more about the background of this project (and lots more pictures) on the Iron Mask Miniatures blog.\nFirst Release\nThe first release of the Iron Mask Miniatures Dwarf Musketeers consists of four dwarf duelist bodies with interchangeable heads and hands. The poses were inspired by 17th Century dueling styles (and not a little influenced by Richard Lester's Three Musketeers films of the 1970s).\nSeparate heads and hands are not unique, but these have some noteworthy elements.The fit of the head to the neck is accomplished through a kind of ball-joint fitting. This lets the head rotate and tilt so you can animate the figure in realistic and expressive ways. No pinning is needed. There are two sets of heads. The first set has cavalier hats with turned-up brims and generous plumes.\nThe second set includes a wide-brimmed hat, a flat cap, a bonnet, and a head scarf.\nThe hands are wearing dueling gauntlets, with the cuffs hollowed to fit over the forearm. You can change the pose and attitude of the figure by rotating the hand on the forearm. What\u2019s more, the hollow cuff makes for a robust attachment, again without pinning. There are currently over 30 finished hands holding rapiers, daggers, and pistols.\nThe rapiers are to scale and sculpted with great detail. There are four types of hilt: cup guard, sail guard, mortuary guard, and swept hilt. For each hilt type, hands hold the blades at different angles. Rotating the gauntlet on the forearm gives you numerous authentic dueling positions.\nThe daggers have the same variety of hilts and, like the swords, are held in different positions.\n(Note also the left- and right-hand flintock pistols.)\nFinally, for grappling with an opponent, brawling in a tavern, or simply showing a little attitude, there is a set of empty hands: left and right open hands, fists, and pointing.\nThe combined effect of these elements is a virtually limitless variety of credible, dynamic, and animated poses.\nLimited Edition Figures\nAt the beginning of this project, two figures were commissioned to test the concept and validate the production process. One figure was sculpted with a separate head. The other has an integral head with a more traditional \"dwarfy\" beard.\nThese figures will be available as limited-edition premiums through this Kickstarter offering at the $60 level and above. They will not go into general production. Since there will be no production molds for these figures, they will be available only as long as the master mold lasts.\nThe hands for these figures (four left and four right) have cinquedea swords and daggers.\nThese 15th Century Italian dueling weapons are perfect for those who favor a more traditional-looking weapon for their King\u2019s Guard.\nOf course, the limited edition figures are fully compatible with the components sculpted for the first release. The figures below are modeled with hands and head from the first release.\nCardinal's Guard Ogres\nThe Dwarf Musketeers\u2019 traditional rivals are the Cardinal\u2019s Guard, the most dangerous of whom are the Cardinal\u2019s Guard Ogres. There are four different ogre duelist bodies. Here is a view of the completed greens:\nThe Iron Mask Miniatures Cardinal's Guard Ogres are 34-36mm from soles to top of head, making them more compatible with the classic ogres of the '80s and '90s than with their modern counterparts. Like the Dwarf Musketeers, they are designed with separate heads and hands. Ogres, regrettably, do not have much in the way of necks, so head positions are somewhat limited. Still, there is a great variety of modeling possibilities. Ogre weapons include rapiers, daggers, and dragons (short-form blunderbuss pistols). There is also a halberd suitable for Ogres standing sentry duty outside the Cardinal\u2019s chambers.\nThese assembled examples are held together with Blue-Tac, but they give an idea of the modeling possibilities:\nThere are more photos on the Iron Mask Miniatures blog.\nGrand Chapeaux\nGrands Chapeaux is a set of skirmish rules suitable for buckling swashes and resolving duels involving your Dwarf Musketeers. The straightforward, quick-play game mechanics were inspired by David Love's Chusingura, a samurai skirmish game that has been very popular at local conventions for many years. The rules are short (6 pages) and without frills, but they work and are fun. PDF versions are offered at nearly all of the pledge levels. Grands Chapeaux will not only get your figures into action, but will also give you a chance to actually use those little boxed sets of gaming dice you have acquired over the years. You know the ones: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 in a tidy plastic box. Duels and swashbuckling acrobatics are handled easily and efficiently without the need for record keeping.\nAdd-Ons\nYou can purchase extra sets of the multipart Dwarf Musketeers as add-ons.\nBodies 1 is the first-release set of four Dwarf Musketeers with separate heads and hands:\nA generous supply of hands will be included but you will need to specify which set of heads you want to go with each set of bodies.\nHeads 1 is a set of four heads with plumed cavalier hats:\nHeads 2 is a set of four heads with assorted hats:\nHow to Get Some Extra Dwarf Musketeers\nIf your pledge level already includes a set of Dwarf Musketeers, you can purchase additional sets of Bodies 1 as add-ons. All you have to do is increase your pledge by $24 per set. No additional postage is required. At the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you will be contacted for details on your extra purchases, at which time you can specify Heads 1 (separate heads with cavalier hats) or Heads 2 (separate heads with assorted hats). Additional hands will be supplied as needed.\nBeardy Add-Ons\nHe that hath a beard is more than a youth...\nSeveral of you have remarked that the Iron Mask Dwarf Musketeers lack long hair and beards. There is a practical reason for this. With the separate-head system, long hair and full beards would restrict the articulation of the head. Also, unless the hair and beard are sculpted with the figure, they do not properly conform to the costume nor flow with the pose.\nBut excuses do not satisfy the true dwarf traditionalist. Dwarves need beards. Even Musketeer Dwarves need beards. Without beards, they are less than beardlings.\nAware of this inevitable affront to the traditionalists, we commissioned bearded versions of the first-release dwarves. These conversions are based on two each of the four available bodies and one each of the eight available heads. The result is eight bodies (two sets of four each) with integral heads and proper dwarfy hair and full beard. You give up the chance to articulate the head, but, hey, you get beards! These two sets of figures are available as add-ons.\nBodies 2\nThe first set, Bodies 2, wears plumed cavalier hats with turned-up brims.\nNote that the three figures on the left conform to 17 C fashion by sporting wigs with the latest in gentledwarf hair treatments. Here are some assembled and primered examples that show better detail:\nBodies 3\nThe next set, Bodies 3, features the flat-brimmed hat, flat cap, bonnet, and head scarf.\nPainted Beardies\nHere are some examples I painted as Cardinal\u2019s Guard (insert obligatory apology for my painting here):\nHow to Get Some Beardy Dwarf Musketeers\nBackers at the $30 level and above can purchase Bodies 2 (integral heads; beards with cavalier hats) or Bodies 3 (integral heads; beards with assorted hats) as add-ons. All you have to do is increase your pledge by $24 per set. No additional postage is required. At the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you will be contacted for details on your extra purchases. Additional hands will be supplied as needed.\nAlternatively, backers at the $30 level and above may exchange their separate-head sets for their beardy counterparts. You need do nothing at this time. At the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you will have the chance to provide the details of your exchange.\nOgre Add-Ons\nThe Cardinal's Guard Ogres will be available as add-ons, either as individual figures or in sets of four.\nIf you want to add only one or two ogres, you must identify the combination of heads and bodies that you want. Identifying the components for an individual ogre is simple.There are four ogre bodies numbered 1 through 4:\nAnd there are four ogre heads lettered A through D:\nTo specify the head-body combination you want, use the number for the body followed by the letter for the head. If you want Ogre Body 2 with Ogre Head B, specify Ogre 2B. If you want Ogre Body 1 with Ogre Head C, specify Ogre 1C.\nAs for hands, with each individual ogre you will receive a rapier, dagger, and a couple of additional hands. If you have special requirements regarding hands, I will try to accommodate them, but remember that you are already getting a complete set of ogre hands with each set of four ogres, so you will have extras.\nOne last word about the individual ogres... Be advised that the hand with halberd is not an easy fit for Ogre 3 (the stooping ogre) because his knuckles are nearly dragging. Still, a practised modeler should be able to make it work with some creative trimming or basing.\nHow to Get Some Extra Ogres\nIf your pledge level already includes a set of Cardinal's Guard Ogres, you can purchase additional ogres as individual figures or in sets of four as add-ons. All you have to do is increase your pledge by $11 for each individual ogre or $40 for each set of four. No additional postage is required. At the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you will be contacted for details on your extra purchases, at which time you can specify your wants. Additional hands will be supplied as needed.\nStretch Goals\nThese bonus figures complete the \"Three Musketeers\" theme. How many bonus figures you get depends on your pledge level as well as the success of the funding. If all of the stretch goals are realized, everyone from the $15 pledge level and up (essentially, any one whose premium includes at least one miniature) will get at least one free figure and some small extras included with their premium. Please note the expected delivery date for each figure. If you want to have your figures sent to you as they become available, there may be additional postage costs.\nThe King -- Milestone Reached!\nAs of 3 August, we reached $9,000. Everyone at the $59 pledge level and above will receive a Dwarf King figure.\nThe King is not the bumbling fool many think, but he is trapped by court intrigue and restrained by the machinery of government. He is proud of his Musketeers and sees himself as a foil to the Cardinal. At the same time, he depends on the Cardinal to ensure the smooth running of the government.\nEstimated delivery date: December 2013.\nM. Roquefort -- Milestone Reached!\nAs of 4 August, we reached $10,000. Everyone at the $59 pledge level and above will receive a M Roquefort figure.\nThe vaguely rat-like M Roquefort (so named because of his predilection for pungent cheese) is the Cardinal\u2019s most trusted human agent. He serves as the conduit of intrigue between the Cardinal and any unseemly but useful elements his Eminence cannot deal with directly. A superb duelist, he is the Cardinal\u2019s chief assassin. When required, he calls upon his conspicuously rat-like minions to do his bidding. No one knows where and how the vaguely rat-like Roquefort finds his conspicuously rat-like minions; no one knows where or when they will appear. But then, that is the nature of conspicuously rat-like minions.\nEstimated delivery date: December 2013.\nMilady -- Milestone Reached!\nAs of  7:00 PM EDT on 4 August, we reached$11,000. Everyone at the $59 pledge level and above will receive a Milady figure.\nShe was born of the union between a wandering Dwarf and an outcast Elf maiden. Raised by her father\u2019s people, Milady de l\u2019elfe grew up shunned by both worlds, surviving by stealth, cunning, and ruthlessness. Her pain was her strength. It was only natural that the Cardinal would perceive her talents and turn her resentment to his own ends. Her ability to walk freely in the dwarven courts, coupled with her ties to the darker side of Elfdom, make her the consummate agent for the Cardinal.\nEstimated delivery date: February 2014.\nJussac\nIf we reach $12,000, everyone at the $59 pledge level and above will receive a Jussac figure.\nLike the King\u2019s Musketeers, the Cardinal\u2019s Guard is known for recruiting the best swordsmen that can be found. The deadliest of these are the ogres. (Ogres also serve in the King\u2019s Musketeers, but that\u2019s another story.) It is true that ogres generally are not cut out to be duelists. They are slow, clumsy, and their peripheral vision is somewhat restricted by their unfortunate lack of neck. However, their ability to absorb wounds -- their staying power -- makes up for what they lack in agility and speed. And though they fall short of the mark as duelists, they will happily club any opponent in submission with their somewhat over-size rapiers. Occasionally, an ogre rises above the common run to a level of skill and service rarely seen among their kind. Jussac is one such ogre. His skill with the blade had made his name a watchword for sudden death. But for all that, he is an ogre of honor. And, as you can no doubt perceived, he is also an ogre of fashion, and having reached the rank of Captain tends to favor court dress in the latest style.\nEstimated delivery date: February 2014.\nSpecial Hands\nIf we reach $13,000, everyone whose pledge premium includes at least one Musketeer Dwarf ($15 pledge level and above) above will receive a selection of special dwarf duelist hands. Everyone who pledged at the $60 and above will receive a full set of special hands.\nEmpty hands, rapiers, daggers, and pistols are all well and good, but for some scenarios you might want to accent the personality or enhance the activity of your dwarf duelists. These hands will help you develop the personality of your dwarf duelists. They are designed to provide some alternate (and unusual) weapons as well as objects such as hat, tankard, handkerchief, etc., that add interest to your figures, games, and vignettes.\nThe special hands will include right hands holding goblet, grenade, bottle, and hand crossbow, and left hands holding hat, lantern, scroll, handkerchief, and tankard.\nEstimated delivery date: February 2014.\nDartleby Onion\nIf we reach $14,000, everyone at the $30 pledge level and above will receive a Dart Onion figure.\nDartleby Onion is an exceptional halfling. Since his youth, he has worshipped the King\u2019s Musketeers and aspired to join their ranks. Young Dart practiced with rapier and dagger until no other halfling would or could stand against him. He adopted the cavalier dress of his heroes, a fashionable, plumed hat and -- to the everlasting shame of his family and neighbors -- broad-topped boots. True, his feet required rather large boots, but that did not deter him. As soon as he was able, he left the quiet village of Pigstead-on-Dibble and set out for the great city, determined to earn his place in the ranks of the King\u2019s Musketeers. Of late, he has become close to Constance, the Queen\u2019s seamstress.\nEstimated delivery date: Summer 2014.\nPlanchet\nIf we reach $15,000, everyone at the $15 pledge level and above will receive a Planchet figure. After all, every duelist needs a servant and good help is hard to find.\nWhen he arrived in the great city, Dart Onion was persuaded to hire a man-servant. Well, a hobbit-servant, actually. His name was Planchet, a street-wise halfling who was familiar with every tavern, bakery, wine shop, inn, smoke house, tea house, ale house, grog shop, and street vendor (particularly food vendors) in the city. As some might suspect, after serving his master, his greatest pleasures are food and drink. Always accommodating and good-natured, his cheerful demeanor belies his exceptional skill with pistol, musket, and cutlass. And what is just as useful to the aspiring hero, he was an exceptional thief... er, forager as well.\nEstimated delivery date: Summer 2014.\nThe Queen\nIf we reach $16,000, everyone at the $60 pledge level and above will receive a Dwarf Queen figure.\nThe long-suffering Queen is devoted to her husband, terrified of the Cardinal, and not above a fair amount of intrigue of her own. Outside of the ladies of her household, she is never sure whom to trust, but she knows that the valiant Musketeers are loyal to her husband. She counts on them to defend her and her husband against the Cardinal\u2019s machinations.\nEstimated delivery date: Summer 2014.\nConstance\nIf we reach $17,000, everyone at the $60 pledge level and above will receive a Constance figure.\nThough she is only a low-born seamstress, the halfling maid Constance is one of the Queen\u2019s most trusted confidants. She is loyal to her mistress and is perfectly placed to aid Her Majesty\u2019s intrigues. She has free access to the Queen\u2019s chambers, while her humble station lets her move unnoticed to and from Court. She often serves as the Queen\u2019s messenger, and because she is a close friend of Dart Onion, she can, through him, call upon the Musketeers when the Queen is in danger.\nEstimated delivery date: Summer 2014.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no serious risks. Two proof-of-concept figures verified production procedures and tested the separate-component system. The master molds for the first release of Dwarf Musketeers are finished. Precasts have been checked for quality and samples have been assembled and painted. Greens for the Cardinal\u2019s Guard Ogres are complete and in for master molding.

They aren't as strong as sword ninja, but are deadlier than unarmed and they go first in combat.\nMaster Ninja\nUnarmed ninja can be upgraded into master ninja, but each clan can only have one master ninja on the board at a time. The master ninja attacks in all phases of combat, essentially acting as a shuriken, sword, and unarmed ninja combined.\nThe Clan Cards\nEach player takes control of a unique clan, represented by the clan card.\nEach clan has a powerful special ability unique to that clan. The clan cards also track the number of ninja that can be moved each action, and how many spaces they can move. Finally, the corner of the clan card acts as a reminder of the possible actions that can be taken on a turn.\nMission & Hour of Night Cards\nShuriken uses two decks of cards.\nHour of Night: There are 20 Hour of Night cards, from which 8 cards are randomly drawn to build the Hour of Night Deck for any given game.\nThe Hour of Night cards bring a unique effect to each round of the game that affects all players. The deck also acts as the timer for the game, and games can be made longer or shorter by changing the size of the Hour of Night Deck.\nMission Cards: each player has a hand of Mission Cards that represent missions that ninja clan can choose to complete to gain access to their techniques.\nTechniques from missions can improve ninja movement, combat, or provide special one-time bonuses. Some techniques also provide victory points that can be cashed in at the end of the game.\nDice & Counters\nShuriken uses custom 6-sided dice to resolve combat, and the game comes with 10 of these dice. In addition the game includes counters that are used on the clan cards to track the number of ninja that can move and how far they can move. These counters are also used to track damage to the gameboard tiles.\nIf you want to know it all, you can download the Shuriken rules in pdf format.\nShuriken uses an action mechanic to determine what players may do on their turn. On each turn players may choose to spend their 3 actions on:\nBringing more ninja onto the board\nMoving ninja\nUpgrading unarmed ninja into a different type\nInitiating combat against another clan\nCombat is quick and simple: all of the ninja on any one gameboard tile participate \u2014 there is no counting spaces or determining who is adjacent to whom. These are ninja after all: they fly through the air, leap off walls, and throw weapons through windows. Combat is resolved by rolling one custom Shuriken die per ninja participating, and each hit represents a casualty.\nCombat occurs over three phases: shuriken, sword, then unarmed -- and casualties are removed after each phase. After the three phases combat is done, even if there are still ninja standing.\nThe destroyable game board, with art by Cyril van der Haegen\nThe gameboard is modular and each tile has a special ability that influences the ninja on that tile. Tiles can be damaged in the course of combat, and after taking too much damage the tile is flipped over to the destroyed side, wiping out all ninja on the tile and losing its special ability... and some destroyed tiles have other, negative effects.\nYou can see a sample game in action in our first gameplay video:\nModular & Customizable\nThe modular nature of the gameboard and the timer mechanic of the Hour of Night deck makes Shuriken a very customizable game.\nYou can change the length of the game by adding or removing Hour of Night cards, and you can change the level of interaction by removing board tiles (and, in fact, games with fewer players use fewer tiles).\nThis design also lends itself very well to scenarios, with unique board configurations, variant rules, team play, and special victory conditions.\nPlaytested\nShuriken has been thoroughly playtested in-house with various groups, and was sent out for blind playtesting to volunteers from BoardGameGeek. In addition to helping us refine and improve the game and the rules, we received fantastic reviews from our blind playtest groups -- here's what some of them had to say:\n\"On the surface there is a game with a great theme and artwork that appeals to me. The game is easy to teach and simple to play. That said, when you actually look in depth and play the game you see that the game has intricate interactions. This is sort of like the game Go where the rules are quick and easy but the game is by no means simple or easy. There is a lot in Shuriken when you examine the game.\"\n\"Shuriken is a streamlined game with a theme that makes it intuitive to grasp what is going on.The list of actions available is clear and concise, and took no time for my group to pick up. And the action on the board brought onlookers around throughout our gameplay. Seeing minis flying across the board, and then destroying the map as they went, was very cinematic, and we spent quite a bit of time laughing and making ninja-related jokes.\"\nFor more opinions:\nBGG reviews thread.\nFather Geek Shuriken Review\nPurple Pawn Review\nSuperfly Circus Review (language)\nCanadian Shipping Note: For shipping to Canada, just add $30 to the level you want to pledge. Canadian orders do not need to use the International shipping checkbox.\nWe have tried to keep the Shuriken rewards directly related to the game itself, and we think we have some sweet options for gamers who love their games:\nShuriken: the obvious key reward level gets you a copy of the Shuriken board game, which we think will have a SRP of $80 US. The game ships free to the US, and overseas you gotta pay the difference in shipping (which is a lot).\nBag o' Ninja is a bag of 100 (black) plastic ninja. This will contain ninja of all four sculpts (unarmed, sword, shuriken, and master) in the same proportions as the game (thus you'll get lots of unarmed, and very few masters).\nWe are working on a scenario for Shuriken that incorporates the Bag o' Ninja with the existing black ninja in the game to pit 150 ninja against the combined efforts of the four other players.\nExtra Dice: Shuriken comes with 10 custom dice, which are plenty sufficient to play the game. But as all gamers know, you can always use more dice. The extra dice will let you park 10 dice on each side of the table, and you won't have to pass the dice from player to player when large numbers of ninja are fighting each other.\nShuriken Dice Bag: this is a custom leather dice bag with the kanji for \"Shuriken\" hot foil stamped into the leather. It looks and feels awesome. This dice bag can easily hold your shuriken dice and/or damage counters.\nAlternatively, higher reward levels allow you to get a full set of these bags, and you can use them to store each players' ninja. The reward level for one dice bag will get the Shuriken kanji in red; the reward level for all 5 will have the kanji stamped in a different color for each color of ninja.\nShuriken 6-Packs: these reward levels do not offer any addition discount on the game, but allow international gamers to team up to save money on shipping (shipping overseas is crazy expensive -- see the FAQ). This is the best way to get the game internationally: team up with 5 friends and pay radically less shipping each.\nWe have a bunch of awesome stretch goals lined up for Shuriken, and we're slowly revealing them.\nTemple of the Oni Scenario Pack: Stretch Goal Achieved! We are adding the new tile, Temple of the Oni, and we're making 3 Hour of Night cards exclusive to Kickstarter backers. Any backer level that receives the base game now gets these stretch goal rewards!\nThe Temple of the Oni scenario allows players to use the Bag o' Ninja from the backer rewards to pit four players against the powerful Oni-corrupted ninja clan of 150 black ninja!\nEmperor of the Mountain Scenario Pack: Stretch Goal Achieved! We are now adding a new scenario, with the new tile, Mount Fuji, and we're making 3 more Hour of Night cards exclusive to Kickstarter backers. Any backer level that receives the base game now gets these stretch goal rewards.\nThe Emperor of the Mountain scenario puts Mount Fuji in the center of the board, an ancient and powerful tile that grants additional victory points each round to the Clan with the most ninja on the tile, creating a game-changing central battleplain in additional to all the other elements of Shuriken.\nAdditional Stretch Goals will be revealed as we get closer to funding.\nThe Shuriken Kickstarter is being run by Awesome Enterprise, which also runs the Awesome Dice store. The Kickstarter is being managed directly by Awesome Enterprise co-founder Brian Wood, who is writing these words.\nShuriken was created by Jon Cazares and Brian Wood, with board art by Cyril van der Haegen.\nJon Cazares is probably best known in gaming circles for his running of the GenCon Cthulhu Masters tournament and the Novos Ordo Seclorum tournament. Jon is a lifelong gamer and lover of all games, and whose Heroscape boards are works of art.\nBrian Wood, known in some circles as Frostheim from Warcraft Hunters Union, worked as the Director of Sales & Marketing for Fantasy Flight Games in the early part of the century, and later ran Hyperion Games, publisher of the Dilbert board game.\nBrian is very familiar with the production process of big box board games, and has handled all stages of board game production, including working with printers and delivering high-quality finished products. Brian will be in charge of seeing Shuriken through the production process and getting the finished game into the hands of backers.\nShuriken is an expensive game to make, as you've probably noticed from our funding goal. We want to be as transparent as possible about these estimated costs:\n$9,500 - Amazon/Kickstarter cut\n$10,000 - Tooling & setup for dice, miniatures, pressforms\n$40,000 - Actual printing costs of the board game for a minimum print run of 1,500 games (the fewest we can print)\n$5,000 - Shipping the game to us from China\n$11,500 - Estimated cost to ship the game & rewards to backers\n$4,500 - Finishing artwork for the game\n$10,000 - Cost to create backer rewards. The bulk of this is the Bag o' Ninja, though the extra dice are surprisingly expensive too\n$4,500 - Padding: in case we estimate backers wrong, we don't want to have to go out of pocket (for example, more international backers means we get to our goal more quickly, but a huge chunk of that money we have to pay out for the crazy international shipping rates). We wanted 5% padding, and this is a tad under.\nBut how do other big box board games manage to print their games for so much less? Here's the secret: they don't.\nMost big box board game Kickstarters that you see these days actually already have the money to print the game, and are just using Kickstarter to raise a little extra money to boost their print runs to enjoy economies of scale (so their per unit costs get lower). They could not actually come close to printing the game and shipping it to you for their funding goals.\nWe do not have this advantage: we've paid the money in art, design, and advertising to get the game to this point, but we have to rely on the gamer Kickstarter community to raise the funds to actually print the game.\nAgain, we're big on transparency, so feel free to ask if you have questions. And we will continue to be transparent about the process as we move forward. If you ever wanted to know the gritty bits about board game production, now is your chance!\nWe believe that Kickstarter is a place where big box games can get made that otherwise would have no chance of doing so. And we hope that you'll think Shuriken is a game worth playing.\nPlease, if you have any questions about the game or the manufacturing or the Kickstarter: feel free to ask us.\nYou can download the rules to check them out in detail and if you want an impartial opinion of Shuriken you can head to the BoardGameGeek forums and ask some of the playtesters what they think of the game.\nIf you want to support Shuriken, please tell your friends about this Kickstarter: tweet, post on Facebook, share on your blog! Follow us on Facebook for more updates. And let your friends know that by backing at just $1 they can get all the updates about the game progress.\nAnd thank you -- if for nothing else than simply for reading all the way to the end of this giant Kickstarter story!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause the game, graphic design, sculpts, and a good chunk of the art is complete, the largest risk is production delays. Actual production of Shuriken is likely to cross over Chinese New Year (though we're going to try to squeeze in before then), which is why we pushed the completion date back to March.\n\nThe final art for the rest of the board tiles also needs to be completed, and while we're working with the same fantastic artist who did the initial board tiles, artwork is always a potential source of delays.\n\nFortunately we have experience in producing high-quality board games and we have padded our completion date to allow for some reasonable delays -- including Chinese New Year.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Awesome Enterprise\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nAwesome Enterprise runs AwesomeDice.com and now helps to fund the design and development of awesome ninja board games.

There are two starting tiles, in opposite corners (only 1 in 2-player games) partially to allow the ninja to spread across the board without being crowded into one corner, but also to prevent a couple of players from filling every square, and thereby preventing players who have lost all their ninja from bringing new ones into the game."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "New Shuriken Review", "update_content": "We've got another great review of Shuriken, this time from Superfly Circus, which you can read here.

Good! Gizmos that shoot pickles at vampires? Better!!\nThat's the idea behind the first stretch goal for Widget - The All Star Monster Expansion Pack!  I intend to add new monster cards to everyone's basic Widget deck until the campaign runs out of time.  Let's take a look at the first few cards:\nLoren Stump has drawn an amazing series of 26 dragons each in the shape of a letter.  I asked him to spell \"Dragons\" with dragons and now its the first card in the Expansion Pack!\nChinese artist Fu Cong was brave enough to tackle the mummies so now we have a whole bunch of them!\nNot everyone knows who Cthulhu is but those who do tend to love the big lug!  That is why I turned to one of my favorite artists, Kris Brannock (who also drew \"Monkeys\"), to do justice to the ruler of R'lyeh (and well-known Widget aficionado). \nThe wonderful Kotoria (who also did \"Squash\") happily agreed to add to the Monster Expansion Pack with her take on Vampires.\nZombies feeding the birds, zombies walking the dog, zombies brushing their teeth - all the things you don't normally get to see zombies do - only in Widget!\nThis exciting new addition to the Expansion Pack was drawn by Natalya P. (the artist that also drew scrunchies).  Not only does it demonstrate Natalya's extraordinary range, it is also the only known image of Mrs. C (captured, apparently, just as she was about to go shopping!).\nJust in time for Easter!  Sort of a weird combination of HAL 9000, a Sith lord and a 1987 movie, Robo-bunny is not someone you would want to meet at your local Easter egg hunt!\nSo...an anime ghost sings a magic song while drinking from an empty teacup to her creepy but unimpressed friend while...look, you figure it out, you tell me!  I just know I like it!\nWhat do Yetis do on their day off?  Now you know.  The happy but increasingly exhausted artists promise, promise, promise to color in the line art once the campaign is finished and they have a bit more time.\nAnother happy family just chillin' on their day (night?) off.  Not sure I want to know what is on that grill, though...  This is another bit of line art that gets colored in once the campaign is over.\nAaaaaaaH!  Ninjas!  So you KNOW what is coming next!\nI'm sure you saw THAT coming!\nAs a purist, this image bothered me.  Since when did Basilisks have wings?  Then I was enlightened - It really depends on which Bestiary you consult.  Lesson 1:  You learn something new every day.  Lesson 2:  It is such an elegant piece of art, I don't care; this is my new idea of \"Basilisks\".\n\"Trenti\" is, apparently, Spanish for \"Mischievous Elves\".  Done by a Spanish artist, this card is, in my mind, simply wonderful.\nThis is a very special card for me.  It is drawn by Mark Chen, who is not only an old friend but is also a backer of this game.  I genuinely appreciate his help and I think this is as good a place as any to end Stretch Goal #1.\nThis card will not be included in any commercial version of the game.  It is only available through Kickstarter.  The card, when played in the game, will have a special benefit for the person who is lucky enough to draw and play it.\nI have a confession to make.  \nWhile I have been working on Widget, I have also been working on my next game as well.  It is very different:  An exciting, extraordinary and completely unexpected adventure crafted by some of the most creative people I know.  It brings together the talents of not only artists but also sculptors and storytellers as well.  \nIt is almost ready to launch.  \nThis card - the Vikings card - is a hint and stretch goal #3.  If we, by some miracle, hit this, every backer will get this card and ... I have another hint waiting.\nIf, in the highly unlikely case this project makes Stretch Goal #4 in the next 90 minutes, I will reveal all about my next project in an exclusive backer's only update.\nAll the images we have to date, all of the maps, all of the sculpted pieces, and all of what we know of the island and all of what we know of the story -- so far. \n I will share it all.   \n________________________________________________________\nThe Basics Of Widget:\n...with something like...\n\n... that shoots ...\n... at ...\n... or puts ...\n... on ...\n... or balances ...\n... on ...\n... and then it gets really weird.\nHi!\nMy name is Kris Wheaton and I am the designer of the game, Widget.  Widget is a fast, easy, card game that asks players to make crazy, silly, funny, weird, unusual or otherwise great sentences out of the words they have in their hands.  The person who creates the \"best\" sentence, as judged by the other players, wins.  \nCards that allow players to switch cards around along with other special rules add an element of strategy to the game, making it easy to learn but different and exciting every time you play.  I have carefully selected the words and the illustrations such that it makes Widget a family-friendly game that also works as a good party game for adults.\nTo make the game more fun, I asked 47 different artists to illustrate the cards in the game.  All I gave any of them was their word, such as \"hamsters\" or \"cakes\" or \"a gadget\", and then told them to have at it.  The art at the beginning of this section is just a small sample of what they came up with.  \nWhile some of these artists are based in the US (such as the wonderful Kris Brannock and her amazing \"Monkeys\" and the enigmatic Kotoria and her, shall we say, \"interesting\", rendition of the word \"Squash\"), others come from all over the world including artists such as Richard Svensson from Sweden (Walruses), Theresa Cann from Canada (Squids) and Natalya P. from Turkey (Scrunchies).  Artists from as far away as the Philippines, Australia, Malaysia, Israel, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Argentina, and Nigeria all contributed to this game.\nI need your support to get this game, with all its incredible art, made and into your hands.  Your money will go towards printing, packaging and mailing the game along with all the other rewards.  It will also go towards improving the game and adding more words and art to the final deck.\nWidget went from 3 X 5 cards to printed out on cardstock to prototype pretty quickly.  The rules are easy but playtesting showed it to be as fun as it looks.  I had to tweak some of the mechanics to get the play balance right but...what?...excuse me?  Show you what it looks like?  Sure!  (Sorry!)  \nHere is the big pile 'o cards with everything currently in the deck.  Nouns, verbs, prepositions, conjunctions, subjects, objects, you name it -- we got it!\nor for those of you want a more organized view...\nFinally, a few close-ups!\nWidget can be played with just 2 or 3 people but it works best when played with 4-6.  Players draw a hand and try to make the best sentence they can with the words they have.  Each turn players pass their cards to the left or right (the player with The Decider card gets to decide which direction) and draw to fill their hands.  Players can build on an existing sentence or make a new one.  Special cards like Verb Switch, Noun Switch or Switch Any allow players to steal other players' words to make their sentences better or other players' sentences worse.  Blank cards allow players to add new words to the game.  Each game takes about 15-20 minutes to play.\nI tried to create a series of rewards that would match just about everyone's pocketbook and level of interest in Widget.  If you just want to play the game, I have reward levels for that.  If you want to be part of the process and have you or your child, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, or pet idolized, exalted and adored by the 1000's of future players of Widget, I got that too.  If you just want to kick in some scratch to help get this project up and running, I even have reward levels for you.  Specifically:\nEvery single one of you who contributes to this project at any level gets our deepest thanks!  \nAhh!  You Wordsmithing Mechanics get to put your skills to use with a print-and-play version of the game.\nEarly birds get the full game of Widget at a discounted price!\nThis is full game of Widget for those who truly like to build things with words.  All hail the Poet Machinists!\nLet's be honest.  My autograph on this version of the game will probably not make it a rare and valuable collectors item ... but the extra $5 WILL go a long way towards making Widget a reality. Your generosity and belief in the project is truly appreciated!\nMaster Essay Craftsmen (and women) need two Widgets (at a discount price) - one for themselves and one for a friend!\nPolyglot Grease Monkeys have all the fun!  At this level you get to be the official sponsor of one of the words already in the Widget deck (see list below).  Let's say you want to sponsor \"Squash\".  Your name, your company's name, your kid's name, your pet's name, your significant other's name or any other name you choose will go on every \"Squash\" card in every deck of Widget printed as a result of this Kickstarter project.  You will also receive a full size digital version of the original \"Squash\" drawing that you can use as cool wallpaper for your monitor, post to your blog or just ogle in awe in the quiet comfort of your own home.\nUnsatisfied with stock words and phrases, the Ink-slinging Gearhead wants to customize and this reward level allows you to do just that.  You pick the noun (nothing naughty, of course) and our stable of illustrators make it real.  You will also get a digital version of this one-of-a-kind drawing as well as everything else.\nAt this level, you are a Writer-maker Laureate and deserve to have your image immortalized!  The clever and nimble illustrators at my disposal will carefully exaggerate, cartoon-ize and exploit any and all of your features for the joy and wonder of future ages of Widget players.  You will get a digital copy of this drawing for your personal use as well as a copy of the game and all the other stuff.\nNot only will we immortalize your visage, at this level, you get three copies of Widget so you can share the joy with others!\nSee the Widget; be the Widget.  As Doodad Lama, you don't need any more stuff but you live to help bring more stuff into existence.  It is hard to imagine that an act this generous would go unnoticed by the cosmos.  It sure as heck won't go unnoticed by me!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have worked very hard to minimize the risks associated with this project.

I have adequate extra space in the deck, though, for all of the premium reward words should people chose those reward levels. I have made arrangements with a local printer who I know well and have done work with in the past to get the games printed, boxed and shipped in a reasonable time upon receipt of funding. I have set the funding level such that I can cover my costs.\n\nI have tried to think of everything and, of course, I am certain something will change or something will not go as planned (It probably wouldn't be a Kickstarter project if everything just worked...).

See update #22 for a video of the creation of the box art.\nDungeon Roll is a light and quick press-your-luck dice game with many important and interesting decisions.\nIn Dungeon Roll, you will:\nBe a Hero with special and unique abilities.\nRoll your party made of clerics, fighters, mages, thieves, champions, and scrolls.\nDestroy the monsters, drink potions, collect treasures, and slay dragons found in the dungeon.\n\nDungeon Roll has:\nMore choice and strategy than a typical push your luck dice game, without losing all of the satisfying highs of a great dice game.\nOutstanding art and visuals.\nCustom molded plastic dice in 2 types, dungeon dice and party dice.\nAn incredible box to loot treasures from.\nFantastic price point -- $15, save $5 from MSRP.\nBattlemage hero artwork.\nIn the words of Dungeon Roll's designer, Chris Darden:\n\"Dungeon Roll began as a simple dice game. Where one pool of dice faced off against the other in an epic battle of... numbers, yawn. Elements of fantasy called to me, and the concept of Dungeon Roll was born.\" \n\"The party dice became Fighters, Mages, Clerics and Thieves. And on the other side: Potions, Treasure Chests, Goblins, other nasty creatures, and of course.. Dragons. They would face off in an epic battle of heroes seeking fortune and glory!\"\nDICE RENDERING ONLY - The dice in Dungeon Roll will be a compression molded plastic with painted debossed faces\nYes, these dice are compression molded, the paint will not be on the same surface as the die. I have heard these referred to as, \"etched\", \"carved\", \"embossed\", \"debossed\", and so forth.  These dice are made to last, unless you melt them at high heats.\nIn Dungeon Roll, you become a hero and roll up your companions. With your party assembled, you start on the first level of the dungeon by rolling three Dungeon Dice. You have decisions to make, enemies to vanquish, and more glory to seek. \nWithout breaking a sweat you stride down to the second level, and then the third, and that's where things really begin to pick up. By using your companions, reviving party members with potions, and using your Hero's ultimate power, you might get deep enough to accumulate a Dragon's horde of treasure...\nJust watch out for that Dragon.\nPaladin hero artwork\nThis Kickstarter project is all about making Dungeon Roll as awesome as possible! We want to give you as much stuff as possible, so please share early and often:\nPROTOTYPE RULEBOOK - This rulebook does not have the final artwork or layout.  This is actively being worked on while this Kickstarter project is live.\nFor more information about how heroes work, see UPDATE #5 - Heroes Explained.\nNecromancer hero artwork.\nDeveloping Dungeon Roll has been a joy. It has grown to become one of the most exciting games for TMG to ever release. It feels magical, mystical, even mythic. Throughout development, the game got awesomer and more components were added. \nThe creative work and manufacturing cost for at least 10,000 copies of Dungeon Roll will require about $36,500. I have already committed TMG to spend about $8,300 on artwork, molds for custom dice, and other setup costs.  That still leaves TMG to pay for more artwork (additional heroes), manufacturing, ocean freight, and delivery to Kickstarter backers. These are HUGE items, especially the delivery to backers which will cost about $6.25 per copy in the USA. This Kickstarter project will determine just how awesome Dungeon Roll will be.\nFor more details on the finances behind this project, see UPDATE #7 - Behind The Curtain: Finances of Dungeon Roll\nTo overstuff the treasure chest box with everything we want and keep a price of $15 requires printing tens of thousands of copies! To fully fund the cost of a printing of 10,000 copies would require a funding level of $75,000.  This would allow us to keep the $15 price point for the non-Kickstarter retail world.\nWith that said, we are comfortable making and delivering Dungeon Roll if we only raise $15,000. It just won't be at the grand scale that we are currently imagining!\nThis is why we are on Kickstarter.\nCommander hero artwork.\nBelow are some important updates to the project which you might be interested in if you are seeing this for the first time:\nUpdate #23 - More preliminary artwork & decisions...\nUpdate #22 - Mimic Box Art Unleashed\nUpdate #20 - FREE BONUS - Treasures Explained (& Artwork) - Respect The Streak\nUpdate #19 - Mimic Unlocked - Stretch Goal Finances - 23 hour referrer analytics\nUpdate #14 - BACKERS ONLY - Print and play files available, if you want to get these, you can pledge for as little as $1.\nUpdate #7 - Behind The Curtain: Finances Of Dungeon Roll\nUpdate #5 - Heroes Explained...\nUpdate #4 - BACKERS ONLY - Supporter Avatars - Use these for your Kickstarter, social media, or forum avatars to show you are a backer!\nEnchantress Hero Artwork\n\nThanks to your support, I can live my dream of publishing wonderful games, connecting people, and strengthening families.

We have published over a dozen games, including 2 previous dice games, and are familiar with the process.\n\nA delay in delivering Dungeon Roll is likely to come from one of 3 main sources, artwork, manufacturing quality control, and freight logistics. We have taken steps to ensure that delivery will be on time, but that cannot always happen on time.\n\nWe see a wider release at GenCon as critical to the short-term and long-term sales success of Dungeon Roll. We will not sell Dungeon Roll at GenCon if Kickstarter backers have not been shipped their copies.

You don\u2019t ever need to worry about what platform it\u2019s on!\nBut even in that world, we've developed a reputation for being a bit different at Days of Wonder:\nwe focus on developing board games with the coolest components, best theme and gameplay, not on producing the cheapest games possible;\nwe develop digital versions of our games ourselves, in-house, rather than licensing them to third-parties;\nand we never, ever, discuss new products and future plans ahead of their actual release.\nBut this time, we'd like to Play Different!\nThe Project: Small World 2\nA year after the launch of Small World - the Board Game, on the first day the original iPad became available, we launched Small World for iPad, pioneering a whole new world of board games on Tablets! \nThe game earned critical acclaim and hordes of devoted players, but soon took a backseat to our own Ticket to Ride - the train game that pays the bills at Days of Wonder.\nThe game didn\u2019t die though. While fans kept playing the original iPad version, deep in a corner of our Paris office, a dedicated team started creating the next generation of Small World.\nDevelopment of Small World 2 is now well underway...\n... and it will ship later this year, no matter what!\nSmall World is about to get A WHOLE LOT BIGGER, in Small World 2. \nComing soon to a screen near you?\nFor the first time, the game will accommodate not just 2, but 3, 4 and 5 players, each players configuration with its own map, just like the board game!\nSmall World ain't so small anymore - just a bit crowded (here, with 5 players!).\nMore players also means more ways to play: Beyond its original Solo and 2 players Face-to-face mode, Small World 2 will now also support Pass'N Play, Local Play and a true Turn-by-Turn asynchronous online mode that lets you play with friends across different platforms and multiple time zones, while remaining fast enough to support real-time play.\nPlay alone or with friends, on one device or multiple ones, even on different platforms!\nThere will also be more Races and Special Powers than ever competing for world domination in Small World 2, now. In addition to the original Cursed! and Grand Dames expansions, Be Not Afraid will be available as an In-App Purchase. \nAnd if this campaign gets funded, all backers at the Tritons level and higher will automatically unlock and receive The Kickstarter Backers digital Bonus Pack, a set of 3 new Races and 3 new Special Powers that Philippe Keyaerts has developed specially for this release.\n\"Be Not Afraid...\" - Famous last words of a Small World Pigmy about to roll a die\nEven better, all these expansions will be playable under a generous \"boardgame-like\" policy, where as long as the person who initiates a game owns an expansion, all players in that game get a chance to play with it; no risk of waiting for opponents with the same set of expansions you own!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe're committed to releasing Small World 2 on iPad no matter what; but we've also heard those of you clamoring for a port onto Android and Steam. \nFor a small company like us, especially one doing all its development in-house, creating versions for these platforms is a non-trivial project, and one that will divert significant resources away from our Ticket to Ride mainstay. \nIn our forums, on Facebook and on Twitter, enough of you have told us you\u2019d like to spend some hard-earned cash on Android and Steam apps to make it worth our while. Now is your chance to prove it. \nAnd to sweeten the pot, we've come up with some very cool swag to help you decide to pledge!\nThe Rewards\nThe Online game and Kickstarter Backers digital Bonus Pack\nPhilippe Keyaerts has designed 3 new races and 3 new special powers specially for Small World players who choose to back us with their pledges during this campaign. These new races and special powers will be unlocked through a special achievement linked to each backers (at the Tritons level and higher) player account, when Small Word 2 for Android and Steam ships.\nPledge at the Skeletons level if you want the bonus races & powers along with a copy of the game on the platform of your choice.\nIf you already own Small World iPad, and are interested in getting a copy of the game on another platform, no problem - Go ahead and pledge for this new platform, and your Bonus pack will automatically appear and be playable on all platforms you own Small World 2 on!\nIf you already own Small World iPad, but don't care about the Android or Steam versions, pledge at the Tritons level instead:\nPhysical board game rewards for higher pledges\nIf you're a committed player of the board game, you might also be tempted by the rewards for some of our higher pledges, such as...\nThe 6 Player cardboard Map of Small World that Philippe is designing for this campaign.\nFeaturing Small World on one side, Small World Underground on the other, this reward will ship with all the additional tokens (mountains, lost tribes, monsters, etc.) required to play with 6 players around the table.\nIf you already own Small World on the iPad, and don't care about any of our other digital versions, but choose to pledge at the Goblins level to get this map, you will be given a chance to donate the digital copy of the game you receive as part of your pledge to a friend, while still choosing to keep the Kickstarter Backers digital Bonus Pack for yourself!\nFinally, if you don't care at all about any digital versions, but still lust for this map, we hope to offer some for sale on our web site, at a later date and slightly higher retail price.\nWe're also busy designing The Small World Pocket Encyclopedia, a 110x140mm hard cover notebook filled with 84+ full-color pages of concept art, illustrations, strategic advice and trivia surrounding the denizens of Small World.\nTo receive the Encyclopedia, simply up your pledge to the Orcs level.\nThe same comments as for the Goblins pledge apply, if you're interested in the Encyclopedia but don't care about digital versions of the games (or already own the iPad version, and have no friends to donate a digital copy to ;-)).\nAnd last but not least, for the most committed, crazy, extravagant or dedicated of you, we are offering a very limited number of opportunities for you to design your very own Small World race or mini-expansion! \nWe will professionally illustrate this expansion, lay it out, print it, and who knows? - maybe even publish it or code it into the game, if we really like it!\nSome all important Add-ons...\nBut it wouldn't quite be Small World if we'd stopped there, right? It's a Board game after all, so we thought we should have some things for those of you who still live in the digital dark ages and couldn't care less about tablets, phones and other strange electrical contraptions.\nSo we've come up with some very special add-ons; physical rewards that you can receive by simply adding the corresponding $ amount to the pledge of your choice. \nFor instance, if you wish to get yourself our sure-to-be-cool 'I Backed a Troll' T-shirt, simply add $ 21 to the pledge of your choice. We will ask your choice of T-shirt size (S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL) once the campaign ends.\nLiving outside the USA? Add + $ 14 in shipping fees to your pledge (i.e. $ 35 in total), to receive this t-shirt.\nIf you only care for some of our add-ons but none of the digital stuff, just pledge at the $1 Kobolds level:\n... and add the $ amount of the physical rewards you want to receive to your pledge. \nFor instance, $ 10 ($1 Kobolds pledge + $9 for the Royal Bonus) will get you a cardboard version of the 3 new races and 3 new special powers Philippe designed for this campaign, along with all the race tokens and markers needed to play them in Small World the board game.\nLiving outside the USA? Add + $ 5 in shipping fees to your pledge (i.e. $ 14 in total), to receive the cardboard races.\n...and a very special Designer Edition!\nFor those of you who wish to go even further, we've come up with a very special add-on: The Designer's Oath version of Small World's upcoming deluxe Designer Edition. \nThe Designer Edition - A truly deluxe version of Small World the Board game\nSmall World's Designer Edition is a spare-no-expense version of Small World the board game that will ship in 2014; this version of the game is true to Philippe Keyaerts' original wooden prototype.\nPhilippe's original prototype of Small World featured delightful wood tokens; we've finally managed to reproduce them for this very special Designer Edition!\nThe Designer Edition will feature: \n307 deluxe wooden tokens covering all races from the base game and its Cursed!, Grand Dames and Be Not Afraid expansions + the Lost Tribes\neach race will comes in its own individual, lavishly illustrated box\nthe banners, special powers and markers that complement the deluxe tokens will all be heat-printed on wood, matching the tokens neatly\nthe victory coins will all be distinctive metal coins specially forged for Small World\nthe maps will be super-sized copies of Small World's 2-5 player maps, and include a new 6 player map specially designed by Philippe Keyaerts for this campaign\nThe Dragon, the Catapult, the 2 Heroes will all be represented by custom resin miniatures\nWe are still in the early design stages of the Designer Edition; Back us now and we'll work hard to make your own copy even nicer...\nLiving outside the USA? Add + $ 50 in shipping fees to your pledge.\nBy adding $ 320 to your pledge now, you'll receive a Kickstarter exclusive version of our Designer Edition, that will include:\nA deluxe wooden version of the 3 new Races & Special Powers in the Kickstarter Backers Bonus Pack\nA signed plaque - numbered and engraved in your name\nShipment 3 months ahead of the actual retail release\nAn $ 80 discount off the $ 400 retail price of the Designer Edition\n\nInternational customers please add $ 50 to your pledge, to cover for our additional shipping fees; If you live outside the US, you must be prepared to take responsibility for custom or import fees, as well as taxes (including VAT) your home country may impose when we ship you your Designer Edition. International copies will ship through the US Postal Service - Priority Mail International.\nWe are investigating the possibility of shipping Designer's Oath versions to European customers from our European warehouse. Should this option materialize, you will be given a chance to select it before we ship you your copy, but your costs may increase as a result of the 20%+ VAT European countries will typically charge us.\nSo, which pledge should I choose?\nStill a bit unsure about which pledge to choose and which add-ons to select to get the rewards you want? Consult this table \nAlso please make sure to check our FAQ at the bottom of this page, and our Updates at the top for additional details and answers to your questions!\nStretch Goals\nThe most frequent requests were for long-out-of-print expansions to come back into print.\nStretch Goal # 1 confirmed - Leaders is coming back into print!\nStretch goal # 1 is now confirmed - Thank you!! We are going to design an updated version of Leaders and mail a free copy to all Kickstarter Backers who pledged $ 30 or more (regardless of how your pledge reaches that amount, whether through add-ons, shipping fees, etc. and regardless of where you live).\nThis revised expansion will contain Leaders for all Small World & Small World Underground races published to date, for Cursed!, Grand Dames, Be Not Afraid and for the 3 new races from the Kickstarter bonus pack.\nStretch Goal # 2 confirmed - Necromancer Island is coming back into print!\nStretch goal # 2 is now confirmed - Thank you!! Necromancer Island is coming back into print later this year, we will mail a free copy and a folded Necromancer Island poster, to all Kickstarter Backers who pledge $ 60 or more (regardless of how your pledge reaches that amount, whether through add-ons, shipping fees, etc. and regardless of where you live).\nWe'll implement some nifty listing in the digital credits of the game!\nStretch goal # 3 is now confirmed - Thank you!!!

Furthermore, even if everything goes according to plan, we might receive feedback and suggestions we want to incorporate, which could delay the product.\n\nThis being said, the iPad version of Small World 2 is already well underway, and we feel confident in our capacity to also ship Android and Steam versions within the next 12 months.\n\nBoard game risks: We work with a small number of highly specialized partners and vendors; some of the coolest rewards we describe in the various pledge levels and add-ons on this page rely on components we have never attempted to incorporate into our games before - or at least never in this manner. This could result in unforeseen production delays, and even possibly force us to modify or change some of the specifics described here.\n\nWe have managed projects of similar scope and complexity before, and are confident in our - and our suppliers' - capabilities to come through and deliver a truly desirable Designer Edition of Small World the Board game (likely the most complex reward item, listed as an add-on on this page).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "The Small World Designer Edition is available for everybody: order your copy on June 9!", "update_content": "R\u2019hka and his dwarf companions were digging for gold, but nothing could prepare them to the discovery they were about to make.\nWith shovels and pickaxes, they were progressing in the mine.

While wearing the \u201cred dragon\u201d shirt, Nico accompanied Rackham in its ascension. He worked on Rag\u2019Narok, Confrontation 2nd to 4th edition,\nIn 2008, Nico lent his hand to Kraken Editions for the background of Alkemy Genesis. The Jade Triad arbors his signature.\nIn 2011, he worked with Studio Cyanide, developer of the Confrontation videogame, as a consultant, freelance author and playtester.\nJean-Baptiste Lullien, a.k.a. Ogre-Mercenaire \nWith a background in linguistics and information, J.-B worked for several years as a game designer for Rackham, on several projects including girls games with little horses and a fashion academy, numerous miniature games (even a kind of \u201cmarbles\u201d monsters!), videogames and comics.\nRapha\u00ebl Guiton\nRaphael is one of the founders of Rackham, and together with another ex-Games Workshop employee Jean Bey, created the iconic game of Confrontation in 1996, and eventually leading its creative team.\nNow a co-founder of Guillotine Games, a studio of french designers, Zombicide, a cooperative boardgame of survivors VS zombies, is his first project to be published as a game designer. \nPercy de Montblanc\nPercy has never worked in Rackham. Co-founder of Guillotine Games, he is in charge of all the tasks the other associates hate and he prepares coffee.\nHe is the executive producer of Zombicide and from time to time he has one or two good ideas that are systematically ignored. Since Zombicide Season 1, he's been locked in the office and let out for occasional walkies.\nStretch Goals\nHelp spread the word and everyone wins with more goodies and upgraded games!\n Optional Items\nHere are some additional add ons if you really want to bling out your games!\nSurvivors\n....\nWalk of the Dead\n15 Walkers\n6 Runners\n3 Fatties\n12 \u201cWalk Of The Dead\u201d Zombie cards\nWalk of the Dead 2- traditional zombie sculpts from Prison Outbreak\n15 Walkers (5 are mix of 2 BOZ only sculpts)\n6 Runners\n3 Fatties (2 of one BOZ only sculpt)\n12 Zombie spawn cards\nToxic Crowd -Toxic zombie sculpts from Toxic City Mall\n15 Toxic Walkers (5 are mix of 2 BOZ only sculpts)\n6 Toxic Runners\n3 Toxic Fatties (2 of one BOZ only sculpt)\n6 Zombie spawn cards\nAngry Zombies- Berserker sculpts from Prison Outbreak\n15 Berserker Walkers (5 are mix of 2 BOZ only sculpts)\n6 Berserker Runners\n3 Berserker Fatties (2 of one BOZ only sculpt)\n6 Zombie spawn cards\n\"BOZ only\" stands for sculpts of models normally only available in that Box of Zombies, i.e. they are not replicated in the base game.

It is your job, as Author of your own Oz story, to populate it with characters. Each character's vitality is worth so many points to the story. At the end of the game, the Author whose characters have the greatest total vitality wins the game.\n\nSounds simple enough? But it can't be that easy. It isn't.\n\nIn The Card Game of Oz, you're sharing your storyline with other Authors. There may even be multiple storylines at once. Characters come and go from various locations, each having a different effect on the story. The locations themselves might even change right out from under the feet of your characters.\n\nCharacters might be unexpectedly shifted around. Objects and other characters can affect the story. Not to mention Effects, Events, and Spells that can change everything in a blink of an eye.\n- Jim O'Connor, Orion's Bell\nCheck out the rules for The Card Game of Oz here.\nYou can Print and Play The Card Game of Oz now to try it out!\nYou can watch this How to Play video from Grey Elephant Gaming.\nYou can watch this Live Play video from Grey Elephant Gaming.\nWe sent out a number of preview copies of The Card Game of OZ and the reviews and comments are starting to come in.\n\"I'm a big fan of the Oz books (have a collection of the whole series) and I think James did a great job of bringing the world of the books into the game.\" -- Stephen Conway, The Spiel Podcast\n\"I would highly recommend this game for any one who loves the world of Oz... the books, the movies...

Long before a game project appears on Kickstarter, the designers and developers will have spent hundred of hours on play testing the game and thousands of dollars on art and design to get the project to state where you will take it seriously.

THE CARD GAME OF OZ is a small project as games go, but even so, it can't be made without your help.\n\nTHE CARD GAME OF OZ is virtually \"Print Ready\" so we plan to send the final files to the printer within a week or two of the project's close. That means we hope to have it available for release in 2013. Every game project is subject to potential production delays, but we believe this date is achievable.\n\nThe final challenge is getting the game and rewards out to the backers.

You don\u2019t need to worry about what platform it\u2019s on!\nBut even in that world, we've developed a reputation for being a bit different at Days of Wonder:\n- we focus on developing board games with the coolest components, best theme and gameplay, not on producing the cheapest games possible;\n- we develop all digital versions of our games ourselves, in-house, rather than licensing them onto third-parties;\n- and we never, ever, discuss new products and future plans ahead of their actual release.\nBut this time, we'd like to Play different! So read on...\nThe Project: Small World 2\nA year after the launch of Small World - the Board game, on the first day the original iPad became available, we launched Small World for iPad, pioneering a whole new world of board games on Tablets! \nThe game earned critical acclaim and hordes of devoted players, but soon took a backseat to our own Ticket to Ride - the train game that pays the bills at Days of Wonder.\nThe game didn\u2019t die though. While fans kept playing the original iPad version, deep in a corner of our Paris office, a dedicated team started creating the next generation of Small World.\nSmall World 2 is now well underway...\nWith up to 5 players, Small World ain't so small anymore - just a bit crowded!\n... and it will ship later this year, no matter what!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe will be launching a new, redesigned campaign on Kickstarter on Tuesday March 12, 2013.
