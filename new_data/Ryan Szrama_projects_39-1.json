My name is Zuby and I'm an independent rapper, author, podcast host, and creative entrepreneur. I've created this Kickstarter campaign to help support the release and promotion of my powerful new album, WORD OF ZUBY.\n'Word of Zuby' album cover (created by MVDEX)\nWORD OF ZUBY is my sixth album and my first music project in over two years. It's also my most important album to date.\nSince releasing 'Perseverance' at the beginning of 2019, I've gained hundreds of thousands of new followers, appeared on some of the biggest podcasts in the world (including 'The Joe Rogan Experience'), and exposed millions of new people to my message through social media, interviews, and TV appearances.\nNow, it's time to bring it back to the MUSIC.\nI am a 100% INDEPENDENT artist.\nI've never signed to a record label, nor even had a manager. That means I can do what I want, artistically and business-wise, without having to answer to 'the music industry'. But it also means I don't have access to label funding, record advances, nor many mainstream promotional outlets.\nIt's you, my fans and supporters, that make everything possible.\nThis crowdfunding campaign will help me to:\nCover physical manufacturing costs (CDs & vinyl) [minimum funding target - ACHIEVED] \nRecoup album production costs (music production, recording, mixing & mastering)\nCreate more amazing music videos\nInvest in advertising, marketing, and PR\nTravel to promote and perform my music to more people\nThe more successful this campaign is, the more cool and creative stuff we can do with this album, and the more people I can reach and inspire!\nBy backing this project, you are directly helping me to fund the independent release and promotion of WORD OF ZUBY. With your contribution, we can reach more people and help shift the culture in a positive direction. \nWORD OF ZUBY is my most personal and provocative album to date. I've had so much on my mind over the last few years, and have been inspired by everything going on in the world and our society. Culture, politics, religion... I cover a lot of topics on this album, and it's likely that some people will consider it 'controversial' (free of profanity as always though!)\nOn this album, I've collaborated with many amazingly talented artists and producers from the UK, USA, Canada, and Europe. I'm proud of every single song.\nTracklist:\n1/ Real\n2/ Devil May Cry\n3/ Moments (feat. YONAS)\n4/ OK Dude\n5/ Legacy (feat. Stephen Smitley & Eric July)\n6/ Underrated (feat. Mac Lethal & Shao Dow)\n7/ Hallelujah (feat. Bryson Gray)\n8/ Live It Up (feat. Reverie)\n9/ Breathe\n10/ No Lamborghini (feat. Tyrone & Warbz)\n11/ Anarchy (feat. An0maly)\n12/ Marvelous (feat. Ruslan)\n13/ Only a Man\n*Track order subject to change\nAs a backer, you will be one of the first people in the world to hear my new album (you'll get it before it's on any major music platform!)\nYou can also get exclusive perks including:\nSigned CDs\nLimited edition vinyl\nUltra-rare art prints signed by ZUBY & MVDEX\nBacker-only updates and offers\nEveryone who backs this campaign at \u00a315 or more will also be invited to a Kickstarter exclusive online album listening party with Zuby!\nBonus Perks Unlocked:\n\u00a320,000 - Lyric booklet addition (\u00a315+ backers) \u2705\n\u00a325,000 - Album artwork postcard (all backers with physical rewards) \u2705\n\u00a330,000 - Kickstarter exclusive sticker pack (all backers with physical rewards) \u2705\n\u00a340,000 - Kickstarter exclusive wristbands (all backers with physical rewards) \u2705\n\u00a350,000+ - More and better music videos! \u2705\nExclusive 'Word of Zuby' CD in 6 panel digipak with original artwork by MVDEX\nOnly the first run of 'Word of Zuby' CDs will have this packaging\nSigned copies available\nMissed out on Zuby's previous albums?

So we've been working on a way to bring Plus-Plus to new environments. We came up with the idea of making a wooden box to hold them - something you would like to have out on your desk.

We'll be updating it with new content all the time.\n\nWhat's in a name?\nWe wanted a name that is open-ended enough to allow you to create anything with it. A word that will be easy to tell someone else about. A name that gives a nod to our Danish heritage. \nDo you know what the Danish word for \"box\" is?  BOKS! So now you speak some Danish. Go ahead, impress your friends and family. \n\nWe'll wait.\n\nWhen & Where?\nWe will be doing the final assembly of BOKS in Greenville, SC for our US, Canadian, and International customers, and in Holb\u00e6k, Denmark for our European friends.

Runs on PC, Linux, and Mac. Go!\nRather watch than play? Okay: \nStill reading? Okay... Rainbow Laser Disco Dungeon is part twin stick-shooter, part rhythm game, part dungeon crawler. Every action, every laser blast and robot explosion, happens according the rhythm of the music. Pick up your weapons and get ready to dance!\nThe Story\nIt is the year 2084. Earth is ruled by evil robots from another dimension. All music has been outlawed. Dancing is strictly forbidden. Still, in the underground, the beat goes on. \nEarth's greatest musicologist, Dr. Dysco, has made a discovery... Although they have proven themselves to be immune to all conventional weapons, music can be used to destroy the robots. Dysco begins constructing a musical arsenal to wipe out the robot invaders. On the verge of completing the ultimate weapon, the Rainbow Laser, Dysco vanishes. The word on the street... Dysco was captured by the robots and is being held in a diabolical dungeon.\nCan you survive in the Dungeon? Will you find the Rainbow Laser?  Will you bring back Dysco? It's not going to be easy.\nOn Difficulty and Accessibility...\nYeah, Rainbow Laser Disco Dungeon is a hard game! Not your thing? No problem. Turn on Explore Mode and dance your way through the dungeon blasting evil robots in total safety. You can dance if you want to! You'll also be able to rebind the controls and turn off the flashing light show. Play your way!\nThe Demo\nYou can play the demo on itch.io right now. Please do! It's only one short level so far, but it shows off the controls, the look and feel, and some dancing robots and rhythm weapons.\nWhat\u2019s Left To Do? \nYou can't have a dungeon without rooms. I'm planning to make well over 100 rooms before the game comes out. I'll need to put some stuff in those rooms so you can expect to see an ever growing number of evil dancing robots and rhythm weapons to take them down. What else? That's a good question. I have some more: How many weapons are the right amount? How many robots? I'll be looking to answer these and more on the way from demo to full game. I'll be counting on your feedback to help me figure it out. I'm down to trying anything!\nThe Music\nThat time travelling weirdo Rainbow Kitten is back at it, this time serving up a heaping helping of pulse pounding dance tracks. If that's not enough, you can add your own tracks to the mix! Since all of the game's sound effects are based on drum samples, and all of the game actions are locked to the rhythm, you'll be adding to the music as you play.\nFor Your Home Computer System\nWe don\u2019t know what operating system you use, and we\u2019re not going to make a big deal about it. Rainbow Laser Disco Dungeon will run on PC, Linux, and Mac from day one. The demo already does.\nThe Rewards\nBackers at any level will get Rainbow Laser Disco Dungeon on Steam and itch.io just as soon as it's ready - before the official release if you want. You can keep them both or give one to a friend or sell the extra on ebay or whatever you want. They're yours! You can even give them both away if you want!\nStep up to Every Vector Hat Game and you'll get Steam and itch.io keys for every Vector Hat game just as soon as this campaign ends. On Steam that's Radical Solitaire, Byte Driver, and R-COIL. Itch.io also has the super radical Radical Chess. Rad!\nGrab Music to Kill Evil Robots By and you'll get all of the above plus all of the original music from Rainbow Laser Disco Dungeon. Evil robots could be anywhere. Take these tunes with you. Better safe than sorry.\nGet a High Score! You're famous! And your name will be included in the game's default high score table.  It can also be your friends name... or your enemy's name... or whatever you want. Nothing awful please. Be cool. Your score will be based on the amount (to the penny) that you pledge.

In that time I've worked on tons of titles including Enemy Mind, Orion Trail, and I Expect You to Die. \nI also make games on my own as Vector Hat, most recently, Radical Solitaire, Radical Chess, and Byte Driver. Those and more at vectorhat.com. \nI've been playing games since the early 80's. All of my happiest memories are in arcades. \nWhy This Campaign?\nFirst, to raise money. That's right; making and selling a game costs money! I've spent countless hours working on this in the middle of the night, and I'll spend countless more before it's done. I'm not going to try to put a dollar value on that time, but surely it's worth something.\nAlso I\u2019m STILL using a computer that was.. ahem.. rescued from the garbage and it\u2019s getting pretty old. I can\u2019t really afford to replace it so if it dies before the game is complete the game dies with it. Raising this money would protect us all from that.\nIt's not just about money though. I'd like to know that a few people will play this game before I spent literally thousands of hours making content for it. So.. are you out there? Do you want to play this game? I'll totally make it for you if you're out there. I promise.\nSo, you've seen the game and the rewards. If you're still reading this, you probably saw something that you liked! Now's your chance to get the game and to help me get this game finished up and released.\nIf you're still not sure, play the demo!\nIt's all up to you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have lots of experience getting these kind of things done on time, and the demo is already playable and fun, so I feel good about there being a larger game that can be built on top of that.

We are Lems, a Colorado-based footwear company founded in 2008 by Andrew Rademacher after a \u201clight bulb moment\u201d stemming from his inability to find shoes that mimicked the natural shape of the foot. Overcoming the growing pains that come with both launching a company and ill-fitting footwear, Rademacher debuted his first shoe, the Primal, in 2011.\nIn an industry where loyalty is paramount, Lems continues to make strides against its big-name competition. These days, Rademacher prefers to let the thousands of 5-star reviews do the speaking for him, while still maintaining his original outlook: \"If you can't find it on the market and no one's doing it, then you have to do it yourself.\"\nTo learn more about Lems, please visit lemsshoes.com.  \nOUR #1 SELLER GOT A HELLUVA LOT BETTER\nIf you loved the incredibly good looking Leather Boulder Boot, have we got something exciting for you. The upgraded version is made with all the features you know and love, like supreme flexibility, a zero-drop platform, and unparalleled packability, but now, it\u2019s also WATERPROOF! That\u2019s right, you can dive right into your next adventure while keeping your feet fully dry. \nThe Waterproof Boulder Boot has long been our most requested shoe, and we\u2019re confident that they\u2019ll be worth the wait. Speaking of weight, this boot still maintains the lightweight frame you\u2019ve come to know and love from Lems \u2014 even though we\u2019ve added a unique waterproof membrane, these puppies will still hit the scale at a featherlight 12.9oz. (Men's 9/Women's 7.5).  Available for both men and women, the Weathered Umber is a rustic brown color well suited for anyone's wardrobe. Available soon for $165 (MSRP). \nWe also took some time to rethink the overall construction of our latest release, and reinforced everything; from a thicker gauge thread to an overall stronger outer construction, this is our toughest pair yet. And yes, before you ask, they\u2019re zero-drop. Ready to roll through a river, plow through an ice pack, or anything else on your agenda? Good, because so are our Waterproof Boulder Boots, which keep your feet shockingly clear from clammy conditions due to a breathable waterproof membrane that stops water from penetrating into the boot, while still allowing the heat from your feet to escape. This kind-of-a-big-deal boot also utilizes a pre-treated leather upper, that can be reapplied with waterproofing wax/spray to help extend its water repellency.\nWATERPROOF\nRain, sun, snow? We\u2019re ready. Not only can you skip through streams and keep your toes dry, you can up the ante on where your travel takes you this winter, thanks to your new favorite snow-proof pair, complete with a gusseted tongue.  \nOILED LEATHER UPPER\nWe\u2019ve utilized a 100% full-grain leather with an oiled finish, that is pre-treated to be water repellent. To increase the water-repellency and extend it over the life of the shoe, we suggest using a waterproofing wax such as Otter Wax and reapplying 2-3 times per year.\nIBR OUTSOLE\nOur injection blown rubber outsole is what makes Lems incredibly lightweight and flexible. Deemed as the perfect travel companion, this boot can pack down to the size of your favorite puff jacket. \nULTRA LIGHTWEIGHT\nThese everyday shoes are some of the lightest on the market. You might be tempted to think you\u2019re not wearing shoes at all, but don\u2019t be fooled; we\u2019ve got your feet covered. \nZERO-DROP\nPlaces the forefoot and heel flat to the ground correcting posture, aligning your spine, and encouraging mid-foot strike. \nGUSSETED TONGUE\nWhether you prefer your laces loose, or tied up tight, thanks to the gusseted tongue you\u2019ll always be protected from the elements.\nThe Waterproof Boulder Boot is the one shoe that does it all without ever missing a step. You can easily pack it, but you\u2019ll also feel good wearing it everywhere, everyday. And just so you know \u2014 this boot was designed with an incredible amount of detail and care, and we can\u2019t wait to see where you go in it.\nREWARDS\nSIZING INFORMATION\nWe have found that the Waterproof Boulder Boot is running about a half size short, so we do recommend that your ORDER A HALF SIZE LARGER than your US size. If you are unsure of your US size, follow these simple steps below to get a measurement of your feet so you can choose the correct size boot! Keep in mind that if you plan on wearing thicker socks, you will want to order up for that purpose as well.

Starting out with a company of only 3 employees with 1 single product, we have now grown to a team of 10 with over 25 unique products.

It was about symfony 1.4.\nTo celebrate 10 years of no books from me, what about writing a book about Symfony 5?\nSymfony has evolved dramatically during the last few years and the developer experience improved significantly. I have the feeling that most Symfony developers are still \"stuck\" with old habits and that they have a hard time embracing the new ways of developing applications with Symfony. I can understand some of the reasons. The pace of evolution is staggering. When working full-time on a project, developers do not have time to follow everything happening in the community. I know first hand as I would not pretend that I can follow everything myself. Far from it.\nThis book is not just for existing Symfony developers. It is also about showing non-Symfony developers the power of the framework and how it can improve their productivity.\nI also feel the need for a new book as the web evolved a lot. Topics like APIs, SPAs, containerization, Continuous Deployment, and many others should be discussed now.\nYour time is precious. Don't expect long paragraphs, nor long explanations about core concepts. The book is more about the journey. Where to start. Which code to write. When. How. I will try to generate some interest on important topics and let you decide if you want to learn more and dig further.\nI don't want to replicate the existing documentation either. Its quality is excellent. I will reference the documentation copiously in the \"Going Further\" section at the end of each step. Consider this book as a list of pointers to more resources.\nThe book will describe the creation of an application. From scratch. To production. We won't develop everything to make it production ready though. The result won't be perfect. We will take shortcuts. We might even skip some edge cases handling, validation or tests. Best practices won't even be respected all the time. But we are going to touch on almost every aspect of a modern Symfony project. Controllers, Twig, HTTP Client, Mailer, Workflow, API Platform, Docker, Webpack and Encore, EasyAdmin, Messenger, Doctrine, and more.\nThe book will be \"open-source\" and published on symfony.com. I would also like to print at least 1000 copies for SymfonyCon Amsterdam. We are running out of time, but I will do my best to deliver.\nI need your help to fund my time. If we get extra money, it will be used to sponsor Symfony development by Symfony SAS (Javier, Nicolas, and me).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe timeline is tight.

We are running this Kickstarter campaign in order to raise funds for cartridge, box and manual production.\nNEScape! is a new, true 8-bit mystery escape room game for the NES. Not only that, but it is (optionally) programmed to work with a SNES mouse! It's totally your choice: play with a standard controller or play with a SNES mouse. Experience the thrill of playing a brand new NES game using a peripheral the system was never designed to work with!\nNEScape! as demoed at MAGfest, January 2019\nNEScape! is packed to the brim with puzzles of all types. Logic puzzles, music puzzles, various mini-games, spot-the-difference puzzles, auditory puzzles, scramble puzzles, etc. We took all of our favorite puzzle-types and crammed them into one game for you all to enjoy. And forgive us when we tell you, this game is hard! We wanted to err on the side of too difficult rather than too easy. But rest assured, all of the puzzles make logical sense, so you won't have to find batteries in a bag of flour (damn you Agatha Christie on the Wii).\nThe best part? None of the puzzles in the game require extensive reflexes or hand/eye coordination, so NEScape! can be enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers alike, from all age groups. If you enjoy challenging your brain, this game is for you!\nNES version\nAll officially released console versions and regions are supported: NTSC NES, PAL NES, and Famicom with a 72-to-60-pin cartridge adapter (not included). The game will auto-detect what region you're in, so there's no worry that you'll receive the wrong version of the game!\nHigh-quality clones such as the retroUSB AVS and Analogue Nt mini are also supported. Please note that this game will not work with NES clones like the Retro Duo or the Retron 5. (Note, we have sent a cartridge to Hyperkin in hopes they can add compatibility to the Retron 5. We'll be sure to let you know if they wind up being successful!) This is due to the fact that NEScape! uses a very specific mapper called GTROM that was designed by Joe Parsell (of Membler Industries) that (nerd warning!) uses nametable mirroring in unique ways that traditional mappers do not, so systems that took shortcuts in emulating the hardware will fall short of compatibility requirements. (For the record, Gauntlet and Rad Racer 2 also use this fancy mirroring. These sub-par clones don't even emulate all licensed games properly!)\nNEScape! plays perfectly in retroUSB's AVS system!\nDigital version\nAlternatively, we offer a ROM version. This allows you to play the game on your PC and other platforms through the use of an emulator. Emulators that will work without issue are harder to find, but support has grown tremendously over the past year. As previously stated, this is due to the fact that NEScape! uses a different mapper than traditional games. We will certainly provide you with information on how to acquire a working emulator.\nAlongside the ROM download, we will provide easy-to-understand instructions on how to set up an emulator to play NEScape! on a Windows PC. It has also been tested to work on Mac through use of the program Wine, as well as mobile devices via the emulator nes.emu.\nHoward Phillips (co-creator of Nintendo Power) playing NEScape! at the Midwest Gaming Classic, April 2019\nPlay With Friends!\nHave you ever sat in a room with a group of friends and played a puzzle game? It's something to behold! NEScape! lends itself perfectly to a party atmosphere, allowing everyone in the room to rambunctiously shout out ideas and then audibly gasp when one of them turns out to be the correct one. It's so much fun, you won't even want to escape!\nGTROM was designed as an affordable alternative for NES homebrew developers who wanted powerful features for a more attractive price than various competitors. It has some really great features like flash saving, which is a huge progression from the old days when games required an on-board battery that had a finite life span (please note that NEScape! itself does not feature saving of any type, as that would ruin the intense, time limited nature of the game). GTROM also supports 4-screen mirroring as well as the ability to store 8 backgrounds in memory at once, so you can do fun things like this:\nIt's true, we've designed our game to be 100% playable with a SNES mouse! Originally designed for Mario Paint, some brilliant people (who are much smarter than us!) have reverse engineered it and figured out how to use the peripheral on the original NES by way of an adapter.\nEscape room games feel like a direct successor from the old point-and-click style adventure games, so it feels completely natural using a mouse to play through it. Until, of course, you realize you are using a mouse on an original NES. Then you smile to yourself and feel like you're cheating technology in some way. But it feels like winning. Trust us. \nNot only is the official SNES mouse supported, but we've also tested our game to make sure it's 100% compatible with the newer, optical Hyperkin SNES mouse, so no matter which SNES mouse you choose to use, you can be sure that it will be supported.\nBoth the official SNES mouse (left) and the Hyperkin mouse (right) are supported!\nOur wish is to release NEScape! in cartridge format and deliver it in a package worthy of the NES.\nOf course, creating physical copies of a game isn't cheap. In the past we have had to put forth the money to purchase everything up front. This can be expensive! Kickstarter allows a better, easier path to get games out. With your help we can afford to get NEScape! out for everyone to enjoy.\nThat's why we are seeking your help!\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nKHAN Games has previously been just Kevin Hanley, all alone in his room coding until the wee hours of the night. But Kevin decided he wanted to share the joy of creating new NES games with others, so he got together with a few of his friends to create something much better and more special than anything he could ever do by himself.\nKevin: programming, sound effects\nKevin has been creating NES games since 2009 and honestly forgot what his hobbies were prior to taking the plunge into learning to program in assembly language. He loves games of all types, but point-and-click adventure games are his favorite.\nJon: background art and sprites\nJon was a fan of the NES homebrew community, never realizing that he himself could actually take part in helping to create one. After Kevin put out a public request looking for artists, he sent Kevin a reply, joking that he would be sending submissions in the form of Microsoft Paint art. Kevin called his bluff and the rest is history.\nTravis: music\nTravis is a chiptune composer who's worked in Famitracker making remixes and covers since 2013, and while he's done a few original songs before, this is his first official video game project. When Kevin put out the call for a composer, he jumped at the opportunity (giving Kevin quite a few ear worms in doing so).\nKyndal: story and puzzle consultant\nKyndal has been Kevin's homebrew photographer for years. One night Kevin went to Kyndal's house, hoping to get an idea for the first puzzle in an escape room game that he wanted to make. Four hours later they had the entire story planned, along with every single puzzle fleshed out. (If you want to throw your controller, blame her.)\nBean: resident doggie\nRuff ruff, bark, bark, howl. (I'm so glad Kevin is finally done with this game so he can spend some time with me).\nNEScape! Box Art (standard edition)\nNEScape! Box Art (limited edition)\nControl scheme, as seen in the full color manual\n\nSHIPPING DETAILS!\nWe've partnered with Antoine from Broke Studio to offer shipping outside the U.S. for an extremely affordable cost! Yes, the price you see at checkout is accurate, we got you covered!  (Note, this doesn't apply on the GO OPTICAL tier, as it would be too expensive to ship the items in bulk overseas, so we'll be handling this tier ourselves from the States.

It all fits back into the box! \nTiny Epic Tactics achieves endless layers of strategy and fun through utilizing a simple combat system with variable player powers and 3D terrain! \nNesting inside the game box are 5 smaller boxes and a map/scroll. Players will set up the game by placing these 5 boxes, plus the box bottom, onto the scroll in designated areas. This creates the environment that players will explore and battle across. \nConquer your opponents in tactical combat where every calculated move matters... or journey across the land and through the caves in a grand cooperative/solo adventure! \nIn competitive play, players will pit their teams against one another in effort to score the most victory points by the end of the game. Each turn, players will have 3 actions to assign across their team. They can move and/or attack with their heroes and different types of heroes have different ways of attacking.\nVictory points are awarded for area control, enemy heroes captured, and keeping your own heroes alive. Gaining complete control of one, or multiple, specific areas offers the most victory points in competitive play.\nGaining control of these areas requires your heroes maintaining majority presence in these areas over the course of a few turns. This requires a careful balance of offense and defense. The control of these areas can easily shift from one player to another based on which player has the majority heroes present in the designated spaces. Once a set number of areas are captured, or one of the players has lost all of their heroes, the end game is triggered. \nTiny Epic Tactics offers a distinctly different experience for solo and cooperative play. In these modes, players will adventure across the map, fighting spawning enemies and exploring caves (printed on the interior of each of the boxes).\nThe goal is to acquire treasures, that belongs to the enemy, from these caves while keeping your heroes alive. Once the end of the game is triggered, victory points are tallied based on how many treasures you took from the enemy and how many heroes you kept alive. \nYour team will consist of 4 heroes, regardless of mode you are playing. You will have one Fighter, one Wizard, one Rogue and one Beast! Each type offer different strengths and abilities.\nFighters are strong and versatile. With lots of hit points and a strong melee attack, they are a great unit to lead the battle. While their missile range is short, it proves useful when moving into position. Their special powers reinforce their ability to stand their ground or to unleash high damage in short range combat scenarios. \nWizards are powerful and resourceful. Their high damage output at long ranges can make them among the most lethal opponents on the field. However, their low hit points make them a target. If one gets caught without an escape plan, they won't be around much longer. Their special powers range from support to multiple-target attacks.\nRogues are swift and cunning. They offer good mobility combined with long range missile attacks. This makes them particularly useful in softening enemy units while bouncing from one control area to another. Their special powers range from weakening enemy units to reinforcing their pesky maneuvers.\nBeasts are relentless and reliable. They have good movement, high hit points and strong melee damage. This combination makes them an army of one. You'll be tempted to send them to one control area and the rest of your team to another. However, they lack any sort of ranged attack and their special powers typically benefit nearby teammates. So you'll want to weigh your options tactically. \nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Lanterns Mini Expansion\nThe Lanterns mini expansion adds a 'pick up and deliver' like mechanism to Tiny Epic Tactics furthering the options and replayability of the game. During the game's setup, each village is given an unlit lantern (backside of token). When a player sends one of their heroes through a portal (cave) they come out with a torch. A player can only have one of their heroes holding a torch at any given time. If a hero takes damage while holding a torch, the torch goes out. If a hero brings a torch to a village and lights the lantern of that village, the player who controls that hero collects the lantern for victory points at the end of the game. \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store. \nThe Maps Expansion is a set of box covers and scrolls. It includes everything needed to convert the 6 Evergreen Woodlands boxes into 2 different settings: the Winter Highlands and the Savage Wastelands. \nThe Maps Expansion is usable with ALL play modes. These are NOT just aesthetic changes! These change the gameplay drastically. Each map takes a different approach to where control areas are placed, how much space is between the control areas and what terrain surrounds them. This requires a different strategy on how to approach and defend the control areas resulting in a very different experience!\nNote: dungeon interiors will remain the same.\nCheck out the images and video below for a closer look at these alternative settings. \nMaps Expansion Includes:\n1 Winter Highlands Map Scroll\n 6 Winter Highlands Box Covers (to be placed over the Evergreen Woodlands boxes) \n1 Savage Wasteland Map Scroll\n 6 Savage Wasteland Box Covers (to be placed over the Evergreen Woodlands boxes) \n1 Reinforced Envelope\nThe box covers are constructed of thick premium cardstock and can be flattened after use for easy storage.\nManually add $12 to your pledge, or select the specific reward tier, if you'd like the Maps Expansion to ship with your copy of Tiny Epic Tactics.\nCheck out the video below for a rotating view of all 3 maps.\nPLAY\n\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included! \nDue to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

Run, jump, hang, climb, roll, and shoot your way through mysterious alien ruins, a flying penitentiary, a high-tech megalopolis, and a majestic forest.\nALPHA GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE:\nThe game is at approximatively 15% through development. The purpose of the alpha footage below is to show Leo's move-sets and animations, some of the levels and the sound design. The UI is far from final and I'm working on new textboxes (improving the readability and including the portraits).  \nI hope it'll give you a feel of the game's ambiance.\nAs Earth became inhospitable, Noah, an AI whose sole purpose was to preserve humanity, was created. Noah chose the Moon as humanity's Ark - renamed Lunark - using it as a ship to evacuate a handful of chosen ones to the nearest superhabitable planet. Unfortunately, whether the planet was inhabited or not was not part of Noah\u2019s programming.\nCenturies later, you play as Leo, an orphan rejected for being\u2026 different. You'll retrace your origins in the midst of a rebellion against the totalitarian regime of Lunark, and meet a wide cast of colorful characters, stuck on either side of the escalating conflict. \nI've designed Lunark as a homage to cinematic platformers while bringing modernity to a lot of the core aspects: The controls are responsive and intuitive and the progression system generous. The game is meant to feel fresh while being nostalgic. Lunark is also an adventure focused on delivering a thrilling narrative with explosive moments.\nSums up my main inspirations quite well...\nThe game will be available Nintendo Switch, PC (Windows) & Mac (OsX) in English, French, and Spanish. I hope to be able to add even more platforms and languages depending on how well the campaign and development goes. A survey will be sent to backers upon release to confirm platform choices.\nYou have no idea what a 2D cinematic platformer is?\n\u201cCinematic platformers are action-adventure platformers with a strong emphasis on realism, cinematic presentation, detailed character animations, [...] and a minimalistic approach to storytelling\u201d.

I'm originally from France but now live in Montreal, Canada. Although I've worked for several years as a graphic designer, you may know me as a pixel artist and animator in the independent video game industry or even have seen that little red-haired guy running on twitter. I've contributed to a dozen games such as Flinthook, Shovel Knight Showdown, Adventure Time, Mercenary Kings Reloaded and Rivals of Aether.\nPrince of Persia, Another World (aka Out of This World) and particularly Flashback have made a significant impact on me as a kid. Seeking to recreate the special feeling conveyed by these games, I started working on Lunark in my spare time. Given the enthusiasm around the project and how my passion grew about it, it became obvious to me that this game had to see the light. In September 2018, I took the leap and decided to quit my job to start my own independent studio: Canari Games Inc.\nI was 7 years old when I started music theory and have never stopped playing and composing since. Everything you hear in Lunark comes from me, music and SFX included. Yet, I\u2019m also enthusiastic about working with other collaborators on Lunark's OST depending on how well the campaign does! \nPLAY\n\nWith your support, my goal is to be able to remain fully independent throughout this venture; without having to look for other contracts or business partners, and allowing me to work with talented collaborators.

Sorta!\nFrom the Brothers Chaps and James Ernest comes Trogdor!! the Board Game. For centuries, the legendary wingaling dragon Trogdor the Burninator has terrorized the peasant kingdom of Peasantry with his scorching flames and greased-up beefy arm. Now, he has descended from the mountains once again and will not stop until he burninates the entire countryside and all those unfortunate enough to get in his way!\nYou and up to 5 friends -or maybe people you just paid to come over- take on the roles of a cult of hooded creepos calling themselves the Keepers of Trogdor who have devoted their lives to aiding the mighty dragon in his quest for total and complete burnination.\nJust a few of the 9 Keepers of Trogdor available in the game. More like Creepos of Trogdor if you ask me.\nTake turns guiding Trogdor on his destructive lost weekend around Peasantry. Help him avoid pesky knights and archers, devour peasants, burninate the countryside, and, of course, the thatched roof COTTAGES!!\nA flaming peasant flees her flaming cottage. Or maybe she's running back in to save her rare vinyl.\nUh oh. We got a Trog-spinner.\nAll artwork and assets not final.

The age is 14+.\nHow to burninate cottages: Surround, scorch the ground, flip that thatched-up mound. Stop-mo by Graw Mad.\nHere's Strong Sad's hands with an episode of his tabletop review series 'Six-Sadded, Die' to play through a couple turns for you:\nPLAY\n\nStack em to the heavens! Stack em to the heavens! You can play an unofficial game where you make up the rules yourself called Stack Em To The Heavens!!\nThe Wingaling Level is our base level tier. It includes the full boxed game (contents listed up the page a bit) with screen-printed wooden meeple game pieces.\nNext is the Burninator Level. It has the full boxed game with wooden meeples like the Wingaling Level, but it ALSO includes a full set of high quality plastic miniature game pieces including:\nSculpts by Rick Van Velsor. Prototype 3D printing and scanning by 3D-printingtech.com\n1 plastic Trogdor mini\n7 plastic Peasant minis\n1 plastic removable Flame Helmet for Peasants\n2 plastic Knights minis\n1 plastic Troghammer mini\n1 plastic Archer Twins mini\n3 plastic thatched roof cottage bases\n3 plastic thatched roof cottage roofs with flippable burninated underside\nNOTE: plastic miniatures come packaged separately but they WILL fit inside the box along with their wooden meeple step-siblings\nHey, guess what? Can you guess? All art and assets not final.\nHold on to your angry eyebrows because things are about to start getting fancy-go-nuts! We have partnered with the incredible artisans at Wyrmwood Gaming, makers of high-end, handcrafted wooden game boards, tables, and accessories to bring you the following insane tiers:\nDid you need more beef with your Burninator? Then you require the Wyrmwood Beefy Level. This level includes: \nthe full boxed game with meeples and plastic minis\nthis beautifully handcrafted and engraved wooden game board made of cherry.\nKeep the countryside tiles in place and flip em with ease thanks to awesome tilt-a-tile technology (I just made that name up). \nEngraved compass rose so Troggie always knows where he's going\nNOTE: this game board does NOT feature Trogdor engraved on the back like the next two tiers\nPrototype cards and minis shown above. Did we mention all art and assets NOT final?\nThe Wyrmwood Majesty Level gets even more nuts!

It has all the same contents and features of the Wyrmwood Majesty Level made with even more luxurious woods and materials and a built in Lazy-Susan! \nremovable engraved lid/game board made of fancy woods I can't pronounce: Wenge, Waterfall Bubinga, Tiger Maple inlaid with Jet, Silver stringing, and Brass! \ngameboard still has cool tilt-a-tile technology for easy flippins\nengraved compass rose so Troggie knows where he's goin' \ncard/game piece storage box \ndetachable Trogshelf with recessed Peasant Void\nseparate engraved Wenge Trog-meter\nbox dimensions: 18 13/18\" x 18 13/18\" x 2 1/4\"(2 9/16\" high with lid) \nlid/playboard dimensions: 17 15/16\" x 17 15/16\" x 13/16\"\nbuilt-in Lazy-Susan so you can rotate the board to whosoever's turn it may be!\nAll art and assets not final comes with everything you see here.\nTilt-a-tile tech in action!

The artifacts at Warmfood. Anyways, Strong Bad provided director commentary for it.\nPLAY\n\nWe know you want more! Keep supporting us, and more crazy cool things will keep happening.\nOur first stretch goal was to reach $150,000 allowing us to have new art made so the game can include all unique, non-repeating game board tiles and use spot UV on the flames on the burninated side to increase the effect of burnination (we didn't know what it meant either, it makes a part of the art shinier than the others. cool!). \nArt and assets so NOT final it hurts!\nOur second stretch goal was to reach $250,000. See that \"Stack Em To The Heavens\" gif back up the page? We're gonna turn that into a real mini game and you'll get a little canvas bag with the rules on it to keep all the meeples in so you can take em with you and play at coffee shops and DMVs everywhere! We will also be able to bring you a Companion Soundboard Website with catchy Strong Bad phrases, music, and sound effects to enhance your game play.\nYou also unlocked a new Strong Bad Email! And the email Strong Bad answers will be from a lucky backer! That's right, the next sbemail that gets made will be chosen from 'emails' submitted in the comments by backers!\nWe know you love video content, so we're bringing you more! Strong Bad will be continuing his Skills of an Artist series by drawing one of your suggestions in the comment section of the campaign in an upcoming video. \nOh man! Look! Here is that video we just mentioned a sentence or two ago! You can watch it now! Thanks to backer Chris O'Connor for the suggestion!\nWe're adding some game upgrades! We're upgrading the cards to be linen cards so they're easy to shuffle and feel luxurious right out of the box. In addition to that, we're adding some spot UV to the flames of the game box itself, giving your box the ultimate effect of burnination. \nFor our fifth stretch goal, we'll be bringing you an all new Six-Sadded, Die video but in the meantime, grab the file (innie or outie) to 3D print your own Six-Sadded, Die! Help us get to 12,000 backers so we can do it! \nArt not final!\nWe decided to give you a surprise gift when we hit 12,000 backers! Strong Bad will be adding some of his own Keeper and Item cards for the game. \nFor our sixth stretch goal, we'll be adding alternate Trogdor Meeples based on the designs by Coach Z, Strong Mad, Strong Sad, and Strong Bad to the game. We need 15,000 backers to do it! \nYou guys sorta did it!\nWe're doing that thing that campaigns do! It's Backer Burnination Bingo! Do awesome stuff in real life, help Trogdor burninate this cottage and we'll do dumb stuff in return!\nIn our game, before you can use an action to burninate a cottage, you must burninate all the surrounding terrain tiles as well as the tile the cottage is on. In such fashion, help Trogdor burninate everything by fulfilling all the dumb demands on the terrain tiles and cottage itself! Once you\u2019ve done them all, you will be rewarded by a live stream of Matt playing Strong Bad\u2019s Cool Game For Attractive People and performing all the voices LIVE until he gets tired of it, or his throat gives out!\nSubmit your achievements to Maya at maya@homestarrunner.com. When you submit pictures and content to us, know that we may post your picture in an update to show your awesomeness! You can track what achievements have been reached on this board which will be just below the stretch goal section of our campaign.\nUPDATE: We gave you the video of 25 people yelling 'Trogdor!' (though we'd still like to see that) since today (Aug 11, '18) is the 10th anniversary of the release of SBCG4AP and since the campaign's almost over. SO, On Sunday Aug 12th at 6pm EST, Matt is gonna do a Kickstarter Live while playing the game and performing the voices like we already said a couple paragraphs ago! Tune in and chat and comment and watch as the wheels come off!!\nMatt and Mattsets NOT Final.\nArt and assets NOT final. But in the ballpark. The meeply ballpark.\nWe're going to make a whole set of meeples of the 12 main Homestar Runner characters. Use them in this board game, or drop em into whatever other tabletop experience you want! You can also add these in BackerKit for an additional cost.\nOh, hey guess what? All art and images not final.\nYou allowed us to be able to make some screen-printed T-Shirt add-ons! There will be a Trogdor box art design and a 'Six-Sadded, Die.' design. You can add them in BackerKit during the survey period for an additional cost. \n\"Bring the fun of pyromania into your living room with TROGDOR! the BOARD GAME!

Even in that early form, this game was so compelling that I quit my job and alienated my family just to play it more. This game will ruin your life in the best possible way. [Think of some good \u201cburninate\u201d pun for here before sending this blurb to the Chaps]\"\n-Paul Sabourin, 48% of Paul & Storm \nThere's no good reason that the Trogdor board game took 15 years to happen other than the fact that Mike and Matt (the Homestar Runner people) started playing more board games with their kids and friends.\nTroggie seemed like an easy fit for a tabletop game, so they cranked out a janky prototype, and it kinda worked!\n3 dice AND 2 decks? What is wrong with you guys? Kerrek tracks seem cool though.\nOnce it was decided that this was not the worst idea ever, they contacted Pat Rothfuss who one time sent Limozeen a box of his fantasy novels. He made a board game once and it was good, so they asked him for advice.\nPat introduced them to James Ernest from Cheapass Games. With his help, the game became playable, perhaps even... enjoyable!\nCourtroom sketches of Pat and James.\nWhile James playtested and iterated all over the place, Chris Schweizer got busy working on art for the game and our pal Rick Van Velsor (who sculpted the Homestar and Cheat Commandos figurines) began sculpting designs for the vinyl miniatures (available in the Burninator level and above). \nRick Van Velsor takes our janky 3D Tinkercad prototype and molds it into pure majesty!\nNow, the game is ready to be produced and played by burnination enthusiasts everywhere.\nFor updates outside of Kickstarter, like our Facebook page and follow us on Twitter. Our Community Manager Maya (Secret Hitler) will be posting there with reminders about the updates here as well as stretch goal and add-on announcements. You can reach out to them at maya@homestarrunner.com if you have any additional questions. \nWe will be using our friends over at Amplifier to ship you your stuff to the rest of the world and BackerKit to collect your survey information.

They smell chemically abrasive, cheap, and without any real quality. It was this problem that lead me to develop my own natural deodorant with custom designed fragrances. And I am so happy with how they turned out.\nMy Co.\n5 years ago I launched my first Kickstarter campaign, which became one of the most successful of its kind. That enormous front-end support allowed me to start Misc. Goods Co. and create more and more products that my customers have come to trust. \nFor this new project I\u2019m venturing into a different market to solve a problem I see. This means that my initial risk is to produce 5,000 sticks of deodorant with a portion of that production cost covered by your pledges. This Kickstarter page is dedicated to bringing that product to market - a Natural Deodorant by Misc. Goods Co. \nOur team, while working alongside the British perfumer Sarah McCartney of the company 4160 Tuesdays, spent months conceptualizing the scents. We designed 20 prototypes before landing on two complex, earthy and unique fragrances made from the world\u2019s best natural essential oils and botanical extracts. We call them Underhill and Valley of Gold.\nAbout the Smells\nUnderhill is a scent inspired by the smells of traveling in nature. A mix of 14 ingredients, the fragrance is deep and complex with aromas of wild herbs such as Rosemary and Athelas, along with leather, pipe tobacco, several wood species, open air and a sweet scent of freshly poured (or spilled) ale.\nValley of Gold is the smell of wild gardens in blossom amidst woods; a place where rose, lavender, geranium, myrtle and broom flower grow freely alongside rosemary, honey bush and surrounding trees. This arrangement creates a balanced, floral, earthy smell, which combines 11 ingredients.\nAbout the Deodorant\nAluminum Free and Paraben Free.\nWe\u2019ve added these fragrances to our natural solid deodorant base, manufactured here in the United States. Some of the most common ingredients are Arrowroot Powder, Shea Butter, Coconut Oil and Jojoba Oil. Visit our FAQ to see the full list of ingredients. \nThis deodorant is formulated to keep you smelling nice all day.\nThe Dopp Kit\nWe're also releasing a brand new traveler's dopp kit exclusively for this Kickstarter campaign. We worked with our local friend and bag maker Austin of Koester Co. to help us develop our concept of how a toiletry bag should look and feel. This bag can easily carry all of your bathroom items as you move from place to place. It\u2019s made from heavy duck canvas and designed with a roll top, fastened by a leather strap and brass o-rings. Also made in the USA.\nThe Solid Colognes\nAnd lastly, our Solid Colognes can be purchased alongside our Natural Deodorants for this campaign. \nThe fragrance of traditional liquid perfumes and colognes can dissipate quickly because they easily evaporate, especially when you perspire.\nOur solid beeswax-based balms stay on longer, with the deep and complex scents of Underhill or Valley of Gold that can last all day. Like many of our products, it\u2019s made to carry with you, wherever you travel. The replaceable cologne insert holds .22oz and fits into a case (2.1x2.9x.67 in.) made of cherry or walnut wood and held together by two sets of magnets. \nTestimonials\nWe know that you can't smell these scents through your screen, so below are some testimonials from different people we asked to test both Underhill and Valley of Gold Natural Deodorant.\nRewards\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo make this product we need to produce 5,000 sticks of deodorant.

Some of the great titles that inspired the design were Stone Age, Agricola, 7 Wonders, and Race for the Galaxy.\nIn summary, gameplay for Everdell is as follows: On your turn, you may either place a worker or play a card.\nPlacing a worker allows you to gather resources to play cards, draw more cards into your hand, or other various actions which will benefit you in different ways.\nBy playing cards, you are building your own city which will consist of Critters and Constructions. Constructions are played by paying the raw resources, and Critters are played by paying berries--or a Critter can be played for free if you have their corresponding Construction already in your city.\nView from the Ever Tree\nThere are five different factions of cards in the game:\nGreen Production activates immediately when played and once during season production.\nMaroon Destination serves as a placement location for workers.\nBlue Governance give you rewards after playing certain card types, or offer unique ways to bend the rules.\nGrey Traveler activate once immediately when played.\nPurple Prosperity give bonus end game points based on other cards in your city.\nPlayers are limited to 15 cards in their city. The rewarding challenge of the game is to optimize on your opportunities to build a strong engine of cards and combos that will serve you well, not only to produce resources, but ultimately to reach the most points before the end of the game.\nThe deck weighs in at 128 cards, featuring 48 unique card types (28 Constructions and 28 Critters), all of which work in different and interesting ways to offer tactical and strategic forms of play. The game is designed with high replayability in mind, while still offering enough straightforward decisions to be easily accessible. \nEvery game of Everdell also features eight Events which all players will be competing to achieve. Four of these Events are standard for every game, but the other four are random from a total of 16 unique Events. These powerful rewards are thematically designed and help to give players a focused goal, albeit a goal that others are working toward as well.\nPlayers have their own hand of cards that grows and changes as the game progresses, but there are also eight face-up cards available to choose from at all times as well. These face-up cards are open to every player, working as an open draft of sorts.\nTimely placement of your workers, smart utilization of card abilities and combos, and achieving Events before your opponents will ensure that the sun shines brightest on your own unique corner of Everdell.\nRead the rules here (currently using placeholder prototype artwork and component images).\nThe Art of Everdell\nAndrew Bosley is Everdell's amazing artist! Andrew is currently working on all the art for the game, and will be completed shortly after the campaign ends. When all the art is done, the game is going to look MAGICAL!\nAnd here is a teaser of some of the Critters being worked on...\nand the Constructions.

Set in Aughmoore, the world of Tiny Epic Kingdoms and Heroes of Land, Air & Sea.\nHOOK: Fast paced, portable co-op, with a unique turn-deck mechanic.\nWIN: Defeat the Epic Foe!  \nLOSE: Let your Capital City get destroyed!\nBASE STORY: After the Great War (Tiny Epic Kingdoms), many of the factions, shattered and defeated, looked for something to cling to. One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions\u2019 leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace\u2026 but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.\nEXPANSION STORY: Aughmoore is in ruins. The evil could not be contained and its darkness has spread to every region of the world. Shattering villages and infecting all forms of life. There has never been a more dire need for Heroes. Everyone who remains must rise up, must unite, and must risk everything to preserve what little spirit remains.\nTiny Epic Defenders: The Dark War, an expansion to Tiny Epic Defenders, is the latest installment in Chronicles of Aughmoore. It introduces new Heroic characters like the Lionkin Charioteer and the Birdfolk Shadow Walker. It also introduces new Epic Foes, new Dire Enemies, and new Artifacts, but more importantly, it introduces new and exciting features that keep players making difficult choices from the edge of their seats.\nThese new features include a Campaign Mode with Enemy Generals, Skills that Heroes can learn, Advanced Regions and Caravans.\nCaravans represent the shattered homes of villagers during this dark time and are spread across all the Regions. Players are faced with the additional challenge of rescuing these Caravans and escorting them safely to the Capital City before they are can defeat the Epic Foe.\nSkills are useful abilities players can assign to their Heroes and require Experience Points to activate. Experience Points are now earned during play by making meaningful decisions that help the party reach their goals.\nThe Campaign Mode plays like an evolving gauntlet challenge, where players must play through the game multiple times, facing Generals at the intervals instead of the regular Epic Foe. The different abilities players will have at their disposal, as well as the threats they face, are unique to each Campaign and evolve with the choices players make during each Campaign. If players can survive long enough, they will face an Epic Foe at the conclusion of the Campaign.\nThe Advanced Regions introduce new threats and also new abilities to aid the players in The Dark War. These new threats and abilities come in the way of 3D constructs like a giant Tree Heroes can hide in, a flying Manticore Heroes can ride, or mysterious Sandstorms! They play a big part in the evolving Campaign Mode. Each Advanced Region features a dark, harmful, side and a light, helpful, side. As players progress through the Campaign Mode, they will work to restore the dark regions to their helpful side. Making the right choices to restore these Regions and rescue the Caravans is critical to achieving victory in Campaign Mode.\nOwn the original Tiny Epic Defenders and curious about what the changes are? Here's what's changed: \nAll new art, component upgrade to include ITEMeeples\u00ae, gameplay changes to give players more control over the outcome of the game, and as a result, it's more fun!

This Add-On is covered by a 30 Day *Money-Back Guarantee!\n  Heroes of Land, Air & Sea is a 4X style board game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) for 1-6* players that plays in 2-3 hours (30m/player), and features 80 highly detailed miniatures and over 30 constructs! *Plays up to 6 players with the deluxe expansion. It is easy to learn, simple to play, and won't take up your entire weekend. It is a Scott Almes design after all, designer of the Tiny Epic series.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea is this simple: each player performs two actions per round. You can take a Capital Action, which could be followed by other players by using a serf. Or, you may take a Conquest action, which can be mustered to allow you to double down on your own actions. After each player has taken their two actions, players will collect resources based on the regions they control and then start a new round. This continues until a player triggers one of the four end game conditions: Expand, Exploit, Explore, or Exterminate! \nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, Scott has us warring across a giant game board (26 x 26 in. that extends to 39 x 26 in.), sailing the great blue sea in boats that actually hold your minis!\nAnd soaring through the clouds with minis on the backs of dragons, griffins, and in airships!\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea is the classic tale of orcs vs humans and the warring factions of a fantasy realm. It is a game of territory control, resource management, mastering your faction and exploiting your opponent's weaknesses.\nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea you'll have 3 heroes, each with special abilities that will become more powerful as the game goes on. You'll have 5 warriors, which will defend your capital city and conquer regions across the land. You will also have 12 serfs, who are used to collect resources, build buildings, as well as take extra actions through a clever follow mechanic. Serfs are a limited resource, so you must deploy them wisely in order to ensure victory.\nWill you rely on the resourcefulness of the Human's? The strength of the Orc? The ingenuity of the Dwarves? or the magic of the Elves?\n      In Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, every decision is a meaningful decision and players will need to be clever to claim victory. One way to surprise your opponent is through well timed use of SPELLS! The effects of which range from resource gain and buffs to your army to interrupts and counter spells. \nBut the focus is always on the 4 X's: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate! Each of them represent an end game trigger.\nEXPLORE  \nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea features a giant 26 inch by 26 inch beautifully illustrated 4-fold game board, and expands to 39 inch by 26 inch with the Expansion board!\nClick to see the Full Map with the Extended Board! \u00a9 2017 Gamelyn Games, all rights reserved.\n  During play, the land and water regions will feature exploration tokens that offer surprises to the players brave enough to enter.\nOnce the final exploration token is revealed, the end of the game is triggered.  \nEXPAND  \nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea you will need to expand your kingdom, your army and your reach. Building certain structures in your Capital will allow you to recruit Heroes! \nAnd, Heroes become better as you level up your Capital City.\nRecruit all of your serfs and warriors and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nEXPLOIT \nThis wouldn't be much of a 4X without the most important X, exploitation! Simply collecting resources and turtling in your castle won't get you very far in Heroes of Land, Air & Sea. Players will need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their faction and that of their opponents to assure victory. Part of that is knowing when and where to build your towers to secure area control. Build 3 towers and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nEXTERMINATE\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea features a luckless combat system that requires timing and wits. To resolve a war, players compare the strength value of their armies, as modified by their selection of a single Tactic Card, highest strength wins. Each player has an identical deck of 7 Tactic Cards and, in each war, must secretly choose one of the 7 to play in conjunction with their army.\nThis gives players perfect information on the potential maneuvers of their opponent. But, how you will exploit this during play is up to you to discover!  \nDestroy an opponent's Capital City and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nVICTORY  \nVictory points can be earned during play for winning wars, casting spells, and certain hero abilities; and at the end of the game for certain units trained, regions controlled, buildings built, towers built (based on their distance from your Capital City), and the level of your Capital City. \nWhoever have the highest victory points at the end of the game, wins!\nEXPAND YOUR GAME\nDon't miss out on expanding your game to support 5 and 6 players and getting 4 more incredible factions. The stalwart Lionkin, the ravenous Undead, the tribal Lizardfolk, and the sprawling Goblins! You'll want to try them all!\n      MERCENARIES\nMercenaries are a Kickstarter promo that will not be available in retail, though future players will be able to buy them directly from Gamelyn Games. For backing us on Kickstarter, you are getting them for FREE! \nIn game, the Mercenaries are essentially super buff Heroes available to purchase for any player. First come, first serve.

Therefore this project may not have as many Stretch Goals as you are used to seeing.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have many years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with our long time partners Panda Game Manufacturing. Who we've worked with on over 10 separate projects and have a great relationship with. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping.\n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 5 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment. I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! Let's bring Heroes of Land, Air & Sea to game tables all around the world!\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe offer a full refund, including fees, up to 14 days after the project ends.

Explore a vast world to find the techno sword, the only effective weapon against the threat.\nThe aesthetic of the game is inspired by retro pixel adventures (Castlevania, Another World, Double Dragon) with a modern touch (Superbrothers, Sword and Sorcery) and an 80s plot homage (Ready Player One, He-Man, The Last Starfighter),  accompanied by the retro synth touch of the old glory days.\n  Pure handcrafted pixel sprites with rich and complex animations.\nA homage to the 80's that tastes like retro but is also new. Narita Boy reloads the creative canons to find an unique style that combines the past and the future of video games\nClassic 2D scroller action with new exotic time and dimension jump mechanics, RPG elements and amazing worlds to explore; from the streets of the 80s to the weird futuristic landscapes of another dimension.\nAn awesome Soundtrack inspired by the glory days of analog synthesizers.\nThe Story will put you through a journey between dimensions, neglecting the ebbs and turns of Time itself.

Lionel Pearl, a genius and a mysterious computer engineer, has created a console (Narita one) and a game (Narita boy) that are sold together.\n The game is a tremendous success and has become a cultural icon. Posters and action figures of Narita Boy are a common find at teenagers\u2019 rooms.\nNowadays it is the most requested console and game among youth. \nHowever, the shrouds between worlds are thinning and game has become reality.\n The Silent Eclipse is weakening the defenses of the Digital Kingdom.\nThe Stallions are coming and we need a real hero.\n This is our Story trailer:\n    You are the legendary hero, Narita Boy.\nYou have been called to fulfill the arduous task of defending the Digital Kingdom from the Stallion invasion.\nYou are the chosen one, The Ultimate Hero. Within you, Trichroma Energy flows and you are the only capable of wield the Techno Sword.\n   The Techno Sword \nThe Techno Sword was forged by the Techno Fathers, using the powerful energy that emerges from the Core of the Digital Kingdom.\nThe Techno Parents are an ancient sect that venerate the Trichroma, the vital energy of the Digital Kingdom. Inspired by the core they learned to manipulate this energy and forged it into the Legendary Sword.\n\nThe Trichroma is the essence of the plane and it flows through everything in the digital realm. The Trichroma is formed by three rays of colours. The Techno Sword is forged with these rays and its high concentration of Trichroma is so powerful that only Narita Boy can wield it.\n   The Stallions are a dark force from the lower dimensions.\nThey are the DEVILISH invaders who yearn for the Conquest of the Digital Kingdom. They are out to steal the Trichroma, the powerful and infinite energy that emanates from the Core.\nThey are the dark forces that you will encounter during the game. Each with unique skills, from black blades to dark magic. Prepare to fight them until your last breath!\nHIM, he is the leader of the Stallion Invasion. The Antagonist. The Dark Warlock.

Travel across vast forests full of mysteries, sail oceans, run through stormy valleys, climb snowy mountains and explore caves where no one has ever been. More surprises awaits you in this adventure where environments are a key character.\nThe dark side of the Digital Kingdom\nThe digital realm is divided into two hemispheres. The north side, under the influence of Trichroma energy, and the south side, where the energy does not reach. In that area dangers lurk. The creatures that live there are anxious to feed on Trichroma. Among the dark speckled moorings of neon blue you will be the object of their desire. Move forward with extreme care, not only the Stallion will be looking for you.\nBack to the 80s\nPerhaps the plot will even take you back to Your Own 80\u2019s... I cannot say more ...

For 10 months Eduardo was both consciously  and unconsciously developing the Narita Boy Universe. Thousand of draws at every corner have been necessary to shape this world.\nWe also have been working in the development of the trailer that has taken us more than 100 animation and 4 different versions of the music. We are going to recycle most of the animations at the production stage.\nWe are currently prototyping some events and working on the character behaviour. Narita Boy is little by little getting responsive and alive in the unity dimension. \nWhy Kickstarter\nThis is my story.\nI am Eduardo Fornieles, director of Narita Boy.\nMaking games has been always my dream. I always wanted to express my universe and imagination through it.\nI have worked for two game developer companies in Tokyo. I always felt that working for other people was teaching me a lot but was also limiting my creativity, As a consequence, these experiences increased my motivation to develop my own game. My blood, my breath and my body smell has always tasted indie\nThe idea of \"Narita Boy\" came in the 2016 spring, while living in Tokyo. I  had just left \"Friend & Foe\" where I contributed to the development of Vane (PS4) and was looking for an idea for my own game. I had a stroke of idea  and started to insanely work on the characters and the backgrounds of the universe that was growing on my mind.\n  I have been working full-time for this project since then. I moved back to Spain to finish the trailer and teasers and start the Kickstarter campaign. I\u2019m currently living with my wife and son at my parent\u2019s summer house while thinking of all the great minds that started their dreams at their parent\u2019s garage.\nMy team members have worked with love and passion (and patience) in the Narita Boy trailer for free. Now is the time to support them financially and also makes my wife feel a bit safer. I am grateful for all the support and hard work of the team members of Narita Boy.\nI need you to make Narita Boy a playable game as the Digital Kingdom needs Narita Boy to save them from the Stallion invasion. If you feel the call after watching the trailer, please help us. Believe in us as we believe in the power of the Mother Board, the Digital Fathers and the Trichroma. We thank you for your support and for being part of this great project. We will honor your help and we will not disappoint you.\nAmazing digital & physical Rewards!

Narita Boy is not only a game but also an experiment and an artistic and sensorial piece of code. The purpose is to blend retro and modern games based on Eduardo\u2019s passion for the 80s.\n These are some Narita Boy designs. The search for an iconic character has taken us time. The idea was to be able to synthesize the character as much as possible so as not to complicate his movements or to recharge him with unnecessary details.\n\"Just remember you are BRAVER than you believe, STRONGER than you seem and SMARTER than you think.\"-Winnie the Pooh\nThanks for watching!

The first player to complete the puzzle by positioning their heroes accordingly collect the quest card and its benefits. \n  Each round is broken down into two phases, the day phase and the night phase.\n  In the night phase, players will roll adventure dice in a communal press-your-luck fashion to try to accomplish the tasks at the locations they ended at during the day phase. This could be fighting a goblin, learning a spell, or delving into a temple. But be careful, if you take too much damage you may exhaust and lose all that round's progress and more! \nPlayers keep track of their heroes' collective health, power and progress on personal adventure logs.\nAnd when you acquire powerful items, you equip them right to your ITEMeeples\u2122! \nPlayers keep track of their spell progress, and the rounds magic level on a community magic mat. As the round's magic increases, goblins become more threatening and even your own power turns from good to bad!\nAfter five rounds, the game is over. While you may not have single handedly saved the world, did you accomplish more than the other players? Whoever has the most points in the end from goblins killed, spells learned, quests accomplished, and legendary items acquired, wins the game!\n    Help us stretch on Social Media: \nClick to visit us on Facebook!\n    Click to find us on Twitter!\n  More stretch goals:\n                          Community Suggested Stretch Goal!\n  This is a DELUXE ONLY Stretch Goal.\n      Glorious Victories are digital content for the Premium Print 'N Play.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with our long time partners Panda Game Manufacturing. Who we've worked with on over 10 separate projects and have a great relationship with. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked again for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 4 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

It was painstakingly engineered to provide a backyard fire experience that cannot be duplicated. Using our patented design and specialized construction process, we have created the most beautiful single unit fire pit ever. Prepare yourself to be wowed by the Bonfire's mesmerizing flames and come closer together with friends and family outdoors.\n  Each portion of the bonfire is made of the highest grade 304 stainless steel and perfectly measured and formed. The bonfire presented us with some unique design challenges that required us to create custom tools.  These tools, along with a precision construction process, and intricate multi-step finishing and polishing process result in a product that is both beautiful and durable.\nThe Bonfire is designed with a double wall to maximize the airflow of the burning process. The bottom holes allow oxygen to the feed the fire from below while simultaneously channeling warm oxygen up between the walls of the stove. This burst of preheated oxygen feeding back into the fire through the top holes causes a secondary combustion that results in a cleaner and more complete burn. \nA more complete burn means no more half burnt logs to deal with. It also means very little smoke which means no more dodging smoke that seems to follow your every move. \nA more efficient burn also means your wood will burn much longer compared to an open fire.  \nWhat Makes The Bonfire Special?\nEngineered Airflow\nOur proprietary design allows the Bonfire to utilize airflow in the burning process like no other fire pit. Perfectly sized and placed air intake holes are located on the outside bottom and inside top of the fire pit. Each hole has been spaced with precision. The bottom holes of the fire pit draws in oxygen to further fuel the fire from underneath. The air from the bottom holes also travels up through the double wall, being heated along the way and finally channeled out the inner top holes. This entire airflow process is continual and has been deliberately engineered to maximize efficiency.\n  Fire Ring\nThe fire ring is formed from a single piece of 304 stainless steel. It is deep drawn with precision tooling and hand polished. The fire ring is specifically designed to keep the fire centered and even. It sits securely on the top and when turned upside down, nests inside for simple storage.\n Easy To Use\nThe Bonfire\u2019s singular construction completely removes the need for parts and assembly. There is literally no setup. The Bonfire won't scorch the ground under it so it's safe to use on your porch, grass or patio. It was designed so standard sized firewood logs can be stacked inside. After an initial fire has started, the airflow process will begin to help the wood ignite. There is no need to wrestle with burning logs or dodge smoke and sparks. \n  Easy Storage\nWant to take your Bonfire to a friend's house, the beach or out to a campsite? No problem! Each Solo Stove Bonfire comes with a weather resistant nylon carry bag.\n  Solo Stove Buzz\nOur Story\nSolo Stove has been making high-end wood burning backpacking and camp stoves since 2011. Our products have been tested in the deserts of Jordan by Backpacker Magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief, Dennis Lewon, and pushed to the limits in the hands of survivalists like Matt Graham (Discovery Channel\u2019s Dual Survival) and Joel Lambert (Discovery Channel\u2019s Lone Target). We\u2019ve won numerous awards including gear of the year awards from 50 Campfires and Section Hiker. But what we\u2019re most proud of is being a part of people\u2019s outdoor adventures.\nWe love the outdoors and we do what we do because making gear that helps people get outside and spend time together is meaningful to us. In today\u2019s busy hustle and bustle lifestyle, we feel there is an ever-increasing need for more of this.\nWe realize that even though people want to get outdoors together, it\u2019s not easy. Not everyone has time to go on an extended multi-day backpacking or camp trip with friends or family. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making the Solo Stove Bonfire. We\u2019re making it easier for you to enjoy the best part of an outdoor adventure in your own backyard \u2013 a killer BONFIRE!\nWe\u2019ve engineered the Bonfire to be the ultimate backyard fire pit. But the meticulous engineering isn\u2019t what\u2019s most important. What\u2019s most important is how easy it will now be to head outside and enjoy the roaring glow of a Bonfire and the company of friends and family.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe good news is that this isn\u2019t our first rodeo. Solo Stove has been selling award-winning products since 2011. This is not the first product we\u2019ve developed so we\u2019re confident in our ability to deliver to the Kickstarter community. We have the designs finished, materials purchased, tooling completed, prototypes tested and our partner factory is ready to go. Receiving the support from the Kickstarter community will help us start and scale production.\n\nQuality is very important to us. We will have our quality team inspect production on the line and after production is completed. We don't foresee any major problems with production but in the unlikely event that quality issues do arise, we'll be sure to inform all backers right away. We take pride in our craft and we will only ship product that we are proud of. \n\nLogistics and fulfillment plans are already in place to ensure safe arrival and prompt delivery to our backers. Again, it's unlikely that any major issue would arise but if anything comes up, you'll be the first to know.\n\nWe\u2019re grateful for your help and support.

Inventory risk: We already have the production prototypes (10 blue units). However, We don't know yet the interest level from Kickstarter backers. Throughout the campaign, we'll monitor the number of orders closely and adjust our production as quickly as possible.\n\n2.

We are Andrew Peterson, author of the bestselling and award-winning book series, The Wingfeather Saga, J. Chris Wall, animation producer extraordinaire, veteran director Tom Owens and CGI visual development expert Keith Lango. We are teaming up to bring the quirky and harrowing stories of the book series to animated life. Between us is a mashup of experience from How to Train Your Dragon / VeggieTales / 3-2-1 Penguins and Portal. Yeah. Awesome, right? We think you\u2019ll love our series and we need your help!\nWe raised $250k to create a half-episode pilot animated short film!\nBeginning now, you have the chance to help create a new animated kids series by funding the pilot episode. This will do two things - prove there is an audience for it and maybe convince a network to make a permanent spot for us.\nSo what stretch goals have been met and what do I get?\nAn animated short film with these characters from the book: Janner, Kalmar, Leeli, Slarb, Nugget, Thwaps, Nia, Podo, Gnorm and Peet the Sock Man!\n5 Illustrated Short Stories from Aerwiar in The Wingfeather Tales eBook. See the list of amazing guest authors and illustrators lower on the page!\nNOW we get to add a 6th Wingfeather Tales short story - from none other than Andrew Peterson!

And we're excited to have Jay Myers joining us to create it!\nNOW the animated short becomes a half-pilot and we get to create the town of Glipwood! This will allow us to make a significantly deeper experience with the characters and story in Aerwiar!\nPlus, whatever Reward level you pledged!\nAll Physical Reward Levels DURGAN and above Get these Bonus Stretch Rewards:\nBacker Goal Reward of an exclusive Wingfeather Saga bookmark\nPrintable coloring pages + temporary tattoos\nAn additional patch for the Bookbindery Guild + an additional mini-poster of Janner\nAn additional patch for The Houndry Guild + an additional mini-poster of Leeli\nAn additional mini-poster of Kalmar\nNOW a printed version of The Wingfeather Tales!

We'll follow up later with a survey to make sure you get the rewards you want. And Yes! We do offer the t-shirts in all adult and youth sizes, including men's and ladies' cut!\nOur fans answered quickly when we launched our project, showing how beloved this series is. Reaching that minimum goal gives us a few minutes of animation in a short film. And that\u2019s great! But we\u2019re not done yet!! With your help, we can create a half or maybe even a full pilot episode of the new Wingfeather Saga animated series!\nPre-production CGI render of Janner and a Toothy Cow\nThe story of The Wingfeather Saga is unique among other animated series in that while the core target is 7-12yr old fans, it is a perilous epic with a self-aware tone that we think will engage \u201cover-the-shoulder\u201d viewing. In other words, we are making our series something really cool for the whole family! Check out our first test scene in this animatic:\nYes, the series will be built in 3D (CGI)!\nAs we began meeting with major distributors, we felt like we should reach out to our amazing fans first! We want to ensure that we are able to make the series that the fans want \u2014 a new experience adapted from the books, but without a network attempting to interpret our audience for us!\nThe Wingfeather Saga blends the whimsy and heart of THE PRINCESS BRIDE with the vastness and peril of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. After living for years under occupation by the evil Fangs of Dang, the Igiby children find a map rumored to lead to the lost Jewels of Anniera---the one thing the Fangs will do anything to find---and the family is thrown headlong into a perilous adventure, uncovering hidden truths about who they are that will change their world forever. If you missed it, check out the teaser!\n*We also have an excerpt from the first book in the series, On The Edge Of The Dark Sea Of Darkness, which will give you a taste of our story. Read it and if you like it, come back here and join in the adventure. Better hurry!\nWe're still pinching ourselves about the enormous show of support from our Wingfeather fans when, in 2013, right here on Kickstarter we hit 840% of our goal in order to publish The Warden and the Wolf King.\nBy raising our first goal of $110k, we\u2019ll be able to make an animated short film with our favorite characters Janner, Kalmar and Leeli in the whimsical and deadly world of Aerwiar. The higher we go with stretch goals, the more characters we'll be able to animate, which will allow us to broaden the scope of the animated short. We'll decide on the scene once we know how many goals we reach and how many characters we can animate!\nBut wait, there\u2019s more!\nWe\u2019ve invited some of our amazing friends, who just happen to be award-winning authors and artists, to help us create a very special illustrated, limited edition digital eBook called Wingfeather Tales, which will be a collection of short stories that will explore lots of untold bits from Skree to Dugtown and Clovenfast and the Green Hollows. Andrew's going to work with these authors and illustrators to fling open the doors to Aerwiar one more time. (I have a feeling we'll learn a bit more of Podo's childhood, and maybe we'll find out what Shadowblade and the Florid Sword have been up to...) For our launch goal, we\u2019ll get to create one story, and with each successive goal we'll add more to the Wingfeather Tales book. The first will be written by Douglas McKelvey (The Angel Knew Papa and the Dog) and illustrated by Aedan Peterson (Pembrick's Creaturepedia).\nWith our next goal of $125k, we\u2019ll get to add additional characters to our animated short film\u2014thwaps, those pesky critters that trouble the gardens of the people of Skree. We\u2019ll also be able to add a second Wingfeather Tales short story, written by Jonathan Rogers (The Wilderking Trilogy) and illustrated by Justin Gerard (The Monster in the Hollows).\nWith our third goal of $135k, we\u2019re excited to add everybody's favorite former pirate, Podo Helmer, to our animated short film. And we\u2019ll get a third Wingfeather Tales short story, written by Jennifer Trafton (The Rise and Fall of Mt. Majestic) and illustrated by John Hendrix (Drawing is Magic, Miracle Man).\nFor our fourth goal of $145k, we\u2019ll be able to tell a story that adds yet another character to our animated short film, the noble Nia. She's the mother of our heroes, and carries a secret that will change everything for them. And we\u2019ll get a fourth Wingfeather Tales short story, this one written by A.S. Peterson (The Fiddler\u2019s Gun) and illustrated by Doug TenNapel (Ghostopolis, Cardboard).\nOur fifth goal is a big one at $175k and we're excited to add the Fang Commander Gnorm and a second character, fan-favorite Peet the Sock Man, to our animated short film! Plus, we\u2019ll get a fifth Wingfeather Tales short story. We\u2019re excited to have writer N.D. Wilson (100 Cupboards) and illustrations by Joe Sutphin (The Warden and the Wolf King).\nThe $250k expansion goal! We\u2019ll get to design the town of Glipwood as part of our animation production and, more importantly, DOUBLE the story length to create a half episode pilot. That means more characters, more adventures and more of Aerwiar.\nOh man, do we have lots more rewards we'd love to unlock as we head towards creating a full pilot episode.\nHow Can You Help? Backer Goals!\nWe REALLY want as many people as possible to share about The Wingfeather Saga! So, we've made a special set of rewards to encourage you, our fine backers, to spread the word. When we hit 10 of these goals, every backer that has a physical reward will get an exclusive Wingfeather Saga bookmark, plus a very entertaining commentary track from Andrew and Chris (and maybe a few special guests). At 20 of these goals, it unlocks a whole host of behind-the-scenes features!\nClick on the images below to be whisked away to each page!\n                                                Rewards\nHopefully, the most compelling part of this project is seeing The Wingfeather Saga come to life on the screen! We also wanted to come up with some really unique and interesting rewards to say 'thank you' for supporting us on our way towards making the project. If you are interested in Add-On Rewards in addition to your pledge level reward, we have those available for the \"Song Maiden $25\" level and up!

Fittingly, he started it off with a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign achieved its $135,000 fundraising goal on Tuesday, and by Thursday morning Ries had more than $170,000 in pledges.\"\u2013\u2013Vox\n\"Ries turned to Kickstarter as an experiment in research, writing, and marketing. He didn't want to write in a vacuum.\" \u2013\u2013Fast Company\nHi, my name is Eric Ries. I\u2019m an entrepreneur and the author of The Lean Startup. \nSince writing The Lean Startup, I\u2019ve traveled around the world, helping companies of every size adopt the Lean Startup approach. In just five years, the Lean Startup movement has grown and transformed in ways I never could have imagined. I\u2019ve worked with founders developing new apps, entrepreneurs at hypergrowth pre-IPO tech startups, and managers at the largest, slowest, most heavily-regulated and bureaucratic organizations in the world. \nThat's me!\nFor all of the enthusiasm I\u2019ve witnessed, though, I\u2019ve seen a lot of people who immediately \u201cgot\u201d it then struggle after experiencing the challenges that come when trying to build a new company or transform an existing one using this methodology. My work lately has revolved around helping people overcome those obstacles and set up systems, team structures and ways of working that support continuous innovation and sustainable growth.\nAnd now, I want to share what I've learned with you.\nThe Leader\u2019s Guide will be a 4-color, 250-page, hardcover and digital book offered exclusively through Kickstarter. In fact, I made an agreement with Crown (my publisher) that it will only be offered to Kickstarter backers and only for the length of this campaign. It cannot be sold in bookstores. \nThe Leader\u2019s Guide is aimed at entrepreneurs, executives, or anyone leading a project or team. It will be full of stories about how companies both large and small are adopting Lean Startup methods to scale successfully and operate in conditions of extreme uncertainy.\nThe Leader\u2019s Guide is for both those who are new to Lean Startup as well as those who love the methodology in principle, but want to know more about how to put it into practice. It will include lots of real-world examples about how entrepreneurs are tackling questions like:\nHow can I convince my team that testing our early ideas with customers does not mean they should sacrifice quality or forget about our vision?\nHow can I convince senior leadership that innovation projects require a different system of accounting? \nHow can I do Lean Startup-style experimentation in a highly-regulated industry? \nHow can I incentivize and reward my team for working in a cross-functional way?\nHow can we turn functional specialists in areas like IT, HR and finance into allies when it comes to supporting new ideas?\nI think of The Leader\u2019s Guide as a kind of master class in applying the Lean Startup methodology. I can\u2019t possibly work with all the companies who ask for help, but I can do my best to translate the work I do into book form. The Leader's Guide will also answer some of the most frequently-asked questions and dispel the myths surrounding the Lean Startup, as well as include tips and tricks from people who've been using the method successfully.\nSo if you\u2019re just discovered The Lean Startup, you're a practitioner who wants a deeper dive, or you\u2019re at a company trying to incorporate it at scale, this is a great next step. \nThe Leader\u2019s Guide in both its hardcover and digital formats will ship to backers in late 2015.\nThe Leader\u2019s Guide will give you the tools you need to execute Lean Startup principles in a wide range of environments\u2014but I have another goal in sharing it with you.\nThis campaign is also an experiment designed to see how I can collaborate with all of you as part of the research process for my next book (working title: The Startup Way). I want to capture the experiences, stories, and learnings of those who support this campaign as they put these ideas to use. \nI want to see what happens when these ideas escape into the wild. \nWe live in a highly-connected world that allows authors like me to get and give instant feedback to and from their readers. I have benefitted from this collaborative landscape at every stage in my career as an author. I tested the concepts at the foundation of The Lean Startup in talks and workshops and on my blog. And as I was writing that book, I had a trusted team of advisors who shared their feedback with me at every step of the editorial process. \nI want my new book to be researched, written and published in a way that is consistent with the methodology I believe in\u2014and Kickstarter provides a platform for an even deeper level of collaboration with my readers. This will be an entirely new kind of publishing process for me, and one that I hope delivers a great deal of learning about how to publish a book successfully in the 21st Century.\nFor someone who loves the experimentation process as much as I do, this is a thrilling proposition. I know how many of you share my love of the Lean Startup, who believe deeply in its potential to create stronger, leaner companies full of people who know that their work has value and their time is not being wasted. And so it's my hope (and my hypothesis) that you'll want to come along for the ride.\nI think of The Leader\u2019s Guide as a kind of roadmap\u2014but maps can only take us so far. \nOne of the things I love about Kickstarter is that it allows backers to engage not only with creators, but also with other supporters and community members. It's an ideal platform for continual learning\u2013an idea at the heart of the Lean Startup methodology. \nAs part of this campaign, I will develop a backer-only community where you can share your experiences, meet and learn from other backers, and interact with me and our entire team during the writing and research process of my next book. \nThis online discussion community will be 100% private to backers of the campaign. Our team will share early drafts and ask for feedback, participate in discussions, and ask for advice about which tools and material have been useful and which haven't. We'll ask backers about their own stories and experiences, and how they align and diverge from those in The Leader's Guide.\nThis will make sure that the learning will continue after the campaign ends.\nThe Lean Startup counts among its fans and supporters some of today's smartest entrepreneurs, investors, and business thinkers\u2014and they're kicking in some incredible rewards.\nThose of you who have followed me for a while know that when I launch something, I love to go big\u2014ridiculous even\u2014in offering extras to the early adopters who support my work.\nBeyond making The Leader's Guide available exclusively as part of this campaign, I've asked my friends to donate what I think you\u2019ll agree are spectacular rewards, once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and invaluable mentorship opportunities.\nOur mentors.\nWe\u2019ve created several different backer reward levels. \nAt the first level are a number of packages aimed at individuals who are new to the Lean Startup or want a deeper dive: these packages include books, videos, tools for developing your startup, and more. \nAt the second level are rewards aimed at leaders and their teams: here, you\u2019ll find some cool mentorship opportunities, tickets to The Lean Startup Conference and other events (both virtual and live) and more. \nAt the third level are experiential rewards\u2014opportunities to meet with leading VCs, thought leaders and entrepreneurs who are having a huge impact on the startup landscape. \nAnd finally, we\u2019ve also included some high-level mentorship and workshop opportunities aimed at leaders who are ready to start implementing Lean Startup throughout their organizations. \nI\u2019m going to spend 100% of the money I receive on the research, writing and production of The Leader's Guide, and on the cost of the campaign itself (including the new private online community just for backers). \nI have assembled an all-star team to help me with the huge undertaking of producing and self-publishing a book based on five years of material with a very tight editorial deadline. \nIf I meet my funding goal of $135,000, I\u2019ll set stretch goals and add cool bonus rewards for all backers at different funding levels to help share the campaign wider. The more people we can get to back the campaign, the more valuable the experiment becomes to everyone who backs it. \nAnd thanks to the support of Crown, everyone who pledges for The Leader\u2019s Guide will get my next book, too.\nAs the Lean Startup movement moves into new sectors and industries, I get constant requests for more stories about how people are using these ideas in new and unexpected ways. And so I\u2019m very excited to share these stories with those of you who want to play a role in my experimentation process. I can\u2019t wait to discover what I might learn from the process of writing and publishing a book in this new way.\nA project like this is a massive undertaking. To make it happen, I haven enlisted a world-class team to help make it a reality on an aggressive schedule. \nChristy Fletcher is the owner of Fletcher & Company, one of the leading management firms working with writers/creators for publishing & business/media strategies.\n\nAlex Daly is a crowdfunding consultant, and the founder of Vann Alexandra.\n\nSarah Rainone is a writer and editor who works with Eric to develop content for his consulting practice. \n\nDavid Cirilli is a communications consultant with an expertise in implementing full-scale marketing and messaging campaigns.\n\nSylvie Greenberg works at Fletcher & Company helping authors strategize & execute marketing, publicity, and speaking opportunities. \n\nHeather McGough and Melissa Z. Moore are co-founders of Lean Startup Co. and executive producers of The Lean Startup Conference.\n\nThe Lean Startup Conference\nThe Leader\u2019s Guide is based on many of my private notes and case studies, but we still have a lot of work ahead. We have a massive pile of material that needs to be organized and edited. And we still have more research to be done: dozens of interviews both with people I\u2019ve worked with and\u2014more importantly\u2014people I haven\u2019t.\nWe also want to stay true to the Lean Startup methodology by testing the material in workshops and getting your feedback. We want to deliver a book to you that\u2019s comprehensive, user-friendly, and beautifully designed. \nI cannot wait to share this material. I'm consistently moved and humbled by the hard work and dedication of the Lean Startup community. Anyone who tells you that building a startup or driving a lean transformation is glamorous has not experienced how much of the work is about measurement, accountability, and being brutally honest with yourselves and your colleagues. And yet that hasn't stopped you from learning from your failures and from taking Lean Startup practices into industries and segments where no one believed it would work.\nI hope you share my excitement about this experiment.

Aegis Defenders takes place in a world where a great war has wiped humanity's memory clean of its once technologically advanced past. Once commonplace items like microwaves are seen as black magic. Humanoid artificial intelligence that demonstrate supernatural strength and intellect are regarded as gods.\nThe core story is about the relationship between Bart and his granddaughter Clu (Yes. She's a girl). Many years ago, their home was destroyed by the demi-god Shem, one of the robotic gods who has been programmed to preserve the lives of his people at any cost, and now Shem is expanding his dominion once again.\nAegis Defenders focuses on their journey to stop Shem from invading their new home of Mu by finding Aegis, a mythical weapon said to endow its bearer absolute power.\n\"The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them.\" - Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, Wind, Sand, and Stars\n Bart the Engineer\nA tinkerer with knowledge of the old world, Bart's determination and ability to bring relics back to life is second to none - even when it is deemed forbidden. Despite his carefree exterior, Bart is burdened with a heavy guilt from his past.\nBart's Arsenal\nAs an engineer, Bart is able to craft static defenses like turrets, barriers, and drones.\nBart isn't great at melee combat but he wields a giant hammer that can be used for melee combat in a pinch. \nWhen not the active character, Bart's passive ability is to repair nearby structures.\nClu the Hunter\nAs an orphan whose parents were killed by the Empire, Clu has difficulty trusting others and puts others at a distance with her her sharp tongue and knack for sarcasm. The lucky few that she does befriend, however, she loves absolutely.\nClu's Arsenal\nClu wields a variety of powerful firearms - ranging from crossbows that can shoot platformable bolts to shotguns with powerful knockback.\nFrom explosive mines to slow fields, Clu can be set deadly traps that offer a wide range of utility.\nClu's passive ability is continual fire, allowing her to function like a mobile turret.\n  Energi Glubs - Remnants of an ancient power source known as Energi, these gelatinous foes live only to eat and will devour your turrets and defenses like candy.\nThe Order of Shem - The Empire's foot-soldiers always travel in groups and must be dispatched of from afar. Their long spears and hardened shields make them impossible to approach up close.\nCheck out more enemies on our Tumblr!\nArachnis the Spider Queen - Fun fact about Arachnis and her children: their butts are shaped like fruit.

Any pledges over our goal will go towards making the experience richer and creating episodes two and three.\nUPDATES\nALL UPDATES\nPRESS\n  Press kit\nThis coming-of-age narrative follows Jenny LeClue, a young detective, living in the idyllic college town of Arthurton. Jenny takes on the case of her life when her mother is accused of murdering the beloved Dean Strausberry. She soon discovers that nothing is what it seems\u2026\nJenny is a brilliant young detective, sharp eyed, intuitive and a ruthless pursuer of the truth. But nothing exciting ever happens in Arthurton, and Jenny has grown bored of the gumshoe cases she usually solves. She longs for adventure and a real case to crack.\nJenny gets more than she bargains for when the Dean of Gumboldt University is found dead, and all the evidence points to her own mother. Jenny will have to use all her skills of deduction and reasoning to uncover the truth and clear her family name. In the process she will discover that Arthurton is not such a quiet town after all. Arthurton is filled with dark secrets, and there are people who will stop at nothing to keep Jenny from the truth.\nWho can she trust? How will she outwit the ever watchful Sheriff? Why has the lake started glowing at night? And why does everyone keep treating her like a kid?\nJenny LeClue is a coming of age tale. Sometimes funny, sometimes scary, always mysterious; it\u2019s a story about finding our strengths, accepting our weaknesses, and the blurred lines between what is right and wrong.\n We've been crafting Jenny LeClue over the last few years, and envision it as an episodic trilogy that rewards exploration and curiosity at every turn. This campaign hopes to fund the first episode.\nThis is a game about your choices and how they permanently affect the story. We want to deliver a rich narrative experience about relationships with delightful surprises and interactions. The story also deals with mature themes, complex characters, and an epic tangled mystery. We want you to help guide the direction of Jenny's journey, within the game itself.\nJenny LeClue is a handmade, 2D, exploration based, adventure game with a focus on story, character, and mystery. The game will initially support PC / Mac / Linux. We plan to add more platforms, especially iOS, after the desktop version is released. We are also looking into the possibility of Steam and Console support.\nEverything is interactive!\nExperience Arthurton, an expansive world with dark corners to explore, secrets to uncover, intriguing and suspicious characters, and mysterious cases to crack!\nTap, swipe, run, jump, and bike your way around Arthurton as you reveal secrets with your flashlight and unravel the mysteries of this deceptively dark town.\n Every moment is a chance to interact in new and refreshing ways. Dialogue scenes become a chance to explore and discover clues on a character\u2019s person and reveal whether they are a witness or a suspect. Curiosity is rewarded with captivating animations and goodies, making for a richer experience and a living world. It\u2019s not just pretty, it\u2019s alive!\nAs you solve mini-mysteries, and put the pieces of Dean Strausberry's murder together, you start to unravel a much bigger mystery\u2026\nExplore the abandoned mines, the forgotten graveyard, the misty mountains. Sneak into the police station evidence room. Wander the shops on Main Street and chat up the baristas at the coffee shop. Dig through the archives of Gumboldt University's Library.\n Jenny LeClue, a young detective, brilliant, spunky, irreverent, with a fierce sense of independence.\nArthur K Finkelstein, The Author, acts as narrator and will guide you if you lose your way. You also have the opportunity to help him and Jenny change the story, permanently, as it evolves. This doesn\u2019t just occur in your own playthrough, but will also affect the way future episodes are written and crafted for everyone. This is choosiness on a massive scale. You choose, together.\nHenry LeClue, Jenny\u2019s dad and the police medical examiner. He is a kind and caring man, but has separated from Jenny and her mom. He has not been seen or heard from in several months for reasons that are still a mystery.\nJulie LeClue, Jenny\u2019s mom and a former CSI who now teaches criminology at Gumboldt University. She\u2019s the only witness and number one suspect to Dean Strausberry\u2019s shocking murder.\nSheriff LeClue, Jenny\u2019s grandfather, is a stoic old-school kind of guy.\nDean Strausberry is the soon-to-retire head of Gumboldt University. He\u2019s a jolly gentlemen often seen shaking hands and kissing babies around town. \nCool Keith, your best friend, usually found around Mr Beans, the coffee shop on Main Street. He will patiently listen to your ridiculous theories about what's really going on in Arthurton. He also has a really cute dog!\nSuzie Glatz, your cousin, frenemy, and secret nerd genius. If you need a newfangled gadget beyond your wits and handy notebook, she's your best bet.\nMr Glatz, a prominent business man in town, and Jenny\u2019s uncle. He\u2019s definitely charismatic but something about him doesn\u2019t sit right with Jenny.\nJJ - Stock up on supplies and other thingamabobs in his overfilled junkyard. As JJ always tells Jenny \"One man's junk is another mans detective kit!\" If you want to upgrade your flashlight, he\u2019s got you covered. Bring him something weird and he might even give you a special reward.\nThese are just a few of the main characters, but there are even more curious citizens of Arthurton to interact with and investigate!\nDelve into a metanarrative and the story layers between The Author, Jenny, and you. Themes include family, loss, identity, redemption, and authorship. This is a story about a young girl, who is confident and in control of part of her life, but insecure in her personal relationships.\nThe story is influenced by my love for Mystery, Horror, and Sci-Fi. Some of my favorite inspirations ( in no particular order ): Twin Peaks, Professor Layton, Broken Age, Resident Evil, Veronica Mars, Ghost Trick, Limbo, Hot Fuzz, Encyclopedia Brown, Clue, Sherlock, Blue Velvet, Are You Afraid Of The Dark, The Silent Age, Kentucky Route Zero, CSI.\nSo why Kickstarter? Because I can\u2019t do it alone\u2026I need you! I need the help of a larger community in order to realize the dream of producing episode one of the Jenny LeClue Trilogy. Storytelling is my passion, and the wonderful Kickstarter community offers the possibility of creating a broader and deeper story than I have the resources to craft on my own.\nI have designed the environments and characters, outlined the story, and the game is ready to be brought to life.\nThis is the story I want to tell as an artist. This is the game I've always wanted to play as a gamer. This is the project I've been excited about making for years, and now we are ready to make that dream a reality. But we can\u2019t do it without your help!\nThese reward images are conceptual renderings.\nThe plan is to have episode one scripted and the game in alpha by Spring '15. This would allow us to time to create final art, animation, sound, music, polish the game, and possibly add voice acting for a launch in Winter '15. If there is enough support for episode two or three, these will follow after. \nThe game requires continued writing, storyboarding, design, game design, illustration, coding, modeling of sets, character rigging, character animation, sound design, music composition, and with the stretch goals, voice talent. All these things are needed to complete the game and this requires focus and time, critical luxuries as a freelancer. The initial goal will afford me these two opportunities. The higher stretch goals will open the doors to a fully realized version with all the bells and whistles and potentially the completion of all three episodes.\nPaying Skilled and Passionate Artists - This is a passion project for me, but other friends and professionals need to be compensated for their tremendous talents. Having a developer, illustrator, as well as an animator on Jenny LeClue would lighten the workload considerably and allow me to concentrate on the overall storytelling and design of the game.\nCompany and Operating Costs - Operating a business, Licensing, Equipment, Living Costs and Bills require a fair chunk of money and time.\nTesting, Refining, and Polishing - Beta testing, integrating Feedback from the Community, and using everything that I have to produce a game I've been dreaming of for years.\n These talented people have all contributed to the project in various ways.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nJenny LeClue is a big idea with a lot of moving pieces. A project of this scope is indeed a challenge, but I live for challenges. It's a big mountain to climb, but we have the tools, and with your support we can make it happen.\n\nMy 10 years of experience as a motion designer, director, and developer has allowed me to hone and polish my skills as a writer, programmer, animator, designer, illustrator and visual storyteller. Every project and every day presents a new problem-solving challenge.\n\nI also previously Kickstarted FATHOMS, a very long short film. I did everything on the project including writing, directing, modeling, animating, editing, sound design and compositing.\n\nI have also developed several iOS apps, including Anatomy In Motion, a top selling educational app and Facebook community with over 180,000 followers. I have also successfully designed and developed iOS apps, games, web, and mobile experiences using javascript for private clients and personal projects. Other team contributors have experience developing flash games, and iOS apps and games using Obj-C.\n\nWe are building the game using Unity, and have a few prototypes in production. I\u2019ve previously done all the development work myself, but the hope is with enough support we could bring on a dedicated Unity developer. This will allow me more time to focus specifically on the core game, art, and story experience.\n\nThe biggest benefits of using Unity are a trusted engine with a lot of 1st & 3rd-party support. More importantly, Unity is very flexible, and will make it much easier to support other platforms in the future including: iOS, Android, PS4, Vita.\n\nI'm super excited to go on this adventure together and climb that mountain!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #91", "update_userinfo": "PHYSICAL REWARDS & A BIG UPDATE COMING SOON!", "update_content": "Hello detectives!

But I rarely spend the big bucks for the Fire Stations, Police Stations and other deluxe items (in spite of great persistence on the part of the Hamilton Army).  Instead, my kids build things out of unit blocks, empty boxes or anything else they can get their hands on.\nWe've been wishing for some play environments that are sturdy but also detailed and affordable.

We have a whole metropolis-worth of ideas, but the designs we are launching with are: Storefront & Police Station in a smaller size and House & Fire Station in a larger size -- plus a Kickstarter exclusive Storefront!  \nWe will use the funds from Kickstarter to pay a graphic designer to put the finishing touches on our artwork, to finalize packaging design and then, having met our manufacturer's minimum order quantity requirements with your help, go right into production this fall.  \nBrikBilt Fire Station\nBrikBilt Police Station\nBrikBilt Storefront\n We'll even be producing a one-time-only, Kickstarter-exclusive \"Kickstarter Store\" for this campaign.  It will be printed on the inside walls with the names of all of our backers!\nEXCLUSIVE BrikBilt Kickstarter Storefront\nWe're proud to be manufacturing BrikBilt right here in the US of A. We've made toys here before (see our Topozoo animals), so we know how to go from sketchpad to store shelf and how to manage all the steps in between. \nBrikBilt is made from a sturdy, recyclable, eco-friendly material we call BrikBoard that is fine enough to take a hi-resolution print but tough enough to be played with. It's often used for in-store displays and such at stores, but no one is using this modern material to make toys - until now!\nHow it came to be:\nI'm always looking for unconventional materials that we can use to make toys, especially eco-friendly ones!  Back in 2011 I found this material, but at the time it was still quite new and the costs were still too high.  Since then, though, costs have come down and the versatility of the material has grown as producers learn how to work with it.\nI started off with sketches, then moved Google Sketchup, then created rough protoypes, and now we have finished prototypes. Along the way we've used pencil & paper, cardboard, computer, and everything else we could get our hands on!  Of course, throughout this process our kids have helped us test everything out to make sure that we create a toy that they will enjoy - which is the most important thing after all!\nAbout the creator\nI'm Ryan Hamilton, a father of four, a restless tinkerer and a big fan of toys.  My company, Geared For Imagination, is a family-owned operation that sells lots of toys and other fun products for kids and 'kidults', from Europe, the USA and around the world.  I've been in the toy business for over 10 years as a buyer, salesman, toy store owner and more.  \nMy business partner, Bret Faber, has also been a buyer, salesman and more and has extensive experience in the toy industry. We work to find toys that we love in Europe and around the world, bring them to the United States and sell them to the best toy stores, museum shops and gift boutiques we can find around the country.  We've been doing this since 2009 and currently sell to over 1,000 stores around the USA.\nWe've had many ideas for our own products over the years, though BrikBilt is the first one we've brought to Kickstarter.  We started making our Topozoo product line here in the USA back in 2010 using bootstrap funding and learned a lot about the ins and outs of the product development process.  We currently sell our toys to everyone from your corner toy store to MoMA and Pottery Barn Kids.\nOur new idea is big - and we knew that the biggest crowdfunding platform in the world was the place to launch it.  \nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe've come to Kickstarter for a few reasons.  First, we want to make our toys here in the US.  To do this, the initial setup costs are higher than they would be overseas.  We think this is well worth it, but we need a little help to get things going.\nSecond, well, access to capital ain't what it used to be, and we figure that the best way to test out our concept and launch this puppy is to go straight to you, the consumer/parent/lover of toys!\nWhat's next?\nOnce we finish our successful Kickstarter campaign, we will finalize our designs with the help of our amazing artist-friend, Dave O'Neill.  He illustrates beautiful children's books among other things, and we love working with him.  He's going to add the little details that will make these play environments so endearing to kids - fire uniforms, toys on the store shelves, shrubberies and more.\nAfter the designs are finalized, we'll go into production.  We're manufacturing in Wisconsin with an experienced printer who can make BrikBilt in the eye-catching, fun way we want.  \nAll products will be available for the Holidays - and once you get your reward, we hope you'll come back for more buildings!\nAfter the holiday selling season, we look forward to adding more designs, more buildings (airplane hangars, castles, vintage buildings)...and more fun! \nVarious and Sundry:\nBuilding bricks, figures and vehicles shown are for demonstrating scale and play pattern only.

That said, I'm sure there will be unexpected challenges and we will be 100% transparent with the timeline for delivery and each step along the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "They're here - and shipping out!", "update_content": "Happy Thursday, Kickstarter backers!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Almost shipping time!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Getting so close, folks!", "update_content": "Hi Backers & Friends,\nJust a quick update to tell you what's going on here.\nIt's a busy time of year in the toy industry, as you might imagine, since we work at the North Pole and all.

A 4x MicroGame!\nClick here to visit TEK on GamelynGames.com for more information!\n\"Tiny Epic Kingdoms is the best bang for your buck on Kickstarter!\"\nWhat does 4x mean!?\nIt means eXpand, eXplore, eXploit and eXterminate and usually only shows up in games that cost $50+ and take 2hrs+ to play. Well not anymore! Tiny Epic Kingdoms has all the strategy of a traditional 4x game without the cost or the long playing time. Tiny Epic Kingdoms is only $16 and takes only 30-60 minutes to play.\nIn TEK, you are a tiny kingdom with big ambitions. You want to expand your population throughout the realms, learn powerful magic, build grand towers, and have your neighbors quiver in fear at the mention of your name. The conflict? All of the other kingdoms want the same thing and there's not enough room for everyone to succeed...  \n*Watch a gameplay video below in the Reviews & Videos section*\nThis mock-up image includes all the unlocked stretch goals! \nAll THIS for only $16!\nGet even MORE with the DELUXE PACKAGE! Don't miss out!\nFor the purpose of distinguishing them from the reward tier descriptions, \"Gifts\" are NOT considered \"Stretch Goals\"\nEach player starts with a unique faction, a small territory, and a technology tree to grant them unique faction-specific magical abilities as the game progresses. Players will collect resources, explore other territories, battle each other, research magic, and work to build a great tower to protect their realm. The final round of the game is triggered when a player maxes out either their Magic Level, Population, or Tower.\nThe Factions: Magic Levels & Kingdom Resources\nEach player will choose a faction. This will be the persona taken on by that player. If played properly, it can lead them to victory!\nEach faction has a unique set of skills known as Magic Levels. Players can unlock these abilities by Researching Magic during the game. The abilities stack, eventually creating a very powerful entity.\nIn addition to Magic Levels, each player will have access to their Kingdom vault where they will manage and track their resources. Resources are used for several aspects in the game; researching magic, expanding population, building towers, and battling opponents. \nThe Human Player is currently benefiting from Magic Levels 1 through 3. He/She has 3 Mana, 5 Ore, and 6 Food.\nThe Orc Player is currently benefiting from Magic Level 1. He/She has 1 Mana, 2 Food, and 4 Ore.\nThe Elven Player is currently benefiting from Magic Levels 1 through 4. He/She has 1 Ore, 4 Mana, and 7 Food.\nThe Dwarven Player is currently benefiting from Magic Levels 1 and 2. He/She has 2 Food, 2 Mana, and 8 Ore.\nThe Territories & Population\nEach player will be the landlord of a unique Territory. They will Expand their population across the regions and even explore into other player's regions. This is done to gather resources and/or block their opponent's resource supply. They will also battle each other for position and/or fortify their Kingdom's defense.\nThe Elven Player is gathering Mana from the Forest and the Orc Player is gathering Food from the Heartlands\nThe Dwarven Player is gathering Ore from the Mountains. The Human Player and the Orc Player are either battling or cohabiting... most likely battling. =)\nCohabiting is when two players create an alliance and share the benefits of that region. The alternative would be to battle, in which one player will lose his meeple and the other player's meeple will remain. War is resolved through a resource bidding system.\nThe Orc Player is gathering all 3 resource types.\nThe Elven Player is fortifying the Forest so that no other player may enter. However, she is gathering 1 Mana, not 2. The Human Player is gathering 2 Food.\nThe Tower & Improved VP\nEvery player will be competing to build a great Tower. They will keep track of their status on a community Tower Card. Because the Tower does not offer any immediate benefits, it is worth additional Victory Points in the end.\nThe scrolls on the right indicate the VP value of that tier.\nThe Action Selection Card & Exploitation\nThe Action Selection Card is the driving engine in Tiny Epic Kingdoms. The players share a community Action Selection Card and even community actions. During a turn, the active player selects an action by placing a gray cube next to it. He may either perform the action he selected OR perform no action at all. Now, the other players, in order, must perform the action that the active player selected OR gather resources. \nThe number of resources gathered is based on where a player's cubes are placed on the Territory Cards. A player gathers 1 resource per region that he has at least 1 cube in. The type of resource gathered is based on the type of region occupied. \nIt is now the next player's turn, he is now the active player that is selecting the community action. He may not select an action already chosen in previous turns, this is tracked by the gray shields. Once all the gray shields have been placed, they will wipe on the following turn. That active player will now have a clean slate to choose from.\nPlayers are able to use the Action Card to exploit other players by selecting actions they know their opponent(s) can't afford to perform.\nRules of Play\nYou can download the prototype rules below. This version of the rules has not yet received the wonderful treatment of the graphic artist.\nClick HERE to download the TEK Rules of Play (prototype)\nPlease see update #21 for details on this package.\nEndless hours have been poured into Tiny Epic Kingdoms in effort to make it the best possible game it can be, but with your help it can be even better! \nAt $15,000 we are able to produce a high quality board game that is sure to hit your game table time and time again. If we are fortunate enough to raise funds above and beyond that goal we can really improve upon this great little game.\nThe most effective way to assure we reach these upgrades is to share this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, blogs, etc. Share this project with EVERYONE!! \nTelling your friends, family, and gaming communities to jump in on this great game will make everyone's game better as all stretch goals are production wide!\nSpeaking of social media, here is an incentive for getting involved:\nSOCIAL MEDIA STRETCH GOAL! UNLOCKED\n1,000 Facebook Likes! Once the Gamelyn Games Facebook page reaches 1,000 likes, ALL the cards in the game will be UPGRADED to a larger, more formidable size; 88 x 125 mm. This IS a sleevable size!\nNow, onto some other exciting stretch goals!\nAll material upgrades will be included in the final retail version of Tiny Epic Kingdoms, unless otherwise noted. However, it may be the case that not all factions, additional maps or the mini expansion are included in the final version (they will be included with the every KS copy). Any factions, maps and the mini expansion left out of the final version will be available via the BGG store, conventions and/or other outlets.\nPrior to launching on Kickstarter, we sent out tons of prototypes of Tiny Epic Kingdoms. Some to established reviewers and some to gamers who like to write reviews. Both crowds received the game so well, that I had to reach out further and see just how far the excitement for TEK went. So, I released a FREE Print 'N Play of the game and within two weeks it had already been downloaded over 1,500 times! I encourage you to read these reviews and see just what people are raving about!\n                                                                                               BoardGamegGeek Review Forum (14 reviews)\n\"Tiny Epic Kingdoms is a win in my book. Microgames and 4X games are two of my weaknesses, and this manages to combine both together in a tidy package.\" -Craig Imprimis\n\"For us, many 4X games are simply inaccessible due to their over-production of rules, mechanics and sometimes graphic layout. There were none of these obstacles in Tiny Epic Kingdoms and we felt like we were expanding, exploring, exploiting and exterminating. Finally, there is a 4X game that we can play and want to play.\" -Sarah Reed\n\"It's a nice game some people can fit in a lunch break, has fast setup and take down, and benefits from smooth paced turns.\" -Justin Lowmaster\n\"TEK manages to capture all the depth you'd expect to find in a 4X game\" -Legend Montgomery\n\"Having a game of this caliber in a very portable size is rare. I can bring this anywhere and pull it out nearly anywhere. The game plays quickly so it doesn't over stay its welcome. I\u2019m so glad this game found me.\" -J. Riddell\n\u2022 TEK Preview by Scott King\nYou've read all about how great the game is, but now let me prove it to you! Follow the link below to find a FREE Print 'N Play of Tiny Epic Kingdoms.

Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help with that:\nWhy you should back Tiny Epic Kingdoms on Kickstarter.\nApart from TEK being an AMAZING game!!??\nAlright, here's the thing, without Kickstarter the game would not be made at all. So waiting around to find it at your FLGS or favorite online retailer would NOT even be an option!\nWe need people to back it on Kickstarter to get it made. So, here are the incentives we've offered:\n\u2022 20% discounted from MSRP (on an already super cheap game)\n\u2022 FREE US Shipping + Discounted International Shipping\n\u2022 *Kickstarter Exclusive content! Including extra Factions and Territories!\n*Kickstarter Exclusive - Will never enter regular distribution channels but may become available in limited quantities via contests, conventions, and/or the BGG store.\nWhy we use Kickstarter.\nWe choose to use Kickstarter because of the people. Kickstarter has a very supportive and enthusiastic community that we've grown to love.\nOur experience with Kickstarter began as a project creators. I, personally, had not backed a project prior to making my own, that quickly changed. The philanthropy demonstrated by the backers that so generously supported our projects became contagious. We're not just project creators anymore, we are backers now and we love it! Backing a project is a little bit like being Santa Claus in helping make dreams come true! Then getting it in the mail later is a lot like being a kid on Christmas day! It's a win, win.\nThere's more than one way to fund the publication of a board game and even within the crowd-funding concept there are several options but none that compare to Kickstarter. Without the wonderful community of Kickstarter we would not be where we are today. That is why we feel it is important to give back. Kickstarter has changed our business and our lives in a big way and if we can play a small part in changing someone else's life in a big way we will!\nWe have put endless hours into bringing Tiny Epic Kingdoms to this point. Many people have put a lot of hard work into this game but entering production is very expensive and unfortunately outside the limitations of our resources. The game has been enjoyed by so many and some awesome memories have been made. With your help, we can make this game a reality and share the unique experience within with a lot of people.\nThank you Kickstarter and thank you backers!

Since then the series has become a favorite of families around the world, winning the Christy Award for Young Adult Fiction in 2010 for North! Or Be Eaten. But like every good story, the Saga has to come to an end, and in early 2014, Rabbit Room Press will release the final installment of this epic tale.\nRallied behind Kalmar Wingfeather, the Wolf King of Anniera, the people of the Green Hollows are prepared for war. But high atop the Killridge Mountains in Castle Throg, Gnag the Nameless broods over dark secrets, and those secrets may prove more than a boy, even a boy king like Kalmar, can bear. \nWhile Leeli, Podo, and Nia, fight to save the Green Hollows, Sara Cobbler and the wildy transformed Peet the Sockman strive to overthrow the Fangs of Dang and liberate the long-enslaved people of Skree. \nBut Kalmar and his brother Janner, the Throne Warden of Anniera, will be driven into darkness to face a nameless evil (that has no name). Dragons will rise. The Jewels will shine. And in the end, an Annieran will die.\nWe want to publish the grand finale of this story in style, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here on Kickstarter. If we make our goal of $14,000 that will allow us to publish the book as a high quality trade paperback, just like we did with The Monster in the Hollows in 2011.\nPre-Release in time for Christmas!\nIf we meet our goal, we're also committed to delivering an early pre-release version of the book to Kickstarter backers who pledge at the RAT BADGER level and above--and we're going to get this version of the book to you in time for Christmas. \nThis special pre-release will be an early proof of the book in PDF format that you can read on any device that supports PDFs (such as an iPad or a Kindle or a laptop). Because it's an early proof, it will not contain final artwork and will be subject to change as final edits take place, but if you are looking for something special to start reading on Christmas Day, this is just the thing.\nBut wait! There's more. If we can exceed our base goal, we\u2019re going to start adding value to the book in some exciting ways. And the best part is that everyone will able to benefit from these awesome additions. \nWhat kind of added value?\nStretch Goal #1 - Illustrations: For The Warden and the Wolf King, we\u2019re working with illustrator Joe Sutphin. Joe is a big fan of the Wingfeather Saga and we're really excited about the work he's doing. Visit his website here to see some of his other illustration work.\nAt our base goal, we know Joe will be doing 6 original illustrations for the book as well as new maps. But we want to do better than that. If we exceed the $14,000 goal, we\u2019ll be able to pay Joe to do even more illustrations---maybe a LOT more. Joe's art will be in the book, no matter what, but the more you help, the more illustrations he\u2019ll be able to do. Instead of 6 illustrations, as in The Monster in the Hollows, we\u2019d like to see a dozen or more. \nBut wait\u2026there\u2019s more!\nStretch Goal #2 - The Warden and the Wolf King in Hardcover: The second Stretch Goal takes effect when we reach $25,000. If we reach that threshold, we\u2019ll upgrade our production plans and publish The Warden and the Wolf King in hardcover. That means everyone who contributes (at RAT BADGER level or above) will be automatically upgraded to the hardback edition. \nStretch Goal #3 - The Monster in the Hollows Audiobook: The third Stretch Goal takes effect when we reach $30,000. Upon reaching this goal, we\u2019ll commit to producing the digital audiobook of The Monster in the Hollows (book three). Andrew Peterson will read the book, and everyone who has pledged (at the CAVE BLAT level or above) will receive it as a free download. And don't worry, Andrew is no amateur. He's narrated several audiobooks over the years.\nStretch Goal #4 - The Warden and the Wolf King Audiobook: The fourth Stretch Goal takes effect when we reach $35,000. At this point, we\u2019ll also produce the digital audiobook of The Warden and the Wolf King. Andrew Peterson will read it, and once again, everyone at the CAVE BLAT level or above will receive it as a free download. \nBut wait! There\u2019s more!\n\nStretch Goal #5 - The Monster in the Hollows in Hardcover: If we reach $45,000, we\u2019ll publish a hardback edition of book three, The Monster in the Hollows, and yes, everyone who\u2019s pledged at CAVE BLAT level or above will receive a copy\u2014for free!\nAnd, finally, here\u2019s the one we\u2019re most excited about: \nStretch Goal #6 - Pembrick's Creaturepedia: If we reach $65,000, we're going to publish something really special. Throughout the Wingfeather Saga, there have been references to Pembrick\u2019s Creaturepedia. Pembrick, the story goes, ventured all across Aerwiar, putting himself at great risk, to catalogue the strange and wonderful (and hungry) creatures of his world. And because of his great sacrifices, Annieran and Skreean people have, for many years, sat safely in the comfort of their homes to read about Gargan Rockroaches, and Snick Buzzards, and Sea Dragons, and Flabbits. For generations, the people of Aerwiar have stared rapturously at Pembrick\u2019s well-noted illustrations and thanked the Maker that they\u2019ve never encountered the horrors depicted therein. \nShould we reach $65,000, Rabbit Room Press will publish Pembrick\u2019s Creaturepedia so that you too may peruse the terrors and wonders of the Aerwiaran wilds from the security of your own home. Each and every contributor (at the CAVE BLAT level and above) will receive this hallowed tome for free. (Though it won\u2019t be delivered until the spring/summer of 2014). \nStretch Goal #7 - Fold-Out Map: If we reach $85,000 every backer at CAVE BLAT level or higher will receive a brand new, full-color, professionally-illustrated, poster-sized, fold-out map of Aerwiar. The map will be large and detailed and suitable for framing if you so desire.\nStretch Goal #8 - An Original Song: If we make it to $110,000, we'll hire producer-extraordinaire Ben Shive and record an original song from The Wingfeather Saga: \"My Love Has Gone Across the Sea.\" Andrew and Ben will work together on the arrangement and, since it's a song sung by Leeli, they'll find an awesome female vocalist here in Nashville to do the singing.\nLet us sum up.\nIf we reach $14,000, the Warden and the Wolf King will be published in early 2014, and everyone receives the pledge rewards listed in the sidebar.\nBut...\nIf we reach at least $110,000, everyone who\u2019s pledged at the CAVE BLAT level or higher will receive (in addition to the pledge rewards listed in the sidebar):\n-a hardback edition of The Warden and the Wolf King\n-a hardback edition of The Monster in the Hollows\n-a digital audiobook of The Monster in the Hollows\n-a digital audiobook of The Warden and the Wolf King\n-Pembrick\u2019s Creaturepedia \n-a poster-sized, full-color, fold-out, map of Aerwiar\n-a download of an original song from The Wingfeather Saga\nWe\u2019re confident that with your help, we can reach our goal of $14,000 and publish The Warden and the Wolf King. But for us to do all the rest, we need your help. \nShare this page! Link to it, and put it on your blog, and tell your friends, and your librarians, and your village elders.

The combat system supports up to five characters simultaneously, much like Final Fantasy 2/4, and is viewed from a sleek first-person perspective as in the early Phantasy Star titles. Whew! Take all those classic RPG mechanics, streamline and polish them to a shine, wrap them up in an original and riveting science fiction story, and you\u2019ve got Worlds Beyond.\nRun!!!\nThe goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to earn enough money to allow both of us at Bridge Unit Orzo to live and simply work on Worlds Beyond for a full year (or longer, depending on funding and development requirements). Finding the time to work on a project like this has become increasingly difficult, with a lot of time having already been put into part-time production around our tricky schedules. We'd love to make Worlds Beyond our full-time job so that we can finally show you our vision for this game. Here\u2019s a little bit more about ourselves and why we need your help to complete our dream:\nAge: 23\nLocation: Victoria, BC, Canadialand\nFavorite games: Myst, Shadow of the Colossus, Chrono Trigger, Killer7\nJobs: Pixel art, sound and music, writing, design\nBio: When I was about 8 years old, I started playing video games on a Super Nintendo belonging to a friend\u2019s dad. I was allowed 30 minutes at a time after school, just enough to get a taste for games like Final Fantasy 2/4, Brain Lord, Illusion of Gaia, and Zelda: A Link to the Past. I was later introduced to the surreal, otherworldly style of games like Myst and (much later) Shadow of the Colossus, which hit me in ways I\u2019d never known, but my roots are firmly in 16-bit console RPGs.\n\nWorlds Beyond is definitely a love letter to my \u2018roots\u2019 in gaming and everything I love about the style -- and more -- is in there in some form. I\u2019m currently trying to escape a permanent job description of dishwasher and prep cook in the oceanside city of Victoria. I love rats, blocky pixels, quinoa, and all manner of music. To me, the success of this campaign will finally -- after a ton of hard work and slow chipping-away of assets -- give me the time to make Worlds Beyond look, sound, and read the best it can... Not to mention completing the game so you can play it!\nAge: 28\nLocation: Farm land in northern Illinois, USA\nFavorite games: FF4-7, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, Lufia 2, etc, etc\nBio: I'm a programmer/musician/problem solver known various places around the \u2018net as cha0s. I enjoy long walks along the beaches of Guldove or an evening at the Aria di Mezzo Carattere. Maybe we could share a night at the Gold Saucer if you\u2019re feeling lucky! ;) ...but seriously.\n\nI still remember my first (random?) encounter with the genre. I was but a baby hero informed by my big brother about an awesome game called Dragon Warrior where \"the enemies are invisible\". Naturally I was intrigued! I went on to honor Erdrick in the best way I knew how...and I got the girl! I moved on to Final Fantasy which culminated in an epic battle with Chaos (my namesake!). When the sequel came out, I was absolutely blown away by the 16-bit style, and still am to this day. Nothing beats lovingly hand-crafted pixel art and engaging meaningful stories.\n\nSince those days I have dreamed of being a part of creating one of those masterpieces, and now I have the skills to make it happen. As it turns out, now that I\u2019m a crusty old man, I have to actually have a thing called a \u201cjob\u201d and \u201cwork\u201d for \u201cmoney\u201d. Booo!

So, the BETA tier includes the THREE-PACK, SOUNDTRACK, and PRE-ORDER tiers.\nAURO is a turn-based, dungeon crawling strategy game that will be released on many platforms: iOS, Android, Windows, OSX, Linux, and more.\nThe simple-yet-deep gameplay is easy to learn, but difficult to master.  AURO is designed to be replayed infinitely, with each game presenting fun and interesting new challenges.\nThe game is being developed by Dinofarm Games, the creators of the critically-acclaimed iOS/OSX game, 100 Rogues.  Programming the game is Ido Yehieli, creator of Cardinal Quest.  If we get funding, we can be done with the game in 4-5 months (Late 2012).\nWith unique gameplay mechanisms, charming pixel art, an original soundtrack and a whimsical sense of humor, we're trying to make a game that will stand out from the crowd and will also stand the test of time.\n\nIf you like dungeon-crawling games like Diablo or our own 100 Rogues, or if you like turn-based strategy games like Advance Wars or Final Fantasy Tactics, then AURO is a game you'll enjoy for many years to come.\n\n\n*NEW*  STRETCH GOALS! ~\n\nIf we reach...\n$10,000: We'll add more custom effect animations for specific events and more tilesets to the game.  Essentially, a content-upgrade.\n\n$13,000:  A second playable class will be bundled with the game on launch.  He's not designed yet, but he would have some significantly different rules about how he functions.  Maybe he only has 1 HP, but he has all the abilities.  Or maybe he has a new discipline tree, or his attacks don't knock-back, or something.  Some kind of base rule that changes how he plays, dramatically (and new sprite art for him and such).\n$16,000:  A second story campaign mode, that features our added playable class.\n$20,000: Campaign/Puzzle Creator!  Create your own Puzzle Mode puzzles and campaigns with your own little stories, which you can share with friends!  Exciting!\nStory ~\nAURO comes with a story-based campaign which introduces you to the world and characters of AURO, while also teaching you how to play the game.\nYou play as the spoiled Prince Auro, who, for the first time in his life, is actually asked to go and perform a quest.  Your father, King Omiron, is a weak man who is too easily pushed around, but the royal scholar Quillsh is able to finally convince him to stand up to you.\nThe mission is simple - get down to the bottom of the Kingdom sewers.  But despite Quillsh's many warnings, childish Auro carelessly awakens an ancient evil that may be spell the end for his people!\nDetails ~\nTurn Based Strategy!  Quick, pick-up-and-play tactical decisions are what AURO's all about.  Turn based games are great for mobile games, because they don't require constant, fixed attention.  Further, they don't require as much tactile precision and timing on a touch-screen\nRich \"Disciplines\" System!  Study the destructive forces of the Fire  skill tree, or the sneaky tactics of the Elude skills.  Or find some new combination and learn to master it!  Each skill has many uses and there are a thousand ways to play - get creative!\nInnovative, ground-breaking gameplay!  We're doing a lot of things that no one has ever done before.  We've done away with tons of conventions that simply did not make sense before in an attempt to create a super-focused, replayable game.\nRandomized Challenges!  The levels, monsters, and items are all randomized each time you play AURO, meaning that it's infinitely re-playable\nSeveral modes of play!  For those who like traversing an unfolding story, there is a Story Mode.  If you just want an quick yet solid test of your skill, Normal Game is for you.  If you enjoy puzzles, try Puzzle Mode!  We plan to add many more variants in the future.\nCharm!  We think you'll delight at the characters we've been developing over the past year for AURO.\nQuality Art & Music!  We have a very distinct vision for what AURO   should look and sound like.  We hope you'll find it to be a beautiful piece of art on its own when it's complete.\nCross Platform!  Play AURO on your Android Phone, iPad, iPhone, iTouch while you're at work.  When you come home, play it some more on your desktop Windows, MacOS or Linux PC!\nHere's an article from our blog about the artwork for the game: http://www.dinofarmgames.com/the-art-barn-whats-involved-in-spriting-for-auro/\nAnd here's one about the skill trees:  http://www.dinofarmgames.com/design-process-for-auros-skill-redesign/\nWhy We Need Money ~\nAnyone who's involved in game development knows what an incredible amount of work it is.  Painting, pixel art, animation, graphic design, UI design, programming, game design, video editing, writing - the list of disciplines required to put a game like AURO together is staggering, and yet, it's being made by only three people!\n\nWe really believe in this game and the real reason we're making it is that we think the world will be the tiniest bit of a better place when it exists.  AURO is not just another game to us - it's the embodiment of all of our philosophies and the expression of our belief in the medium.  It is our collective love letter to the idea of the digital game!\n\nAt least, it will be!  But we really need your help.  As I mentioned, AURO is being made by just three people.  The amount of work - just raw man-hours that it's going to take to get it from its current prototype phase to a completed, polished product is huge.  We're hoping that Kickstarter may be the way for us to pursue our passion and at the same time, be able to survive.\nSo far, Auro has been self-funded from proceeds from our first game as well as income from other freelance jobs, but we've reached a point in our development where we need to dedicate more time to Auro in order to get it polished and ready for release...and that's where you come in. The funding from this Kickstarter project will be enough to replace our income from doing freelance work and allow us to devote our time to finishing Auro, in order to hit our estimated release window of Q4 2012.\nEvery year, there are some great game ideas coming out of independent developers, and there are great productions coming out of large AAA studios.  It's an exceptional situation when one team can do both things.  With your help, Dinofarm Games can be that team with Auro. \n\nWe thank you for reading, and please consider supporting our game!\n\nAbout Us ~\nWe're Dinofarm Games.

Conserve Ammo. And Never Cut a Deal With A Dragon.\nJordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back and Shadowrun Returns (for Apple & Android tablets and PCs) is the game that Shadowrun fans have been waiting for a long time. A graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat, Shadowrun Returns is not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe that is beloved around the world. \nCreated almost 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of a Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of a Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to. \nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\nThere are a couple of key ideas at the core of Shadowrun Returns.\nDeep, Interactive Stories \nWe intend to follow a braided anthology structure for our story. Jordan, his partner Mitch Gitelman and Mike Mulvihill, who led Shadowrun game development at FASA Corp. will craft and structure the meta-story, then supply key information for a group of writers to weave into their own short stories, which we'll then use as the basis for our missions. To ensure an authentic tone, we'll incorporate the storytelling skills of many Shadowrun authors and designers who've been carrying the flame over the last 23 years such as:\nMichael A. Stackpole\nMike Mulvihill\nTom Dowd\nMalik Toms\nMel Odom\nJason Hardy\nStephen Kenson\nThe result should be an overall narrative that is layered, textured, and satisfying. \nOne of the many innovations in Data East\u2019s Shadowrun Super Nintendo game was a unique conversation engine that opened up new avenues of conversation based upon information you learned through interactions with characters and objects. We intend on taking a similar path with a new twist or two.\nContextual Gameplay in Four Realities\nFour realities overlap in the world of Shadowrun (the Physical, the Digital, the Mystic, and the Astral) and associated character classes such as the Street Samurai, Hacker, Combat Mage, and Shaman, each have the ability to view and interact with the world in ways the others can\u2019t.\nHere are some ways that selecting each character type allows you to see the map from a different perspective:\nStreet Samurai see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.\nCombat Mages see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.\nHackers/Deckers see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.\nShaman see the \u201ctrue world\u201d that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other \u201cdead\u201d objects appear as mere shadows.\nMissions (aka \"Runs\") in Shadowrun Returns can require interaction with all four realities simultaneously, requiring you to use information learned from each character\u2019s perspective to coordinate their context-sensitive actions to get the job done. . . and survive.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to make Shadowrun Returns a turn-based game\u2014so we can offer you a wide range of context-based gameplay options from which to craft a your plan.\nThe Streets Tell a Million Stories\nOne of the things that we feel most strongly about is that the world of Shadowrun was created for all of us to tell stories within. That\u2019s one of the beautiful things about in-person tabletop role-playing\u2014the stories are extremely relevant to you and your friends because they were made by you and your friends.\nIn honor of that tradition, we plan to release our PC-based level editor when we release Shadowrun Returns so that everyone can create their own Shadowrun stories & \u201cruns\u201d. When you upload your stories, you can make them available to your Friends Only or the entire Shadowrun community. \nThe game we want to make is very humble by modern blockbuster game standards but it is still way beyond the ability of a small start-up to fund by itself. The restraints on the license from Microsoft made it impossible to get established publishers interested in Shadowrun and so it remained just a dream for a long time until Jordan saw the recent successes of some other veteran designers on Kickstarter.\nCrowd sourcing to fund creative content represents truly profound change to the status quo. While we watch financial models for the creation and distribution of creative content continue to erode, Kickstarter charts a direction for how fans can directly impact development of creative content they want by funding its creation.\nWe hope that Shadowrun Returns is a creative concept you want to help make into a reality and we thank your consideration and support.\nIt is strange to be required to license your own game in order to make a new version of it but that\u2019s what can happen when you\u2019re old and keep changing companies. Here's the fast-forward version:\nAnd so, our favorite game has come full circle and Jordan is again leading the development of a world he started oh, so many years ago.\nAnd for those of you that have been around since the very early days, we want to make sure that YOU understand that WE understand and that we'd love to see things like this (and more) in the game. \nAres Predators and Ruger Super Warhawks (yes, with smartlinks), Maglocks and Doc Wagons, datajacks and  credsticks, dermal plating and wired reflexes, \u201cchummer\u201d and \"drek\", Ares and Fuchi and Aztechnology (Oh my!). \nBut that's not all. \nMr. Johnson(s), Lofwyr  (can\u2019t leave him out can we?), gangers, toxic spirits, Renraku Arcology, The Sprawl, the Redmond Barrens & the Ork Underground (oh yes), UCAS, Tir Taingire and even the Sioux Nation, but most of all you WILL be saying (or is that screaming?). . . \u201cNever EVER Deal with a Dragon!\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter Now LIVE!", "update_content": "We\u2019re excited to let you know that the Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter has launched.

We are still deciding on the tech, and we don't know what the final budget is, so it can be difficult to have answers for everything right now.\nSo see our thoughts on Multi-player as well as a list of links to some of the great press we have been getting, go to our updates page by clicking \"Updates \" at the top of this page.\nBrian Fargo appears on Hard Drive.\n\"I\u2019m personally a big fan of the Wasteland series from having played the original game in the late 80s; I\u2019ve also always admired Brian Fargo\u2019s courage to experiment with new designs and game engines from my time working with him in the early days of BioWare when we worked with Interplay, and as a result I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing the next game in the Wasteland series!\" - Ray Muzyka - CEO Bioware\n\"Hats off to Fargo and inXile, I'm definitely putting my money down when they start up their Kickstarter fund, and I'll donate just as much as I did to Double Fine.  Give me Wasteland 2 already.\" - Chris Avellone - RPG designer extraordinaire\n\"Brian was one of the pioneers for the computer RPG with games like Bard's Tale and Wasteland.  I would be very excited to see what Brian could achieve with a sequel to such a classic like the first Wasteland.\"         - Rob Pardo - ExecutiveVice President of Game Design, Blizzard Entertainment\n\"WASTELAND is the game that made me a gamer.  It's still my favourite game of all time, simply because of how influential and mind-blowing it was at the time.\" - Rock Paper Shotgun reader Zerosociety\n\"Shut up and take my money!\" - Eurogamer reader Arcam (amongst many others)\nWasteland 2 is the direct sequel to the first ever post-apocalyptic computer RPG. The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s current \u201cArt of the Computer Game\u201d exhibition.\nWasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more.  It'll finally be the game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.\nFor Wasteland 2, we\u2019re getting the band back together again!. Brian Fargo who Executive Produced both Wasteland and Fallout will be heading the team. Alan Pavlish and Mike Stackpole\u2014the original game\u2019s primary designers\u2014are coming back to put the project together, and we\u2019re rounding up as many of the other designers, like Ken St. Andre, as we can. On top of that, we\u2019ll have music by Mark Morgan of Fallout 1 and 2 fame. The storyline for Wasteland 2 was written by Jason Anderson who was the co-creator of Fallout. We have also enlisted the help of the amazing concept artist, Andree Wallin to help craft the Wasteland 2 world.\nA sample of Andree's other work can be seen below.\nBrian Fargo founded Interplay Productions (By Gamers, For Gamers) in 1983 where he went on to produce and finance some of the biggest RPG's made like Bard's Tale, Fallout 1 and 2, Stonekeep, Dragon Wars, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and more. Creating a new Wasteland will be a point of pride in the long history of games.\nNot a month goes by when an email doesn\u2019t come in asking if we\u2019ve ever considered doing a sequel. Emails from gamers who remember Wasteland fondly and want, just as badly as we do, to return to that gritty world where burning through clips might be the only thing that keeps you alive; and where running out of ammo will certainly get you killed. The fact that you, the folks who know and love and play games, keep asking for Wasteland 2 told us that there is a demand for it.\n\nSo, we\u2019re coming to you for support.\n\nFinancial.\n\nAnd creative.\n\nAfter all, since you\u2019re the driving force behind this game, we want to make sure that we\u2019ll be delivering the game you want. Wasteland is ready for a sequel, and with your help, it\u2019s going to happen. As for why you should want to participate, we\u2019ll let Kotaku point out why making Wasteland 2 happen is very important:  FanFundWasteland!\nWith your collective vision, the game that was the godfather to the popular Fallout series will become a reality.  Not only will you fund the development, but you\u2019ll have a voice in how the game goes together. We will have forums up for design discussion and soliciting your ideas for what will make Wasteland 2 rock.\nThis is your chance to influence the kind of game you want to see. With fan funding, you drive the direction of game design and development. If it is important to you, it is important to us. \nThis is probably the last chance for a Wasteland sequel.  We have tried to pitch this game multiple times to game publishers, but they\u2019ve balked. They don\u2019t think there\u2019s any interest in a solid, old school type of game.  This is our shot at proving them wrong. And more importantly this could help bring back an entire genre of RPGs. The power of the Indie scene continues and we see this as all part of a bigger trend of bringing control back to the developers.\nSupporting Wasteland 2 is nothing more radical than pre-ordering a game from your favorite brick-and-mortar store. We believe strongly enough in this project and in your desire to see it become a reality, that we decided to go ahead with this Kickstarter drive to fund it.\nNuts and bolts time.\nWe\u2019re going back to the original and building from there. No first person shooter, we\u2019re going top down so you get a tactical feel for the situation. And we\u2019re not ditching the party play to turn it into some hack-and-slash bloodfest. It\u2019s turn based, tactical, with a storyline that will be deeper and broader.\nWe\u2019re determined to keep the gritty, grim and satirical writing. We\u2019re going to pitch those moral dilemmas at you. You\u2019re going to be faced with the consequences of your actions.\nWe\u2019re planning on an initial 6 months of pre-production. We\u2019ll nail down every important element that you, our creative partners, want.  Once we have all that figured out, we buckle down for 12 month development cycle. During that time, players can get a sneak peek on a private closed beta through Steam.  In addition, we will be giving you constant updates and showing you our progress along the way.\nTo do this game right, we need to raise $1 million, but you'll notice our funding request is $900,000 and that is because Brian Fargo has offered to fund the last $100,000 if need be. That\u2019s a lot of money needed, but not when compared with the budgets of most full scale RPGs made today. The original game sold over 100,000 copies\u2014on the Apple ][ and Commodore 64 platforms back in the day. If everyone who played it then backs the project at the most basic level, the game is on.\n\nBut we\u2019re looking ahead to what we can do if you all back this project in force. At $1.25 million, the money will go primarily into making the world bigger, adding more maps, more divergent stories and even more music. \n\nAt $1.5 million, the world gets even bigger. You\u2019ll have more adventures to play, more challenges to deal with, and a greater level of complexity to the entire storyline.  We\u2019ll add more environments, story elements, and characters to make the rich world come alive even more.  We will even be able to bring Wasteland 2 to OS X and Linux! And after $1.5 million the sky is the limit.\nEveryone on the team is incredibly excited about the possibilities this Kickstarter will unlock. Like you, we\u2019ve long dreamed of being able to bring Wasteland back.  If you share that dream, if you\u2019ve always wanted to watch and influence the game design process from start to finish, this is your chance. If you\u2019ve wanted to change the world and get the games you really deserve, then do it by funding this Kickstarter.  The road to Wasteland 2 is there. \nJoin us on what\u2019s going to be a wild ride.\n***A big thank you to our (already) loyal forum users for their help in crafting the Kickstarter rewards.

The number keeps going up and now the question is just how much news do we want to make with this? We're getting a lot of attention already and it seems like this little project could have an impact beyond itself. \nAll money raised will go to make the game and documentary better. Additional money means it can appear on more platforms, be translated into more languages, have more music and voice, and an original soundtrack for the documentary, and more!  We're still working to figure out exactly what we can offer, but we'll post more information as soon as possible.\nYour backing and comments have been truly inspiring to me and the team, so on behalf of Double Fine and 2 Player Productions I want to say THANK YOU!!!\nI can't wait to see where this thing can go!\nWelcome to the Adventure\nThe world of video game design is a mysterious one.  What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.  We believe that beyond the reward of receiving the finished game, the ability to be a participant in the project makes this a unique opportunity.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond the call, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from a download of the full documentary series in splendid 1080p HD video with bonus footage, to unique posters, original concept art, and even a mini painting of yourself done by the game's artist!   \nFor those of you who want to be really special, check out www.doublefine.com for details on super premium high level rewards!\n\n\n\nClosing\nFor anyone interested in the inner workings of the game industry, either professionally or as a fan, this project will be a landmark in exploring the art of development.  For people that just love great games, this is an opportunity to help bring one to fruition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Your Final Rewards are coming + Double Fine Adventure: Definitive Edition", "update_content": "Hello, Backers of Adventure!\nI love you!\nSorry, I got a little emotional there.

The inspiration and energy to create an amazing record is there but this time we will be working without the support of a label. This gives us incredible artistic freedom, but it also means we need to raise our own financing. Our hope is to release an album in 2013, ten years after our initial final show.\nWe are shooting for the financial goal of $30,000.Your pledges will be used to pay for demoing new material, recording, mixing, mastering, and associated travel expenses.Keep in mind, this budget covers making the album only. Every dollar we raise over $30,000 will be used for such things as promotion of the album once it's released because we think it would be great to have this album reach as many people as possible! Additional funds could also enable us to play some shows, because yes, we would love to play shows!\nThank you so much, every one of you for all the love, kindness, support, humor, prayers and friendship you have shown us since 1995. To our absolute joy this band continues to be more than just a band to many of you....and you are more than just folks at a show to us. If the past is any indication of the future we may all be in for a very wild ride.\nWe will keep you posted every step of the way.\nSincerely yours, Five Iron Frenzy\nPS) If you aren't familiar with our band and would like to donate, thank you very much!

We have songs about chips and salsa, lost pajamas, shark bugs, worn out socks, and going potty (as requested), as well as songs about adoption, friendship, and how God Makes Messy Things Beautiful. But we can't make this music without you.  The recording process is very expensive, and that's where you and Kickstarter come in. You pre-order CDs and select from a list of tiers with super-cool rewards, and that money helps us make the record! \nOur recording budget is $20,000, and all of that money will go to pay for the fantastic musicians, brilliant producer(Ben Shive), the engineers, studio time, artwork, duplication, etc.  If lightning strikes and we gain a lot more, then we'll start making the new round of animated videos we need for the new tour.  So if you believe in what we're doing and would like to help make it happen, I hope you'll scroll down and see the cool rewards in store for those who are inspired to partner with Slugs & Bugs!\n\n(Slugs & Bugs CDs make great birthday and Christmas gifts, so we've provided a few one-time-only opportunities for buying in bulk, OR - in the upper tiers you can purchase entire concerts and even off-beat stuff like coloring pages or birthday parties.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "The King of Pong", "update_content": "Hey friends,\nFor those of you who are scheduled to get a video of AP and I playing ping pong, the match is on tonight's calendar.

We're a team of 2 - Tom Brien and Alex Nichiporchik - making an indie game called NO TIME TO EXPLAIN for the PC & Mac. \nIn March we've released an Announcement Trailer that somehow got onto major gaming sites like Kotaku, Destructoid, Wired, RockPaperShotgun, IndieGames and many, many more. \nPeople have been asking us to open up pre-orders, bring the game to multiple consoles and so much more. The amount of positive feedback is simply amazing. \nWe could just open up pre-orders for the game, but instead want to make things interesting and allow the community to participate in actually shaping the game, along with getting into the final credits. \nAbout No Time To Explain\nNo Time To Explain is a platformer game about Time Travel, Big Jetpack Guns, Giant Enemy Crabs and Ribs in People's Eyes. \nThink Back to the Future meets The Butterfly Effect. Add a lot of blood and people getting dragged away by monsters, and you've got our game. \nYou are taken on a wild adventure of time paradoxes, things that make no sense and more things that make less sense. Eventually it will wrap up in a way that does make a little sense though. \nWhy we want your money\nWe want to know that the community is on our side and release a game that fully exceeds expectations and keep on supporting it post-release (for free, btw)\nThe community is what makes or breaks an indie game. The more people pledge, the bigger, better and available to more people on more platforms will No Time To Explain be. If the 100% goal is met, expect the game to definitely come out on Apple's iOS (iPad/iPhone). If we go beyond, think Xbox & PS3/NGP! \nWhat the money is for\n100% of the requested funding used to:\nScale up the production values (visuals, sound, music levels, MORE MONSTERS)\nBring the game to the iOS (iPad/iPhone), Mac App Store\nEverything over 100% will contribute to:\nAcquire Sony PS3 / NGP development kits and expertise to port the game to Sony consoles\nAcquire Microsoft Xbox development kits and expertise to port the game to Xbox Live Arcade (Indie Games)\nGet a stand at GamesCom 2011 (Aug 17-21, Cologne, Germany) + travel\nGet a stand at PAX Prime 2011 (Aug 26-28, Seattle, US) + travel (this is a LONG trip for us Europeans)\nI would love to tell you more about the game BUT THERE IS NO TIME!!!\nLike the trailer music?...\nDownload the AWESOME TRAILER MUSIC!
