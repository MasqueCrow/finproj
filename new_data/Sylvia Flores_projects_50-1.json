[{"backer": "Sylvia Flores", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Spirits: The Soul Collector is an ongoing, all-ages, fantasy comic from the weird and playful minds of Colin Lawler and Joseph Grabowski.\nSpirits, at the simplest level, is about the force and energy of life. The entire world around us, if we can learn to attune to it deeply and personally, reveals itself to have just as much breath within it as you or I.\nOur story follows this unique pair of seers:\nTo be a seer has almost always been considered a blessing in our world. The gift becomes a curse when an ancient and dangerously powerful dark spirit by the name of Canis begins hunting the few seers of earth, in pursuit of their souls.\nThe stakes are high as Will and Norah must work together to find and rescue the soul of Will's younger brother, Kenny, while avoiding becoming the malevolent Canis' next victims.\nThe extent of Will and Norah's journey thus far is all available digitally for free thanks to the fine folks over at LINE Webtoon. \nFor all the readers who fancy a good ol' fashioned book-in-hand, we would like to bring the first 20 chapters (160+ pages) to print! This is where you come in.\nThe book itself will be nearly a half inch thick. That's 176 full-color pages of Colin's gorgeous and magical art!\nThe cover will also feature elegant french flaps, and a snazzy spot-UV. Quite simply, this baby should look really, really good.\n*Images displayed are mock-ups, actual book will look slightly different. In particular, there will be french flaps, which are not shown above.\nFor the analytical types out there, here is more specifically why we need your help:\nIf we are lucky enough to exceed our goal, any additional earnings will go to:\n1) Funding future comic con appearances. We love meeting fans!\n2) Putting some money back into Colin's pocket. He spends a LOT of hours creating the magic you see on every page. His back has been feeling wonky, and quite frankly the dude needs a massage.\n*Images displayed are mock-ups, final products may vary.

The permanence of the art form is what drew me in first. Marble and glass do not fade. Mortar is mortar. An ancient mosaic looks exactly as intended by the artist who produced it over two millennia ago. What else can claim that kind of staying power? I find this idea simply amazing. Since my experience in Italy, I've devoted myself to changing people's perception of what a mosaic could be. Using the same materials, tools, and methods of the archaic craftsmen, I create mosaics that speak of modern things in an ancient voice. From junk food to coffee to breakfast cereal, my work permanently locks into mortar unexpected concepts drawn from the present.\nThe original pothole installation on May 20, 2013\nOn May 20, 2013, I began to apply this thinking to the numerous potholes filling the streets of Chicago. Temporarily fixed over and over again by city street crews, the potholes cried out for something more resilient, and far more aesthetically pleasing than a patch of asphalt. Early concepts of the artwork that I first installed branded the pothole as an authentic \"Chicago-style\" pothole. Other, early creations included serial numbers (to represent the vast number of city potholes), phone numbers of nearby auto repair shops (to offer convenient access to auto wheel repairs) and even flowers (as a pretty juxtaposition to the universally ugly pothole.) My ten-piece 2015 campaign called \"Treats in the Streets\" featured classic ice cream treats. That Kickstarter project even helped partially fund installing 6 pieces in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland. In addition to Chicago installs, I've been able to piggyback on existing travel plans and install new work in Los Angeles, San Antonio, Detroit, and Philadelphia. \n\"Strawberry Shortcake\" from the \"Treats in the Streets\" series.\n$8 gets you an original POTHOLE pin!\n\"Nutter Butter\" from the \"And you supply the milk\" series.\n\"Hot Sauce Packets\" from the \"Pretty Trashed\" series.\nThe project has been featured on news outlets from around the world including CBS Sunday Morning (click here), PBS, ABC News, the UK's Daily Mail, Oprah's magazine \"O\", Hyperallergic, and many others. A recent piece was even featured on the cover of the March 2017 issue of Chicago magazine.\nMarch 2017 issue of Chicago Magazine\n It's early 2018 now and pothole season will soon be upon us. Since these works of art are permanently affixed to the ground, I can't sell them. This year I'm looking for is a little funding for a 3 to 5 piece series to be installed in New York City!

(I've now done almost 60 pieces of pothole art.) Temperature plays a big part of the process and April/May is a good time for me to start, since it's usually warm enough for the mortar to set properly. Given that my canvas is a city street, the artwork occasionally gets paved over or patched with asphalt. But that comes with playing the street. For me the only risks/challenges are making sure not to get hit by a car during an installation. There is a limitless supply of pothole candidates and, when the weather cooperates, an installation takes about 2 days to complete.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Pothole Karma", "descp": "\u2022 This one earns a smile on your face knowing you've brightened NYC (and this world) in the tiniest of ways\n\u2022 Updates on the project emailed to you", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["45 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "NYC Pothole sticker", "descp": "\u2022 A cool NYC \"Pothole\" sticker\n\u2022 Updates on the project emailed to you", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["42 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 7 or more", "title": "NYC Pothole patch", "descp": "\u2022 A snazzy NYC \"Pothole\" patch\n\u2022 Updates on the project emailed to you", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "Original POTHOLE pin", "descp": "\u2022 A groovy original POTHOLE pin for your jacket, backpack, nose (not really), wherever, measures 1\" x .75\"\n\u2022 Updates on the project emailed to you", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["48 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Original Pothole pin, NYC patch, sticker", "descp": "\u2022 A groovy original POTHOLE pin for your jacket, backpack, nose (not really), wherever, measures 1\" x .75\"\n\u2022 A snazzy NYC Pothole patch.\n\u2022 A cool NYC Pothole sticker.\n\u2022 Updates on the project emailed to you.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["42 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Signed \"Treats in the Streets\" poster ++", "descp": "\u2022 A signed 18\" x 24\" poster featuring the popular \"Treats in the Streets\" campaign!\n\u2022 A snazzy NYC Pothole patch.\n\u2022 A cool NYC Pothole sticker.\n\u2022 Updates on the project emailed to you.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Signed 8\" x 10\" print PLUS!", "descp": "\u2022 An 8\" x 10\" signed print of one of the pothole art installations from the NYC 2018 campaign!\n\u2022 A snazzy NYC Pothole patch.\n\u2022 A cool NYC Pothole sticker.\n\u2022 Updates on the project emailed to you.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "POTHOLE beanie plus more!", "descp": "\u2022 An awesome light gray POTHOLE beanie!\n\u2022 A snazzy NYC Pothole patch.\n\u2022 A cool NYC Pothole sticker.\n\u2022 Updates on the project emailed to you.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["18 backers", "Limited (2 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "NYC Pothole Art T-shirt", "descp": "\u2022 A groovy designer T-shirt based on a piece installed during the NYC 2018 campaign!\n\u2022 A snazzy NYC Pothole patch.\n\u2022 A cool NYC Pothole sticker.\n\u2022 Updates on the project emailed to you.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Signed 11\" x 14\" NYC pothole print", "descp": "\u2022 An 11\" x 14\" signed print of one of the pothole art installations from the NYC 2018 campaign!\n\u2022 A snazzy NYC Pothole patch.\n\u2022 A cool NYC Pothole sticker.\n\u2022 Updates on the project emailed to you.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Signed \"Pothole Rescue\" Pothole print+", "descp": "\u2022 A 15\" x 15\" limited edition gicl\u00e9e print of \"Pothole Rescue\" by French artist Julie Baldassi.

He lived in Alabama through the most chaotic and violent period in our history when everything in society and nature conspired to drag powerless people like Traylor under.\nBut, instead of disappearing, Bill Traylor soared.\nNear the end of his long life, Traylor sat down, by the corner of Monroe Street, in the heart of Montgomery\u2019s black business district and drew. It was between 1939-1942, working with astonishing patience and focus, that Traylor created over 1000 works of singular genius that today still bear witness to his ordinary, extraordinary life and times.\nIf ever there was a story about the redemptive power of art and transcendence of the human spirit, this is it.\nWho was Bill Traylor?\nBill Traylor was born in 1853 on an Alabama cotton plantation owned by John Traylor in Dallas County, Alabama. Born into slavery, Traylor was about twelve years old when the Civil War ended, ending his legal servitude but not the basics of his way of life: he continued to live near his birthplace for another six decades, working as a farm laborer and contract farmer for the Traylor family until the late 1920s. Aging and alone, he moved to Montgomery and worked odd jobs in the segregated black neighborhood.\nA decade later, in his late eighties, too weak to work, Traylor became homeless and started to draw and paint, both past memories from plantation days and current scenes of a radically changing culture in which black people had their own businesses, schools, churches, clothing and hair styles, music, food-ways and more. Traylor witnessed profound social and political change. Raised by parents who had lived their whole lives as slaves, Traylor came of age with the first generation of African American citizens.\nHis life ultimately spanned slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, segregation and the Great Migration\u2014which led most of his children away from the South. Traylor\u2019s generation had little and struggled inestimably; yet they stood together, persisted, and laid the groundwork for the coming era of Civil Rights.\n'Fighter' by Bill Traylor\nTraylor\u2019s story is the ultimate American story. Having never learned to read or write, Traylor created his own visual language as a means to communicate and record the stories of his life. Traylor had an amazing way with color and is often compared to jazz and the blues; he translated an oral culture into something original, powerful, culturally rooted and entirely personal.\nBut music and folktales were much better at surviving than physical objects that demanded care, and Traylor\u2019s art is the sole body of work made by a black artist of his era to survive. He made over a thousand drawings and paintings on discarded cardboard between 1939 and 1942; this body of work is truly a national treasure.\nInstallation view of \u2018Bill Traylor: Drawings from the Collections of the High Museum of Art and the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts.\u2019 (Courtesy American Folk Art Museum)\nThe Story\nMy introduction to artist Bill Traylor came with the 1982 watershed exhibit \u201cBlack Folk Art in America\u201d at the Smithsonian Corcoran Museum of Art. I had applied for a small grant to film the opening and interview a number of the living artists who were able to attend, e.g. Blues musician and sculptor James \u2018Son Ford\u2019 Thomas, South Carolina artist Sam Doyle, Alabama\u2019s Mose Tolliver, and woodcarver Elijah Pierce, to name a few.\nThrough the years I\u2019ve made short films using that footage, always thinking about how to document Bill Traylor in a feature-length film. Over the more than three decades since that first encounter, my interest in Traylor continued to intensify with a desire to unravel and delve deeper into his art through the context of Southern culture and the complexities of the Jim Crow South.\nToday, Bill Traylor is one of the most celebrated self-taught artists, with one of the most remarkable and unlikely biographies. Now, coming full circle, my documentary film Bill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts will premiere at the opening of a retrospective of his work at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, organized by curator of Folk and Self-Taught Art Leslie Umberger.\nThe Film\nBill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts offers a unique perspective on a turbulent and often misunderstood century of Southern history, and on the experience of ordinary black people in extraordinary times; it also offers an inspiring lesson on the stubborn persistence of the human spirit, and the transcendent power of human creativity.\nUsing animation, new interviews, archival photography, musical and dance performances, dramatic readings, and, most importantly, Traylor\u2019s striking drawings and paintings, Bill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts is a 90-minute documentary designed to bring the spirit of his unforgettable work to life onscreen, and to introduce one of America\u2019s most important and famous artists you\u2019ve never heard of.\nThe film prominently features Traylor\u2019s enigmatic drawings and paintings, whose genius resides in their ability to tell their own stories. We will use them as Traylor drew them\u2014as a way to conjure up the world that lived in his memory of a vanished rural past, and to respond to what he saw from the margins of an early 20th century Southern city.\nMonroe Street in Alabama\nAs a seasoned filmmaker and finding a collaborating partner in writer/producer Fred Barron, we have mined the archives, explored Traylor\u2019s plantation life and Montgomery migration, researched the context of Southern black culture and history, interviewed authorities in these fields, and compiled a resource of Traylor\u2019s known pieces of art.\nThe Team\nJeffrey Wolf (Director/Producer/Editor) made the acclaimed documentary, James Castle: Portrait of an Artist, an award-winning film that delves into the life and creative process of the artist James Castle, as told by family members, artists and members of the deaf community. He has also made short films about the following artists: James \u2018Son Ford\u2019 Thomas, Martin Ramirez, Elijah Pierce, and Gregory Van Maanen. As a feature film editor, Wolf is recognized for his film work with prominent directors such as Arthur Penn, Sidney Lumet, David Grubin, John Waters, Ted Demme, and Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m. Films include The Ref, Beautiful Girls, Holes, Life, among others. Wolf is a member of the American Folk Art Museum's Council for Art Brut and Self-Taught Art. The purpose of this group is to help guide the museum curators in understanding what is important to the museum membership and public at large.\nFred Barron (Writer) was Executive Producer on Seinfeld, created Caroline in the City and wrote/executive produced The Larry Sanders Show. His BBC series My Family has been one of the longest running shows in British television history. Barron's shows have won Emmy, Cable-Ace, BAFTA and Royal Television Society awards.\nNancy Novack (Editor) is an Emmy Award winning editor of When the Levees Broke. Other award-winning films include: Take My Nose\u2026Please!, The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross for PBS, Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies and My Lai. Novack is also known for editing many American Masters, American Experience, and HBO documentaries.\nDaphne McWilliams (Producer) began her documentary career in 1995 as a line producer for the Academy Award nominated film Four Little Girls, directed by Spike Lee. Her other credits include \u201cFeels Like Coming Home\u201d and \u201cWarming by the Devils Fire\u201d for Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Blues\u201d documentary series, and the documentary Slavery by Another Name, directed by Sam Pollard, as well as Pollard's recently released feature documentary Maynard, which tells the story of the first African American mayor of Atlanta. McWilliam\u2019s recently had her directorial debut for her documentary film In a Perfect World\u2026\nHenry Adebonojo (Cinematographer) In 2001, Henry was nominated for an Emmy for his work on the documentary Half Past Autumn\u2014The Life and Works of Gordon Parks for HBO directed by Craig Rice, and in the same year, the documentary On Hallowed Ground\u2014The Championships of the Rucker, a basketball documentary program directed by Kip and Kern Konwiser, won a Sports Emmy for best documentary subject. In 2016, Henry was invited by acclaimed director Raoul Peck to contribute to the production for I Am Not Your Negro, a documentary based on an unfinished work by the author James Baldwin. This film was nominated for an Academy Award in the documentary class in 2017. He recently worked on a documentary titled Maynard about Atlanta\u2019s first black Mayor Maynard Holbrook Jackson, directed by the award-winning director Sam Pollard.\nSam Pollard (Consulting Producer) is an accomplished feature film and television video editor, and documentary producer/director whose work spans 30+ years. He\u2019s been involved with practically every iconic African-American film during that time including as director of Zora Neale Hurston: Jump at the Sun for American Masters and Slavery by Another Name for national PBS broadcast. In addition to his film, video and documentary work, Pollard is a Professor of Film Studies at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. Pollard brings invaluable experience and a deep knowledge of African-American culture as well as filmmaking expertise.\nHow will the funds be used?\nBill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts will premiere at the opening of a retrospective of his work at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Between now and then, there\u2019s a great deal of work ahead!\nTo make Bill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts a reality, we need to meet our fundraising goal with this campaign. Your contributions will help us move forward to pay for a crew to begin production in the Montgomery area during the early part of 2018.\nFilm Premiere\nI am working closely with Smithsonian American Art Museum curator of Folk and Self-Taught Art Leslie Umberger. Her exhibit \u201cBetween Worlds: The Art of Bill Traylor,\u201d will open September 28, 2018. My documentary Bill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts will premiere during the opening night of this landmark exhibit. This is the first retrospective ever organized for an artist born into slavery, and the most comprehensive look at Bill Traylor\u2019s work to date.\nLook for the link on our page for more information about the exhibit. Additional screenings will be scheduled during the run of the exhibit.\nRewards\nWe've got lots of great rewards available if you can back the film, including some from our friends at Just Folk and Intuit. Check out all the rewards on the right hand side of this page. Here's a few of our favorites:\nPoster ($150): A beautiful poster of Bill Traylor's art from Just Folk.\n  \"Bill Traylor: Unfiltered\" ($250): A book of Traylor's work, from Just Folk\n  \"Bill Traylor Postcards\" ($350): A postcard sized book of Traylor's work, from Just Folk\n  Exclusive Bill Traylor T-Shirts (part of $1000 bundle): t-shirts featuring Bill Traylor's artwork, donated by Intuit\nRaw Vision subscription (part of $2500 bundle): A yearly subscription to Raw Vision\n  The film strives to broaden our understanding of this important period of transformation in American history. Much about the decades following emancipation of slaves is misunderstood or misrepresented. This was a time that black people prospered as business professionals in Montgomery, late 1930s to early 1940s, in spite of living through the fear and volatility of Jim Crow South that impacted daily life.\nUsing the artist\u2019s life story and artistic work, we open a window into America\u2019s past. We intend to inhabit this world to provide an honest portrayal of Bill Traylor\u2019s life and times. Bill Traylor did not begin to draw until he was an old man; and when he did, his burst of creativity demonstrated a unique mastery of artistic technique and a unique chronicler of his times.\nI hope you will come along and be a partner in this remarkable journey.

We have gone deep into archival research of the time and area, assembling both archival stills and film footage, as well as sifting through records of Traylor\u2019s genealogy. With the generosity of close friends, we\u2019ve been able to keep the project going, developing the script and creating a budget, now both in place. We\u2019ve hired ace grant writers to help raise the required budget. We have also formed a Board of Advisors committed to the project. A large contribution from one investor allowed me to film the recent Detroit interviews with the few Traylor family members still alive. With your help, donations will allow our creative team to continue production in the Montgomery area. I have made so many lovely friends and collaborators in the south and around the country who are eager to help see this film completed. The deadline of September 2018 looms, and with the cooperation of the Museum and many collaborators, we are all in high gear to meet that challenge.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "JOIN THE COMMUNITY & STAY CONNECTED", "descp": "Follow BILL TRAYLOR: CHASING GHOSTS.

Over 65 million people have been forced from their homes by war and violence. These innocent people are stuck in indefinite limbo, without the freedom to work, play and live free. It\u2019s a miserable existence that crushes aspiration and traps talent. \nBut what if one small object had the power to give back opportunity to those who have lost it? That is the objective of The Pin Project: to help displaced persons, returnees and refugees achieve long-term self-reliance through meaningful work. \nBy buying or gifting a Pin made by a refugee, displaced person or returnee, you will help create employment and income for a displaced generation to craft their own futures.  \n    Pin Pricing\nWe are partners from around the world. Under Pricing we outline the approximate conversation rates for each reward you purchase. \n  The Pin measures 0.95 inches wide x 1.4 inches long (3.5 cm x 2.4 cm). The Pin weighs between 5.5 and 6 grams.\n This is how the Pin will be packaged:\n Wearing the Pin \nIconic, fashion-forward and universal, the Pin can be worn anywhere, on anything, by anyone. It\u2019s a badge of honor, signifying our shared commitment to meeting one of the greatest challenges of our time.\n   Inspired Design\nThe Pin is designed by the award-winning jewelry designer Jenny Bird. The kite is a symbol of hope and aspiration. It represents the power of humanity\u2019s ability to rise above challenges, no matter how great.\n  PLAY\n\n Gifting a Pin this Holiday Season\nAs the season of giving and goodwill approaches, make a difference with your gifts this holiday season. After backing the campaign, we\u2019ll send you a virtual card previewing the Pin and showing how it will make a difference, which you can then forward to the recipient(s) of your choosing. \n   Special Edition: Gold\nFor an extra special gift or keepsake, choose our elegant 18-Karat Solid Gold Pin. You can also choose a collection of all three Pins. \n   Special Edition: Afghan Kites\nIn countries around the world where refugees and returnees will be producing The Pin, the kite represents hope to children and adults alike. By purchasing these authentic Afghan kites to fly or display on your wall, you'll also be supporting The Pin Project as we equip a Jordanian workshop to employ Syrian refugees. You can also pair The Brass Pin with a set of five kites.\n  Video by Lalage Snow for Turquoise Mountain.\n   Pricing\n*These are approximate conversions as of November 15th, 2017. \n   Why the Pin Project is Different\nThe sheer scale of the refugee crisis is daunting. People want to help, but often don\u2019t know where to start. The Pin Project gives anyone a chance to do something positive and simple to help displaced persons, returnees and refugees today.\nThe Pin Project is also fundamentally different from donating to charity: you give refugees, displaced persons or returnees the chance to take control of their own futures through income-earning opportunities.\nBy buying a Pin you are not only providing makers with direct wages, you are also funding training and the purchase of tools and equipment required to generate long-term employment opportunities where they are desperately needed.\n    The Power of Craft\nThe UN Refugee Agency believes that 1 in 3 viable jobs for refugees is in craft production. Craft production is a long-term driver of economic growth in developing economies. The skills that crafts training provides are lifelong, suitable for people of all genders, easily transferable from generation to generation, and have been found to have higher levels of job satisfaction than many other jobs available to displaced people. \n        The Power of Work \nRefugees should not be viewed as passive victims. By providing meaningful work we can unlock their potential, develop new skills, and help them forge a pathway to autonomy. \nA prevailing phenomenon in all refugee camps is utter boredom. It isn\u2019t that most refugees don\u2019t want to work, it is that working is very rarely an option available for them. The Pin Project will reignite a sense of daily purpose and help restore structure and dignity to shattered lives.\n    A Scalable Solution \nThe Pin has been designed so that it can be made by displaced persons around the world. While elegant, the design is also simple and replicable. The materials to make the Pin can also be sourced locally.\nWe have developed a straightforward \u2018How To\u2019 guide outlining step by step instructions to creating the Pin, making it possible to scale production to almost anywhere in a relatively short amount of time. \n  Where the Pins Will Be Made\n\n  Our initial focus is on countries with the world\u2019s largest refugee, internally displaced and returnee populations. For the first 30,000 Pins, we will partner with existing workshops in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Burkina Faso. \nIf the Kickstarter Campaign reaches well beyond our target, we will be able to expand globally to support other affected refugee populations, including South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, Somali refugees in Kenya, and Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh (see the map above and refer to our stretch goals below for more information).\n  Our Stretch Goals\n\nOur impact will grow rapidly as we raise more money because our production partners will be training a greater proportion of new artisans. \nThe average artisan will make 3 pins per day, but as we produce more, we will employ more artisans who will only be able to produce 1-2 Pins per day. \nEmployment for a single refugee for can benefit up to 10 people. \nIf we raise $750,000 or roughly 30,000 pins sold, we will be able to expand production to Myanmar, Uganda, Kenya and Bangladesh. \n  Where Your Money Goes\n\nThese are our projected financials for the campaign, which may fluctuate based on the number of pins sold. \n  The production process is simple and will be similar from workshop to workshop, country to country. Turquoise Mountain, our technical partner, will provide technical assistance to new producers, leveraging their extensive experience doing so.\n  The Timeline\n    The Pin Project is an initiative being launched by a coalition of like-minded social enterprises working with refugees: Far + Wide Collective, ISHKAR, Global Goods Partners and Turquoise Mountain.   \nEndorsements\n  Campaign Partners  \n  Technical Partner\n  Production Partners \n  We hope to add other production partners to the campaign as we reach our stretch goals. \n  Press \n     Influencers\n             ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will do our best to jump over logistical hurdles and ensure production remains within the given time frame.

We are Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick, who have been collaborating together in the art world for over 20 years under the moniker Kahn & Selesnick. For your consideration, we would like to present The Carnival at the End of the World Tarot Deck.  http://kahnselesnick.biz/tarot-deck/ is now where you can find it to preorder post our very successful kickstarter campaign.\nFine Art Edition Tarot Deck\nCarnival at the End of the World Tarot is a contemporary tarot deck, a loose-leaf Book of Fate summoned from the same mythologies we have been exploring in our recent photographs, paintings and book project. In 2006, our multimedia project Eisbergfreistadt included a poker deck that when laid out in a long line, revealed a panoramic narrative of climate change and environmental devastation. In 2017, as the stakes of the Great Game have grown greater and the Anthropocene has exponentially brought change and chaos to many lives around the world, we have moved from making cards for jovial pastimes to those for divination: the Tarot, which in its traditional uses has been consulted to forecast disaster, anticipate risk, and navigate life-choices through backstage access to the Unseen. However, worry not if you don't wish to dabble in sortilege and oracular query to peruse a glimpse of what the future may have in store for you--you may also ruminate upon the cards one by one in a linear fashion, and meditate upon the views from the Fool's Journey as one would read a Pilgrim's Progress; or, just as seekers and wanderers once stowed painted icons and gilded relics in the pockets of their cloaks, the Tarot can be a portable trove of mystifying talismanic images to accompany, inspire and entertain you on your own peregrinations.\nA Sample Reading\nAs long as people have been using Tarot cards for divination, its symbolism and methodologies have evolved to keep time with societal change. Carnival at the End of the World Tarot keeps to the Rider-Waite-Smith nomenclature and numbering for the major arcana and also presents pictorial scenes and similar suits for the pip cards for the minor arcana, but its iconography and interpretive values are appropriate to our own uncertain times. One of Kahn & Selesnick's collaborators, the writer/artist/medium Sarah Falkner, has channeled Madame Lulu's Book of Fate--a guidebook and travelogue specifically created for the interpretation and practical use of the Carnival at the End of the World Tarot Deck. The cast of characters from Truppe Fledermaus--who one can also find in Kahn & Selesnick photographs and motion pictures--star as the tarot's portentous archetypes, whether in the leading roles of the Major Arcana or in the Minor Arcana's ensemble pieces among the four suits and their corresponding alchemical elements, of which Earth, Air, Fire and Water show the impact of climate change amid sinking islands, arsenals of armaments, blazing forests, and melting icecaps. In addition to the usual suits, the deck includes three extra cards each representing one of the three main members of the Truppe Fledermaus--Dr. Falke, Count Orlofsky, and Madame Lulu--as featured in Kahn & Selesnick's books and narratives. These three cards can be mixed into the querent's readings to provide an extra layer of meaning.\nThe Full Deck\n  Original Paintings\nProcess\nSketches for the cards were created by the artists, and then each was painted in watercolor and gouache. The complete set of 78 paintings were completed in July 2017. After scanning the paintings and adding typography, we made an oversized fine art first edition printed, cut and boxed by ourselves, limited to 200 sets that we show at our gallery venues. The reception to the first edition has been extraordinary--but the time and expense required to hand produce this fine art deck required a correspondingly high price tag, and convinced us of the need to produce a deck that was more affordable to the general public. \nThe Fool\nFunding Goals\nWe are looking to raise the cost of printing the tarot deck on durable stock by one of the best presses for playing cards. This will require at least $12,000 for a print run of 2,000. Like the Fool, we have set upon our path as artists traveling light and spending any money we earn along the way to produce new adventures for our audience, including all the original costumes and sets that our cast of characters inhabit. This Kickstarter campaign will enable us to produce a tarot deck priced accessibly for the average person, and while the decks are being printed, we can busy ourselves dreaming up our next story for your consideration.\nExamples from the Major Arcana\n  Examples from the suit of Pentacles\n  Examples from the suit of Cups\n  Examples from the suit of Swords\n  Examples from the suit of Wands\n  Truppe Fledermaus Bonus Cards\n  A Talisman Locket with Spirit Animal\n Here is how to add items to your current pledge:\nHow can I change my pledge amount?\nVisit the project page and click the blue \u201cManage\" button that appears next to your pledge amount.

We will be sending out a survey when the project is funded and it will ask you what you ordered, so if you are paying more than the amount of the reward you initially selected on the survey you will be able to indicate the combination of rewards you were pledging for.  So if you want both the print of the whole deck and a fine art deck you pledge the combined amount of both rewards and explain it all to us in the survey. Its a bit wonky, but thats the kickstarter way,  absurd , like our deck.\nPlease note: all cards seen above and in the video are from our fine art edition. There may be some very minor changes in formatting due to the differing size & layouts used by commercial producers of playing cards. In addition, the standard deck will be packaged in a tuck box rather than a band and slipcase. Thanks! \nProject video directed by Jason Marlow, with music by John Gromada.\nThe Drowning World\n  The Fool from Madame Lulu's Book of Fate\n CARNIVAL AT THE END OF THE WORLD TAROT: THE BOOK OF FATE\nDear Querent:\nTo ask a question is to start a Journey! The Book of Fate is a Traveler's gazetteer, loose-leaf and unbound: it is for you to shuffle and arrange the narrative, it is for you to play with the cards the game of Chance in which the Unseen has a hand and thereby tells a story you may hear--with advice and messages for you--if only you quiet your own mind. The Tarot in its traditional uses has been consulted to forecast the portions to be served on the Plat du Jour of disaster and fortune, to anticipate risk, and to navigate life-choices through backstage access to the players under direction of the Unseen. Traveler, you have in your powers both Will and Surrender, and the Wise determine which to apply or relinquish, assesses what in the forecast is fixed and what is mutable, query what can and cannot be controlled or prepared for, feel in the gut what is best avoided or embraced.\nAnother piece of advice for the Traveler: keep in mind that the Tarot, of which the Book of Fate is but one conveyance, is a time-tested, well-used method of transport. The Traveler may already be in possession of precious cargo from past journeys--historic meanings and interpretations which the Traveler holds dear to heart\u2014let somesuch serve you well on this Journey if they will, but endeavor also to consider when deploying this oracle the newfangled Interpretation of Dreams and Nightmares presented here readymade especially for this, the Anthropocene, in whatever concatenation of images and numbers, signs and wonders, that Traveler makes from the Book of Fate.\nLastly, worry not if you don't wish to dabble in sortilege and oracular query to peruse a glimpse of what the future may have in store for you! You may also ruminate upon the cards one by one in a linear fashion, and meditate upon the views from the Fool's Journey as one would read a Pilgrim's Progress; or, just as seekers and wanderers once stowed painted icons and gilded relics in the pockets of their cloaks, the Tarot can be a portable trove of mystifying talismanic images to accompany, inspire and entertain you on your own peregrinations.\nMay you enjoy the enjoyable, escape the escapable, endure the endurable! Bon voyage et bonne chance!\n\u2013-Madame Lulu, channeled by the Medium Sarah Falkner", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur self-produced poker deck taught us a lot about the management and completion of a project similar to the tarot--and the swift selling out of the first edition showed us that we had underestimated our potential audience in our initial print run. If we reach our goal for this Kickstarter campaign, we will immediately start working with the printer to match the color and quality of our original paintings with the same painstaking care and patience that we deploy when creating our fine art prints.\n The deck will be printed on Robusto card stock, an extra thick and beautiful card stock, the best we can find, and manufactured by Expert Playing Card Company. Though we maintain a busy schedule of lectures, exhibitions, and artistic practice, we will accomplish the mailing and fulfillment part of the Kickstarter campaign in an efficient and timely fashion.

It\u2019s been quite a year , but we went live with the Carnival at the End of the World Tarot Deck a year ago today. Hopefully everyone has received their rewards at this point , email us if you haven\u2019t for some reason. We learned a lot about mail rates and lost packages but we pray most of you are happy with your decks and books and prints , it\u2019s been an amazing experience connecting with you all. We continue to offer the decks for you on our website kahnselesnick.com ( though at a higher price than you supporters paid ) so do tell your friends about it and give a deck or two to your loved ones this holiday season , we have them in stock so should be able to get them out in time ( except for the week of dec 7 to 13 when we will be in character shooting new circular photos and a dance of death project with the nomadic school of wonder on Fogo Island Newfoundland Canada. ) We may run a Black Friday special on the deck so look out for that post American thanksgiving Thursday.\nWe\u2019ve been working hard on preparing another Kickstarter Card Deck issue , in January we hope , a reissue of our 2008 Eisbergfreistadt Panoramic storytelling poker deck. We\u2019ve reprinted the original files , a brand new water coloring of the cards to make them brighter and reworked the black line outlines to improve nearly every card,so they will be more artful and magical we hope. They tell the story of climate change and rising waters in four suits , Birds, Chimneys , Icebergs and Weeds. 52 cards , plus we will see if the printers plates allow some extras and there will be a brand new box. Paper stock will be improved , and if we can we may make them larger than standard poker deck , all in all this next Kickstarter should allow us to rival the quality of the Carnival Deck and get our first deck out to more people as it\u2019s been in constant demand since we sold out the original run of 2000 9 years ago. We will offer again a handprinted version as well for special collectors and this time we hope to have the pitfalls of timing and distribution more worked out , our sincere apologies for any and all delays and mail issues , all things that were largely out of our hands this year. We hope some of you will be excited to support this deck as well on social m\u00e9dia , it really helped us with the Carnival Deck and we really appreciate any and all posts you make on your tarot forums, instagram ,Facebook ect for both decks. We will keep you posted. The video reviews we\u2019ve seen for the Carnival Deck have all been so delicious to watch , and hearing and seeing your stories of how you use the deck all give us a hopeful shot of support everyday we hit the studio with the fear and wistful longing for our glorious planet to survive.

So if any of you single deck supporters from outside of USA want to help us out of a financial hole created by this difference , we will throw in the two extra cards from the fine art edition , 6 of Wands and High Priestess if you can PayPal is the $10 difference in shipping from what we expected it to cost to the reality of shipping to the rest of the world for a commercial single deck.

Anyone who never filled out a backer report this is really crucial, We can\u2019t send decks without it , if you really can\u2019t make it work message us your address and what you ordered through the Kickstarter and any additional orders you may have added on through some method and we will do our best to muddle through all those messages. We know it\u2019s been a long time since you all ordered so no worries about changing addresses , many of you have moved , just this is your last chance to inform us on any further changes .

It\u2019s all hand addressed old school with stamps if I can get enough or print them , sorry we just can\u2019t spend the time for 700 orders at once inputting and emailing each of you. We will make an announcement on here when all the packages are out the door so you all know they are on their way, Till then please don\u2019t ask privately if we\u2019ve shipped it will drive us bonkers at a time we need all our wits about us. We are very much a cottage industry shipping out of a real 1830s cottage on a marsh with old school technology , in keeping with the flavor of the deck.

We finally got firm numbers and dates from the factory and it\u2019s printing now, and will be ready to ship to us in mid April , they said hopefully April 22nd.

What will the next few years teach kids about America and what it stands for? What will they learn from the current U.S. president about how to treat other people?\nLet\u2019s make sure kids know the story of a president who represented the best of us, and who showed us what we can do when we all work together for change. \nBecause kids should know: \nWe once had a president who was kind and who knew that everyone is important.\nKids should know that we once had a president who pulled the country out of the worst economic crisis we've seen since the Great Depression, saved the auto industry, ended two wars, and championed diversity and equality. \nKids should know that we once had a president who was black. \nAbove all, kids should know that all of us can be a part of making our country better, for everyone in it\u2026\n\u2026 and change can start with them.\nThe words and the art for the book are done. Now I need to hire a layout designer to bring it all together in a professional book, buy ISBNs, get the first 1,000 copies printed, and ship everything!\n1. The book: Hardcover, 32 pages, eight inches by eight inches\u2014small enough to be held by little hands but appropriate for bigger readers, too.\n\nThe book will be filled with words by Laura Olin (that's me!) and original artwork by Franziska Barczyk telling the story of the 44th president of the United States to inspire kids to be kind and make change.\n  2. Exclusive to Kickstarter: A coloring pack featuring original illustrations of Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, and Bo the dog alongside motivational messages (and barking; Bo can't really talk). Color one in with your favorite shades and put it on your fridge or next to your desk for a little daily inspiration. \n3. A \"70 Ways to Change the World\" poster PDF you can print at home and put up on your wall to remind you that you have the power to help, in ways big and small\u2014from registering a friend to vote to giving a surprise burrito to someone who looks like they could use it. A Kickstarter Exclusive. \n4. Your friend or family member's name in the Changemaker Hall of Fame\nONLY ON KICKSTARTER: Have the name of your daughter, son, niece, nephew, or friend printed in the book as someone who will change the world\u2014or someone who already has.\n5. Signed copies, a school pack, and more!\nMy name is Laura Olin. I\u2019ve worked in politics and advocacy for most of the last 15 years, including two years on the 2012 campaign to re-elect Barack Obama. (Among other things, I was in charge of @BarackObama on Twitter, back when we had a president who recognized he had more important things to do than tweeting and thus asked other people to do it for him.) \nI make stuff on the side: I had a humor book published last year and ran a popular email newsletter for three years.\nI need help to hire a layout designer to bring the book together, buy ISBNs, print the first 1,000 copies, and ship them. \nTHE PLAN:\nNovember: Kickstarter campaign launches\nDecember: Kickstarter campaign ends\nJanuary/February: Book gets laid out\nMarch: Book goes to printer\nApril/May: Books packaged and shipped!\nWHERE THE $ WILL GO:\n I hope you'll be a part of putting this small good thing into the world.

However, even with our now years of experience with klokers, given the degree of innovation that KLOK-08 represents, the risks of this campaign are:\n\n- technical risk of KLOK-08 dial colors: the watches presented on these pages are prototypes. Considering the state-of-the-art technologies used, the industrial phase may make changes to the KLOK-08 dial colors. This will not however affect the aesthetical quality of KLOK-08. \nBesides, klokers reserves the right to change one color or even not provide some color references at all if these ones have not been enough requested. In such a case, klokers may provide another model. \n\n- industrial risk: in the watchmaking industry, the extremely high precision of components is essential. The technical team will be paying very close attention to respect of tolerances, precision, and quality of components. It is possible that the manufacturing tolerances could change depending on the challenges and difficulties encountered to comply the components\u2019 specifications. The necessary mastery of the production ramp-up phase may also cause changes to the delivery schedule. \n\n- financial and economic risk: klokers is a successful but a young company which constantly adapts to the evolutions of its exploitation and environment (market, legislation, norms, etc.). This environment may affect the development of the company and postpone some elements of the production planning.\n\n- Kickstarter risk: Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform which helps projects under development, not an on-line sales site like Amazon, eBay, Priceminister, CDiscount, etc. As stated by Kickstarter, \u00abwe are not here to buy some products but to create something that does not exist yet. \u00bb \nAll contributions will be engaged for the manufacturing and the industrialization of KLOK-08. These funds will be committed for this purpose. As backers on Kickstarter, reimbursement for the pledge is impossible. In the Kickstarter context, the backers do accept these risks as they support a project under development. \n\nIf any of the information provided in this document changes then we will notify all of our backers in a transparent and timely manner.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac199 or more", "title": "SUPER EARLY BIRD (save \u20ac180)", "descp": "PACK 3: 1 KLOK-08 with 1 regular strap.\nNumbered edition\nYou'll choose colors of dial and strap later", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["343 backers", "Limited (157 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac249 or more", "title": "SUPER EARLY BIRD (save ~ 50%)", "descp": "PACK 4: 1 KLOK-08 with 1 regular strap + 1 accessory.\nNumbered edition\nYou'll choose colors of dial and strap + accessory later", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["155 backers", "Limited (345 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac259 or more", "title": "EARLY BIRD (save \u20ac120)", "descp": "PACK 5: 1 KLOK-08 with 1 regular strap.\nYou'll choose colors of dial and strap later", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (1000 left of 1000)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac319 or more", "title": "EARLY BIRD (save ~ 35%)", "descp": "PACK 7: 1 KLOK-08 with 1 regular strap + 1 accessory.\nYou'll choose colors of dial and strap + accessory later", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (498 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac379 or more", "title": "EARLY DELIVERY", "descp": "PACK 8: 1 KLOK-08 with 1 regular strap + a klokers tote bag.\nYou'll choose colors of dial and strap later", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac389 or more", "title": "SUPER EARLY BIRD -

Help us create a powerful venue in which to explore them.\nLAAB #0: DARK MATTER will concern itself with mythological blackness, and black bodies in science fiction.  \nRon has recruited a cadre of bold thinkers, writers, artists, musicians, and genre-defiers to mine this rich territory. LAAB is their long-overdue soapbox, their stage, their megaphone, their clubhouse, and their launching pad \u2013 all in a mass-produced, widely accessible newspaper format that everyone can enjoy.\n The debut issue will be jam-packed with:  \nAn interview with musician and actor Saul Williams  \nA conversation with graphic artist Trenton Doyle Hancock \nJames Romberger on Jean-Michel Basquiat \nA discussion with the poster artist Alexandra Bell\nA critical analysis of George Lucas's THX 1138 \nRonald Wimberly's visual tribute to Sun Ra \nA review of BLACK, the new comic from Black Mask Studios  \nOver a dozen pages of comics and illustration by Ronald Wimberly\n...and much more!\nThis Kickstarter isn't just about making this first issue happen. A community forum deserves to be heard by every member of the community, and so part of our funding goal goes towards donating a minimum of 200 copies of LAAB to free public libraries around the country. For every $5,000 we raise above our funding goal of $30,000, we will increase that amount of freely donated copies by 100. That's about one donated copy for every two and a half copies sold.  \nWe're also offering a LOCAL HERO reward tier, which would enable a generous backer to donate 50 or more copies to an institution of their choosing.\nThis isn't just because we love libraries (though we certainly do). It's because LAAB's vision is incomplete if its ideas can't travel into every nook and cranny of our culture, and into every member of our community's hands.\nSTRETCH GOALS!\n$35,000: We will donate a total of 300 copies of LAAB to various free public libraries across the country.\n$40,000: CUSTOM BAGS!\nEvery copy of LAAB #0 will come in a custom made plastic bag, designed by Ronald Wimberly and Ma\u00eblle Doliveux.\n$45,000: We will donate a total of 500 copies of LAAB to free public libraries across the country.\n$50,000: LAAB PATCHES!\n2\" embroidered patches featuring the LAAB logo. Will look very slick on a hat, bag, jacket, or literally anywhere else.\n$60,000: FOUR NEW PAGES!\nWe will add FOUR piping hot pages of brand new content, bringing the length of the mag to 36 pages. \n$70,000: We will donate a total of 1,000 copies of LAAB to free public libraries across the country.\n$95,000: We will donate a total of 1,500 copies of LAAB to free public libraries across the country.\n$100,000: EIGHT NEW PAGES! \nWe will add EIGHT pages of fresh new content, increasing the total length of the mag to 40 full broadsheet pages.\nAnd so on.\nWe can't make this happen without you. \nOur mission at Beehive Books is to enable unusual projects by artists and thinkers we admire -- unique delivery systems for vital ideas and aesthetics. Ronald Wimberly and the diverse cast of talents he's assembled for this issue are the kinds of voices we need tackling the complex and charged issues the magazine will address. We need your help amplifying their signal, and broadcasting it all over the world. \nPlease become part of this campaign, and make LAAB MAGAZINE a reality.\nORIGINAL ART\nIn order to raise funds for LAAB MAGAZINE, Ronald is making a number of pieces of original artwork available for sale exclusively through this campaign.\nThis is a rare opportunity to own a handmade, one-of-a-kind piece of Wimberly artwork.

His most recent works of note were the critically-acclaimed Prince of Cats, Black History in Its Own Words, and the cartoon essay \u201cLighten Up\u201d for The Nib.\nBEEHIVE BOOKS is a new small press founded by the artist and designer Ma\u00eblle Doliveux, and editor and Locust Moon co-publisher Josh O\u2019Neill. They just finished funding a line of literary classics, illustrated by the great contemporary artists Paul Pope, Yuko Shimizu and Bill Sienkiewicz. Along with his partners at Locust Moon, Josh published the Kickstarter-funded projects THE LOST WORK OF WILL EISNER and the Eisner and Harvey Award-winning anthology LITTLE NEMO: DREAM ANOTHER DREAM. Their forthcoming art book THE TEMPLE OF SILENCE collects the work of Herbert Crowley, a forgotten master of comics and graphic art from the early 20th century.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith seven successful Kickstarters totaling over half a million dollars to our name (between Locust Moon, Beehive Books and Janice Magazine), Josh and Ma\u00eblle are veterans of crowdfunded publishing.

See 'Add-ons' below.\nAbout this project\nFollowing on the heels of the first Hobo Coins project, I'm super-thrilled to offer the next series of four all-new designs based on iconic US Coins.\nWhat are Hobo Coins?\nThroughout time, people have modified coins by hand-carving or engraving their own designs into existing coins. But this form of folk art really took off during the Great Depression. Those that were out of work or down on their luck took to modifying coins by engraving their own designs into them. They would use pocket knives or even filed down nails to carve beautiful designs that were as varied as the artists themselves. This art form evolved over time to often portray skeletons or skulls, incorporating elements from the coins as part of the final works of art. They would almost always keep the lettering on the coins.\nThe Hobo Coins project brings back this largely forgotten piece of American history. These coins are being minted by the oldest continuously operated private mint in the U.S and are SOLID. They each weigh about the same as 5 US. quarters, and are a little larger than the size of a US Dollar coins (these coins are 39 mm). Die-struck with over 100 tons of pressure in solid metal alloys and featuring antique finishes.\nPlease note that Hobo Coins are not actual US currency or modified US currency coins, they are die-struck new coins at different sizes, weights, and (clearly), different art than actual US coins.\nHelp revive a piece of history you can carry!\nThe Designs\nEach coin was crafted and designed by me using some of the most iconic coins as their base:\n\u2018The Davey Jones Locker\u2019 - 1919 S Wheat Penny \nThe original wheat penny designed by Victor D. Brenner made its debut in 1909. My rendition reimagines the coin with a nautical theme underscoring the dangers that lurk below. Aged with an antique silver-finish the coins will have a \u2018smooth\u2019 edge like the original (not \u2018reeded\u2019). As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin.\nThe Davey Jones Locker - 1919 S Wheat Penny\n \u2018The John Henry\u2019 - 1871 20 Dollar Coin\nFolk hero John Henry immortalized in metal. Around 1870 or '71, John Henry raced a steam-powered hammer on the C&O train line and won! He did, tragically, die soon after from exhaustion, but his spirit of determination lives on this Hobo Coin! Aged with an antique silver-finish and as with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original 20 Dollar coin.\nThe John Henry - 1871 Twenty Dollar Coin\n\u2018The Good Doctor\u2019 - 1937 Buffalo Nickel \nMy take on the classic \u2018Plague Doctor\u2019 updated with an industrial age motif and featuring a fearsome rat (the source of the plague and its spread) guarding its prize. This is no mere Templeton! Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin. This coin will have a smooth edge like the Buffalo nickel (smooth edge).\nThe Good Doctor - 1937 Buffalo Nickel\n\u2018The Aviator\u2019 - 1942 Mercury Dime\nMy latest take on the classic Mercury dime, featuring one bad ass pilot on the front, and a Catch-22 inspired Mitchell B-29 on the back\u2014which is, incidentally, the source of my website\u2019s name Dead on Paper. Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin. This coin will have a \u2018reeded\u2019 edge like the original Mercury dime.\n  The Aviator - 1942 Mercury Dime\nThe \u2018Hobo Coin / Davey Jones Locker\u2019 Limited Edition Print \nTo complement the coins, I\u2019ve designed this print which is inspired by the Davey Jones Locker coin. Each print is 18\u201d x 24\u201d, signed, and numbered.\nLimited Edition Hobo Coins Print - Signed and Numbered - click to view higher resolution at deadonpaper.com\n  Add-ons \nAll Add-ons are immediately available (including Solid Silver coins this time).

With your support, this movie can be completely finished before the end of the year!\nSilent cinema, Hammer Horror, psychic science, and UFOs.\nMy friends John Terendy (cinematographer), Aaron Shaps (my co-writer and co-director), and I grew up on Fortean Times, Man Myth & Magic, and Chariots of the Gods? and love weird UFO history, so we decided to take a little-known historical record, pull it as far into the realms of conspiracy theories as possible, and then bring it back until it matched what we know today.  It was exciting to write an absolutely outlandish story where, if you check it against the news reports from the past century, everything lines up.  Read on to see what bizarre liberties we took with the story of...\nThe first documented UFO crash in American history. \nIt is widely believed that Roswell, New Mexico is the site of the first UFO crash in American history- but that distinction actually goes to a small town in Texas. According to an historical account reported in the local newspaper, early in the morning on April 17, 1897, the residents of Aurora (located just outside of Fort Worth) were awakened by a loud explosion as an inexplicable airship crashed to Earth\u2013six years before the first flight of the Wright Bros, and 40 years before the town even had electricity. A body was found at the site and buried in an unmarked grave in the town cemetery, the wreckage was thrown into a deep well, and a legend was born.\nSignal Service officer T. J. Weems, the military presence at the site, was coincidentally (or not) an expert in Astronomy and reported that the creature was a Martian. The well water where the wreckage was reportedly dumped appeared to be tainted in some way from that point forward, causing strange afflictions. Almost 80 years later in the 1970s, a grave widely believed to be that of the unknown pilot was robbed before the body could be exhumed by university scientists, and a fragment of metal unearthed in Aurora defied scientific explanation.  \nAll this leads to the question:\nWhat crashed in Aurora, Texas, in 1897?\n  A popular conspiracy theory is that German scientists developed an antigravity engine in the 1940s that powered a saucer-shaped craft called Die Glocke, or \"the bell,\" and that these test flights were responsible for the increase in UFO sightings in that era.  I won't go into detail here, but a google search will open up a Pandora's box of theories- including that the experimental craft was capable of inter-dimensional and time travel.  What if they were right?  What if the 1940s and the 1897 UFO sightings were connected?\nThe Fledermaus Pilot.\nOur first step was designing the suit for the test pilot for Die Glocke; he would need to be alien and elegant, and we needed a visionary to conjure our retro-futuristic fashion. Brom is high among the most celebrated artists in the world of Fantasy (in 2013 his thirty-year career was honored with the prestigious Spectrum Grand Master award), and he's also one of the genuinely nicest men I know.  To design the costume for Die Glocke's test pilot\u2013from an elite division of pilots known as Fledermaus, or \"bat\"\u2013I gave Brom one direction: imagine if 1930s sportscar maven Ettore Bugatti were designing a deep-sea diving suit.  And to construct the suit with an eye towards hypersensual fetishism, we needed someone rooted in fashion over costuming\u2013the atelier Ritual crafted the perfect embodiment of our vision and Brom\u2019s design.\nNothing says \"1897\" like a Nazi in a black leather space suit.\nThe creature.\nThe inter-dimensional travels of Die Glocke attracted the attention of a rare and peculiar cryptid-style creature we affectionately named Pango; to create this extra-dimensional cryptid SyFy Face Off winners Rayce Bird and J. Anthony Kosar envisioned a bear-pangolin hybrid and Rayce's team brought him to life using masterful skills in creating time-tested practical effects.\nFinal concept sketch before production\n  Production painting by Symbolist painter Gail Potocki\n  Before construction, Rayce used a computer to 3-D model the suit\n  Pango during the sculpting process\n    Jack Campbell starred in the two most-watched programs in Australian television history: the internationally acclaimed series Underbelly: Razor as the notorious legend of Sydney's 1920s underworld \"Big Jim\" Devine, and the award-winning All Saints as the romantic Dr. Steve Taylor. I met with Jack the day he moved here from Australia, and he's the finest leading man I could imagine to portray the gravitas of a soldier thrust into the cauldron of one of the greatest mysteries of the late 19th century.\nThe Aurora screenplay was specifically written with English film, television, and theatre actor Robert Boulter in mind. He's best known for a recurring role as Kieron Fletcher on the BBC series Casualty, turns in the theatre productions Mercury Fur and Citizenship, and the film Donkey Punch. Boulter's meticulous stagecraft delivers the subtle, magnetic intensity needed to humanize a complicated character, delivering a performance reminiscent of legendary silent film star Conrad Veidt. \nBehind-the-scenes photos of the filming of Aurora... To learn more click here: https://www.aurorafilm.info/blog\n  No one on the planet is better equipped to conjure the tones needed to create an alien language than visionary artist Genesis P-Orridge. From honors including being named the legendary \"Godperson of Industrial Music,\" founding the psychedelic, world-shaking band Psychic TV and their most recent incarnation PTV3, and changing the minds of magicians and artists everywhere as a visionary cultural engineer, Genesis is comfortable moving through dimensions other than this earthly plane. Utilizing cut-up techniques inspired by William S. Burroughs, Genesis provides the voice of the creature.\nThe eerie and jarring moments on the soundtrack are the work of two of my favorite musicians on the planet: the unearthly sounds of elegant avant-garde thereminist Armen Ra, and experimental rock drummer Brian Viglione (Nine Inch Nails, Dresden Dolls, Violent Femmes).\nThe gorgeous orchestrations that completely bring Aurora to life were created by composer Troy Sterling Nies; his work for the H. P. Lovecraft Society is equal parts terrifying and heartbreakingly beautiful. Tying all the music together is production master Joe Cassidy of the Belfast-founded band Butterfly Child and Shepard Fairey's L.A. art project N\u00d8ISE.\n \nIn our case, we envisioned a certain kind of movie: Black and white. Western. Science Fiction. Cryptid-style monster. UFOs. Twilight Zone-style anthology. These are all subjects that are a lot of fun and have a lot of artistic integrity, but not much commercial appeal to a larger studio. If you love the things on this list as much as I do, supporting us on Kickstarter is how we can finish the film and make this unique story come to life, exactly as imagined and with NO artistic compromise.\n  All the money raised goes directly into the production and manufacturing of rewards.  There are also a number of post-production steps including taking our edit into a studio for what is called grading- where it's fixed to look right on every possible viewing platform- and the same step on the audio side, called mastering. Those are expensive steps, but necessary.  Many of the people on this page believed both in me and in this movie so much that they have generously deferred payment until we could run a Kickstarter- so we will hopefully have enough left over to get everyone caught up as well.  It would be impossible for this movie to be profitable, but without this Kickstarter campaign it will take another two years to get everything for this movie finished.\nAbove all else you get not only my deepest gratitude, but I can share that you'll have the appreciation of everyone involved with this project\u2013 there are an infinite number of pursuits more financially rewarding than being an artist, and our culture continues to move on a path where everything is available and everything is free- making the support of the people who want to experience the artwork more directly necessary than ever.  By helping us make this you also get the invisible badge of being someone who took part in an act of creation.  \nWhile that is both romantic and noble, my friends and I have all banded together to make it rewarding on the physical plane as well by making some very special objects.  Not all of the designs are finalized, but we promise that they will be gorgeous, tactile experiences that will exceed your expectations!\nTwo-disc sets (The movie and the soundtrack)\nSpecially-printed movie posters (Letterpress, varnish-layered offset)\nTintype photo facsimiles (Insanely cool 1897-style metal print photos)\nVinyl records (We will be going really far with this packaging.)\nT-shirts (High-quality screenprinted vintage-style tees)\nEnamel pin of the creature!\n\n    Please note: if you select the Complete Poster tier ($250) you will receive ALL the posters published- all 6 posters with text, and also any variant posters that we produce (up to 11 posters for $250!)\nWet-plate photographer Anton Orlov brought his 19th century camera to the set, and took photos of the cast and crew in the wild west setting. We'll reprint some of these onto metal plates with modern ink techniques so that you can hang on your wall perfect 8\" x 10\" facsimiles of the tintype photos- these look and feel just like the original metal plate photos!\nThe vinyl record and the wax cylinder will contain the sounds of Troy Sterling Nies, Genesis P-Orridge, Armen Ra, Brian Viglione, Andrew Dalziell, Joe Cassidy, and myself (Thomas Negovan).  I also did a TEDx talk on archaic technologies, so we will be releasing a song on wax cylinder that won't be available anywhere else*.\n*really.\n      I've always devoted my life to trying to encourage connection through art and stories. For over twenty years I've written books on history and art, and curated exhibitions of late 19th and early 20th century artworks of art and artists who have inspired much of today\u2019s popular culture. Researching fascinating history and finding ways to share those stories with the world in an exciting way\u2013 plus decades of hands-on contact with the finest relics from earlier eras\u2013 has helped me develop an intense sensitivity to aesthetics and visual art.\nFor my first art project exploring the 19th century, I gave a TEDx talk on archaic technologies back in 2011. \nAurora is the next step in that evolution.\nAs a kid, my two favorite shows were The Twilight Zone and The Rifleman. Now as a dad, I find myself wanting to create something that might inspire my son when he's a little bit older. With this project, I wanted to create something that had the excitement of the 1950s and 1960s television shows I watched in syndication on Sunday afternoons, but with an undercurrent that was absolutely modern.\nI can't articulate how grateful I am for everyone involved in this project, for their incredible support and creative energy. If I typed how much the people named here mean to me, the page would be overflowing with love.\nI hope that you are as excited about this film as I am, and just as excited for the posters and tintypes and records!

My artwork is typified by dream-like, faintly creepy neotraditional still lifes and macabre fantasy wildlife mixed media paintings in gouache and colored pencil on wooden panels. I am a mostly self-taught artist, and I'm inspired by cartoons, scientific illustration, and folklore and myths. \nWhile most of you know me as the creator of The Wooden Tarot, The Earthbound Oracle, and The Seeker's Lenormand (among other things), what I actually spend most of my time doing is larger gouache and colored pencil paintings on wood while traveling around the States to show work at outdoor art fairs. Just this past year I've shown at art festivals in Buffalo, Minneapolis, and Salt Lake City, as well as several other local southeastern shows like Dragon Con and the Atlanta Dogwood Festival (where I won best in 2D Mixed Media in 2016). It's a lot of work, but the freedom and experience I get from traveling and selling my own art is worth all of the mileage and labor.\nmy loaded down van somewhere along the way to Utah.\nOne of the staples of the work that I show at art festivals is print reproductions of original paintings. I scan all of my originals in 900dpi sections and piece them together in Photoshop to offer a variety of print sizes. They're an alternative to more pricey original paintings, and are a great place to start for people just getting into collecting art or for folks who just want something cool on their walls.\nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to fund the purchase and operation of a large scale, 24\" giclee printer to make much larger prints than the sizes I currently have available. Earlier this year I offered 18x24\" prints on wood that were very popular, but unfortunately very expensive to have made through a professional print shop. It was also difficult to match up their production and shipping times with my own show schedule. So, after years of research on giclee printers, and after running my own smaller printer, I've decided it's time for an upgrade.\nBasically, I want to go bigger and better. Giclee (essentially a fancy word for an aqueous inkjet print, but with much higher implied quality) prints are industry standard for the fine art world. While my current print offerings are archival and rated to last 100+ years, I would still like to push the quality of the prints that I offer even higher along with offering MUCH bigger sizes. It will be much easier and more cost effective in the long run if I make my own prints. \nBy backing this Kickstarter, you'll be helping me fund the very high initial costs of acquiring the printer while receiving some limited edition prints at a much lower price than if you bought them from my online store or at an art festival.\n     Click here to see available prints.\n$20\nThese are the standard size prints that I offer online and at art festivals. They're open edition, giclee prints on archival matte fine art paper, with a half inch border around the image.

His wares were tailored for and sold in high-end retailers such as Hammacher Schlemmer, Saks Fifth Avenue, and the original Pottery Barn store in Manhattan. Milan's works are in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, The Center for Art in Wood, the Museum of Arts and Design, and many private collections. Milan was also a teacher, mentor, and role model for dozens of successful artists and woodworkers who found inspiration in his classes. Despite Milan's own success, he slipped into obscurity after his death without reaching the notoriety of his peers.\nThis project aims to change that.\nGrouping of Four Birds.

The pages reflect the clean, flowing, functional style espoused by Emil Milan himself, while the narration is not just a biography but a fascinating history of woodcraft in modern America. The authors' passion and respect for their subject shows in the meticulous research they undertook to piece together the story of his life and influence, as well as the ample documentation of his work. Bowls, spoons, trays, and birds flow across the pages, interspersed with photographs that lend context to the artwork. This book will be a treasure to anyone who appreciates elegant design, beautiful wood, and a well-told tale.\n\u2014Woodcarving Illustrated Magazine  \nEmil Milan: Midcentury Master, a beautiful book, is the Emil Milan Research Project\u2019s most recent endeavor. Milan was known primarily for his small, exquisitely made carved wood bowls and stylized birds. The book makes clear that his influence on the work of others continues to this day, though not all of those who are influenced are aware of the source of their inspiration. ... Craig Edelbrock (the author) was enlisted to continue the research on Milan, resulting in his impressive and thorough essay, which provides a sometimes intimate biography set in the greater context of the post-WWII craft movement in the U.S. We get a sense of Milan as a person, who, unlike the subjects of many biographies, comes across as truly likable.... While retrospective exhibitions are great tributes, they are only seen by a fortunate few. This book is a more permanent recognition of an important maker, an homage that is long overdue.\n\u2014Excerpt from an article by Mark Sfirri published in the December, 2017 issue of American Woodturner, the journal of the American Association of Woodturners. www.woodturner.org\nAbout Emil Milan\nThe book chronicles the life and work of Emil Milan (American, 1922\u201385), an important American artist, designer, and woodworker who was a major contributor of the studio craft movement in the United States after WWII. Milan\u2019s work, known as \u201cfunctional sculpture,\u201d captures and exemplifies midcentury modern design aesthetic\u2014exploring balance of form and function. Milan's career was impressive, influencing many students and artists during his lifetime. He also played a part in the emergence and growth of craft organizations including the American Craft Council and Peters Valley School of Craft.\nEmil Milan standing in the barn door of his Thompson, PA studio, 1983.

In February of 2008, artist Norm Sartorius initiated The Project. He wanted to learn more about the roots of his own work by investigating the life and work of his earliest influence, Emil Milan, whom he never met. At first the goal was documentation alone, the collection of biographical information where little was available. It quickly became clear that Milan\u2019s role as an artist had been significant and The Project\u2019s mission evolved to include exhibitions, new museum acquisitions, and eventually now this definitive publication on the life and work of this important American artist. \nIn 2008 The Center for Craft, Creativity & Design provided initial financial support to the Emil Milan Research Project in the form of a grant awarded to Barry Gordon, Phil Jurus, and Norm Sartorius to research Emil Milan\u2019s life, work, and influence. According to the team, \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that the grant provided by CCCD was critical in advancing scholarship on Emil Milan, and in building awareness, understanding, and appreciation of his role and importance in the midcentury modern design and the studio craft movement in America.\u201d\nIn 2014, The Center for Art in Wood in Old City, Pennsylvania, held an exhibition of Milan's work and his vast circle of influence. Curated by Jennifer Zwilling, it was the largest exhibition of its kind detailing Milan's work, as well as his inventive tools, techniques, and practices.\nThe forthcoming book, Emil Milan: Midcentury Master will include all of the work shown in the exhibition.\nAs part of the exhibition, The Center For Art in Wood produced the following video that provides further color and context into Milan's work and his circle of influence. \nPLAY\n\nProject Credits\nRESEARCH TEAM\nBARRY GORDON | Artist and devotee of Emil Milan\nWhen Barry Gordon began carving spoons and other utensils in 1977, he found the calling he would love for a lifetime: working with wood to make spoons and objects of elegant simplicity. For much of his career, Gordon made functional utensils and enjoyed producing pieces that were both useful and beautiful.\nGordon has been active in the Emil Milan Research Project from the beginning. He did a lot of the writing in the early years, drafting text, and then revising it in accordance with Norm and Phil's always-cogent suggestions. Gordon describes much of the work as part of a detective saga. The team would uncover new information, sometimes totally unanticipated \u2014 always inspired by the importance of their task. Thirty-three years after Gordon\u2019s single brief visit with Emil Milan, he realized that he was, for a few hours, in the presence of greatness. Observing Milan\u2019s woodworking path strengthened Gordon\u2019s belief in the importance of well-executed small functional objects and in the value of sharing methods for their creation. He has also been reassured that it is OK to have equal affection for both his powerful shaping sander and his favorite carving knife. \nPHIL JURUS | Artist and mentee of Emil Milan\nPhil Jurus has been creating beautiful objects since 1963. He was a goldsmith and silversmith for more than thirty years and co-owned a craft gallery in metropolitan Baltimore, Maryland. In 2009, after closing the gallery, he moved to Hershey, Pennsylvania and set up a wood studio. He makes jewelry as well as sculpted and functional wood pieces using techniques he learned from his woodcarving mentor Emil Milan (1922\u20131985). Using many kinds of hardwoods, foreign and domestic, his pieces are functional, beautiful and pleasing to the touch. His work is in numerous private collections. \n\"The influence Emil Milan had in my life is difficult to put into one quotation. From the mentoring in woodworking skills, to the friendship that my wife and I had which included conversations, sharing meals, providing an entre\u2019 to the shops where he sold his work for us to sell the jewelry we made, and being one of the artists whose creations we carried in our own gallery, these were all examples of the generosity of his spirit. My knowledge of him, gleaned from the research my colleagues and I have done, has enlarged the scope of why he had such a unique appeal as a person and an artist. I realize how fortunate I have been to share our multifaceted relationship. He was a historic figure among Midcentury Woodworkers and deserves that recognition.\"  \nNORM SARTORIUS | Artist and student of Phil Jurus\nA creator of wooden spoons for 30 years, Norm Sartorius has explored the common wooden spoon as a context for sculpture. Using rare and unusual woods of exceptional beauty, he shapes each spoon to stand as a unique artistic statement of color, form, and texture. Testing the boundary between art and craft. His work is inspired by the material, nature, and rich ethnic spoon making traditions worldwide. Emil Milan instructed Norm's first woodworking teacher, Phil Jurus. Norm still shapes each unique sculptural object using some of those techniques taught to Jurus by Milan.\nIn February of 2008 Norm initiated the Emil Milan Research Project. He wanted to learn more about the roots of his own work by investigating the life and work of his earliest influence, Emil Milan, whom he never met. At first the goal was documentation alone, the collection of biographical information where little was available. It quickly became clear that Milan\u2019s role had been significant and the Project mission evolved to include exhibitions, new museum acquisitions, and eventually a book. Norm facilitated the addition of Milan\u2019s work to the permanent collections of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Yale Art Gallery, and the Center for Art in Wood. Additional museum acquisitions are currently in progress. Together with friends and fellow researchers: Barry Gordon, Phil Jurus and Craig Edelbrock, the Project seeks to reintroduce Milan and his work to the public and to the academic record of mid 20th century contemporary craft.\nCRAIG EDELBROCK | Author, Professor and Dean at The University of Alabama, artist & mentee of Norm Sartorius\nAuthor, Craig Edelbrock, was born in Portland, Oregon and holds a bachelor's degree from Western Washington State College and a doctorate from Oregon State University. The author of more than 100 research articles and academic publications, he is a Professor and Dean at the University of Alabama. Craig is also a woodturner and spoon carver under the mentorship of Norm Sartorius. Because of this lineage, he considers Emil Milan his \u201cgreat grandfather in craft.\u201d He is passionately interested in the evolution and current status of both folk art and fine craft in America. He has served on the Boards of the Wharton Esherick Museum, The Center for Art in Wood, and the Collectors of Wood Art. Craig initiated, designed, and hosted the solo exhibit of Emil Milan\u2019s work at the Henry Gallery in Malvern, PA in 2014. Working collaboratively with the team, he created the Wikipedia article on Emil Milan and wrote the text for Emil Milan: Midcentury Master.\nPUBLISHER\nFor at least four decades, Albert LeCoff, Co-Founder and Executive Director of The Center for Art in Wood, has been involved in wood art as a turner and organizing creator of opportunities for artists who express themselves in turnings and sculptures. Albert and his associates at the Center have generated scores of exhibitions and their documentations that explore the evolving field of art in wood, and occasionally other materials. For the Emil Milan Research Project, Albert encouraged and helped shape the production of the comprehensive exposition and appreciation of Emil Milan\u2019s life, work, and inspiration.\nDESIGNERS\nErika Brask and Dan Saal of Thoughtfull Corporation are multi-disciplinary designers with a passion for storytelling. For more than 20 years, they have each collaborated with clients and artists all over the world, bringing their unique stories to life. With each project, the pair thoughtfully pushes the boundaries of viewer experience and relevancy. Their passion for helping clients tell stories has expanded to include both design and self-publishing management. Their expertise helps elevate the work of artists who may not have the resources of a major publisher, institution, or endowment. They are now also collectors of Emil Milan\u2019s work.\nPRODUCTION\niocolor in Seattle, Washington will do the color management and oversee the printing of the book. iocolor produces museum quality books of the highest caliber for its sister company Lucia|Marquand and many other museums, university presses, and publishers all over the country.\nMighty Tieton in central Washington is hand making the wood slip case. Their goal is to establish successful, distinctive businesses by connecting creative entrepreneurs with local resources. Tieton is uniquely positioned to be a hub for artisan businesses.\nPress Materials\nPress who are interested in covering Milan's story and that of the publication can download high-res images, sample spreads, bios, and a prospectus on Google Drive at:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzE5SQpQRedQWEdhRlZUTThmb28?usp=sharing\nSchedule\nDecember 2017 \u2014 Milan's \"Wood Carving\" teacher handout pdf will be emailed.\nJanuary 2018 \u2014 Book printing and wood slip case manufacturing will begin.\nApril 2018 \u2014 Standard and limited edition books will ship to backers along with the sets of postcards.\nImage Credits\nImages of the book, slipcase and offerings: Thoughtfull Corporation\nEmil Milan, \"Small Bird.\" Walnut. 4 1/2 x 6 x 2 in.

It will also serve as an extension of the objects and stories of hip-hop already displayed in the galleries of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, offering perspective on the African American experience and its impact on American culture.

The Smithsonian Institution is unable to provide your rewards or recognize any gift you made unless the informational survey is completed.\nOnce rewards are shipped, please allow an additional 4-6 weeks for your reward(s) to ship internationally. \n Important Information About the Tour Rewards\nSome of the rewards are tours offered at a specific time and place. The Smithsonian is not responsible for any backer\u2019s travel or other costs to participate in such experiences. Further, if a cause beyond the Smithsonian's control requires rescheduling or cancellation of an experience, the Smithsonian is not responsible for any additional travel or other costs a backer may incur in order to participate at the new time. The Smithsonian cannot guarantee that experiences occurring on dates yet to be announced, or that must be rescheduled, will occur on a date that is convenient for all backers.\nImportant Information About the Free Digital Download from Smithsonian Folkways Recordings\nThe Smithsonian will provide participating backers whose support of the Project exceeds the fair market value of the goods and services provided with an acknowledgment letter that reflects the estimated value of this download, $9.99, in the value of the goods and services they are receiving.\nArtist and licensing fees for 120+ tracks (and the samples they use);\nResearch, essays, notes, design, and image rights for the book;\nProduction costs and fulfillment of the full Anthology package;\nKickstarter fees and costs to produce rewards.\nThe Smithsonian has always relied on private support in addition to federal funds. In fact, the Smithsonian was founded 171 years ago by a private donation to the United States government! Federal appropriations provide the foundation of the Smithsonian's operating budget and support core functions \u2013 safeguarding our collections, building operations and maintenance as well as staffing. However, we rely on private donations of all sizes to support many of our priorities, including research, educational outreach and special projects.\nIn other words, your support will make the Anthology possible. By backing the project, you will help the Smithsonian tell the powerful story of hip-hop and its place in American culture. You will truly be the reason it is brought to life \u2013 and we'll keep you involved as we create, design, produce and ship it to homes, including yours!\nYour Pledge Helps Support the Smithsonian\nThe Smithsonian Institution is a nonprofit organization exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.  Depending on your level of support for the project, a portion of your payment may be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Where goods and services are provided by the Smithsonian Institution in exchange for your payment, the amount that is deductible is limited to the excess of your total payment over the fair market value of the goods and services provided. Please refer to the list of reward tiers to the right of the page for these values. The tax information on this page is provided for U.S. tax purposes only. Please consult your tax advisor regarding the deductibility of your payment.\nAbout Smithsonian Folkways Recordings\nSmithsonian Folkways Recordings has, in its near 70-year history, released two landmark anthologies capturing the history and defining an era of revolutionary music: The Anthology of American Folk Music (1952) and Jazz: The Smithsonian Anthology (2011). The Smithsonian Anthology of Hip-Hop and Rap will be the third such undertaking.\nSmithsonian Folkways Recordings is the nonprofit record label of the Smithsonian Institution. We are dedicated to supporting cultural diversity and increased understanding among peoples through the documentation, preservation, and dissemination of sound. Our collection consists of more than 3,000 albums and 43,000 tracks along with videos, playlists, podcasts, lesson plans for teachers, and Smithsonian Folkways Magazine.\nWe believe that musical and cultural diversity contributes to the vitality and quality of life throughout the world. Through the dissemination of audio recordings and educational materials we seek to strengthen people's engagement with their own cultural heritage and to enhance their awareness and appreciation of the cultural heritage of others. \nAbout the National Museum of African American History and Culture\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture is the only national museum devoted exclusively to the documentation of African American life, history, and culture.\nIt was established by Act of Congress in 2003, following decades of efforts to promote and highlight the contributions of African Americans. To date, the Museum has collected nearly 40,000 objects and more than 180,000 individuals have become charter members. The Museum opened to the public on September 24, 2016, as the 19th and newest museum of the Smithsonian Institution.\nBox set images by Michael G. Stewart and Jati Lindsay", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf the funding goal is not met, we'll remain dedicated to producing the Anthology, but it will be delayed until the required funding is secured.

Kojo causes a car accident that tragically kills Kwabena's bride on their wedding day. Kwabena in turn, devices an elaborate plan to seek revenge 7 years later. He lures Kojo to an abandon mine, knocks him unconscious and leaves him in the mine shaft to die. Kojo must survive with no food and water, while his wife and local detective race against time to find him. \nGALAMSEY: /ga-lam-s(\u0259)y/\nA local Ghanaian term for illegal small-scale gold mining.\nA NOTE FROM THE DIRECTOR\nIt all began with a newspaper article I read while visiting family in Ghana two years ago. The text was bold and direct\u2026.\"Galamsey Miners Buried Alive.\u201d That headline stopped me dead in my tracks. For those unfamiliar with Galamsey, it's a local term for illegal gold mining, an extremely dangerous practice with little financial reward and irreversible environmental consequences.\nI became obsessed with understanding why young men and women risked their lives 30 ft underground, only to be paid a fraction of what the gold was worth. I visited the mining towns of Tarkwa and Prestea to do some research. The more I dug, the more apparent it became who really controlled the illegal gold mining industry in Ghana. Chinese companies assisted by local Chiefs really run the show, operating in the shadows while young local miners suffered all the risks and backlash.\n I knew immediately this was a story worth telling. However, I didn't want to focus on the obvious theme of victimization. I wanted to craft a narrative that was personal and intimate, giving the audience a glimpse into a Ghanaian family dealing with love, loss, tragedy, betrayal and sibling rivalry.\nSo, instead of centering the issues, I centered the people, which is seldom done when Hollywood makes films in Africa. Our objective was to capture the beauty, even when the circumstances weren't beautiful.  \nTogether with my Cinematographer Michael Fernandez, we began to craft a visual style that matched the narrative. Storyboards were a major part of the process. I drew all 600 frames (200 pages) of the film which helped us visualize every scene before we shot.  \nWe also produced our own Mexican Telenovela 'Puebla Mi Amor' which our characters in 'The Burial Of Kojo' watched. Anyone who knows Ghanaians knows we love Telenovelas. So, instead of licensing an already made Telenovela, we decided to shoot our own. This allowed us to create a parallel narrative between what was happening to our characters and what was happening on their TV.\n After four intense weeks, we have successfully completed principal photography. We are excited to bring our film to the world and need your help finishing post-production.\nUSE OF FUNDS:\nEditing\nColor grading and correction\nVisual effects\nMusic Composition \nSecuring music rights\nSound effects and Sound mix\nMarketing and Film Festival expenses\n       We have some great Rewards for those who are able to give. Check out the list below and see you at the PREMIERE!!!!  Thanks.\n  All Still Photos by Ofoe Amegavie", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFunding for the film was the most difficult part of the process. I realized no investor was interested in financing an African film that didn't revolve around the narrow clich\u00e9s of War and Disease. Self funding was my only option. I had to leverage my music career, playing concerts around the world to raise the minimum required budget for the film. After two years of hard work, we have finally wrapped production on an essential human story of courage and survival in Ghana. All we need is your help to finish post production and bring this amazing film to the world.

Looking forward to sharing this with you....send us some good vibes, we are on the final lap."}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "705 backers pledged $78,291"}]}], "comment_no": 11, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1220160690/the-burial-of-kojo", "project_name": "The Burial Of Kojo"}}, {"backer": "Sylvia Flores", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "To learn more and order Randy Orangutan, Hazel Sloth, Miguel Frog, Brady Lion, Iris Unicorn, Sophie Elephant, and any future Animoodles we create, visit our website at theanimoodles.com.\nFor press inquiries, please contact team@theanimoodles.com.\nFollow along as we reveal more of the world of Animoodles: YouTube | Facebook | Instagram\nAnimoodles are cuddly and customizable plush that have hidden magnets inside!

She's the newest member of the Wild Jungle family and a one time production run only. For our Kickstarter campaign, Sophie Elephant is available two ways: 1/ Get Sophie Elephant free if you get three friends to back Animoodles on Kickstarter, and 2/ Purchase her as an add-on to your order after our campaign closes (100% of profits will be donated to the African Wildlife Foundation.) \nAnimoodles #1 - Randy Orangutan is inventive and generous\nAnimoodles #2 - Hazel Sloth is a wise and chill yogi\nAnimoodles #3 - Miguel Frog is happy-hoppy!\nAnimoodles #4 - Brady Lion is a brave vegetarian\nAnimoodles #5 - Iris Unicorn is adventurous and imaginative\nAnimoodles #6 - Sophie Elephant is a peaceful gentle giant\nLong ago, a supervolcano named Mount Moody got angry and erupted. This transformed all the animals into Animoodles, creatures with swappable parts!\nIris Unicorn is from the Isle of Mythos, where magic fills every corner. But one day, Iris Unicorn flew too closely to Mount Moody when it was erupting. She tumbled down into the faraway Wild Jungle, where Randy Orangutan, Hazel Sloth, Miguel Frog, and Brady Lion live.\nAfter the tumble, power disappeared from Iris Unicorn's way-finding horn, so now she is lost. And all her parts spread across the Wild Jungle! Luckily, the Wild Jungle Animoodles helped put her back together.\nThen one day, the Animoodles discovered a rustling in the bushes that turned out to be Sophie Elephant! Sophie learns that Iris Unicorn wants to return back to her home on the Isle of Mythos, and she has an idea of which way to go! Join the Animoodles epic quest to find Iris Unicorn's beloved and mystical home on the Isle of Mythos!\nHow will the Animoodles use their own unique strengths to work together and find their way? Which lands will they travel through next, and what new undiscovered Animoodles might they meet?\nBy backing Animoodles now, you'll join the journey at the very beginning of the unfolding story.\nOver the past 18 months, we've play tested prototypes with over 50 kids and parents in 5 cities across the country, and incorporated their feedback to make Animoodles as much fun as possible for children of all ages. Here's some of what we've heard:\n\"This is THE BEST stuffed animal ever\" - Colin, age 11\n\"It's a toy AND a friend\"- Sara, age 5\n\"Can I trade you all my toys for one of those?\" - Alayna, age 6\nHow do kids like to play with Animoodles?\n\"I gave them to my nephew for his birthday & he won't go anywhere without them...These are a genius idea & amazing design.\" - Amy, Amy & Aron's Real Life Reviews\n\"My girls both LOVE to place them on their lamps by their bedside since they really like that they are magnetic... They play with them most right before bed & especially while I read them a book -almost like a fidget toy.\" - Katrina, Outnumbered 3 to 1\nParents are loving Animoodles, too:\n\"The most creative plush toys we've ever seen or experienced.... My kids want to play with their Animoodles rather than watch TV...\" - Ondria, Mommy's Block Party\n\"With Animoodles your toys never get boring.\" - Bethany, Parenting in Progress\n\"If you don\u2019t think Animoodles are cool, then hand over your parenting license right now.\" - Grant, ProductHype\n\"I love that Animoodles combine all of my children's favorite things in one awesome toy. Part cute and snuggly plush, part creative building toy, & so many opportunities for imaginative play that can keep them laughing & playing for hours.\" - Leanne, Rave & Review\nAnimoodles all share the same hidden magic inside--neodymium rare earth magnets! These magnets are both stronger and harder to be demagnetized than other magnet types, such as common refrigerator magnets.\nEvery Animoodles joint has a magnetic pull force of over 5 lbs., which is not too strong for a 3 year old to pull apart, yet strong enough to hold Animoodles together without easily falling apart! The strength of the magnets inside Animoodles is what causes the satisfying snap you hear every time you put two Animoodles parts together. It's how you know the magnets work!\nThis means Iris Unicorn can stand up right (like a human) or walk on all fours (like a horse).\nHidden safely inside double-sewn patent-pending enclosures are 6 magnetic connection joints within each Animoodle at the legs, arms, head, and upper back. Each Animoodle has a total of 11 magnets inside.\nAll parts can be rotated 360 degrees, so you can pose Animoodles any way you want. You can make Randy Orangutan wave or Miguel Frog twist his head curiously to the side.\nAll Animoodles parts are fully interchangeable, so you can make your own creations. The more Animoodles you have, the more creative possibilities you can make. You can mix up all the parts of Hazel Sloth OR mix and match her parts with Iris Unicorn to make a Slothicorn!\nThere's also an extra magnet on every Animoodle's back, so you can switch them from sitting to standing position! No other stuffed animals can do this! Miguel Frog demonstrates:\nPLAY\n\nBut, are Animoodles soft? Oh, you betcha. No cold, hard building toy parts here. Animoodles' magnetic joints are well hidden, so you're still left with a warm, cuddly soft friend. All the way from the outside in, they're made of the softest, fur, fluff, and filling materials to make them perfect for hugs and cuddles. Finally, a lovable building toy!\nOur mission is to make quality plush toys children love, and to inspire the next generation of compassionate little makers around the world.\nPLAY\n\nWe believe there's power in both building and bonding, creating and caring, making and relating. Stuffed animals have always played an important role in child development of social, emotional, and relational skills. But, until now, building sets have traditionally been better at developing spatial and problem-solving skills in kids. Animoodles combine the best of both worlds because we believe in the power of creation and compassion.\nWe hope to enable kids to see themselves as little makers, and to understand the value of our differences -- how our unique parts can come together to make something amazing.\nDan Holland and Marissa Louie, Co-Creators\nWe're both lifelong makers pursing our personal passions with Animoodles. Dan Holland has designed some of the most beloved children's characters as a character artist at a top animation studio, and Marissa Louie has designed some of the most innovative technology experiences as an interaction designer at Apple and Yahoo. We're bringing together our experiences to create the world of Animoodles.\nThis is just the start of the stories we hope to tell and the characters we hope to create. In future collections, we will reveal new Animoodles that are compatible with these first 5 limited edition Animoodles. It all starts here and now.\nTo place our first big factory order, we need your help. Thanks for your support in making our dreams come true!\nThere are literally hundreds of combinations you can make with the complete set of Animoodles. Here are just some ideas of what you can make, and the fun you can have.\nThe journey doesn't end here! Visit theanimoodles.com to order Animoodles.

We've visited our factory 4 times since September 2016, iterating with them on dozens of prototypes and nailing down our manufacturing process. And, we've also identified experienced fulfillment partners to make sure Animoodles travel to your homes quickly and seamlessly. \n\nWe'll do everything in our power to deliver Animoodles on schedule (if not early), and promise to communicate with you openly and honestly should anything unexpected happen. \n\nAdditional Terms & Conditions\nWe will do our best to mail Animoodles to their future homes starting May 2018, assuming our campaign is fully funded.

Update: We reached our goal in just 9 days! So, it\u2019s time to move the goalposts: Let\u2019s raise $350,000 and we'll build a screening room !!!\nMovie Madness is a Portland institution. Known for its vast collection, knowledgeable staff, and display cases full of legendary film props, the iconic Belmont storefront has a deserved reputation as one of the best video stores in the country.\nBut now Movie Madness is in danger of closing forever. The Hollywood Theatre has the chance to purchase Movie Madness and fold it into our nonprofit, ensuring that this invaluable collection remains available to Oregonians for years to come. We must raise $250,000 by November 10 or Movie Madness will close and the collection will be sold.\nWith your help, we can save this important piece of Portland\u2019s culture and ensure its collection of 80,000+ titles remains accessible to movie lovers everywhere.\nMovie Madness was founded in 1991 by Mike Clark. Mike is now ready to retire - and he\u2019s offered the Hollywood Theatre the chance to acquire his beloved business for $250,000. (The collection alone was recently appraised at $585,000.)\nIf we succeed in raising our goal, the Hollywood Theatre will buy Movie Madness - the business and the 80,000+ title collection - and transition it into our nonprofit. We will continue to rent the Belmont storefront for the foreseeable future, and Mike will continue to display his remarkable collection of film props in the store\u2019s film museum. We will also retain the store\u2019s current employees.\nThe Hollywood is the right organization to buy Movie Madness and ensure its long-term survival. We\u2019ve lovingly restored our 1926 movie palace, and opened our new microcinema at Portland International Airport. We brought 70mm film presentation back to Portland. And we\u2019re a thriving nonprofit with 3,200+ members who believe in our mission of preserving and promoting the art of film.\nBy acquiring Movie Madness, we\u2019re not trying to save a dying business model - we\u2019re going to help it evolve by rethinking the role it plays in the community.\nWe\u2019ll expand our popular membership program to include benefits at Movie Madness. \nWe\u2019ll explore community engagement opportunities through construction of a new screening room and the development of new partnerships. \nWe\u2019ll partner with Free Geek to provide affordable access to VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray players. \nWe\u2019ll continue to preserve and grow the collection, adding new releases and found treasures to ensure that Movie Madness remains a \u201cliving collection\u201d that reflects the diverse interests and perspectives of the community it serves.\nWe\u2019ve already secured a $90,000 grant from the James F. and Marion L. Miller Foundation to provide two years of operating support for the project, contingent on this campaign succeeding. We are prepared to invest time, energy, and money into this project to ensure the long-term viability of Movie Madness.\nThe single most important reason for acquiring Movie Madness is to keep its extensive collection accessible to the public. A collection of this size is an irreplaceable cultural resource.\nThere are 80,000+ titles in the Movie Madness collection. In 2016, according to Variety, Amazon had 18,405 movies and 1,981 TV shows; Netflix had 4,563 movies and 2,445 TV shows; and Hulu had 6,656 films and 3,588 television shows. (Read more about Netflix\u2019s \u201cabominable selection of classic cinema\u201d in this recent Newsweek article.) Movie Madness has twice as many titles available as all three platforms combined.\nStreaming services offer only the illusion of choice. In reality, their constantly shifting lineup is dictated by studio licenses and distributor contracts, with titles subject to vanishing without notice.\nAdditionally, plenty of movies never make it to these services in the first place. Whenever there is an industry transition to a new format, movies are left behind - obscure and cult titles rarely make the cut.\nThese movies are not just entertainment - they represent diverse perspectives in a time when diverse voices are sorely needed in public discourse, and provide snapshots into our cultural history that can enlighten our present. By acquiring the Movie Madness collection, we\u2019ll keep these titles available to the public, and we\u2019ll make sure that the rare and one-of-a-kind titles in the collection are preserved.\nPledge today, and help us keep this irreplaceable community resource alive.\nWe're excited to offer some unique rewards in return for your support!\nFor $25, you can get your hands on a wool felt pennant in either the Movie Madness or Hollywood Theatre design. For $35, we've got some beautiful enamel pins, designed exclusively for this Kickstarter project. For $40, you can wear your support with pride with our Movie Madness \u201cVHS\u201d tee, and for $50, our glow-in-the-dark \"Frankie\" tee.\nNew! For $75, we\u2019re offering a limited-edition 18\u201dx24\u201d screenprinted poster, featuring prominent films from the Movie Madness collection and plenty of easter eggs for Movie Madness fans. Illustrated by Jolby & Friends and printed by Seizure Palace.\nFor $80, you\u2019ll get two tickets to A Night With Todd Haynes, an exclusive double feature of BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS and a newly restored, doll-themed rarity (the title of which we\u2019re not at liberty to mention). Both films will be presented in 35mm and the evening will be hosted by director Todd Haynes! We\u2019ll even throw in popcorn and two beverages per person.\nWe're also excited to offer new ways for our community to get involved with Movie Madness. For $100, you can select a film from their 80,000+ collection to be sponsored indefinitely under a name of your choosing (availability permitting). For $150, choose five movies to be featured in Movie Madness\u2019 Community Picks section - with recommendations provided by you. Your picks will be featured for one month.\nNew! For $400, we'll screen your favorite film from the Movie Madness collection in our *new* screening room! Once we finish construction, you\u2019ll be among the first to enjoy Southeast Portland\u2019s newest community space. Invite 15-20 of your closest friends for a private pizza party with complimentary pizza provided by Sizzle Pie.\nFor 25 lucky backers who pledge $500, we're handing over our marquee for you to display a personalized message. Why not use our marquee to surprise a friend and grab a photo! We'll choose a date together, and display your message from 11pm through 2pm the following day.\nFor $1,000 we're offering two tickets to a backers-only movie-themed dinner with award-winning local chef Naomi Pomeroy at her restaurant, Beast.\nFor $2,500, we'll walk you and 16 friends through airport security and screen a movie of your choosing at our PDX microcinema (schedule permitting). For $5,000, we'll screen your favorite movie for you and your friends at the Hollywood Theatre (schedule permitting).\nAnd if that's not enough, for $10,000, we'll screen 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, or WEST SIDE STORY in 70mm for you and 383 of your friends at the Hollywood Theatre (schedule permitting).\nWe'd like to thank Mike Clark for bringing this unique opportunity to us, for his all his generosity and hard work, and for his trust in the team at the Hollywood Theatre. We'd also like to thank the staff at Movie Madness (our future co-workers, we hope!) for their collaboration and enthusiasm for this project.\nThanks also to Todd Haynes for agreeing to host our very special double feature, Naomi Pomeroy and the staff at Beast for offering to host our backer dinner, Blue Chalk for our incredible project video (featuring Joaquin Lopez and Anahelena Goodman-Flood\u2014thank you!), Scarecrow Video for their advice and insights, Nate Ashley for his tireless work designing our campaign reward materials, and Andy McMillan for assisting with this Kickstarter project and managing our reward fulfillment.\nThank you also to Alison Hallett and Kristy Conrad for their extra effort on this Kickstarter campaign, and the rest of our office and theatre staff for their hard work day in and day out, our board for their steadfast guidance, and all 3,200+ Hollywood Theatre members for their support.\n\u201cMovie Madness is a place where a love of movies is completely and totally evident. An entire consummate encyclopedic collection of rare and obscure titles goes away if Movie Madness goes away. It would be not just the loss of an extraordinary collection, but a loss of a place that is a real, breathing tribute to the love of movies. It keeps you excited about the world to discover places like this.\u201d\n\u2014 Todd Haynes, Film Director & Hollywood Theatre Board Member \n\u201cThe Movie Madness library that the Hollywood Theatre would like to absorb is one of the most amazing collections of cinema archaeology that I have ever seen and it is very important that it be saved. This is a very worthy endeavor - give money to this project!\u201d\n\u2014 Gus Van Sant, Film Director\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine better bastions of film and TV history combining forces to create a whole new entertainment future for Portland than the Hollywood Theatre and Movie Madness. It\u2019s going to be tough to decide which one to spend more time in!\u201d \n\u2014 Tim Williams, Executive Director, Oregon Film\n\u201cUnparalleled in its breadth, depth, and genuine quirkiness, Movie Madness is the keeper of an important legacy. So much of the classic cinema behind its doors just isn\u2019t available anywhere else. Like a library, Movie Madness looks to enhance the future by preserving the past. I offer my full support to Hollywood Theatre and its effort to serve Portlanders, now and into the future, by preserving Movie Madness as a treasure for everyone to enjoy.\u201d \n\u2014 Vailey Oehlke, Director of Libraries, Multnomah County Library\n\u201cTruly great independent video stores with a collection of this size are an incredible asset for cinephile research and study. We can\u2019t tell you how many films have slipped into a copyright and/or distribution morass - there are many instances where a collection of early commercial releases like this is your only chance to see something exceptionally rare and unique. To lose such an incredible community resource would be heartbreaking.\u201d \n\u2014 Todd Wiener, Motion Picture Archivist, UCLA Film & Television Archive", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a community-supported nonprofit, we have a wealth of experience delivering on large-scale fundraising and crowdfunding efforts, having previously raised significant funds to bring 70mm film presentation back to Portland and managed multiple projects to restore our 1926 movie palace, including a prior Kickstarter to revive our marquee.\n\nWe've worked closely with Mike Clark to develop a transition plan for Movie Madness.

You may think a series of personal training sessions, strict diets, and miles of walking and running will do the trick. \nHowever, it is actually easier than that. Muscles are very dynamic. Re-training the muscles can changes your bone structure. Here is a catch though. Building muscles memory takes about 3 months. Plus, you need to introduce new good habits to your muscles. It's like learning how to play golf for the first time. \nUsing the Zero-Gravity Upright Posture Cushion helps build muscle memory.

Compressed Spines & Discs that may develop into Sciatica (pain radiating down the legs), Numbness or pins-and-needles in an arm or leg, etc.\n\n\nSitting on Zero-Gravity Upright Posture Cushion feels like skilled therapists' hands, correcting your sitting posture. Check it out.\n  See the Difference!\n  Sitting is not natural to the body. We can help you with ZGUP Cushion.\n  Great Posture at the chairs not only helps your back and neck, but your sit bones & intervertebral discs (Discs between each spine). By evenly distributing weight and pressure of the body, your sitting is much more effortless; Your Spines & Hips will appreciate you at night.\n Zero Gravity Upright Posture Cushion ships with the mesh cover: anti-sweat cover (double layer mesh) that is breathable with great ventilation.\nMemory foam is Visco foam that features:\nBetter contouring and pressure relief \nBetter durability and a longer comfort life \nBetter motion dampening \nMore resistant to microorganisms and allergens\nHighly resistant to bacteria, mold, mildew, mites, and other odor causing germs\nPlus, the Visco Foam has semi-permanent durability.

As a result, you\u2019ll reduce neck, shoulder, and back pain to power through your day. \n  The Human Body is rather simple to understand. When you sit, in most cases your pelvic girdle turns either forward or backward. We call it anterior pelvic tilt or posterior pelvic tilt. Whatever it does, by introducing the perfectly measured wedge, your spine and hips are supported from every possible angle. \nIt is 3:1. That\u2019s the magic ratio. You can try it out by putting a towel on your tailbone. Try it and wait 3 seconds. 1-2-3. Take a deep breath. You will feel the whole spines starting to let go of the tension. We wish you can feel it.\nWe use high quality memory foam to create the perfect angle and forgiveness regardless weight. We had 20 different formula for density, softness prototypes. Only 1 out of 20 is good enough for this particular cushion with the rare combination of functionality & comfort. You can apply this knowledge in your feet (insoles), knees, hips, and elsewhere on your body.\n      This is the first step in our mission to bring comfort to everyone in the world. We would like to address a problem millions of people are experiencing every day: bad, uncomfortable chairs or seat cushions that affects their health, productivity, and happiness. Well... let's change that.\nWith the Zero Gravity Upright Posture Cushion, we are calling on our community of innovators & supporters on Kickstarter to help us launch this new, unique product.

In order to protect themselves from the environment, the animals develop superfine wool coats. The natural environment here and the traditional, nomadic, free-range way of raising the animals is what makes Mongolian cashmere the most sought after in the world.\nChillin' with his yak wool coat!\nI'm pretty jealous of the goats and their coats. I've been living in Mongolia for 5 years. Originally as a Peace Corps volunteer and then coming back to do business development work, I've felt plenty of those -40 temps. I've got some history with the textiles industry here through a previous clothing label, and am using that experience to bring ULA+LIA international! I need Kickstarter's help to meet the shipping requirements to get some inventory for an online shop, so we are taking pre-orders at direct, wholesale prices!\nMost of the 5 years I've lived in Mongolia have been spent in Mongolia's capital, Ulaanbaatar (UB). Sometimes, UB can get some hate for the issues a lot of developing cities have, which are mainly the traffic and the pollution that comes through in the winter. Problems aside, UB is cool, thriving, and has a pulse once you get to know it. It's always changing, and it's also the heart of manufacturing in Mongolia. Without Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia wouldn't work. \nI took this idea to the beginning of ULA+LIA. Natural, un-died fibers from the countryside turned into beautiful finish products in the capital, with a high-quality, durable finish. After using the fibers to stay warm through the harsh winters, animals shed their finest fibers in the spring. That's when herders sheer their sheep, or brush the yaks and goats to harvest their rare fibers. \nA herd of sheep and goats enjoying the summer\nMost of these throws can also be worn as a sweet blanket scarf if you're brave enough! The beautiful fibers carry the Mongolian, nomadic soul, and the infusion of some urban refinement makes them perfect in any home. I personally guarantee you'll love it!\n  Traditionally overshadowed by its softer wool companion, cashmere, Mongolian sheep's wool has been gaining popularity lately as domestic processing and production in Mongolia have developed enough to support the unique Mongolian wool. Originally, I didn't plan to use sheep wool with this label, but was shocked at the softness and quality of the wool blankets during development. Warm, soft, and durable, sheep's wool provides the Mongolian spirit at a lower price.\n  Sheep Wool Throw - (150cm x 200cm / 59in x 78in)\n    Sounds strange, but feels incredible. Exotic and less known than sheep's wool and cashmere, yak wool should actually be called yak cashmere. Being finer and softer than some cashmere from other countries, yak wool feels almost like a merino/cashmere blend.\nDue to their unique habitat of high elevations and bitterly cold temperatures, yak wool is both very fine and soft, but also comprised of abnormally long and durable fibers. Even with my years of experience around cashmere and wools, I sometimes need to double check labels to confirm if it's yak wool and not cashmere.\nDark Chocolate Brown Yak Throw (150cm x 200cm / 59\" x 78\")\n  Due to their relatively low numbers and limited supply, I'm promising 7 yak throws for immediate delivery, and the rest before the end of January. They will all probably get out with the first batch, but it might take me a little longer to get them all together. I'll make it happen, I just didn't want to over promise.\nThe ultimate in luxury. It's hard to put into words how incredible it is to cuddle up with a pure cashmere blanket! Mongolian cashmere is uniquely known for its softness and durability in international markets. Especially with the durable and sturdy woven construction, our blankets and throws are lightly brushed to soften the fabric, while the weave keeps it tightly held together. Cashmere items aren't generally seen as something you can pass down to your children, but if you give them a bit of care, they will be around indefinitely!\nCashmere Throw (180cm x 145cm / 71\" x 57\")\n  Free Range Cashmere Goat in the Buff\n  This is my favorite hat ever. It's thin enough to wear in the spring or fall, but warm enough to rock in the winter as well. Fold it over and double it up over your ears, or let it out flat for a relaxed look. Timeless! Doesn't matter if you're 16 or 60, this hat will be perfect. Same one I'm wearing in the videos! Will do some stretch goals for different colors, so let me know what you guys are interested in. I always recommend the pure, undyed colors because they are the softest, but sometimes you just can't beat a black beanie!\nHeaven is wearing cashmere socks. These are cable knitted for strength and for incredible softness. I recommend wearing these around the home on a cold morning while sipping some coffee, but use 'em in your boots for extra warmth. Recommended for sizes 6-10. Makes an incredible gift!\n      I know I come off a bit casual, but this campaign and business mean a lot to me. The plan for this brand and campaign is to not only develop into a larger business that I can pursue full time, but to also use it as a proof of concept for small Mongolian businesses to reach international markets. \nThere are some great companies here with incredible products and unique stories behind them, but need a some cash and a bit of a customer base to get going abroad. I've worked for years doing business development here, and I already have 3 or 4 brands with incredible stories that I want to consult and partner with on kickstarter campaigns, and then work together with them to set up international distribution.\nThe products ULA + LIA sells also support the the nomadic herders and their lifestyle here in Mongolia. They are vulnerable to climate change and changing economics, and the international support can help to stabilize prices and protect their livelihood. \nTHANK YOU for reading this far and for supporting the project. If you have any questions about Mongolia, the herders, cashmere, wool, yaks, ANYTHING, let me know! I can and will go on for hours!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith half a decade of experience in Mongolia, I understand the business environment and the logistical challenges of working here.

I am seeking to use your portrait to explore and grow my personal style and understanding of likeness. This project is not about creating formal portraits or copying photographs. I will be taking artistic liberties with the images that are provided to create my own interesting and personal visions.\nHow does it work?\nOnce the project is funded, I will send a request to all backers for a photo of a portrait of themselves or someone they know that they would like me to paint. As soon as I begin receiving pictures, I will be busy painting them based on the size corresponding to your pledge amount (either 5\"x7\", 8\"x10\", or 16\"x20\").

I have tried to come up with pledge offers that are fair to the backer and myself, considering all the costs that are associated, from materials to packing and, of course, time. And don't forget that all United States backers' shipping costs are INCLUDED in the pledge amount for the 5\"x7\" and 8\"x10\" rewards.\nIf this project is successful, I have plans for more projects that are similar, possibly including some bigger reward opportunities.

By sending me your photograph, you are giving me permission to paint it. Photographs that do not follow the Basic Guidelines or for any reason are deemed unusable will be discarded and a new photograph will be requested. Refunds will not be given where a person fails to provide a working photograph as deemed by me, the artist.\n\nAbout me:\nI am from a small town in Western KY where I went to school at Murray State University, studying Music Education. I taught vocal music at a local high school for a couple years out of college. I found the experience to be both rewarding and, at times, frustrating. After my second year, I began to dabble in the field of graphic design, creating logos and a variety of advertising literature for various companies.\nWhile I have always had an interest in art, I do not have any formal training. My dad, John McLaren, also an artist, has been a huge influence on me, encouraging me to join a local art gallery, which has been a very positive experience. I am always humbled and even surprised to find out that someone has purchased or commented on one of my paintings, as I have only really been painting since December of 2016.\nUp until recently I have painted almost exclusively with soft pastels and love the vibrant colors that I can achieve with their use. I have since begun to dabble in watercolor and am already falling in love with the medium. I like the inherent \"randomness\" and unpredictability that you can achieve. As for subject matter, I tend to paint things that make me smile or laugh, and I especially love painting people.\nAside from painting, I currently manage a number of rental properties in the area and am a stay-at-home-dad to my nearly 2 year old daughter, Charlotte, who keeps me plenty busy. When I do have some free time, I am likely either painting or playing board games with friends and family.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI would say the biggest challenge for me is simply going to be time.

(Kinda.) Now, Blights Out is running for Mayor! (Sort of!) While Blights Out isn\u2019t planning a collective occupation of the Mayor\u2019s office (yet), we are launching a year-long creative campaign called \u2018Blights Out for Mayor\u2019\u2013\u2013a series of 12 billboards and 5 yard sign designs that call for and suggest entry points into a Truth and Reconciliation process that would redress the racist/classist/disaster capitalist policies and values imposed after Hurricane Katrina. These messages seek to expand the horizon of our political imaginary, calling us to reevaluate our society\u2019s relationship to property, land, and money. It is a call to action, a call to #PutHousingFirst.\nBlights Out, \"50 Years Later...(Blights Out for President)\", 2016. Billboard inspired by the Black Panther Party 10-Point Program.\nWhy is our public visioning space taken up by ads for crank lawyers, liquor, guns, and politicians without platforms? While your political candidates might not have much to say about the state of ecology, affordable housing, gentrification, and debt in New Orleans and across our nation, WE DO! We are occupying billboard space on the corner of Orleans Avenue and Galvez Street in New Orleans\u2019 6th Ward starting NOW, just before the New Orleans Mayoral Election on October 14th and for one full year after. Each month, a fresh platform point will crop up, keeping public conversation popping... Because politics and policy neither begin nor end at the ballot.\nOur messages will draw from conversations we've had with folks from the housing justice movement, our own research into how the system of development works (or doesn't work), and our Living Glossary project. Each billboard will seed the public's mind to receive the next message. Our preliminary billboard goes up in time with the Kickstarter so you can get a taste for things to come. With your support, we can reserve our billboard location for one full year and cover the costs of producing the billboard posters and yard signs.\nBlights Out, Theater of the Gentrified Presents: \"Auction\", from the Living Glossary series (feat. Mariama Eversley), 2017.\n Why is this important?\nBlights Out, \"1731 Dumaine\", 2016. Once 1731 Dumaine's roof caved in, demolition became inevitable. It is a stand-in for all of the lost former homes that were condemned to demolition-by-neglect.\nClimate change is real. It is here. Yet our politicians are not acknowledging the major changes that we must make to save our cities from a future of ecological apartheid.\nAcross the world, wealth and power are reorganizing cities in their own image. After decades of disinvestment in urban centers, real estate developers have set their sites on the \u201cinner city\u201d, recognizing the immense profit to be made by converting disinvested neighborhoods into luxury developments. The phenomenon of gentrification is impacting cities across the US from New Orleans to Detroit, New York to San Francisco.\nBlights Out, Commodified Housing is Class Warfare (Blights Out for President), 2016.\nGentrification is a product of end-game free market capitalism run rampant. Racist/classist policy, capitalist values and climate change are coming to a head. We must ask ourselves: will the future of our cities be gentrified fortresses that protect the wealthy from the rising-up of seas and people? We all must unite to demystify the forces behind this phenomenon and push ourselves, the public, and our representatives to act now to create permanently affordable housing, preserve local culture, and build sustainable communities for all. While this project will be rooted in New Orleans, its strategies, messages, significance, and impact will resonate everywhere.\nBlights Out, \u201c803 Spain (Faces of Gentrification series)\", 2017. A blighted house in Marigny is repaired just enough to allow it to be photographed for market.\nAbout Blights Out\nBlights Out is a collective of artists, activists, architects, and concerned members of the public who seek to demystify and democratize the system of housing development and expose the policies that lead to gentrification. We have located the lynchpin of gentrification in laws governing debt and property, racialized boundaries, and wealth stratification. Our mission is to generate dialogue, art, and action that expose the policies that lead to and suggests ways out of our current housing crisis. We believe that art can envision, embody, and inspire better policy for people and the planet.\nBlights Out meeting at Level Art Collective in 2015, prior to the ten-year anniversary of Katrina. Photograph by Bryan Tarnowski.\nBlights Out was co-founded by native New Orleans artist/activist Imani Jacqueline Brown, New York-based artist Lisa Sigal, and native New Orleans artist Carl Joe Williams. The collective is led by the co-founders along with Founding Architectural Designer Bryan C. Lee, Jr. and Embedded Historian Mariama Eversley.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nBlights Out, \"Trauma/Resistance\" (Blights Out for President), 2016. Billboard design for Blights Out's \"Blights Out for President\" campaign in 2016.\nWe recognize that the values that have created bad housing policy in New Orleans are the same values that are destabilizing cities across our nation. Gentrification is a national crisis of values and is the natural end of our society's refusal to redress our nation's founding values and laws, which justified the displacement, mass murder, and enslavement of indigenous and African people and their descendants. Blights Out is coming to Kickstarter to fundraise for this new project because we want to unite people in New Orleans and across our nation in a call to expose the roots of gentrification, address inequitable development as the root of systemic poverty and the expression of institutional racism, and declare that housing is a human right.\nRewards\nHere is a small sampling of some of the rewards available as \"thank you's\" for your contributions to our campaign!

There is always inherent risk when bringing new products to market. Production delays can occur, and we are first to admit that we have definitely experienced them before. This is our second Kickstarter campaign, and the experience we gained 3 years ago (and the journey since) has been invaluable for the planning of this campaign. We are now well versed in the production process, and have taken all steps to ensure the process goes as smoothly as possible. \n\nBut we don't like over-promising something - so here's a few potential risk areas, and how we have mitigated them. \n\n- Bottle production - quality. In our first campaign we hit a number of roadblocks - learning how to produce flat bottles with an offset neck, whilst maintaining good clarity and quality. There were months of back and forth with samples before we finally arrived at the final product. This time, we have done this grunt work in the lead up to this campaign, and have strong existing manufacturer relationships in place. \n\n- Soft good production - Manufacturing soft goods also has it's challenges.

We\u2019re talking about the free spirits who can\u2019t live unless they\u2019re spattering the earth with crazy ideas and irresistible energy. We sent the Lomo\u2019Instant Square to actors, tattoo artists, musicians, photographers, entrepreneurs; anyone we could find who was giving their all to creating something amazing. Here\u2019s what we got back.\nZach Carothers, Member of Portugal. The Man, Touring the World\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with the Lomo\u2019Instant Square. Compact, instant and fun. The energy in a space or a party steps up every time I pull out the camera. It brings people together. I\u2019m all about the pictures taken with it. There is something so beautiful about right angles and equal sides. Classic framing that brings me back to my childhood. The glass is so much sharper and easier to control. Very excited to get into this more.\u201d\n  Makui and Chow, Founders of Caf\u00e9 Mum's Not Home, Hong Kong \n\u201cEverything about instant photography is filled with expectation and excitement. We enjoy the mixture of emotions as you wait for the photo to develop. We\u2018ve always loved the square format because it\u2019s balanced, which makes it look more perfect.\u201d\nRuby June, Artist and Photographer, New York \n\u201cIt's amazing to be able to capture a moment and have it in my palm immediately \u2014 ready to write the memory down while it's still fresh. When I used to bring my digital camera with me I had to take a thousand photos and it was really hard to stay present. With the instant camera I have maybe five shots that I can use. If they turn out great! If they don't, that's a memory too.\u201d\nNaomi Perkins, Tattoo Artist's Manager, New York\n\u201cThe Lomo'Instant Square is really fun and easy to use. Having the physical copy of a photo is so much cooler than just having it in your phone. Michelle and I immediately started talking about taking photographs of her with clients and making a backdrop out of them. It would be so cool! I love the way Sheena\u2019s hair and tattoos look in the film\u2014so detailed! When I first saw the Lomo\u2019Instant Square I thought it was a reaaaaaally old camera. Carrying it around would catch attention and I think a lot of people would be curious to know more about it!\u201d\nLuca Font, Tattoo Artist and Illustrator, Milan\n\u201cI choose to shoot people who do interesting things. Taking a picture of them is, in some way, showing a small instant of what is happening in Milan in 2017. The Lomo\u2019Instant Square is very intuitive and user-friendly. I feel that the shots reflect the subjects' personality in a true and efficient way. Whether in instant or 120 format, there\u2019s something deeply fascinating about square photography that I\u2019ve never been able to explain!\u201d\nRussell Darling, Michael Hanratty and Hector Moss; Filmmaker and Actors; London\n\u201cI love the raw, edgy, provocative, crazy and beautiful images that Andy Warhol and Robert Mapplethorpe created in the 1970s. I took inspiration from them, and from movies such as Eyes Wide Shut. The square format is perfect for portraits, as it allows for an up-close intimate window into the world of that person. It was also very satisfying to see the photos right away and share them with my subjects, Michael Hanratty and Hector Moss.\u201d\n  The Lomo\u2019Instant Square automatically adjusts shutter speed, aperture and flash output to make sure that your shots are perfectly exposed \u2014 no matter where you\u2019re exploring or what you\u2019re discovering.

Disclaimer: I can't guarantee these will help you pass that crusty, old class with that crusty, old teacher (Note: I'm a teacher myself, so I'm pretty sure it's okay for me to poke fun at teachers).\nOkay, here's the deal: I've adapted 5 of my favorite crusty, old stories into short, illustrated books that will be informative (kind of) and fun (yes!) for all ages!  \nWhile remaining faithful (kind of) to the original stories, I have condensed them into short, comedic adaptations that will be a great introduction for new readers, but also an entertaining time for folks who love the original crusty, old books!  I actually do enjoy those crusty, old books.  But I really enjoy poking fun at them as well! \nThese non-crusty, new paperback books measure 6\"x6\" and range from 50 to 72 pages.  Each one features a short adaptation of the classic with original black and white illustrations as well as other poems, drawings, puzzles and more!  \nI plan on creating several sets of \"CLASSICS (kind of).\"  My ultimate goal is to turn this project into an ongoing series.  The crusty, old books I've chosen for the 1st set are: The Odyssey, Moby Dick, Hamlet, Dracula and The Raven.  \nThe \"CLASSICS (kind of)\" series will be a terrific way to introduce these stories to first time readers, and a hilarious addition to the collection for all you literary scholars out there!\nHere are some sample pages from each book:\n\"Dracula\" by Bram Stoker (kind of)\n   The Odyssey by Homer (kind of)\n  The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe (kind of)\n  \"Moby Dick\" by Herman Melville (kind of)\n  \"Hamlet\" by William Shakespeare (kind of)\nAND EACH BOOK WILL INCLUDE ORIGINAL PUZZLES & GAMES!!! (if we reach our 1st stretch goal, I'll also add an original crossword puzzle to each book - WE REACHED IT)!!!\nWord Searches, Mazes & More!!!\n          6 Stretch Goals Reached!\n    8 Stretch Goals Reached!!!\n  NOTE: I apologize for not offering this campaign internationally. Shipping costs have just increased too much to make it economically feasible to ship these books to international addresses.  I truly apologize for this!

Available for Mini DisplayPort or USB-C, Luna sets up in seconds and instantly works with your existing Wi-Fi.\nLuna was designed to have a signature look and fit great with your Mac\nLuna connects to your Mac's display port (either Mini DisplayPort or USB-C)\nChoose the Luna that works with your Mac: Mini DisplayPort or USB-C\nLuna is a true display that fits in the palm of your hand. Simply plug Luna in your Mac, launch the free app, and you\u2019re off and running. It's the quickest and easiest way to setup a second screen with your iPad.\nEasy to use and friendly, Luna fits in your palm\nPowered by our unique LIQUID technology, Luna was designed from the very beginning to work wirelessly. However if Wi-Fi is not available, USB is also a great reliable alternative.\nMac and iPad connect over Wi-Fi or USB\nLuna Display acts as a complete extension to your Mac, allowing you to use it directly from your iPad with full support for external keyboards,  Apple Pencil, and touch interactions. It literally turns your Mac into a touchable device, allowing pinching, panning and tapping\u2026 making it much more than just a second screen.\nFull External Keyboard Support\nWorks with Apple Pencil\nTouch Interaction Compatible\nWatch our team talk about the key aspects of Luna: our goals, the technology behind it, our design process, and Luna's energy & battery use.\nLuna fully integrates with our award-winning drawing software Astropad. Luna extends both Astropad Standard and Astropad Studio to provide the ultimate drawing experience with the best second screen solution for iPad. If you are a creative professional, Luna has been designed with you in mind.\nLuna Display adds second screen functionality to Astropad Standard and Astropad Studio\nBenefits of using Astropad with Luna Display\nWorks with any modern Mac - Luna requires a Mac running macOS 10.10, Yosemite (or later). For optimal performance we recommend these configurations: MacBook Air (2012 and later), MacBook Pro (2012 and later), Mac mini (2012 and later), iMac (2012 and later), Mac Pro (Late 2013).\nWorks with any modern iPad - Luna requires an iPad running iOS 9.1 (or later): iPad 2 (or later), any iPad Mini and any iPad Pro.\nUsing the iPad as a second display allows you to more easily get your work done anywhere \u2014 so you can be productive whether you\u2019re at the office, in the studio, or on the go. Luna is the perfect companion for...\nSpreadsheets & Data - Luna gives you the freedom and flexibility to give your data and spreadsheets the room it deserves. It's the perfect partner for Excel, Numbers, or any of your other favorite spreadsheet apps.\nPresentations & Keynotes - Take advantage of dual monitor presentation modes to make your power point and Keynote presentation more fluid and precise.  \nDevelopment & Coding - Use your iPad as a preview window for a flexible and portable way to see and share code previews. \nAudio and Music - Give plugins and additional editing windows their own place to live while utilizing touch interactions to bring creative executions to a whole new level. \nWe developed Luna because we knew there was a better solution than relying on software to turn an iPad into a second display.\nSoftware apps literally hack your graphics card, delivering a glitchy and unreliable picture. Software tricks your Mac into thinking a display is attached, when in fact they get no benefit of graphics acceleration or Metal GPU support. It's like buying a car and only using half the engine. \nSo unlike software apps, Luna harnesses the raw power of your graphics card, giving you the full benefit of its graphics acceleration \u2014 delivering a stunning second monitor that\u2019s 100% wire free.\nGet the benefit of graphics acceleration & Metal GPU\nWhen developing the product design, we wanted Luna to stand out and feel like a creative accessory to the computer hardware. We purposefully avoided making it look like another Apple-like, copy cat accessory.\nIn designing Luna we took inspiration from crystals found in nature\nA great amount of time was put into the angular, crystal like design to be as aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well as the hand. \nEarly 3D study of the crystal design enclosure\nOur proprietary LIQUID Technology was originally built for creative professionals and is now available to everyone.\nUsing LIQUID, Luna Display provides crystal clear image quality, reliable performance, and wireless flexibility. We realized it\u2019s not just artists that value these things and that\u2019s why we are bringing our LIQUID technology to our latest product \u2014 Luna Display.\nOur LIQUID technology provides:\nUncompromised image quality \nLightning fast speeds \nLag-free performance at 60 frames per second \nGPU acceleration, so your Mac stays fast and optimized \nHand optimized ARM assembly to maximize battery life\nVelocity Control, which analyzes network conditions dozens of times per second \n Founded by ex-Apple engineers\nAstro HQ \u2014 the company behind Luna \u2014 was founded by two ex-Apple engineers: Matt Ronge & Giovanni Donelli. In 2015 we launched a tool designed for creative professionals called Astropad. Astropad has been a smash hit that is now used by tens of thousands of creative pros and some of the largest animation studios in the world.

We are back with a new project: Panobook, a notebook for your desk, and eventually, your shelf. \nHere is Panobook, in a nutshell:\nThe unique panoramic format (160 mm x 288 mm) is designed to sit nicely on your desk, either in front of, behind, to next to your keyboard. \nEach page contains a subtle dot grid, with guide markers to help with layout. \nWe really sweated the details. All of the materials have a premium feel and are very nice. \nPanobooks are designed to be kept. Put it in the included slip case, annotate it if you want, and line a bunch up on the shelf.\nKeep scrolling to learn more!  \n  It all started with an insight about how we use notebooks. Even though we spend 8 hours a day doing digital work on a computer, notebooks are an essential analogue tool. We noticed, while sitting at a computer, it would be great to have a notebook directly in front of us. But that would require a different type of notebook, one with more of a panoramic ratio. So that\u2019s what we made.\nPanobook works great on a desk, either in front of, behind, or to the side of your keyboard. We wanted to create a notebook that was always open and always within arm's reach.\nIn using a prototype of the Panobook, we realized its unique format opened up some interesting creative possibilities. In landscape, it is fantastic for things like UI flows, storyboards, weekly calendars, Gantt charts, comic strips, level design, bullet journals, etc. Open up the notebook fully to get an even wider view. Rotate the notebook 90 degrees and you\u2019ve got a mini legal pad, great for list making, note taking, webpage layout, giraffe doodles, and more. We were surprised by how the unusual format seemed to get the creative juices flowing.\n        We designed the pages to help creative folks get their work done. Every page has a very subtle dot grid, with a twist. We\u2019ve included guide markers that make it easy to quickly draw three rectangles on the page, sized ideally for smartphone UI design or storyboarding. We also included edge guides to divide up the page and provide layout cues. The guides virtually disappear if you are not looking for them, but are very useful when you need them.\nEach page is 160 mm x 288 mm (6.3 in by 11.34 in) and the dots on the grid are spaced 5 mm apart.\nGuides for three 16:9 boxes.\n  Vertical and horizontal midpoint guides.\n  5 mm dot grid on a 288 mm x 160 mm sheet.\n  Being two fussy designers, we paid attention to every last detail in this notebook. The paper is super high quality, and performs well with a variety of writing instruments without smudging or bleeding. We consulted with several pen nerds and paper experts to help us find a fantastic paper, and we think we found it. It is Finch Soft White Ultra Smooth 70 lb text, if you're curious. Each notebook contains 50 sheets / 100 pages.\nFinch Soft White Ultra Smooth 70 lb.\nThe front and back covers are rigid, with an amazing soft touch feel. Panobook is bound with a robust wire-o binding, which allows the notebook to sit flat when opened. An insert in the front of the notebook contains a place for record keeping, as well as metric and imperial rulers and a type size reference. \nWe think you will appreciate all the care and attention to detail we put into this thing.\n  The front and back covers are rigid, with a slightly textured, soft touch feel.\n   The front insert.\n  Lastly, Panobook was designed to be kept. It comes with a slip case, which is meant to be the final resting place for your notebook. You can write on the spine to catalogue the notebook, and it looks awesome when you line several up on a shelf. We've noticed a tendency among designers to hang on to their old notebooks, and Panobook helps facilitate that. \nThere is a spot to write on the spine of the slip case for archival purposes.\n   The slipcase.\n  Panobooks lined up on a shelf.\n  We've wanted to make a notebook for a while now. We went in several different directions, but the \"ah-ha\" moment came when we started to consider how a notebook could be uniquely designed for desk use. We spent way too long fussing over materials and details of the notebook. Every last detail was considered, and we think you will be pleased with the end result. \nIf you want to learn more about the design process behind Panobook, be sure to listen to our podcast episode specifically about it! \nLots and lots of paper samples.\n  Printing projects such as this one are required to be paid in full to place an order, and are only cost effective if you reach a certain quantity threshold. We are on Kickstarter to gauge interest for Panobook, and see if it can gather enough pre-orders to make it a reality!

He received countless glowing reviews. His visionary cartoons were published in the now-storied New York Herald Sunday comics section, printed on the reverse side of Winsor McCay's masterpiece LITTLE NEMO IN SLUMBERLAND. \nHe was a rising star in a brand new form of art. And then, in 1917, he vanished from the art world, never to be heard from again.  \nUntil now.\nIn October of 2016, we launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund THE TEMPLE OF SILENCE, a large-format art book and biography collecting the work and telling the story of this fascinating specter from vanishing past. \nThe response was overwhelming. 740 passionate lovers of art, history and comics rallied to our cause, funding our quixotic reclamation project to the tune of $96,772. Thanks to them, we'll be able not only to publish THE TEMPLE OF SILENCE, but to do it in style. We're pulling out all the stops on the production of this beautiful book.\n\nA lot of backers, as enthralled by Crowley's astonishing artwork as we are, asked us if we would be willing to produce high end fine art prints of some of the images featured in the campaign. So when Kickstarter invited us to remix the Crowley project for their Kickstarter Gold program, we knew exactly what to do.\n\nSo, with our giant, gorgeous books currently rolling off the presses, we are relaunching this glorious campaign with a brand new line of limited edition of archival gicl\u00e9e fine art prints. We are incredibly excited to share our works in progress with all of you, and keep spreading the gospel of Herbert. We hope you'll get on board with this campaign to save one of the great geniuses of early 20th century art from being lost forever in the sands of time. \n\nIn Art Out of Time, Dan Nadel\u2019s 2006 collection of comics by unknown cartoonists, several of Crowley\u2019s strips are reproduced as examples of vital early newspaper cartooning that had been unjustly and completely forgotten. In a short piece at the end of the anthology, Nadel describes Crowley as representing the \u201csingle largest information gap in this book,\u201d \u2014 a book about unremembered artists \u2014 and writes that that aside from the existence of these comic strips, \u201cnothing else is known about Crowley or his work.\u201d\n  Outside of two great comics collections reproducing a small handful of his Wigglemuch strips, none of his astonishing work \u2014 which includes oil paintings, pen & ink illustrations, bronze sculptures, set designs, children's books and more \u2014 has ever been collected or published. Over the course of a century, the memory of this uniquely brilliant artist has been erased. Herbert Crowley has been completely forgotten. \n\nWhere did Herbert Crowley go?\n You can find him this fall, in our biographical art book.\n\nOur tome includes hundreds of newly discovered Herbert Crowley pieces which have never been published or exhibited anywhere, in any form. \n\nOur seven years of primary-source research have taken us from Texas to Toronto to Zurich. We've literally crawled into the ruins of Crowley's collapsed home in upstate New York, reclaiming incredible artwork from the raccoons and silverfish. \nWe've spent time with Crowley's family in Zurich and New York City, digging up a huge amount of correspondence and ephemera, and slowly and painstakingly uncovered his long-forgotten story\u2014a strange and incredible saga that arcs across the planet, from the Americas to Europe to the middle and far East, through the front line of the first World War, the early days of experimental theatre, and the inner circle of the visionary psychoanalyst Carl Jung. \nThere is a peculiar void in the world now, where Crowley\u2019s artwork used to be. An artist of this caliber should never have been\u2014and cannot remain\u2014forgotten. \nWith your help, we hope to bring his work to the world.\n\"As someone interested in the weirdnesses and Roads Not Taken in the history of comix, Crowley is one of the most idiosyncratic and quirky artists in the cohort. I salute him, and you for doing the heavy-lifting archaeological dig of bringing him to the surface again.\" \n          -Art Spiegelman\n\"[Crowley's characters] are complex icons, more akin to mandalas than any cartoon character. Crowley accomplished a vision in newsprint that could only have snuck into print under the guise of a comic strip, at a time when the medium was first finding its feet.\"\n          -Dan Nadel\n\"Herbert Crowley's insanely detailed architectural renderings, hairy devils, and countless creepy creatures are mind-boggling, deeply mysterious, and long overdue for a collection. His work was psychedelic decades before that term came into use. I wish he had been around when I was publishing Dope Comix.\" \n          -Denis Kitchen\n\"...drawings by Mr. Crowley are quite interesting in as much as they contain curious symbols referring to the sympathicus as well as to the multiple luminosities of the collective unconscious. He has been driven in to astounding depths -- quite dangerous when consciousness is not up to it. Such things usually leave a peculiar void in the conscious world after they have passed.\" \n           -Carl Jung, 1951\n  THE BOOK \n  THE TEMPLE OF SILENCE: FORGOTTEN WORKS & WORLDS OF HERBERT CROWLEY is an oversized hardcover archival art book that contains the greatest works of Crowley's remarkable career. At 108 pages and 11\" x 17\u201d, this handsomely produced prestige edition will contain a wealth of his artwork, much of it at its original size\u2014alongside a comprehensive 20,000 word biography recounting his unforgettable tale.

However, the process of frequently washing and drying your bedding takes up valuable time; taking you away from doing the things that you love. Ettitude has created a range of new high-performance, sustainable bedding that absorbs odor and drys faster than any other bedding in the world to avoid the growth of bacteria - saving you time, water and electricity.\nIntroducing Bamboo Coffee Sheets - a blend of our signature Bamboo Lyocell fabric and reclaimed coffee grounds.\nCoffee grounds may seem like an unlikely sleep partner but we can assure you it will give you the best sleep of your life. By harnessing coffee\u2019s natural ability to block odors, these sheets have excellent odor neutralizing and moisture wicking abilities, so your sheets can stay fresh for longer. No more musty-smelling sheets ever!\nEttitude As Seen In Press   \nWhy You Want to Sleep With Bamboo Coffee\n Why Use Coffee Grounds?\nCoffee makes the world go round, with over 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed in the world every day! The average cup of coffee, however, only utilizes a minuscule 0.2% of the coffee with the remaining 99.8% becoming coffee grounds thrown into the trash. By using S.Cafe\u00ae technology, we are able to recycle this previously wasted 99.8%, to transform coffee grounds into a yarn which can be used in bedding. \nCoffee grounds also have excellent ability to remove foul smells, even one of the worst smells around -- sewer gas! Scientists at The City College of New York (CCNY) found that used coffee grounds can sop up hydrogen sulfide gas, the chemical that makes raw sewage stinky. That's how powerful used coffee ground as a deodorizer!\nOdour Neutralising\nMany people experience night sweat during their sleep. This can cause a rough night\u2019s sleep and will mean your sheets need to be washed sooner. \nWhen sweat and odor pass through the fabric, it is absorbed into the micropores of the coffee yarn fibers, virtually eliminating it, allowing you to stay fresh all night and your sheets to remain cleaner for longer.\nFast Drying\nS.Cafe\u00ae coffee yarn is also used by some of the biggest athletic and adventure wear companies due to its fast drying ability. We are the first in the world to use the S.Cafe\u00ae technology in bedding.\nThis unique bamboo coffee fabric can move moisture away from the skin to the outer surface of the fabric for a faster drying process. Imagine the structure sort of like a sponge, lots of surface area to spread, absorb and dry faster. This function is permanent and will never wash out. So bacterias don't get the chance to breed and grow on your sheets and create that unpleasant musty smell!\nHow Do Coffee Grounds Turn Into Yarn\nFirstly, only coffee beans which have been roasted and ground can be used to produce coffee yarn. This is because during roasting, the beans swell and the hot water removes materials clogging the space, meaning the inside of the bean expands, allowing for odor absorption and fast drying functions. After the coffee beans are ground, used in coffee making and discarded, they are reclaimed to be used to make coffee yarn. The coffee grounds are embedded onto a yarn fiber, using a low temperature, high-pressure and energy saving process.\nDuring this process, the filaments of the fiber change and lock and embed the coffee grounds into the yarn. The yarn fiber used is made from recycled plastic water bottles, another high-tech and sustainable material. The oils in the grounds, which produce the coffee scent are also removed through a pharmaceutical process so you won\u2019t be kept awake all night.\nBamboo Lyocell Yarn\nBamboo Lyocell is a fabric that consists of fiber made from dissolving organic bamboo pulp. We are the FIRST company in the world to make 100% Bamboo Lyocell bedding. This fabric is superior to any other bamboo products on the market right now which use the traditional viscose/rayon process. Lyocell fabrication process is the most sustainable fabrication process, using a closed-loop system. 99% of the organic solvent and water in the process is recycled and reused up to 200 times. This process has minimal environmental impact, with economical use of both energy and water. Bamboo Lyocell fabric is incredibly soft, silky and super breathable.\nS.Cafe\u00ae Coffee Yarn + Bamboo Lyocell\nThe S.Cafe\u00ae coffee yarn (35%) is woven together with Bamboo Lyocell yarn (65%) in the fabrication process to create these odor control and fast drying sheets that bring you the freshest sleep environment.\nThis Is How Your New Favourite Bedding Looks\n\n               Design & Sizing\nWe offer modern and neutral colours that will work in any home. Please choose the perk which lists your bed size. We have grouped similar sizes together so don\u2019t be confused by other sizes in your perk. We will email you after the campaign is completed to finalize your size and colour selections.\nLatte Colour\n  A close up of the Latte colour fabric.\nFlat White Colour\nA close up of the Flat White colour fabric\nMocha Colour\nA close up of the Mocha colour fabric.\nStrawberry Frappe Colour\nA close up of the Strawberry Frappe colour fabric\nOur complete Bamboo Coffee Bedding Collection\nOhh how buttery soft and smooth the sheets are!\nCare Instructions \nBamboo coffee lyocell bedding is super easy to care for. Just machine wash cold separately and line dry or tumble dry low and you are all set to enjoy them and the long lasting freshness for years to come! We do not recommend using bleaches, as they are usually packed with toxic chemicals. Fabric softener is also not necessary with bamboo sheets \u2013 they are already super soft and will stay that way wash after wash.\nRewards (all prices are in AUD) \nLIMITED FOUNDING BACKER SPECIAL OFFERS:\nFirst 100 people to pledge sheet set or duvet set will get 1 free eye mask in the same colour fabric \nFirst 30 people to pledge complete set or family pack will get 1 free dressing gown in the same colour fabric. The gown comes in S, M, L size, unisex style.\nThe Most Sustainable Bedding Fabric to Date\nThese two unique yarns both hold numerous eco-friendly and quality certifications.\nOrganic Bamboo Lyocell is a cruelty-free, vegan-friendly fabric that has all the softness and smoothness of silk or high count Egyptian cotton. Made with FSC-certified organic bamboo, it is also more sustainable and eco-friendly than any other new types of functional textiles. \nS.Cafe\u00ae Coffee Yarn holds bluesign\u24c7, Cradle to Cradle and GRS (Global Recycle Standard) certifications. \nBoth yarns and the final product pass the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 test to make sure no harmful substances remained in the products at the end of the manufacturing process.\nWe also work closely with our manufacturing partners to make sure all our products are ethically made. Our factory is certified by Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP), which is awarded based upon both internationally and nationally accepted humane workplace standards, safety, and ethical manufacturing regulations.\nAdd-ons and Adjusting Your Pledge \nIf you would like to add additional products to your pledge, simply add the price of the additional product to your current pledge amount.

This unique bamboo coffee lyocell fabric requires a minimum financial commitment of $30,000 to be custom-made. Since Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing proposition, we must hit $30,000 to begin mass production. \nWe also have two stretch goals, each requiring an additional $20,000 to cover the expenses of offering an expanded option. For each stretch goal we achieve, we will make the option of an additional colour available to all of our backers.\nYour pledge will help fund the initial production of these Bamboo Coffee Sheets. We have everything lined up - the prototypes have proved successful, our warehouse staff is trained and ready, our customer service team is ready to help deliver your rewards. All that's missing is you.\nWhat Our Customers Say About Our Original Bamboo Sheets\nWhether you sleep solo or with your partner you can enjoy the most comfortable night's sleep with our organic bamboo sheets.

We believe that creativity in cooking comes from a combination of supreme quality materials, artisanal craftsmanship, and aesthetic beauty.\nBased on our experience in knife making we carefully selected a supreme quality Japanese steel called AUS-10. With a hardness range of 58-60 HRC, high toughness, supreme sharpness and good corrosion resistance, this steel is ideal for the highest quality Chef knives.\n  Our blade consists of 67 layers of premium quality Japanese steel. This multi-layered steel has its origin in both Japanese samurai and Damascene sword making. \nWhilst the pattern is originally formed in the forging process, skilled artisan workers manually submerge the blade into an etching solution. This penetrates the multiple layers of steel and brings out the beautiful dark floral pattern on the blade. Each blade pattern is unique.\n We worked with London designer Christian Bird, to create a contemporary and effortlessly beautiful design that ensured our knives were of the highest quality, both aesthetically and functionally.\n    Every KUROI HANA blade consists of 67 layers of Japanese high carbon steel from Aichi steel corporation. Each layer also contributes to a combined layered effect known as the \u2018Damascus effect\u2019. The result is this amazing dark floral pattern. This is KUROI HANA.  \nThe steel core is of AUS10. AUS-10 is Aichi\u2019s most well-rounded knife steel. With a hardness range of 58-60 HRC, high toughness, scary sharpness and good corrosion resistance, AUS-10 is the recommended grade for high-end chef's knives.\nThis innovative high carbon steel core also contains Vanadium which improves the wear resistance, toughness, and ease of sharpening. The remaining layers are formed by alterations of S/S 430 and S/S 431 steel to create an outer case, protecting the cutting core.\nThe blade cutting angle is 35\u00ba (17.5 on each side for optimal sharpness).\n      Black Diamond Knife Block\n      A tremendous thank you to all 4,000 backers who have helped us reach the huge milestone of \u00a31,000,000. We are extremely thankful for your support. To celebrate this milestone, we are excited to present new add-on products exclusively to all our backers. In response to your kind feedback and product suggestions, our design team have worked very hard to finalise the design of four new knives. All backers will be able to add these items to their pledge on CrowdOx once the campaign has ended. The delivery of all add-ons will be in March 2018.\n                                                    ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a376 or more",

Share on Facebook   |    Share on Twitter\neto is a beautifully designed wine decanter that gives you the freedom to enjoy wine at your own pace, and never waste a drop again. Its innovative, patented preservation system uses an airtight seal to keep wine perfectly fresh for at least 7 days, as proven by blind taste tests carried out with 'Master of Wine' Richard Hemming, and independent laboratory testing at Bangor University.\neto is easy to use - its unique design ensures every step is quick, clean and complements the traditional ritual of enjoying wine.\nDue to its patented preservation system that creates an airtight seal over the wine, eto halts the oxidation process, which in turn preserves the wine\u2019s freshness and taste. \nAs we become more health-consciousness, more and more of us are choosing to enjoy just a glass or two rather than several \u2013 or even save our wine drinking for the weekend. eto gives us this freedom. \nWith eto you can open and savour that treasured bottle over several days or even weeks. \nThe long funnel gently oxygenates the wine to release its flavours and the sharp lip ensures drip-free pouring. \nNo waste, and no need to rush to finish the bottle (or the next one...)\neto\u2019s ability to prevent wine oxidation has been proven by independent tests carried out at Bangor University. The graph shows just how effective eto is compared to other wine preservation products. \nBeacon Laboratories. \u00a9 Bangor University 2016\neto underwent rigorous testing and re-testing over a 12 month period with a variety of red and white wines. The results were indisputable - eto far out-performed competitor products in every tightly-monitored test.  \nWhile science proved eto prevented oxidation, blind taste tests with wine experts showed that eto protected the quality of the wine too.  \n'Master of Wine' Richard Hemming \u2013 and writer at JancisRobinson.com \u2013 took part in two separate blind taste tests, comparing freshly opened wine with its eto 7 day preserved equivalent.  \u201cOn the seventh day ... for me, the results were unanimous: there was no perceptible difference between a freshly opened bottle and the eto-stored sample\u201d Read the full article HERE.\nAfter taking part in a similar blind taste test, Wine Director at Honest Grapes, Tom Harrow, commented \u201cA wine which had been decanted (into eto) seven days beforehand tasted every bit as fresh as a wine which had come from a recently opened bottle. But it also had the added benefits of decanting, in that the wine was breathing ... it was opening up ... it tasted absolutely delicious.\u201d \nI am Tom Cotton, an award-winning industrial designer with nearly 20 years experience of bringing products from concept to market. I am passionate about protecting the environment, and in 2011 became interested in designing a product that helped to reduce wine wastage.\nWine wastage is a huge environmental problem across the world. In the UK alone, 50 million litres of wine are poured down the sink every year - see WRAP report EVA063. A recent study by Laithwaite\u2019s Wine put the figure down as enough to fill 333 Olympic-sized swimming pools, and also these disturbing statistics: \nOur inability to preserve wine once the cork has been popped is a major cause of this wine waste. And I quickly discovered that the wine preservation products on the market were either ineffective or hugely expensive.\nMy inspiration for eto came after a friend highlighted the method - common amongst wine experts - of transferring leftover wine into a smaller container to minimise the air contact. After experimenting, I found the method of reducing air exposure very effective. I just needed to work on the container\u2026 \nAfter months of exploration I filed a patent for an innovative design in September 2012. At the core of the invention was a new unique valve concept that sealed wine at exactly the right moment, no matter how much wine was left. \nThe \u2018design for manufacture\u2019 stage brought significant challenges. Not only did the valve require costly \u2018proof of concept\u2019 prototyping, experts in the glass industry said the precision required for glass simply couldn\u2019t be achieved within the cost.  \nAfter a highly rigorous and competitive process, I was awarded an Innovate UK government grant to develop eto further. This support proved invaluable, allowing me to build over 60 functioning prototypes, develop a detailed manufacture design and test eto\u2019s effectiveness in the laboratory. \nFive years on, we have a product that really works. eto looks beautiful, preserves wine brilliantly and is exceptionally easy to use, store and maintain.  \nWe have built a strong relationship with our chosen manufacturing partner, and use only the highest quality materials to ensure eto is effective, elegant and durable in the long term. \nAll materials are food approved and fully compliant with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the German BfR, ensuring they have no effect on the wine\u2019s flavour. All materials are also BPA free. \nThe glass used in eto is high precision \u2018toughened\u2019 borosilicate glass that\u2019s optically clear & \u2018seam free\u2019 to optimise the wine colour. The glass has increased heat & shatter resistance, and won't stain or absorb any odours.\nHigh grade Stainless steel with anti-corrosion properties and antimicrobial finish.\nPVD coating creates a tough finish that is approximately ten times harder than stainless steel itself.\neto dissembles into four main sections and these can be individually replaced if damaged. (Although we do not foresee any reason to replace parts due to natural wear & tear.)\nAs glass specification was one of our major challenges, we undertook extensive research before selecting a glass manufacturer who we were confident could achieve the consistent glass tolerance required for eto without spiralling costs. High standards in worker treatment and environmental impact were also essential.  \nWe have worked closely with our manufacturing and assembly partner for over two years. They have over 30 years of experience bringing premium houseware products to market, and their skilled quality control team inspect each product before shipping.\neto has taken several years to perfect, as we have built multiple prototypes to improve and simplify its design. We now have a product with minimal parts, precision-engineered seam-free glass, and high grade, anti-corrosion stainless steel that is both durable and aesthetic.\nBack eto and become part of our story. Once the campaign is over, we will be in touch to collect your shipping address details. We will then keep you updated throughout the process, and you will become one of the first people to enjoy using eto in early 2018. \neto is a unique and innovative product, and would make a great gift for any wine drinker. If you would like to buy eto for someone special, simply download the \u2018gift card\u2019 (from the link below) which can be printed, or sent electronically. \neto is easy to clean \u2013 simply rinse with hot water straight after use and avoid using detergents. Please note, the metal parts of eto are not dishwasher safe. \nTo make eto viable, we need to raise \u00a355,000 through our Kickstarter campaign. This diagram shows you how your money will be allocated. Any additional funds will be used to increase production. \neto's creator Tom Cotton is an award winning industrial designer with nearly 20 years experience creating 3D product & packaging designs for some of the world\u2019s leading brands. He has a passion for delivering fresh, breakthrough designs that reflect a high-level of consumer and market understanding, and has a strength for balancing design and technology constraints, often working through tough issues until they are resolved.   \nTom is cited as \u2018inventor\u2019 on over 18 international patents for consumer products, and has been extensively involved in the development and commercialisation of IP. His enthusiasm for innovation and problem solving is balanced by a detailed understanding of manufacturing, materials, IP & business realities. He\u2019s created structural pack forms and product designs for clients including Gillette, Diageo, Procter & Gamble, Absolute vodka, Bacardi and Nestle.\nPLAY\n\n Easy to use - even by a 3 year old :)\nI am a London based Welshman and, like many of my countrymen, proud of my roots. The word eto means \u2018again\u2019 in Welsh, which perfectly sums up the joy of the product. eto allows you to enjoy wine again, and again \u2013 without sacrificing either its taste or our planet.\nKickstarter is a proven start-up platform with a community of \u2018early adopters\u2019 who help vet, fund and refine new products. For innovative entrepreneurs who want to realise their vision, the pioneering Kickstarter community offers the most supportive platform. We highly value the Kickstarter community and its role in supporting innovation and hope that together we can launch eto. We\u2019re not on Kickstarter to make a big margin; we\u2019re here to build a community of early adopters who can also help us decide what eto will do next.  \nJoin us in bringing this collaboration to life \u2013 we can't do it without you!\nWe couldn\u2019t have created eto without the help and support of friends and family, all of whom who have encouraged us to launch our new product on Kickstarter. In particular, a big thanks to Shish Patel, Steve Challouma, Ellie MacLeod, Mike Webster, Sarah Clarke-Wareham, Paula Zuccotti, Ed Adamson, Olly Chambers, Mark Armstrong, Ian Webb, Felix Scarlett, Tom Herman, Jon Sleeman, Gareth Thomas, Mark Shickle, Raj Sood, Ben Scales, Henry & Kath Rowe, Rae Stewart, Sine Sorensen, Paul Wilford, Aaron Probyn, Hannah Thomas and Katy Gandon for marketing guidance, and Siwan Jones and Andrei Saltykov from Lacey Saltykov for letting us use their amazing house for the photo-shoot.

We can't wait to get your new eto to you.  \nIf you like the look of eto, but aren\u2019t quite ready to pledge, you can help us make eto a success by sharing our posts on social media, giving us your feedback and telling your friends and family about eto and our Kickstarter campaign.  \nWhen wine is continually exposed to air, the oxygen reacts with certain phenolic compounds in the wine and causes their oxidation, which results in:  \nLoss of fruit characters\nReduced Aroma\nIncrease in bitterness as a result of the development of acetaldehyde\nUnwanted bacteria and yeast such as Acetobacter aceti, Lactic acid bacteria, and Brettanomyces starting to thrive. \nLower antioxidants - such as quercetin and resveratrol. Research has shown this plays a part in helping to prevent heart disease and cancer ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs eto is a high precision product, it brings a number of production challenges \u2013 from manufacturing to shipping and support. However, we have done everything possible to ensure our backers receive eto in perfect condition \u2013 and will continue to do so throughout the process.\n\nWe have many years of product design experience, taking ideas through to fully realised products, and have sourced the best manufacturer and fulfilment company to bring eto from a prototype to a product in your hands. \n\nThroughout the project we\u2019ve sought advice and expertise from within the design, manufacturing and wine industries. We also highly value the Kickstarter community and its role in supporting innovation and hope that together, with your help we can launch eto - a product that is for you, by you and with you.\n\nWe have a strong relationship with our manufacturing team and are confident that we can meet our published schedule, and get eto to our backers on time. We don\u2019t currently foresee any issues with eto, but recognize that any project can encounter unexpected challenges. If we do, we promise to be fully transparent and to provide regular updates to backers.\n\nHighly likely risk: Postal errors Statistically 2% of all postal deliveries go missing. We understand that this is an unwelcome situation for our backer as well as ourselves. Additional eto decanters will be produced to ensure no one is left empty handed, and we will share advice on how you can help minimise this risk. \n\nLikely risk: customs + taxes \n\nYour eto will be sent from the UK. Therefore, there may be VAT, duties, or tax due on arrival in your country. These can range from 0% to 20% in the US and EU countries. \n\nLikely risk: Distance = time \n\nEvery eto will be posted to their backer on the same day. Therefore, if you are based in the UK or EU, you are likely to receive your eto earlier than if you reside in countries further afield such as the US.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "SUPPORTER -

I am so grateful to all of our backers and we're excited to come back to Kickstarter to share the all-new Third Edition with everyone. So let's get started!\nA Mini Museum is a handcrafted, limited edition collectible, designed to inspire learning and exploration. Every specimen in the Mini Museum is authentic, iconic, and labeled. \nLarge and Small Third Edition Mini Museums\nI've been collecting rare and fascinating objects for most of my life, ever since my father gave me my first specimens in 1977.\nFirst specimens from Malta and my father, Dr. J\u00f6rgen Fex (1924-2006)\nOver the years, I've been fortunate to meet many amazing people including scientists, museum curators, astronauts, and other adventurers. With their help, I've been able to assemble an incredible collection which I am now sharing with the world.\nThe full collection for the Third Edition of the Mini Museum contains 29 unique, carefully selected specimens. Each Mini Museum is artfully arranged, and encased in Lucite acrylic. As with our first two editions, this line-up of specimens will only be offered once.\nThe \"Large\" version of the Mini Museum measures 5\"x4\"x1\" and contains all 29 specimens in the Third Edition:\nLarge Third Edition Mini Museum (29 Specimens)\nThe \"Small\" version measures 4\"x3\"x1\" and contains 12 specimens:\nSmall Third Edition Mini Museum (12 Specimens)\nOf course, with a handmade product like the Mini Museum, there will always be variations. There may be tiny air bubbles, or a specimen may be shaped and sized differently. Specimens have also been known to shift or fragment slightly during acrylic casting. Such variations highlight the fact that each Mini Museum is handmade and absolutely unique.\nDetailed specimen descriptions can be found further down the page.\nIn addition to these amazing specimens, your Mini Museum will arrive in a handsome Display Box designed just for the Third Edition.  A Certificate of Authenticity will be included in the box and the Mini Museum will be protected by a custom, micro-fiber pouch. You'll also receive a special book with your Mini Museum which we call the Companion Guide.\nThe Mini Museum is an awesome collection to have and hold. To help you share the Mini Museum, we created a full-color book called the Mini Museum Companion Guide.\nPages from the New, Expanded Companion Guide\nFor the Third Edition, we're excited to announce that the Companion Guide will return to the hardbound version we used in the First Edition.  We've also expanded the content for each specimen to provide even more details. In many ways, this is our most ambitious project to date and we have so much to share!\nEvery specimen has its challenges and the Third Edition presented some of the most difficult situations we've ever faced.  Along the way we pushed ourselves further than ever before, creating miniature, handcrafted art pieces at a new level of detail.  I couldn't be happier with the way these amazing new specimens turned out.\nMacro image of the First Transatlantic Cable Specimen\nWith a full year of development behind us, we have so many amazing stories to share.  For example, in the underwater, time-lapse video below, we've compressed eight minutes of high-tech cutting time into just a few seconds. \nUsing high-energy, Electric Discharge Machining to create precise slices of a 14th century Samurai sword.\nThis is just one step in the lengthy process of creating the Samurai Sword specimen. This brief glimpse is just a sample of the effort and care we put into creating the Third Edition.\nAs with our last two projects, I'll cover many of the specimens in detailed project updates. From the incredible variation of life...\nThe many colors of the Dire Wolf Specimen\n ... to the unraveling of an Enigma.\nInterior of the WW II Enigma Rotor Specimen\nNew challenges and new friends...\nBaltimore Knife and Sword Smiths at work on the Viking Axe Specimen\n... not to mention incredible help from past Mini Museum backers!\nArchitectural work uncovering early 14th century Venice\nPutting together the Third Edition has been an epic adventure.  I can't wait to share it all with you! \nBirds of a Feather: Visiting the SR-71 at the National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center with the Third Edition SR-71 Specimen. Kind thanks to Layne Karafantis, PhD. and Curator of Modern Military Aircraft for allowing us to visit.\nBackers of our first two projects know how strongly I believe in Kickstarter. The support of this community is what's made the Mini Museum possible and allowed me to fulfill my life long dream of sharing my love of science and history with the world.\nMore than 10,000 Mini Museums shipped all over the world!\nTo me, this picture represents what Kickstarter is all about.  It's an honor to return once more to ask for your support for the Third Edition.  Thank you all so very much for taking time to learn more about our latest collection.  I hope you're as excited as I am to continue the journey.\nNow, it's back to work!\n- Hans Fex, Creator and Chief Curator of the Mini Museum\nSPACE GEMS (4,557,000,000 years old)\n\"On the basis of a modest conjecture, I have undertaken a dangerous journey. Yet, already I see the foothills of new lands.\" ~ Immanuel Kant, 1755 \"Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens\"\nCreated in the heart of an asteroid soon after the birth of the solar system, Pallasite Peridot is among the rarest and oldest gems. Pallasites are characterized by a unique matrix of the mineral Olivine embedded in solidified iron and nickel. This combination of two materials of contrasting densities is as surprising to science as it is beautiful to the eye.\nThe specimens in the Mini Museum are fragments of Peridot from the Jepara meteorite discovered in 2008 on the Indonesian island of Java. The original mass weighed 499.5 kg (1100 lbs) with a diameter of just 85 cm (33 in).\nOLDEST EARTH (4,374,000,000 years old)\n\"The only physical evidence from the earliest phases of Earth\u2019s evolution comes from zircons.\" ~ John Valley, Geoscientist\nZircons are quite common in the crust of Earth. They are shed through the process of erosion once igneous rocks reach the surface, at which point the zircons are incorporated into new sedimentary layers. In Western Australia, the rough, sedimentary layers of the Jack Hills formation contain the oldest zircons ever discovered. In addition to being the oldest known samples of Earth's crust, the zircons of the Jack Hills formation also contain water and the earliest suggestions of life in the form of biogenic carbon.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a small piece of the Jack Hills formation north of Perth in Western Australia. The specimen was purchased from Tom Kapitany of Crystal World and collected in accordance with Australia's cultural heritage and mining laws.\nGREAT OXYGENATION EVENT (3,020,000,000 years old)\n\"Whenever I feel blue, I start breathing again.\" ~ L. Frank Baum, author of the Wizard of Oz\nThe Great Oxygenation Event marks the buildup of oxygen in the Earth's early atmosphere. The evidence of this Great Oxygenation Event is found across the planet in the striking red, black, and silver colors of Banded Iron Formations.  With thousands of millimeter and submillimeter-thick layers, banded iron is the result of oxygen released in the early acidic seas by photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Lasting more than a billion years, this process resulted in the semi-permanent oxygenation of Earth's oceans.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the Mid Archean Pilbara supergroup formation located in Western Australia. The estimated age is of this group is over 3 billion years old. The specimen was recovered by Tom Kapitany of Crystal World in strict accordance with Australia's cultural resource protection legislation.\nOLDEST RIVER (Finke, 400,000,000 years old)\n\"How the river has worn its way through a basalt range half a mile thick and 1,000 feet high is a mystery.\" ~ Charles Chewing, Sources of the Finke River (1886)\nThe sinuous Finke River in Australia has mesmerized human beings for thousands of years. Aboriginal mythology ties the creation of the river's curves to the Rainbow Serpent which shaped the entire landscape of Australia after the Dreamtime when the world was flat and still. These wildly meandering curves cut deep into the mountains and hills of Central Australia. This suggests that the river must be even older than those hills which formed roughly 300-400 million years ago during a mountain-forming event known as the Alice Springs Orogeny.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the bed of the Finke River. The river was free flowing when Hans collected the small sample, which is an unusual occurrence. We are greatly indebted to Hank Ebes for the generosity of his time in introducing Hans to the natural beauty of Australia.\nJURASSIC TREE\n\"Araucaria was targeted as commonly available nutritious food source by many high-browsing megaherbivores.\" ~ J\u00fcrgen Hummel, Professor for Ruminant Nutrition, Georg-August-University G\u00f6ttingen\nOver the last 200 million years, the \"primitive\" look of the Araucaria hasn't changed much. Averaging 30-60 meters in height, these conifers feature straight, columnar trunks and branches covered in overlapping, scale-like leaves.\nIt should come as no surprise that scientists believe this conifer was a favorite food for long-necked sauropods.  Recent digestive studies suggest that Araucaria is capable of yielding a surprising amount of energy when fermented for long periods.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment of Araucaria from Queensland, Australia located in strata dating to the Jurassic. The specimen was purchased from Tom Kapitany of Crystal World. It was collected in accordance with Australia's cultural heritage and mining laws.\nCRINOID (170,000,000 years old)\n\"It was the Law of the Sea, they said. Civilization ends at the waterline. Beyond that, we all enter the food chain, and not always right at the top.\" ~ Hunter S. Thompson\nSometimes referred to as feather stars or sea lilies, crinoids are members of an extended and very ancient family of sea animals known as echinoderms. An integral part of the explosion of complex life during the Cambrian Period, the symmetry of the crinoid's body plan is fascinating and beautiful.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the center of a crinoid stem, also known as a \"columnal\". It was recovered near Talsint, Morocco. The fossil beds in this region are from the Bajocian Age of the Middle Jurassic Epoch.\nSPINOSAURUS (Spine)\n\"Spinosaurus appears to have been poorly adapted to bipedal terrestrial locomotion. The forward position of the center of mass may have enhanced balance during foot-propelled locomotion in water.\" ~ Nizar Ibrahim, Paleontologist, University of Chicago\nTopping out at just over 18m long (59ft), Spinosaurus is one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs ever discovered. This family of semi-aquatic theropods also happens to be among the most surprising creatures in the fossil record. In some species, the spines in the namesake sail measure more than 2 meters in length, providing the framework for an impressive structure that would rise high above the water.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the Kem Kem Beds in Morocco. During the Cretaceous Period, this region was part of a vast river system. In recent years members of the Spinosaurus family have been found in many parts of the world including Europe, South America, and even Australia.\nANKYLOSAURUS (Bone)\n\"The armor are bones that form within the skin, just like crocodiles.\" ~ Ken Carpenter, Director, USU Eastern Prehistoric Museum\nCovered in rows of bony plates and wielding a powerful clubbed tail, the Ankylosaurs are one of the most distinctive and successful of all dinosaur families. Spread across more than 90 million years of the fossil record, various species of this sturdy dinosaur can be found on every continent on earth.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from Ankylosaurus dermal plates recovered by paleontologists working on private land. Large and oval in shape, these scutes are consistent with the armor that protected the neck and shoulders of Ankylosaurus from the sharp teeth of predators.\nMOSASAUR (Jaw)\n\"A swift and powerful swimmer over short distances, the Mosasaur used surprise and the thrust of his muscular tail to outrun his prey with a short burst of speed.\" ~ Michael J. Everhart, Oceans of Kansas\nIf we look first to the sea, the Mesozoic Era might not be known as the Age of Dinosaurs, but rather as the Age of Marine Reptiles. Beginning with the appearance of the dolphin-shaped Ichthyosaurs in the Triassic Period, the rising seas of the Jurassic Period led to a wide variety of large predators including the long-necked plesiosaurs and pliosaurs to the powerful Mosasaurs.\nMosasaurs ranged in size from 1.1m (3.3ft) to 17.4m (57ft). Their skulls were flexible and their jaws were double-hinged. While this arrangement probably allowed a Mosasaur to swallow prey whole, the alignment of a Mosasaur's teeth with \"bony crypts\" to protect emerging teeth also suggests Mosasaurs likely crushed bones as frequently as they tore into flesh.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the muzzle of a juvenile Tylosaurus proriger. This species typically grew to a length of 15m (50ft). The specimen was collected on private land in Western Kansas.\nSAN ANDREAS FAULT\n\"Big earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault are inevitable, and by geologic standards extremely common.\" ~ Lucile M. Jones, USGS ShakeOut Scenario\nOn the morning of April 18th, 1906, a powerful earthquake woke the city of San Francisco at precisely 5:12AM. Fires resulting from the quake destroyed 80% of the city, killing more than 3,000 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. It was as violent an introduction as one could imagine to the presence of the 28 million year-old San Andreas Fault.\nDisconcerting as this may be, the 1906 quake is not the largest quake possible along the San Andreas or even the largest that's occurred in the past. All along the fault's 1300km (800mi) spine, we can see the history of two continental plates grinding past each other.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum was recovered from the Tejon Pass, where the interface between the North American and Pacific plates are directly exposed and easily accessible. Each specimen is comprised of parts of both plates.\nMEGALODON (Tooth)\n\"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" ~ Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, Jaws (1975)\nThe Megalodon shark dominated the oceans of the world for over 20 million years. Reaching sizes upwards of 18m (59ft) in length, the largest Megalodon jaw reconstruction measures 3.3m (11ft) across and 2.7m (9ft) tall. Computer models suggest that a full-grown Megalodon had the most powerful bite of any known animal in the fossil record, somewhere between 11 and 18 tonnes or 25,000-40,000 pounds. This epic jaw was also lined with enormous teeth - 46 in the front row, to be exact, with 5 more rows waiting behind.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the fossilized tooth enamel of a Megalodon shark. The teeth come from the coastal rivers of South Carolina, one of the most popular regions for hunting Megalodon teeth.\nMOLDAVITE (14,400,000 years old)\n\"It reminds one of the strange ring mountains of the Moon, and it is easy to think that the origins of these as well as of the Ries Basin are due to the same causes.\" ~ Ernest Werner (1904), the first to suggest Ries basin origin is not volcanic\nFor many years, a pastoral region of southern Germany was thought to be the remains of an ancient volcanic crater. Imagine the surprise when it was discovered that the the N\u00f6rdlingen Ries Basin was in fact an asteroid impact site some 14,400,000 years earlier.\nIn an instant, a 1.5km wide asteroid released 2.4\u00d710^21 joules - enough energy to power the entire modern human world for more than six years. This tremendous blast gouged out hundreds of cubic kilometers of material and created created a complex array of materials, from new metamorphic rocks studded with impact diamonds to stunning, green gems called Moldavite.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from Moldavites found in the Bohemia region of the western Czech Republic. 99% of all Moldavites come from this region.\nGIANT SLOTH (Claw)\n\"I will venture to refer to him by the name of the Great-Claw...\" ~ Thomas Jefferson (1799)\nOften known for their great claws and ungainly appearance, ground sloths were a very successful family of mammals. The largest species evolved during the Pliocene epoch in the midst of a period of great migration between North and South America. This \"Great American Interchange\" lasted millions of years, beginning with island hopping and peaking as animals crossed freely over the newly formed isthmus of Panama.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the tip of an Eremotherium claw, discovered on private land and partially restored by George Heslep. Eremotherium stood roughly 4m tall (20ft) and weighed 3,000 kilograms (6,600lbs).\nDIRE WOLF (Bone)\n\"Let me tell you something about wolves, child. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives.\" ~ George R.R. Martin, Song of Ice and Fire\nThe real dire wolf was one of the most successful predators of the late Pleistocene epoch. Ranging from Alaska to Bolivia, this muscular carnivore fed on a wide variety of large prey including bison, camels, horses, mastodons, and mammoths... even giant sloths!\nYet, despite the dire wolf's advantages in size and numbers, it disappeared along with many other large species at the end of the Pleistocene epoch. Most scientists believe that rapid climate change played a major role in this large scale extinction event, but it would be difficult to ignore the introduction of humans to the Americas as the two species often sought the same prey.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the partial remains of a dire wolf found in Florida on private land.\nEGYPTIAN PAPYRUS\n\"Before we leave Egypt we shall also describe the nature of papyrus, since our civilization or at all events our records depend very largely on the employment of paper.\" ~ Pliny the Elder\nIn ancient Egyptian cosmology, the world began as dry land emerged from the primeval waters. The darkness of the world was filled with light, and there in the marsh the papyrus grew. From this creation myth, the humble papyrus went on to serve as the symbol of life in Egypt. It rivaled linen as a chief commercial export and evidence suggests this writing material was in use for over 5,000 years.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a selection of fragmented papyri collected over many years by a German dealer of antiquities.\nVIKING AXE (10th Century)\n\"Never before has such terror appeared in Britain as we have now suffered from a pagan race...\" ~ Alcuin of York, on the first Viking raids of 793\nMore than 1200 years ago the Vikings left the fjords of modern Scandinavia and set out to sea. Today, nearly every country in Europe has a story to tell of the Viking expansion and a complex history of their many societies is slowly being rediscovered.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a set of Viking bearded axes dating to 900 CE. We worked closely with the blacksmiths of Baltimore Knife & Sword to prepare the material for inclusion.\nSAMURAI SWORD (14th Century)\n\"\u590f\u8349\u3084 \u5175\u3069\u3082\u304c \u5922\u306e\u8de1 - Summer grass... all that remains of warrior dreams.\" ~ Matsuo Bash\u014d (1644\u20131694)\nThe Japanese sword is a symbol of unparalleled beauty and quality. Bound closely to the image of the samurai class, the blades are highly prized and honored by collectors all over the world. The history of these incredible weapons and the warriors who wielded them are intimately connected to the development of the Japanese nation and the culture of modern Japan.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is comprised of two parts. The first is from a Ko-t\u014d period katana circa the mid-1300s. It is a single-forged blade attributed to the Yamato Senjuin School. The second piece is a late-Edo period Kamishimo, including a sleeveless jacket known as the Kataginu and the trousers known as the Hakama.\nThe blade was selected with the generous support of Pablo Kuntz. Pablo is the owner of Unique Japan, a respected dealer of Japanese swords worldwide. While lovely, the blade has a number of micro-fractures that made it unsuitable, and potentially dangerous, as a collectible. The Kamishimo was selected to compliment the sword and was acquired at auction.\nVENICE (14th Century)\n\"I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs; A palace and a prison on each hand...\" ~ Lord Byron, 1812\nThe City of Canals, the City of Bridges, the City of Masks... The city of Venice has been known by many names and ruled by many hands. Yet, despite its legendary history at the center of a long-lived republic, it is the ever-present Adriatic Sea which has defined the fortunes of Venice, and it is to those waters that the city may eventually return.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from an early 14th century paving brick uncovered in the Cannaregio sestiere during a recent renovation. The brick was acquired directly from the architectural firm performing the renovation. We are extremely grateful for the assistance of Mini Museum Backer N. Lugato in identifying and securing this specimen.\nROUGH OPAL (Australia)\n\"Opals combine brilliant qualities of the most valuable gems and, above all, defy description.\" ~ Pliny the Elder\nOpal forms in areas where water comes in contact with sandstone and filters deep into the Earth, picking up more silica along the way. This silica-rich solution settles into cracks, natural fractures in the rock, or even into fossilized organic material. Under intense heat and pressure, most of the water evaporates leaving the silica behind.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is opalized fossil plant material from Lightning Ridge in NSW, Australia. Australia is the largest producer of opals in the world. The opal fields here date to the Cretaceous when Central Australia was home to an enormous inland sea, known to science as the Eromanga Basin.\nFIRST TRANSATLANTIC CABLE\n\u201cWhat hath God wrought?\u201d ~ Samuel F.B. Morse, 1844\nTen years after Samuel F.B. Morse sent the first telegraph message in 1844, the world was hooked on the new form of rapid communication. Yet even with this breathtaking progress, overcoming the Atlantic Ocean seemed an impossible task. Nearly two thousand miles of open ocean separated the closest two points between Europe and North America, and the depth along the route often exceeded two miles. Spanning this enormous gap would require the will of a person of immense vision and grit, and perhaps even a touch of madness.\nOn August 4th, 1858, after already suffering one failed attempt to connect the line, entrepreneur Cyrus West Field and the USS Niagara reached Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, connecting the first Transatlantic Telegraph Cable. Within days, messages began flowing between the two continents at a rate never before imagined. The world had become smaller in what seemed like an instant.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a section of the original Transatlantic cable carried aboard the USS Niagara. After the completion of the first line, the remaining cable was purchased by Charles Tiffany with the intent of selling souvenirs commemorating the linking of both continents. Stored for over 100 years, several cases of finished cable sections were located and later sold by the the Smithsonian Institution in the 1970s.\nALCATRAZ\n\"It looks like Alcatraz has got me licked.\" ~ Gangster Al Capone\nInhospitable and inescapable, the legendary Federal Penitentiary on Alcatraz Island played host to some of the most notorious criminals of the 20th century. Originally conceived as a concentration program to manage the most difficult prisoners in the federal penal system, the isolated and harsh environment of \"The Rock\" became a symbol of cold, impersonal justice, earning the prison it's infamous nickname.\nToday, Alcatraz Island is a National Park visited by over 1 million people each year. The island is also home to a rapidly growing population of nesting colonial seabirds, including cormorants, snowy egrets, and black-crowned night herons. The specimen in the Mini Museum comes from concrete salvaged by the National Park Service during restoration of the site.\nWWII ENIGMA (Rotor)\n\"There was nothing to stop the German U-boats until Alan Turing managed to break naval Enigma. If that hadn\u2019t happened, Britain would have been starved and would have lost the war.\" ~ Cpt. Raymond C. Roberts, Bletchley Park Codebreaker\nIn times of war, the struggle for information often means the difference between winning and losing. Yet few efforts to conceal and reveal information reached the scale or importance of the puzzle which surrounded the German Enigma during World War II.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the remains of several ruined, military-grade Enigma rotors. Each individual specimen contains fragments from the key components of the rotor, including: the notched \"thumbwheel\", the alphabet ring, and the core of the rotor which contained the wiring and contacts that enabled the system to function.\nFORDITE (Motor Agate)\n\"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants as long as it is black.\" ~ Henry Ford, 1909\nThe bright, jewel-like layers of Fordite are comprised of thousands of layers of automobile paint. Drop by drop, each layer represents a different vehicle as it passed through the paint booth in the factory. Heated to hundreds of degrees, the layers fused together to form one of the most beautiful and completely accidental man-made composites.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from the Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo, Missouri. The plant opened in 1951 and since 1957 the 4,700,000-square-foot facility has been home to ten generations of F-Series Pickup Truck production, as well as many other vehicles.\nTHE BEATLES (Cavern Club)\n\"The Cavern... Do I have memories of the Cavern? Do I? Oh yeah.\" ~ Paul McCartney\nBefore The Beatles played for millions of viewers on The Ed Sullivan Show, the Lads from Liverpool put in thousands of hours in clubs and lounges across the UK, Germany, Sweden, and France. Yet few venues can be so closely associated with the earliest days of the Beatles as the original Cavern Club in Liverpool, England.\nFrom 1961 to 1963, the Fab Four played 292 shows in the Cavern Club. The club was demolished in 1973, but the bricks were saved. In 1983, a selection of bricks were auctioned for charity and the remaining bricks were used in the rebuilding of the Cavern Club on the original site. The specimen in the Mini Museum comes from one of those original bricks, purchased at auction.\nSR-71 (Blackbird)\n\u201cNothing had prepared me to fly that fast\u2026\u201d ~ Air Force Colonel Jim Wadkins\nThe SR-71 was built for speed and stealth. Setting records as the world's fastest manned aircraft, the SR-71 easily cruised at more than three times the speed of sound. \nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a fragment of a \"turkey feather\" from SR-71 61-7972. It was purchased from Daniel Freeman, Supervisor and Chief of Metals Technology for the 9th Reconnaissance Wing I.\nThe turkey feathers are overlapping flaps which surrounded the exhaust of the SR-71. Opening and closing according to the pressure output of the afterburner, they are considered one of the hardest working parts of the aircraft. SR-71 61-7972 was retired in 1990 and is currently on display in the Smithsonian's Air & Space collection at the Udvar-Hazy Center just outside Washington, D.C. During the delivery flight from Los Angeles, the aircraft flew coast to coast in just 67 minutes.\nPEL\u00c9 (Soccer ball)\n\"I close my eyes, and I can still see my first soccer ball.\" ~ Pel\u00e9\nLike many Brazilians, Edson Arantes do Nascimento has been known by many names. He was called \"Dico\" by his family and \"Gasolina\" because he was so fast, but the one name that really stuck was Pel\u00e9. The name Pel\u00e9 has no actual meaning in Portuguese, but the life of the greatest soccer player of all time has been anything but meaningless.\nFollowing the incredible early success of winning the 1958 World Cup, Pel\u00e9 went on to score 1283 career goals and played on two more winning World Cup teams (1962, 1970). Those who met him on the field used words like \"flawless\" and \"magical\", sowing seeds for the legend that would lead to yet another nickname - \"The King\".\nSince retiring from play, Pel\u00e9 has travelled the world promoting soccer and serving as an inspiration for millions of people. His lasting legacy is one of peace and sportsmanship.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a vintage leather football owned by Pel\u00e9 and acquired by auction in London. This personal auction was the most lucrative sale of football memorabilia in history.\nCHARLES & DIANA (Royal Wedding Cake)\n\"Only do what your heart tells you.\" ~ Princess Diana\nThe marriage of HRH Charles Windsor, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer was an international sensation. Watched by an estimated 750,000,000 people around the world.\nYet what seemed to the world like a beautiful story would become much more complicated as the years passed until their divorce in 1996.  Just one year later, on August 31st, 1997, Lady Diana died in a car crash while fleeing the paparazzi in Paris. On September 6th, 1997, more than 2,500,000,000 people watched the funeral held at Westminster Abbey. Diana was just 36 years-old.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a piece of the royal wedding cake, a traditional fruit cake with cream cheese frosting. The layers of the official cake took 14 weeks to prepare including an identical twin held in emergency reserve. For display, each cake was sliced and placed into individual monogrammed boxes. These prepared slices were then placed into larger, hand-painted boxes and finished with sugar paste icing to form the decorated layers of the cake.\nSTEVE JOBS (Turtleneck)\n\"I want to put a ding in the universe.\" ~ Steve Jobs\nBeginning life as the adopted son of working-class parents, Steve Jobs rose to the height of global business. His companies revolutionized several different industries and his countercultural vision reshaped much of the modern technological world.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum is a swatch of fabric from a black mock turtleneck owned by Steve Jobs. One of the earliest examples of what would eventually become Steve's trademark style, this turtleneck was worn by Steve at the 1991 PC Forum gathering. The turtleneck was sold by his personal assistant and purchased at a public auction.\nSPACE STATION MIR (Cosmonaut Food)\n\"Looking into the station I could see a lone ray of light shining through the port widow and outlining the dining table. It was the only time Mir looked warm, inviting, and spacious.\" ~ Jerry Linenger, NASA Astronaut on his arrival at Mir\nOften considered the world's first successful community in space, the space station Mir (\u041c\u0438\u0440) operated in low earth orbit from February 20th, 1986 until final reentry on March 23rd, 2001.\nThe specimen in the Mini Museum comes from a selection of mission flown food prepared for the space station Mir. The menu includes items from both Roskosmos and NASA, including pork goulash, sausage, bread rolls, rice, tinned salmon, and hot cocoa. Each Mini Museum contains a \"complete meal\", with two dishes (carbohydrate and protein) along with a serving of hot cocoa.\nThank you so very much for taking the time to learn about the Third Edition of the Mini Museum!

A journey through our entire galaxy, the Milkey Way, would last 120.000 years...with the speed of light! and it contains of 300 billion stars. A journey to our nearest neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy, would last around 2.5 million years with that speed. And there we are, at the first tiny dot, next to our own tiny dot in the center of this very sphere. If you add the next 100 000 Galaxies you can see the structure of Laniakea, our home supercluster. Laniakea is around 160 megaparsec in size and of cause surrounded by even larger structures.\nThe diameter of the cloud of galaxies in the sphere is around 250 megaparsec (Mpc). One Parsec is equal to 3.2616 lightyears, which means, that the cloud is 815.400.000 lightyears in diameter. 815 million years of travel, with the speed of light, captured in an 8cm glass sphere. \nWith all these information, this sphere convinced me, that we can\u00b4t be alone in the universe. \nHow is it made?\nI took a katalogue of galaxies and chose every galaxy in a radius of 125 Mpc. I converted the data and found a company, which was able to laser these 675 758 galaxies into a glass sphere. Some galaxies were to close to each other, so they merged together. There are in total 380 000 dots in this 8cm (3.14\") sphere and it weights 0,8Kg (1,76lb). The inner structure reflects light, so it looks really nice, if you put it on an LED, but it is also really good to see without an extra light. The brightness changes with the perspective, so you can spend hours looking into the Sphere. It comes in a black gift box with black velvet inside.\nPLAY\n\nUniverse Sphere in it\u00b4s box.\nExtension:\nThese are some pictures of the Sphere on the polyamid bases on the LED-Base Plate.\n\"LED fitting Base\" on the \"LED Base Plate\"\nI finished the first bases you could buy as an extension. They will be 3D-printed in different colors and materials such as polyamid, steel and some precious metals like pure silver and gold coated brass.\nPLAY\n\nHexagonal Grid Base, Pure Silver\nHexagonas Base, Black Plastic\nRound Base, Black Plastic\nMy Motivation:\nThe idea of the Universe Sphere came to me, after I was watching the video \"the power of ten\" and the more recent video \"a cosmic voyage\".It showes how incredibly huge our observable universe is and I wanted to see the structure of our universe in 3D with my bare eyes. So I decided to create a more concrete view of it, by lasering this tremendous structure in a glass sphere. I was so impressed by what came out of that, that I decided to make it available for all the universe-loving people outside, who try to understand the gigantic dimension of the place we exist in. To make it affordable, I need to order a large amount of Spheres and for that...I need your help!  \nYou can watch the clip \"A Cosmic Voyage\" on youtube and I promise, it is mindblowing.\nDeutsch:\nZu der Struktur im Inneren:\nJeder gelaserte Punkt entspricht nicht nur einem Stern, sondern einer ganzen Galaxie mit milliarden von Sternen. Eine Reise durch unsere eigene Galaxie, der Milchstra\u00dfe, w\u00fcrde 120.000 Jahre dauern, mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit! Sie besteht aus ca. 300 milliarden Sternen. F\u00fcr eine Reise zu unserer Nachbargalaxie, der Andromeda Galaxie, w\u00fcrden 2,5 millionen Jahre ben\u00f6tigt. Und da w\u00e4ren wir nun bei dem n\u00e4chsten kleinen Punkt neben unserem kleinen Punkt angekommen. F\u00fcgt man diesen beiden Galaxien noch weitere 100 000 hinzu, erkennt man den Laniakea Supercluster, der wiederum von weiteren noch gr\u00f6\u00dferen Strukturen umgeben ist.\nDer Durchmesser der Punktewolke entspricht ca. 250 Megaparsec (Mpc). Ein Parsec entspricht 3,2616 Lichtjahren, was bedeutet, dass die Wolke einen Durchmesser von ca.815.400.000 Lichtjahren hat. Diese unvorstellbar gro\u00dfe Struktur, in der es 815 millionen Jahre dauern w\u00fcrde, mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit von einem Ende zum anderen Ende zu fliegen und in der 380.000 Punkte enthalten sind, kann man jetzt in einer 8cm gro\u00dfen Glaskugel in seiner eigenen Hand halten. \nDiese unvorstellbaren Mengen an Galaxien mit jeweils Millionen von Sternen, haben mir gezeigt, dass wir nicht alleine im Universum sein k\u00f6nnen.\nWie wird sie gefertigt:\nIch habe aus einem Galaxienkatalog alle Galaxien in einem Umkreis von 125 Mpc ausgew\u00e4hlt und diese so umgewandelt, dass eine Firma sie in eine Glasskugel lasern konnte. Aus 675 758 Galaxien wurden 380 000 Punkte, da einige f\u00fcr den Laser schlichtweg zu nah aneinander lagen. Die Kugel misst 8cm im Durchmesser,  wiegt ca. 800gramm und wird in einer schwarzen Geschenkbox geliefert. Die Struktur im inneren reflektiert Licht, sodass sie von verschiedenen Perspektiven unterschiedlich hell wirkt. Man k\u00f6nnte sie gut auf einen beleuchteten Sockel stellen aber auch ohne Lichtquelle sieht sie fantastisch aus, sodass man Stundenlang ins Innere der Kugel starren kann.\nErweiterung:\nMomentan arbeite ich an 3D-gedruckten Sockeln f\u00fcr die Kugeln, die ich freischalten m\u00f6chte, sobald das Projekt sein Finanzierungsziel erreicht hat.\nMeine Motivation:\nDie Idee der Universe Sphere kam mir, nachdem ich das Video \"a cosmic voyage\" auf Youtube gesehen habe. Es zeigt, wie unglaublich gro\u00df das beobachtbare Universum ist und in was f\u00fcr einer fantastischen Struktur die Galaxien angeordnet sind. Diese Struktur wollte ich gerne mit blo\u00dfen Augen in 3D sehen k\u00f6nnen. Daraufhin habe ich recherchiert, woher ich die Koordinaten der Galaxien bekommen kann, wie ich diese umwandele und letztenendes habe ich eine Firma gefunden, die mit meinen Daten eine Glasskugel lasern konnte. Das Ergebnis war so erstaunlich, dass ich mich entschieden habe, mein erstes Kickstarter Projekt zu starten. Um den Preis der Kugel von \u00fcber 90\u20ac auf unter 50\u20ac zu bekommen muss ich allerdings eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Menge bestellen.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Up to 9 Spheres", "descp": "In this Reward you can pledge for up to 9 Spheres.

Whatever it was, we found ourselves putting hot sauce on everything.\nThere's Sriracha for Asian cuisine, Cholula for everything south of the border, but what about Italian food? How about a legitimate hot sauce made for Italian food? BOOM. \"The Original Italian Hot Sauce\" was born.\nWe've spent the last few years perfecting our recipe and jumping through all the necessary hoops to get Italian Hot Sauce ready for market. It's too great an idea and too damn delicious not to share with the world. So, here we are! With your help, we can get The Original Italian Hot Sauce burnin' bright!\nOur one of a kind recipe is handcrafted using gorgeous Calabrian chiles, imported straight from the source in Southern Italy. These red beauties are aged on the vine to ensure a rich and earthy flavor with a medium-spicy heat. We add a hint of garlic and herb to create the perfect hot sauce for pizza, subs, and all things Italian food.\nPacked with a unique, bold flavor and just the right amount of spice, our hot sauce is the perfect addition to any Italian dish. Buon appetito piccante!\nOur ultimate goal is to bring Italian Hot Sauce to every table across America. Your generous pledge will considerably allow us to:\nImport Calabrian chiles directly from Southern Italy in abundant quantities.\nOrder bottles, equipment, and ingredients for larger scale productions.\nProduce thousands of bottles of Italian Hot Sauce for commercial sale.\nDevelop an impressive online presence and social following.\nPresent and contribute to trade shows, local festivals, stores, and restaurants.\nThank you for helping our dreams become a reality! It's been quite an adventure, and we're so excited to share this journey with you.

The game takes a few minutes to learn, it's kid-friendly, and each round takes about 20 minutes to play.\n(Stretch Goals here!)\n    THE ORIGIN STORY\n                                   I\u2019ve always wanted to make a card game. A few years ago, I started working on a game based on my comic, The Oatmeal, where you connect heads, torsos, arms, and legs to create a variety of monsters based on characters from my comic, such as the Bear-O-Dactyl. The original version of this game was doodled onto paper cutouts, and had no functioning game mechanic other than \u201cbuild funny-looking things.\u201d \nThe very first version of the Oatmeal card game.\nTwo years ago I met Elan Lee, and he showed me a prototype of a game called \u201cBombSquad,\u201d which we renamed to Exploding Kittens. After Exploding Kittens launched, my creature-building game got put on hold.\nAfter the dust from Exploding Kittens eventually settled, I asked Elan to help with the design of my monster-building game. I didn\u2019t want this to be one of those games where you're trying to \"out-comedy\" one another; I wanted it to be more of a deck-building game, such as Dominion or Hearthstone, but without all the complexity. I wanted a monster-building game you could easily play at a party.\n Up until this point, my version of the game had a big problem:  when you played, you were on autopilot. You had no decisions to make and usually one correct action to perform on every turn.  Elan has been designing physical and digital games for most of his career (he invented the genre of alternate reality games, and was formerly the creative director of the Xbox), so he put his gargantuan puzzle-solving brain to work and added a layer of much-needed complexity to the game.  He tinkered a bunch and established the basic rules of conflict, construction, and the escalation mechanic that would define the core gameplay. The tricky part was keeping this simple enough to be a party game, but complicated enough to allow for depth and strategy. It\u2019s easy to fall into two bad categories when designing tabletop games: either they\u2019re easy to learn but completely random, or they\u2019re very strategic but mind-numbingly boring. You have to walk a very thin line between the two. I think with Bears vs Babies we did that.\nOur battle-hardened \"Sharpie Deck\"\nAfter months of pestering everyone we knew to play the game with us and tweaking the rules bit by bit, we finally got it to the point where our friends pestered us to play, instead of vice versa. And that eventually brought us here, to Kickstarter, where we\u2019re now pestering the whole internet to play with us.\nAnd so here we are. \nLet the bear hugs and baby burping begin.\n-Matt and Elan\n----------\n   ----------\n                                                                                 Press Inquiries\nEmail: info@bearsvsbabies.com\n----------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRemember that one time two years ago when we built Exploding Kittens and shipped everything we promised to you ON TIME?\n\nSeems like a pretty keen idea to try that again.

We just applied this version on our demo unit to monitor our Kickstrarter Project Page and it works like a charm.\nThanks everybody for your enthusiastic support. Thumbs Up!!!\nLike-o-Meter\nAre you always checking your smartphone to check for new Facebook page likes? Us too. That's why we've created a physical object, in the real world, that tells us - and everyone else - when a page gets a new like.\nLike-o-Meter in action!\nThe Like-o-Meter is the one and only 3D version of the iconic Facebook like button. It's constructed of high quality plastic that can take a beating. Connect it to your wireless network, and in just a few easy steps you can hook it up to your Facebook page. Then, every time your page gets a new like, you'll instantly get a new thumbs up. Way to go!\nAnd that's just the beginning. If we meet our stretch goals, the Like-o-Meter will have even more features, like lights, customizable sounds and a battery. Check out our stretch goals below.\nOrigin Story\nAfter more than 15 years of working in the digital world, we wanted to make the virtual become reality. And our 3D printer was able to make that happen.\nWith the combined forces of social media managers, designers and coders, we embraced this challenge.\nAt the very beginning, we started with some some electronic cooking: simple wiring on a breadboard. The servo was programmed to move a small flag for every like. We had our electronic prototype, with the right code and wiring, but something was missing. So we engaged our creative team to come up with the right design.\nThe Making of the Like-o-Meter\nMonths of arts and crafts later and we had the first paper and glue prototype. Then it was time for the Computer-Aided Design: looking at each part and how it would work, how each piece would be manufactured and how it would all be put together. Finally, the prototype was ready to be revealed to the world.\nWhere We Are\nWhat we have:\nworking and tested code for the Like-o-Meter\nCAD design ready for injection-moulding production\nelectronic mainboard design ready for production\nLike-o-Meter Timeline\nWhat we need:\nthe numbers to enable injection-moulding\nyour enthusiastic support to refine the project as we move ahead\nRewards\nIt's easy. Every kickstarter will receive their very own Like-o-Meter in a stylish cardboard box. The only difference between rewards is based on how fast you participated in our campaign.\nLike-o-Meter Rewards\n\u20ac10 - Super Early Bird: 10 Like-o-Meters available\n\u20ac15 - Early Bird: 100 Like-o-Meters available\n\u20ac20 - One Like-o-Meter\n\u20ac1000 - Special corporate holiday gift: 100 Like-o-Meters with your brand in a customized and personalized box, delivered to you before 10th December 2016\nStretch Goals\nWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going. We\u2019ve set up a few stretch goals we\u2019ll be able to meet as volumes increase.\n\u20ac20,000 - We\u2019ll add a WRGB light onto the Like-o-Meter which can be configured in terms of color, duration and lightning pattern. The thumb will trigger the light when you receive a new like\n\u20ac40,000 - We\u2019ll also add a voice to the Like-o-Meter. From the configuration panel accessible from your smartphone, you can upload an audio file that will play for every like received\n\u20ac100,000 - The Like-o-Meter goes wild with this battery upgrade. The USB cable will act as a recharger for the internal battery, ensuring hundred of wireless thumbs ups\nIf we meet these goals, you\u2019ll receive an enhanced version of the Like-o-Meter.\nLike-o-Meter Stretch Goals\nWhat? What if we exceed the \u20ac100K goal too? Thank you, you\u2019re all the best!

Alchema brings the joy of craft cider to you and your loved ones. You pick the ingredients, and let Alchema take care of the rest!   \n    With Alchema, you can create your own flavor of craft cider or mead within 2 weeks. You can also make wine with Alchema with your own resource of wine grapes and age it for longer.\n        Fermentation is a natural process where yeast transforms sugar into alcohol. Alchema simplifies the homebrew hassle by helping you enjoy your own craft cider in just 3 easy steps: \n    1. Choose a recipe on the app: Browse through our online recipe database and gather the necessary ingredients, including fruit, sugar, and water.\n2. Add ingredients- fruit, sugar, water: Each recipe indicates which kind and how much yeast to add. As you are adding each ingredient, Alchema will weigh the ingredients and let you know (through the app) when it's enough.\n3. Add a yeast packet: Yeast is essential for fermentation to take place. The recipe will tell you which yeast will work best for the kind of cider you're making. For example, you need different yeast to make your cider still or bubbly. Buy additional yeast from the Alchema site or from local homebrew stores. Included in each 3-pack of yeast: 1 packet for sparkling cider, 1 for fruitier concoctions, and 1 for recipes with a stronger alcohol content.\nThat's it! A batch of cider typically takes about 1-2 weeks to ferment, depending on the fruit and recipe. Alchema will notify you when it\u2019s ready.\nHere's a demo video of Alchema in action:\n   The reason why passionate homebrew beginners often fail at their first batch is often due to contamination, which causes a bad taste. Alchema is equipped with medical grade UV-C LED light that sanitizes the container before starting the fermentation process. Additionally, the Alchema app allows the user to monitor all aspects of the fermentation process, eliminating the need to open the lid and check the batch. This eliminates another potential cause of contamination.\n      Check your fermentation status with just one tap!\nTo celebrate we reached $300K on Kickstarter, Alchema is now equipped with a \"progress indicator\" that tells you how much percentage your craft cider creation is finished. You can check it simply with ONE TAP on the Alchema device and the LED bar will light up. The more portion of the bar lights up, the closer you can enjoy your tasty cider!\n  Select and Follow a Recipe Select a recipe from the recipe collection.

Please support us by pre-ordering through one of the pledge/reward levels and become part of the craft making family!\nWe have designed especially for you, our backers, an elegant bottle opener and a cider glass:\nAlso, we will provide yeast packets along with the device. Each packet is for making one round of cider (0.6 gal, or 2.4 L). Included in each 3-pack of yeast packets: \n1 packet for sparkling cider\n1 for fruitier concoctions\n1 for recipes with a stronger alcohol content (up to 14% ABV)  \n              Click the picture to see our update!\n     Click the picture to see our update!\n    Click the picture to see our update!\n          We started creating Alchema in 2014 and have made three prototypes before the working sample you see now. With the working sample, we were selected by HAX, the world\u2019s first and largest hardware accelerator, to finally launch Alchema. With the help from HAX, we have been demoing our product at large retailers such as Target and Brookstone. We have been receiving great feedback and revising our product accordingly from people like you!

However, sometimes fitting in time to wash your sheets regularly can be a struggle. We have created a technologically advanced bedding range that offers all the advantages of bamboo lyocell fabric but with the added benefit of bamboo charcoal.\nThis miracle natural ingredient enables the sheets to remain fresh for longer. The excellent deodorising and bacteria fighting abilities mean you don't need to wash them as often. Save time, water and electricity! They also feel as soft and luxurious as silk, but at half the price. You will love these sheets and they will love you back.\nWhy You Want to Sleep With Bamboo Charcoal\nThis Is How Your New Favourite Bedding Looks\nWhat Is Bamboo Charcoal?\nBamboo charcoal is produced from burning organic bamboo at 800\u00b0C then grinding and filtering it into nano-sized powder. Organic bamboo charcoal is 100% safe to use in fabric and directly on our skin. In fact, bamboo charcoal has already been widely used with great success in beauty products, water filters, even foods and medicines! It eliminates odours, absorbs excess moisture and purifies water.\nWhat is Bamboo Lyocell?\nBamboo lyocell is a fabric that consists of fibre made from dissolving organic bamboo pulp. We are the FIRST company in the world to make 100% bamboo lyocell bedding. This fabric is superior to any other bamboo products on the market right now which uses the old fashioned viscose/rayon process. Lyocell fabrication process is the most sustainable fabrication process, using a closed-loop system. 99% of the organic solvent and water in the process is recycled and reused up to 200 times. This process has minimal environmental impact,  with economical use of both energy and water. Bamboo lyocell fabric is incredibly soft, silky and super breathable. \nBamboo Charcoal + Lyocell\nBamboo charcoal powder is added in the bamboo lyocell fabrication process to create the world's healthiest bedding fabric.\nWhy Organic Bamboo Charcoal Powder Works\nBamboo charcoal powder's ultra-fine structure contains millions of tiny gaps, which allows 1 gram of bamboo charcoal powder to cover a surface area of 600 square meters. This super porous structure of bamboo charcoal powder absorbs bacteria, unwanted odour and wicks away sweat up to 50% quicker than cotton. \nAccording to research, bamboo charcoal can absorb formaldehyde at a rate of 16% ~ 19.39%; as for benzene, the rate is 8.69% ~ 10.08%; as for toluene, the rate is 5.65% ~ 8.42%; ammonia with the rate of 22.73% ~ 30.65%; chloroform with the high rate of 40.68%. Bamboo Charcoal fiber also effectively decomposes the micro-organisms attached to its surface and in the air around it. According to ASTME2149 (The American Association for Testing and Materials) test method and standards, bamboo charcoal fiber has an antimicrobial rate of 84%.\nWe are giving your bedsheets additional anti-microbial properties by fusing bamboo lyocell fabric with bamboo charcoal. \nThe Most Sustainable Bedding Fabric to Date\nOrganic bamboo charcoal lyocell is a cruelty-free, vegan-friendly, 100% plant derived fabric that has all the softness and smoothness of silk or high count Egyptian cotton. It is also more sustainable and eco-friendly than any other new types of functional textiles such as silver ion fabric. \nBamboo fabric is 100% biodegradable, where as silver is either infused or woven directly into the fabric, it ends up in the landfill and then enters the water system at the end of the product cycle. Silver nanoparticles are antimicrobial because they release silver \u2018ions\u2019 \u2013 charged molecules of silver \u2013 which interfere with processes in living cells. As a result, they have the potential to damage ecologically important bacteria and other microorganisms in soils and aquatic environments, or to accumulate through food chains, which could damage the health of larger creatures including humans.\n  All our products are made with FSC-certified organic bamboo and pass the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 test to make sure no harmful substances remained in the products at the end of the manufacturing process.\nWe also work closely with our manufacturing partners to make sure all our products are ethically made. Our factory is certified by Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP), which is awarded based upon both internationally and nationally accepted humane workplace standards, safety, and ethical manufacturing regulations.\nLuxury For Less\nBy simplifying the traditional retail process and selling directly online to you, we eliminate brick-and-mortar expenses and retail markups and pass these savings onto you. \nSince we are manufacturing and delivering the product directly to you, we are pleased to offer these premium quality bedding to you at up to 43% less than the price of other luxury brands. We also offer FREE DELIVERY for all U.S. and Australia orders.\nSize & Design\nWe offer simple, elegant designs that will work in any home. Our designs feature neutral colours and patterns. We will email you after the campaign is completed to get your selections regarding bedding size, colour and pattern.\nInitially, solid Dove Grey will be available. If we reach our stretch goals, we will open additional patterns and colour options.\nDove Grey\nClose Up of The Fabric\nGrid Pattern and Additional Colours \nWhite Grid Pattern on Dove Grey\nIndigo\nU.S. Size: Twin, Full, Queen, King, Cali King\n Australian Size: Single, Double, Queen, King\nCare Instructions\nBamboo charcoal lyocell bedding is super easy to care for. Just machine wash cold separately and line dry or tumble dry low and you are all set to enjoy them and the long lasting freshness for years to come! We do not recommend using bleaches, as they are usually packed with toxic chemicals. Fabric softener is also not necessary with bamboo sheets \u2013 they are already super soft and will stay that way wash after wash.\nRewards\nWe offer pillow case, flat/top sheet and duvet cover separately so you can mix and match your bedding essentials.\nThe Sheet Set (with one fitted sheet and two pillow cases) is the starter kit to complete your bed. You can also add extra flat/top sheet and duvet cover for extra layers of comfort.\nAdd-ons and Adjusting Your Pledge\nIf you would like to add additional products to your pledge, simply add the price of the additional product to your current pledge amount. If you would like to change your reward selection altogether follow the steps below:\n1. Click the \"Manage\" button to adjust your pledge\n2. Click \"Change Your Pledge\" and select your desired reward tier.\n3. At the end of the campaign, we will contact all our backers to confirm your desired rewards and color and size choices at the end of the campaign to make sure you receive the correct items.\nFunding Goals & Stretch Goals\nWe are seeking to raise $30,000 to get our first production started. This unique bamboo charcoal fabric requires a minimum order quantity of 3000 meters to be custom-made. Since Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing proposition, we must hit $30,000 to begin production. \nWe also have three stretch goals, each requiring an additional $10,000 to cover the expenses of offering an expanded option. For each stretch goal we achieve, we will make the option of an additional pattern and colour available to all of our backers.\nWhat's Next?\nYour pledge will help fund the production of these amazing bamboo charcoal lyocell sheets from start to finish. We have everything lined up\u2013\u2013the prototypes have proved successful, our warehouse staff is trained and ready. All that's missing is you.\nWhy Ettitude\nEttitude is a sustainable lifestyle label offering high quality, modern, minimalistic bedding products. We believe that bedding should be healthy, good quality and affordable as we spend 1/3 of our lives in bed. We care about doing good from start to finish. So that's why we spend more than a year to create, test and perfect these bamboo charcoal lyocell sheets that start from organic plants, using a highly eco-friendly fabrication process and will completely biodegrade after they provide you with years of comfortable and healthy sleep!\nWhat Our Customers Say About Our Original Bamboo Sheets\nWhether you sleep solo or with your partner you can enjoy the most comfortable night's sleep with our organic bamboo sheets.

They've participated at every stage of the development process and have produced many prototypes leading to the final ones you see in our video and on this page.\n\nThis is our second crowdfunding project. Our first one reached more than double the target amount on Pozible.com (https://pozible.com/project/186143). It was delivered on time to rave reviews. We have done our best to make realistic projections of the amount of raw materials and the time needed to manufacture the sheets. Based on our past experience, we anticipate being able to fulfill orders within 10\u201312 weeks. But we\u2019d love our backers to surprise us by blowing our target out of the water. If order volumes exceed our wildest expectations, it might take slightly longer to fulfill orders.\n\nWe partnered with the right people, completed all sampling, and sourced the best fabrics, so we're confident to ship the \u201cperfect\u201d sheets that will exceed all your expectations.

From improving brain function to helping prevent a whole host of health issues, sleep is so important that when we think of wellness it really should be: diet, exercise, and sleep.\nBut sometimes the noises around you keep you up, sometimes your own mind won't let you rest, and sometimes your neighbor decides to cut down a tree before the sun comes up...\nSNOOZ is an acoustic white noise machine that helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. Using a proprietary fan in an acoustically optimized enclosure, SNOOZ produces peaceful white noise to help the world fade away so you can sleep.\nPlenty of new devices track sleep disturbances. SNOOZ ends them. Period.\nSNOOZ uses a real fan so you don't have to worry if it's going to sound real, because it is real.  \nDesigned with airflow simulations run on supercomputers, SNOOZ uses a proprietary fan to generate live, natural white noise that is adjustable and doesn't disturb the surrounding air.  \nNo looping tracks or low-quality speakers. Just the soothing sound of moving air.\nSNOOZ will be durable for traveling but a pouch will protect it from scratches or getting smudged by your sneakers that just spent a weekend walking around the city. \nDon't need it for travel? Use it to store all the coin you'll be saving from not running the box fan year round. We'll include one for every device.  \nWe think this could be a great addition for parents who'd like to use SNOOZ for their little ones!\nThe white light would be on an on/off toggle (with a button both on the device and within the app) so you won't ever have to use it if you don't want it. We'll never have an indicator light or any other undesired light coming from SNOOZ -- it's to help you sleep, after all (yes we're the kind of people who turn around the alarm clock in the hotel, too).\nIn a 2008 Consumer Reports analysis, 2,021 survey respondents found sound machines to be more helpful than over-the-counter drugs or supplements like Tylenol PM and Unisom (and almost as effective as prescription medication like Ambien and Lunesta). \nWhite noise works.\nAs a room gets quieter your hearing becomes more acute. One of the key reasons white noise is effective is that it reduces the delta between your baseline sound and containment noise so many disturbances aren't heard and the others sound much quieter (i.e. the \"startle factor\" is reduced).  \nSNOOZ literally smooths the bumps in the night.\nVolume is adjusted by rotating a stepless dial. SNOOZ can produce sound that ranges from the lightest stir to break up the stillness to the all-out roar of a renegade box fan.\nTone is adjusted with an easy twist of the outer shell. Rotate from a light fan sound (think table fan) to a deep fan drone (think airplane cabin) and everything in-between.\nA recessed channel on the bottom of SNOOZ keeps packing more organized when you're on the road. \nSometimes you're already comfortably in bed when you realize your neighbor is celebrating his 28th birthday for the fourth time.  \nSNOOZ works best when placed away from your bed so it can fill the room with sound. Use the app to turn up the volume without getting out of bed or set an automatic shutoff in case you only want to use it at the beginning of the night.\nNo need for earplugs. SNOOZ helps you tune out the world with the soothing sound of moving air.\nBetween annoyances like loud neighbors, city noise, and freeway traffic, it can be difficult to sleep on the road.\nAt just 2.5\" tall and a wrap to store the power cord, SNOOZ packs easily in a backpack or carry-on so you never have to be without a peaceful, room-filling cocoon of sound.\nNo more tiptoeing around the house! \nSNOOZ masks sounds to decrease arousal stimuli (e.g. the \"there's no way that just woke up the baby\" sneeze).\nAnd it's particularly great for the \"fourth trimester.\" In a randomized trial of newborn babies, researchers found that babies were 25-80% more likely to fall asleep when exposed to white noise.\nBut the sound level needs to be safe.\nA 2014 study by the University of Toronto (covered by The New York Times) looked at 14 popular infant sleep machines and found that all of them were capable of producing sound levels that exceeded the limits set for hospital nurseries.\nEvery single one.\nTo address this, SNOOZ is the first white noise machine to be accompanied by a nursery calibration feature to make sure the sound level is safe for your little one. Simply place your phone in the bed or crib to measure the sound level your child will hear and adjust SNOOZ until the volume is safe.\nSNOOZ uses an ultra-efficient brushless DC motor so it uses the energy equivalent of a 12W LED bulb. That means the annual power consumption of SNOOZ is 98% less than that of a box fan.\nNo more pointing a fan at the wall in the winter.\nIt all started when we noticed several parents using fans to help their children sleep. But it wasn't for the breeze, it was for the sound.\nFour hundred seventy hours of computer simulation, 8 months of product design, and 29 lbs of 3D printer filament later, SNOOZ became a reality.\nTechnically speaking, our goal with SNOOZ was to create broadband turbulence sound and filter the sound with an adjustable acoustic enclosure (i.e. it needed to sound good). \nUnfortunately, this is an obscure area of acoustics (one for which there is almost no literature at all). Unable to rely on established engineering principles, we logged almost 500 hours of computer simulations using computational fluid dynamic methods to understand the salient features of airflow and sound generation.\nAfter engineering the acoustics, we teamed up with the experienced design team at Herbst Produkt in Santa Cruz, CA to make SNOOZ beautiful. Faced with significant airflow constraints, Herbst worked to ensure that SNOOZ was adjustable, portable, and that it maintained the acoustic properties of early prototypes.\nThough computer simulations brought us a long way, a ton of of trial and error remained. Starting with CD spindles and quickly moving to a Makerbot Replicator 2, we ended up printing most of our prototype parts on industrial SLA, SLS, FDM, and PolyJet 3D printers to test each of our designs in the real world. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe can\u2019t wait to deliver SNOOZ but there are inherent challenges in building hardware. Though we've been methodical in our design process, have built and tested prototypes for three years, and believe our timeline is realistic, we won\u2019t ship SNOOZ until it meets our high quality standards. \n\nTo help us build SNOOZ, we've teamed up with an experienced product design firm in Santa Cruz, CA, worked with one of the world\u2019s leading brushless motor manufacturers, and have a talented team of advisors across the U.S. who have experience bringing hardware products from the idea stage to market success.\n\nFurther, this area of sound engineering is obscure, but our team has extensive experience in aerodynamics and acoustics, and has developed the design for SNOOZ through the use of computational fluid mechanics. The design has been repeatedly prototyped and iterated upon with rigorous testing and feedback from alpha testers.\n\nWe\u2019re building SNOOZ because we want to be its first customers.

At Blissett Textile customers can design and print their own fabric for home furnishings, apparel and craft projects. Traditional textile manufacturing which includes apparel, home furnishings and upholstery requires large bulk orders and long lead times. With the innovation of digital printing, independent designers and small retailers can have access to high quality textiles on demand. Digital printing is also better for the environment because it wastes less water, ink and fabric than traditional textile manufacturing. Blissett Textile prints on natural fabrics and uses environmentally-friendly water-based inks. Like much of the South, New Orleans has a long and rich history in textile manufacturing. Before outsourcing to China became popular, New Orleans was home to textile manufacturers like Blumenthal Print Works and apparel brands such as Wrangler and Lee jeans.The last few remaining companies left after Hurricane Katrina (read more). Blissett Textile is proud to be part of the growing post-Katrina entrepreneurial culture that is helping to recreate textile manufacturing in New Orleans.\nWHO ARE WE? \nBlissett Textile is led by a group of women who are passionate about design and committed to creating a sustainable model for environmentally-friendly textile manufacturing in New Orleans. Camilla Franklin is owner and chief designer for Blissett Textile. She has over 30 years of experience in textile design and manufacturing.Camilla loves the challenge of combining the originality of design with the advanced technology of digital printing. Jeanne Marquez is studio manager and designer. She is a native of New Orleans who returned after Hurricane Katrina to conduct surveys to preserve the unique architecture of New Orleans. Jeanne is inspired by color, light, pattern and all things New Orleans.  Katie Lerin Murphy is marketing manager and textile designer. Katie believes design works best when it\u2019s a part of our social and environmental fabric.\nWHY WE DO IT? \nIn order to create a sustainable model for domestic manufacturing, New Orleans-based companies need a dedicated pool of skilled workers. With the loss of textile jobs to overseas markets, there has been a lack of workforce development and training in this industry for decades.As a woman-owned company firmly rooted in the community, Blissett Textile decided to partner with local non-profits to train and employ low-skilled workers in textile manufacturing. Last year, we launched our first workforce training program with Hagar's House.Hagar's House is a sanctuary for women and children in New Orleans that provides temporary housing for families affected by domestic violence, substance abuse or homelessness. (www.hagarhousenola.org).In the first year of our partnership we trained a number of women to design and sew pillows using customized fabric from Blissett Textile.These pillows were sold at local boutiques and provided income to help residents transition to more stable housing.\nHOW CAN YOU HELP? \nGiven our early success, we want to train and employ more women through Hagar's House, but we need to expand our manufacturing capacity. We need $10,000 to purchase more sewing machines, finishing equipment and technology upgrades for our website to add online and fulfillment capacity for the products made by Hagar's House residents.\nWHAT IMPACT YOU WILL YOU HAVE? \n(1) New equipment to expand the manufacturing capacity of Blissett Textile, a New Orleans-based textile manufacturing company \n(2) Scale-up our workforce development program so that more women are trained to design and sew table linens, pillows and other products that will grow their personal income \n(3) Support the return of textile manufacturing to New Orleans by creating a ripple effect of more skilled workers to support the local industry\nHOW WILL WE SHOW OUR THANKS? \nEach supporter of our Kickstarter campaign will receive a special edition textile product handmade by a Hagar's House resident.

The biggest risk is that production will take longer than anticipated\u2014perhaps because a potentate gets into the production queue ahead of us.\n\nI promise that I won\u2019t stop working until all my sponsors receive their things-could-be-worse mugs.

From a hardware standpoint, the Silk Light shares a lot of similarities with previous LED bulbs, with the addition of a second bank of LEDS for color temperature flexibility. We are using a very reliable Zigbee SOC (System On Chip) and have a lot of experience working with this SOC already. \n\nOur greatest challenge is getting the firmware out of beta stage and ready for primetime. In addition to the firmware development, making it play nicely with the smartphone apps also represents a challenge. The level of scheduling control and the nClick functionality has never been done before in a smart bulb, mostly because of how complicated it makes the firmware design. We have beta firmware in place and working already, so we are confident in our ability to finalize the firmware and complete the app functionality.\n\nWe have a highly-experienced manufacturing partner lined up for production.
