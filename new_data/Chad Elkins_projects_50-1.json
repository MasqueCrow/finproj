Not with words, but with the grandiose knockers that adorn them. In Spanish colonial times, the knockers announced your occupation and your social status. Lions, lizards, sea creatures, and hands proclaimed the homes' occupants as Soldiers, Nobles, Fishermen, and the Clergy. The beautiful Door cards depict some of the most recognizable historic aldabas, brought to life through the art of Colombian artistJuan Vargas.\nAldabas is a puzzly tableau-builder in which you seek to fill your neighborhood with the most influential citizens. On each turn, you'll take actions to build your neighborhood or increase your wealth. Clever placement will unlock bonuses, but only if you build up your influence with the different professions wisely\u2026 it\u2019s not enough to merely win over a profession, you must also satisfy its conditions well, to really reap the rewards it has to offer! Each profession has different priorities, so make sure that you keep an eye on how to score best from the ones that you favor!\nThe Aldabas campaign will not have any Stretch Goals. The game will be produced at high quality from the start, and the game system is so tightly designed that added content of the sort that Kickstarter campaigns usually feature (new characters, scenarios, etc) are not really suitable. Aldabas stands strong as a finished project without the need to 'stretch' into anything beyond what we are presenting here.\nThere are a few Kickstarter Enhancements that will make the Kickstarter Edition of Aldabas more deluxe than the (still gorgeous) version that will go to retail. Scroll down below the Game Elements to see what is special in the Kickstarter Edition!\nGame play is simple. On your turn you will take two of the three available actions (either two different actions, or the same one twice):\n1) Gain two Coins. Take two coins from the supply into your purse.\nRunning low on cash? Having available currency is key to your long term plans.\n2) Buy a Door. There are five cards available for you to choose in the dock. The first two are free, then the remaining three increase in cost from one to three coins. Pick a card, pay its cost, and take it to hand.\nNew people come to Cartagena every day, and you must entice them to your neighborhood from the dock!\n3) Play a Door card to your block. You must follow the placement rules: No empty block spaces may be below or to the left of the new Door, and a Door can't go beside or above another Door of the same color.\nWhen you add a Door to your block, you can activate the Power of the new door, and the powers of the doors that are right next to it.\nHere we see the placed door gaining you three Coins from the supply, the red door to the left allows you to place a Coin from your supply onto a Door (increasing your influence there), and the Blue door below has an Ongoing Ability which doesn't activate right now.\nThe game will end in one of three ways:\nOne player completes their tableau (four cards wide by three cards high)\nThe coins in the supply run out\nThe deck is depleted and the dock cannot be completely filled\nThe triggering player finishes their turn, every other player gets one more turn, then the game ends and scoring begins. Coins in your vault are worth 2 points each. Some Doors award points directly. Having the most Influence overall will get you a reward. But the most important way to earn points is from the Professions. Each Profession rewards the player with the most Influence over it; you will resolve them one at a time. If you have the most Influence over a Profession, you'll benefit from its unique scoring method; second place gets a weaker version of the benefit.\nIn this example, you have the most Influence on Soldiers, so you win that category. The Soldier scoring condition says that you earn 3 points for each Noble card in your block; you have two Nobles, so you score 6 points!\nIf you are a more visual learner, check out this comprehensive How to Play video by Paul Marchbanks of The Dicey Review!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery campaign comes with its own challenges. We are confident that you will get a game that you\u2019ll love to play AND proudly display on your game shelf.\n\nThe art and mechanics for Aldabas are complete, so once this campaign ends, we'll be ready to submit print files.\n\nIt is always possible that delays occur while a game is coming to fruition. This can happen for various reasons such as manufacturing issues, freight delays, and even importing the games to the various regions of the world. Although we have budgeted a year to bring Aldabas to your doorstep, delays can change our timeline at various stages. Therefore this timeline is only an estimate. We are working to do everything we can to meet our goal of getting Aldabas to you by Apr 2022.\n\nWe will be using fulfillment partners from around the world so that we can ensure a fast and smooth operation. We have worked with many of these partners before, so we are optimistic that everything will go as planned. We have full faith that your games will be delivered to you safe and in a timely fashion.\n\nA note on our track record:\n\nSuccessful and timely fulfillment of 6 projects over 4 years including the following games: Unreal Estate, Pocket Ops, The Artemis Project, Endeavor: Age of Sail, Endangered, Endeavor: Age of Expansion. (Gorinto, Endangered: New Species, and The Belgian Beers Race are underway.)\n\nOUR REFUND POLICY\n\nWe will refund your pledge in full within 10 days of the campaign\u2019s end, including all fees. After that period, we will also refund your pledge, no questions asked, minus 15% cancellation fee, which represents all of the fees associated with the Kickstarter, our pledge manager, payment processing, and our work. This project is in USD and refunds will also be processed in USD, excluding applicable fees. No reward pledges will not be refunded. If you do not complete the pledge manager by our required deadline, you will not be eligible for a refund for any reason. The pledge manager will be open for sufficient time, and multiple reminders will be sent.\n\nWe want you to be happy! We promise to keep you in the loop every step of the way. If you have any questions, send us a direct message, email us at marc@grandgamersguild.com, or simply comment on the campaign.

Note that the Ant-Man and Wasp Stretch Goals can only be found in the standard retail Core Box.\nWe will be offering backers the option to choose 2-Wave Expedited Shipping for their pledges! By selecting this option, we will separate your pledge into two shipping Waves. The First Wave will contain only the Marvel United: X-Men Core Box (however many copies you get) and it is estimated to deliver around September 2021, about the same time as the Core Box goes to retail. Then, the Second Wave will contain everything else in your pledge, including the box of Stretch Goals and all Optional Buys, and it is estimated to deliver around May 2022. Of course, by separating the shipping, the total cost of 2 different shipments will be charged, so by selecting this option you should notice an increase in your shipping cost and VAT if applicable. The finals costs will be calculated on the Pledg.it Pledge Manager system, however estimates for both waves are listed under 'Shipping Information'. Backers who select Single Wave Shipping will get their full pledge in the estimated May 2022 delivery date.\nPlease take note that once the system launches they'll also have different deadlines to confirm the pledges, with the Expedited shipment having a much earlier deadline. After the deadline to confirm the Expedited shipment pledges, all pledges (and extra pledges) containing the First Wave Core Box will be locked and will no longer be editable. However, everything related to the Second Wave will be editable up until the Second Wave deadline. This means that backers that confirm a 2-Wave Expedited Shipping order will still be able to add/remove pledges/add-ons related to the Second Wave after the First Wave deadline.\nNote: 2-Wave Expedited Shipping will not be available to backers in the UK.\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our Pledg.it pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Mutant pledge, for a 1 or 2-wave shipment. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                          \u00a9 2021 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 48th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is May 2022, for single wave pledges, and for Expedited Shipment pledges, September 2021 and May 2022 for wave 1 and 2 respectively, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to the Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge in that system within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

The pledge manager will be open for sufficient time to complete it, and we will send several reminders as well. \nYou are new to Kickstarter and don't really know how it works? No worries, here is how you can participate and support our project:\n Create a Kickstarter account. It only takes a few clicks. \n Choose 1 of 3 pledge levels. The 3 pledge levels differentiate in the number of games you will receive and the price you will pay. See more under \"pledges\".\nIf we reach or exceed our funding goal at the end of our campaign, your credit card will be charged according to the pledge you have chosen. If we do not reach our goal, you will not be charged.\nSoon after the campaign ends we will reach out to you via email, so you can enter your shipping address, select the languages for your games and pay for shipping costs. The final shipping cost will be calculated then and may slightly vary from the estimate you see here.\nAs soon as we know how many games we need to produce for each language we will kick off production and will get the games in your hands as fast as we can. \nIf you want to sell Hidden Leader in your store you can check out this page and find the right contact person from the list of our publishing partners. During the Kickstarter campaign we don't offer any specific retailer pledges or deals.

Thanks for being here.\n\nKickstarter is not an online shop. Therefore, we want to make you aware of the inherent risks of crowdfunding. It is our goal to provide you with the best game possible and to create a satisfying product for you and us. Still, making a board game is a complex and time consuming task and especially when financing things over Kickstarter there is never a 100% certainty that all will turn out as we envision it right now. Therefore minor changes can happen until the game arrives at your door. Especially in these uncertain times we cannot guarantee that no delays will happen along the delivery line, but we promise to never compromise on quality.\n\nBy supporting us on Kickstarter you support the idea of the game and its artwork and we promise to reward you with a fun game. You can track our changes and work in progress by following us on Twitter or other social media sites and by having a look at our blog. We will always keep you up to date about any decisions or changes along the way and are always glad to hear your feedback.\n\nWe are well prepared for providing you with a game that you will love, for three reasons:\n\n1) We have finished all of our artwork already and secured all the rights for it. The game will come with the artwork you can see all over social media already. Only small changes in the visual design might happen. \n2) We have set our time tables well. We did extensive research and used our product management experience to estimate this process well. In the worst case scenario, we will rather delay the delivery before compromising on your game experience.\n3) Our manufacturer has an established track record in the board game industry and we carefully evaluate the quality of our prototypes. Also we are working with fulfillment companies and experiences localisation partners to ensure that they can handle the campaign easily.\n\nWe thank you for all your support.

We will make every effort to reduce and where possible eliminate or absorb your VAT and other tariffs while abiding by local government regulations and customs.\nWhat does it mean that TRANSMISSIONS is EXCLUSIVE to KICKSTARTER?\nTransmissions will likely never see retail, so everything you see here is currently exclusive to Kickstarter. In other words, we can make no guarantees this game will appear anywhere else for sale. Why? Because it's crowded out there! We currently have no distributors who will get the game to retailers. So if you don't back it here, you may not see it anywhere. Although we do hope at least a few brave retailers will back us for their store, and there may be some copies left after the campaign is over, there are no guarantees.

He also likes to make pictures of robots.\nTransmissions is a series of illustrations which attempt to examine feelings and emotion that might be difficult to express in other ways. What began in 2006 with a single painting has grown into a long-running personal project which now comprises over 200 images, published across seven volumes of Transmissions art books.

If this is your first Meeple Source Kickstarter project, welcome! And if it isn't, welcome back!\nThis is our 15th Kickstarter project, so it really means something when we say that this project includes the most exciting variety of game upgrades to date. We hope that you will pull up a chair, stay a while, and take this journey with us.\nThis is expected to be our only Kickstarter project in 2021, so we are giving you everything we've got! We have new upgrades for popular series like Scythe, Wingspan, and The West Kingdom Trilogy. We're adding beautiful pieces to our line of upgrades for Lords of Waterdeep, Pandemic, Carcassonne, Concordia, Caverna, Agricola, and Grand Austria Hotel. Hot new games are definitely represented here as well, with sets designed especially for Lost Ruins of Arnak, Obsession, Darwin's Journey, Creature Comforts, Hallertau, Bonfire, New York Zoo, Dominant Species: Marine, Tekhenu, and Tawantinsuyu. And that's not all! Isle of Cats, Taverns of Tiefenthal, Fields of Arle, Carpe Diem, Keyper, Keyflower: The Farmers, and Key Market, Dice Settlers, A Feast for Odin, Cat Lady, Clans of Caledonia, Wendake, Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, Reykholt, and Underwater Cities are all shown some massive love in this project!\nWith so many game upgrades offered in this project (and likely a few more to come along the way), we are offering some of our pledge levels in a different way than we have in the past. We are calling these first few upgrades \"Featured Pledge Levels\", and you can pledge for them by simply browsing the list of Kickstarter pledge levels and selecting it, just as you normally would with any Kickstarter project. If you scroll down further, you will get to the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which will be used for all of the other upgrades.\nAll of the other game upgrades, including partial sets (when shown as a project option), are being combined in the \"Additional Game Upgrades\" pledge level, which shows a cost of $1. You can/should still pledge for the combined amount for your desired game upgrades. Although different from the way we have done this in the past, we are hoping that a simplified format will make a project with as many options as this easier to navigate.\nIn Kickstarter, you will only choose one pledge level as your primary pledge, but it is certainly possible to pledge for multiple things here.  To do so, simply select one of the upgrades as your \"main pledge level\", then select \"add-ons\" for your other upgrade(s) you want as well. Additionally, there will be an intuitive process in BackerKit (the post-project order management and survey software we use) to handle the multiple upgrades and choices. You can take advantage of our flat-rate shipping offer by bundling an unlimited number of upgrades from this project with no additional shipping cost.\nThe popularity of flat-rate shipping cannot be understated, so that's what we're doing. The amount varies by country, but the shipping amount is fixed, no matter how many upgrades and add-ons you pledge for. The flat shipping rate within the United States is $7, and other countries have a flat rate of $9-$15.\nWe don't want anything to stand between you and these really fantastic game upgrades. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally. \nEven though inexpensive worldwide shipping is available for this project, if there are any import duties and/or fees owed at delivery, these are still your responsibility. This used to only rarely happen though, based on the declared value, size, and weight of packages of this kind. BUT, things are changing, at least in some countries. Read on...\nIf we are required to collect VAT for your order before the project ships, that cost will be collected in BackerKit (our chosen post-project management/fulfillment tool). This will almost certainly be necessary for UK backers (see more below), and likely EU backers as well. If at the point we need to collect the VAT for your shipment, you are unhappy with the amount or process, you will have the opportunity to cancel some or all of your pledge, but we will have to reduce the refund at that time by the amount of the non-refundable Kickstarter fees for your transaction. \n2021 has already seen huge changes in transit, tariffs, and international business. We are running this project in good faith, and will be transparent with what needs to happen to get you the fancy upgrades that you desire! :-) \nThere are also a number of countries that we are not able to ship to, due to known limitations and/or difficulty delivering successfully in the past. The list of countries that we CAN ship to are: United States, Canada, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Thailand. Other than the UK (see special circumstances below), if you don't live in one of these countries, pledging for this project will be difficult. Options that you may have are to combine your order with a friend who lives in a serviced country, or to use a US-based mail/package forwarding service. There are many out there, and some of our customers from around the world use them regularly. \nYou might be aware that we are not currently shipping to the UK on our website. We hope to change this soon, but Brexit-related changes to importing/exporting (at least for small companies such as ourselves) have proven maddening. Our distinct expectation is that it will be a thing of the past by the time we are fulfilling this project. Assuming so, we will have to collect the VAT for your pledge, and will file that on your behalf at that time (resulting in a seamless and fee-free delivery). But, if we are unable to accomplish this, we will refund 100% of your pledge (we will absorb the Kickstarter fees mentioned above, in this case). For a variety of reasons though, we would like you to make your pledge (no matter what it's for) as a $1 (+shipping) pledge in the \"UK Backers Only\" pledge level. We can sort everything else out with you individually in BackerKit afterward. We apologize for this admittedly wonky process, but our alternative was to exclude UK backers from the project, which we really didn't want to do.\nMeeple Source is a family owned and operated company from Orlando, FL. Siblings Chris and Cynthia Landon are the founders, and remain in primary operational roles today. If you ever stop by our booth at conventions (in a non-COVID year!), you'll see the whole Landon family helping out - along with some friends that are as close as family!\nThe artist for most of these upgrades is Jamie Noble Frier, who also designed our Wingspan birds, Raiders of the North Sea upgrades, Architects of the West Kingdom meeples, as well as a number of our other more recent upgrades! \nWe are also excited to offer a set of meeples by a guest artist for Darwin's Journey, Paolo Voto, who is the artist for the game itself!\nAt this point, you have almost surely seen some of our past work, or even own some yourself. Nonetheless, here are just a few of our beautiful upgrade kits from past projects, starting with our a few of our most recent upgrades...\nWingspan: Oceania Bird Meeples\nNectar Tokens for Wingspan: Oceania\nPaladins of the West Kingdom Meeples\nRaiders of the North Sea Meeples\nResources for Raiders of the North Sea\nTomesaga/Overlord Meeples for Viscounts of the West Kingdom", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for over nine years now, and other painted components longer than that. We are proud to say that we have a reputation for high quality pieces and great customer service.\n\nEven with the success of our 14 completed Kickstarter projects to date, we are still a very small, family-run company that takes great pride in taking care of our customers and their orders personally. We quality-control every meeple individually by hand and ship all orders in-house, and we also use a post-project management system (typically BackerKit) which helps keep everything orderly.\n\nIf you are one of our many repeat Kickstarter backers, you probably know that we are very straight-forward with regard to the progress of our projects, and will let you know if we encounter any delays. We did have an unfortunate technological hiccup with regard to Kickstarter emails/messages during the final phase of fulfillment of our last project, and can assure you that we will pay closer attention than ever, and won't have a lapse in response like we did at that time. \n\nWe believe that we have allotted enough time in the production and delivery schedule to account for the types of situations that could arise, but unexpected delays are still always possible. Our last few Kickstarter projects delivered early, and although this could occur again, we obviously can't promise that.\n\nMore than anything, we are committed to quality. Our past customers know that this is true, and our Kickstarter backers know that we offer a money-back guarantee on all pledges.

Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Meeple Source reserves the right to cancel any pledge, although we have never had to exercise this right in the past.\n\nAny VAT that Meeple Source is required to collect and remit on your behalf will be collected in BackerKit (the 3rd party pledge manager that we use) - it is not already built-in to the listed prices on Kickstarter that are applicable to all backers.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in BackerKit and the package is returned to us as undeliverable, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any selected add-ons.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in BackerKit and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason, Meeple Source will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nIf you do not log in to BackerKit and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. If you need more time to complete your BackerKit survey, you must contact us. Meeple Source reserves the right to deny or fulfill orders beyond these 8 weeks under our discretion. If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into the BackerKit system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge for this project.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email meeplesource@gmail.com for further information.

Shipping will be charged after the campaign ends, which will allow us to reduce the cost to backers should we find a more cost-effective shipping partner in a backer's region. Our pledge manager will use the shipping address to calculate and charge the shipping costs for the rewards. We have worked to offset this cost as much as possible and are offering a shipping discount to all backers.\nShipping has changed dramatically and has become extremely challenging in the last year. We are working with Quartermaster Logistics, OTX Logistics and SimplyVAT to make this experience as painless as possible for both our backers and us.  We are new to several of the shipping processes that we are undertaking, and we sincerely appreciate your patience throughout this journey.\nWe will prepay applicable duty/customs-related Import VAT taxes. Based on our previous campaigns, we anticipate that backers in one of the above regions will not have any Import VAT fees associated with receiving the reward package (e.g. clearance, customs, etc.).  Backers outside of the above regions, may experience customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees.\nIn compliance with the UK and EU laws, Sales VAT will be collected in our pledge manager for UK and EU backers. Sales VAT is not included in the shipping cost and will appear as a separate line item in the pledge manager.  Some regions require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, this should be kept in mind as one plans while backing this project.\nIf you are interested in carrying Long Shot: The Dice Game in your store, please let us know by using the contact form at perplext.com, found HERE.\n\n\\", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS & CHALLENGES\n\nPerplext, LLC is a game publishing company established in 2001 and 'Long Shot: The Dice Game' is Perplext's fourth KickStarter project.\n\nWe have carefully selected and developed this project to ensure that we are bringing the best gaming experience possible to the hobby. Though you are taking a risk by pledging, our commitment to backers, the product, and the game industry as a whole, is our outright full-time focus. That being said, images used for this Kickstarter, card counts, components, horse names, packaging and rules may be subject to change. \n\nWe have had very few issues with delivery timelines and product quality on previous projects. The estimated delivery date of 'Long Shot: The Dice Game' is February, 2022, however this is only an estimate. Delays outside of our control may occur due to production, manufacturing, shipping, and/or customs. The nature and logistics of international shipping may result in backers from different regions of the world receiving their rewards sooner than others. We appreciate your support and thank you sincerely for patience in advance of any potential snags in fulfillment. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this project, individuals agree to conduct all public interactions with our project, team and other backers, via Kickstarter, in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the ejection of the backer from the campaign and the cancellation of the corresponding pledge (with a full refund). Perplext reserves the right at any time and for any reason to cancel a pledge (with a full refund). \n\nBy pledging for a reward, the backer acknowledges that the final components and content are subject to change .If for any reason Perplext cannot fulfill a part of an order, we will provide a pro-rated refund for that portion of the reward. If a backer does not confirm the pledge in the Pledge Manager within 8 weeks of our email notification to \u2018confirm your pledge\u2019, the backer agrees that Perplext has fulfilled its obligation in full for payment or donations received. At our discretion, Perplext may refund the backer or ship the reward if contact is made to confirm the pledge outside the 8-week window.\n\nWe make every effort to ensure that rewards are shipped safely. Minor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. If a backer believes a reward has sustained more than minor cosmetic damage, immediately contact Perplext by sending images and informational context to info@perplext.com. We ask that backers in this scenario keep all packaging, including outer cartons, for future inspection. Perplext maintains sole discretion in determining \u201cmore than minor cosmetic damage.\u201d .\n\nIf Perplext ships to the address provided via our Pledge Manager and the package is returned as undeliverable, the backer will pay the full cost to ship the reward again to an updated address. If it is delivered to that address and the backer is unable to receive it, is no longer the occupant of the address, the backer will pay the full cost to ship the package to the updated address. If the package is lost or stolen after delivery, the backer will pay the full cost to ship the order again. Should the package be held in customs or by a government agency, the backer may be required to contact the agency directly for the package\u2019s release, as Perplext\u2019s ability to assist may be limited. \n\nPlease refrain from pledging if you do not accept these terms.

Neoprene Playmats to make any flat surface a quality gaming table.\n2. Premium Bags for taking several options to game night with great style and protection.\n2. Lightweight Bags as a smaller sized option, meant for quick trips or a short night with friends.\n4. 2021 Weekly Desk Calendar with 53 beautiful board game photos taken by members of the community.\nThe Playmat is a premium play surface designed with the help of over a thousand gamers who participated in surveys and provided insightful feedback.\nWhether you're a casual or diehard gamer, there's no doubt this will elevate gaming experiences for you and your friends and family, at home or on the go.\nBased on survey data, it will come in two sizes:\n 3 x 5 ft (91 x 152 cm)\n 3.5 x 5.5 ft (107 x 168 cm)\nThe smaller size will fit on 75% of your tables and the larger size will fit on 45% of your tables. These two options should be a good balance between fitting on as many tables as possible, while giving you as much room to play as possible.\nAs an added bonus, the small size will fit in the play area of our affordable and available-for-purchase Jasper Board Game Table, and the large size is the same size as the Jasper's dining topper.\nExtra Thick Padding\n         Our premium Playmat is 5mm thick, a noticeable improvement over typical 3mm options. This makes it closer to a real gaming table feel designed to elevate your tactile experience. It's not just a pretty backdrop.\nInset Edge Stitching\n         The edge stitching really takes the Playmat from basic material to a fine product. We've also made sure the stitching has a lower profile than the rest of the mat, so it won't catch cards if they slide to the edge.  \nNo-Slip Rubber Backing\n         Few things are worse than a board sliding across the table and pieces falling to the floor. We've tested this. Trust us. The Playmat won't be sliding anywhere.\nEvery Playmat will come with a carrying case specifically designed for it. We want it to go with you to a friend's house, a community game night, a con, or a weekend getaway.\nI'm always a little skeptical of \"gift-with-purchase\" items companies use to increase interest, so it was important this wasn't just a cheap add-on. We've made sure the quality of the case matches the quality of the mat. The Playmat slides into the case easily and the adjustable straps make it comfortable to carry. We bet you'll end up using it even more than you think!\nWhy do I need a board game bag, you ask? We agree you could use a small grocery bag or precariously bungee-cord a big stack of games together - but wouldn't you and your games feel much safer with something made exclusively for them?\nWhen we first launched these bags, we had no idea just how much you'd love them and how important they'd be. From going over to a friend's house or even traveling (yes, this will happen again!), having a durable and padded bag has saved countless boxes getting lost or ruined and pieces exploding all over the floor or car. Now, with a bunch of real-life product testing, the Premium Bag is even better with upgraded shoulder straps and limited-edition colors.\nDurable water resistant exterior with reinforced seams \nRubber feet\nHeavy padding on all six sides\nMultiple compartments\nTough metal zippers \nSeveral options for different carrying methods\nDifferent situations (or hand cramps) call for different transport methods, so your new Premium or Standard bag is built for several options.  You can wear it as a backpack, secure it to your luggage, or carry it the good old fashioned way. The backpack straps even hide under the luggage handle slip so that everything is tucked away when you aren't using them.\nPremium Bag Bonus: A removable shoulder strap with heavy-duty metal parts and a padded strap.\nOne of the most popular requests  was to add more colors and we definitely agreed, so here they are: Ruby Red and Fern Green. These are limited edition colors so if you like them, now's the time to get them!\nPlease note, Heather Blue bags are not available in Europe for this campaign.\nYou're only as good as your weakest link, so they say. And whoever \"they\" are, they're probably right.\nWhich is why we're adding all metal parts to the Premium Bag. Now, the weight capacity has increased and you can be certain that you'll be able to carry any ambitious packing list.\nPlus, doesn't metal just look way better, and well, more premium?\nMetal parts!\nThe Premium and Standard Bags are both the same shape, but the main differences are the upgraded materials, colors, carrying options, and weight capacity.\n Fabric & Colors: Premium bags are made with a high-end soft-touch blue, red or green fabric. Standard Bags are made of a basic woven fabric and are only available in grey.\n Carrying Options: Premium bags offer a heavy-duty and removable shoulder strap. \n Weight Limits: Premium Bags are rated at 65 pounds for every carrying method while the Standard Bag handle is rated at 50 pounds for the handle and the backpack straps at 40 pounds.\n**Upgrade: The premium bags have been upgraded from our previous bags. They now have metal clasps and clips instead of plastic.** \n\"Chad really listened to his customers and his reviewers and went back to the drawing board and redesigned it and you can tell he is also a game player because he made the perfect game bag. Price point - perfect. The quality - for what it is, for what it does - it's a spot-on perfect.\"\nSometimes you don't need everything our Premium and Standard bags have to offer, so we're excited to launch a completely new and very affordable companion product, the Lightweight Bag.\nIt has the solid construction of our Premium and Standard offerings but is a bit smaller.\nFolds flat\nDual-layer water resistant fabric exterior\nWraparound handle straps to fully support game boxes\nI realized I needed this because grocery bags aren\u2019t built for games. The proportions aren't right for games to fit comfortably, no lid meant everything falling out in the car, there was no protection from light rain, and they weren\u2019t built for the weight.\nI also felt it wasn't quite appropriate to bring a big imposing bag when going to dinner with friends and they asked me to bring over \"just a couple of games\". \nPriced at only $6, its dollar-to-value ratio will definitely impress you!\nNote on weight limits: The Premium, Standard and Lightweight bag weight limits are based on factory testing. These bags are made for board games not for bricks, gold bars, or dirty laundry, so please use them responsibly. Weight limits also may vary depending on the weight distribution and how the bag is handled.\nOur 2020 Weekly-View Calendar was a huge hit (little did we know how many board games we'd actually end up playing) so we're bringing it back for 2021 with updated photos.\nThis is a feature-packed calendar that will include weekly gaming prompts, gamer profile cards, full year overview, 10x10 Challenge, weekly tracker, habit tracker, and space for notes.\nHave you seen some great board game photos that should be in the calendar? Recommend a specific photo (with link to original photo and/or photographer profile) in the comments section and we'll choose some photos to include! (assuming the photographer is on board).\nIt's basic business that if you're using someone's work, they should get paid. All photographers will be paid a royalty based on a percentage of calendar sales and will receive a free calendar. Each photo will say the name of both the photographer and game. \nAnytime before your items ship, you may cancel your order for a full refund, no questions asked.\nAnd when you do get your items, if you don't think what you ordered lives up to expectations, we'll also refund you 100% and even pay for return shipping.\nWe are quite confident you should receive your items by the end of December, before Christmas. There's also the possibility that, depending on your order, our inventory and fulfillment speed, you may receive your items as early as October (We'll caffeinate our elves and try our best!).\nNo additional duty or taxes will be due when your rewards are delivered to US, Canada, UK & European Union, and Australia locations.\nFriendly shipping means your package will ship from your own country or region. This is done to expedite delivery and eliminate taxes and fees.\nUS Friendly Shipping\nEU/UK Friendly Shipping (Will ship from Germany)\nAustralia Friendly Shipping\nCanada Friendly Shipping\nDo not manually increase your pledge amount to pay for the shipping now.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign in the Pledge Manager. You will get an email and an update from us after the campaign with instructions for the Pledge Manager. If you pay for shipping now, it will make things much more complicated during the Pledge Manager.\nBoardGameTables.com was founded in 2014 by me, Chad DeShon. I'm a gamer who wanted a nice table for playing board games and figured other people might as well.\nNow, in addition to selling high quality custom board game tables, BoardGameTables.com also sells a less expensive, some-assembly-required, solid wood table called The Jasper Board Game Table, and a line of quick but deceptively strategic board games.\nWe started selling board game bags for a similar reason. I needed something to carry my games in. No off-the-shelf options worked for me. They were too big, too small, or not protected enough.\nI published a board game calendar back in 2011, simply as a hobby, and sold 100. It was the first time I sold a product online, and it planted a seed of things to come; starting a business that would serve the board gaming community.  It's so rewarding to still be doing that.\nFirst: Choose the pledge level you want.\nSecond: If you want to buy lightweight bags or calendars, you will need to manually increase the price to pay for those.\nAdd $6 to your pledge for every lightweight bag.\nAdd $14 to your pledge for every calendar.\nYou can also add additional regular/premium bags or small/large playmats by adding $29/$46/$59/$69 to your pledge for each.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though this Kickstarter consists of several different products, I am confident we can deliver them on time.

As for Pendulum, we have more information on our website.

The flat shipping rate within the United States is only $6, and other countries have a flat rate of $8-$16.\n If you want more than one set, simply choose your main pledge level as you normally would, and add the amount of the additional set(s) to the total amount pledged. It's that easy!\n We don't want anything to stand between you and these really fantastic game upgrades. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\n All orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL.

We first discovered Dollars to Donuts during a company summit in Washington State. Shawn & Molly from Flatout came down to visit us and show off their games in development. From the moment we first played this charming game, we knew we had to publish it. \nHere we are almost exactly 2 years later, with the game fully developed and delightfully illustrated by Dylan Mangini. We're this close to having the game in our hands, and all we need is your help deciding how much awesome to pack in the box! \nDollars to Donuts is already a complete game. However, we've come up with a bunch of things we'd love to do with it that are typically beyond the reach of a traditional retail release - including some pie in the sky stuff that we just might be able to pull off, but only with your help.\nWe're offering Dollars to Donuts at a significant discount from the final retail price. Especially if we unlock most or all of the stretch goals we have planned, the value you'll see in the box for just $29 is outstanding. \nBackers are also guaranteed to receive their copies before anyone else. The only copies you'll see in stores or conventions before you receive yours will be offered by retailers who back this campaign - because they're backers, too (see below).\nBeyond that are the practical effects of every dollar pledged to this campaign. We've made sure every milestone in this campaign improves the final product you'll receive, and that every improvement is as significant as it can possibly be. You can find a short list of the first couple upgrades in the Stretch Goals section below, but in the meantime we wanted to offer you another way to tangibly improve the game even before we actually fund...\nWe encourage retailers to consider the $50 Dollars to Donuts Retailer pledge level. That tier includes 3 copies of the game, which is discounted even further than the already discounted backer price of $29 per copy. You may of course add multiple sets of 3 copies, each for an additional $50. \nWe love our brick & mortar partners across the world and we want you to benefit just as much as everyone else, so we are including everything we offer to any backer in this campaign to you at exactly the same time and in exactly the same quantities. That's important, so let's say it again...\nYou automatically earn the same stretch & social goal rewards as everyone else. \nWe know it's a burden for retailers to tie up funds for the longer period required for a Kickstarter campaign, so we promise that all retail backers will be included in the first shipping wave. \nWe also want to remind you that all items offered in this campaign are entirely ready for production right now. \nThank you shop owners and operators everywhere for supporting us for over 15 years!

To thank our followers for helping us to make some fun board games over the last six years, we have lowered the pledge price for this game as low as it can go. We have subsidised shipping costs as much as we can. We don't want you to miss out on pledging for Whale Riders, because we aren't sure how many copies will make it to retail.\nWhale Riders is a new design with a classic feel from famed game designer Reiner Knizia. In 45 minutes of play, 2-6 players will race to the end of the Ice Coast and back, buying and selling as many resources as possible, to make the money needed to acquire the richest prizes. Will you skip opportunities to gain the greatest treasures, or will you make your money slowly along the way?\nEach player has two actions per turn, but a lot they will want to accomplish. Sail? Buy? Sell? Draw more order cards? All the while, your opponents might be sailing past and beating you to what's on offer down the coast! Once all the precious pearls have been purchased, the game will end and the player with the most pearls will win!\nEach copy of Whale Riders will be carefully planned, prepared and packed. Here is a list of all you will receive. Oh! And please see the Stretch Goals section below for more info on how these components may be further improved and expanded during our campaign...\nThere are a few different pledge levels for our campaign. In summary, this is what you will receive at each level...\nYou will be able to choose to receive your game in English/French or Spanish in the Pledge Manager.\nRetailers: Before selecting the retailer-only pledge level, please contact us through this link: https://support.murano-alliance.com/retailers to discuss your particular enquiry. Proof of eligibility will be collected via a retailer survey upon completion of the campaign and will need to be submitted before receiving and finalising your pledge manager. Retailers will be able to order a number of copies of each title offered during this campaign.\nWhale Riders has simple and short rules, but offers a lot of interaction and interesting decisions for players. It has a classic feel - similar to many of (famed game designer) Knizia\u2019s great designs - but also feels new, sleek and (of course) fun!\n\u2192 Watch Stella and Tarrant form Meeple University teach you how to play Whale Riders!\n\u2192 You can also download the rule book by clicking the button below!\nAs well as the board game Whale Riders, we are offering the small card game Whale Riders: The Card Game to backers during this campaign for a low price! Unlike its big sister, The Card Game is not planned to be sold at retail. Copies will only be made available through this (and perhaps a future KS) campaign, and directly through our online store or at a convention. We hope you may consider backing for both games at our ALL ABOARD pledge level.\nWhale Riders: The Card Game, 2-4 players will sail alongside each other to buy goods along the Ice Coast. What is on offer at the ports will vary in quantity. Sometimes you will be working together with others only to become competitors again when a better proposition comes along. This is a re-implementation of Reiner Knizia's previously released card game, Trendy.\nJust like the Whale Riders board game, the card game is also designed by Reiner Knizia and illustrated by Vincent Dutrait, but it is a much smaller game that plays totally different to the board game\u2026\n\u2192 Watch David from Grail Games (and friends) show you how to play Whale Riders!\n\u2192 You can also download the rule book by clicking the button below!\nWith your help, we can make Whale Riders even better!

And, to reduce taxes and fees, games will ship to backers from within the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia*!\n*Australian and NZ backers have the option of paying extra to receive their copies of the game earlier - posted directly from China (and not from within Australia 1-2 months later). If you would like to take this offer, back at the regular shipping level now, and we will give you the option to pay extra in our pledge manager after the campaign. (Note that the 6-pack is not available for express shipping as the package will be overweight).\nBy supporting Whale Riders on Kickstarter, not only are you helping us to produce the game(s) in the first place, but if you back now, you will also receive them:\nat a cheaper than MSRP price,\nwith Whale Riders: The Card Game (if you wish), also heavily discounted and only available through Kickstarter and directly through Grail Games,\nearlier than anyone else will get the games, and,\nwe will be providing copies of some other titles to backers of this campaign at a reduced price as a thank you to you (Yellow & Yangtze and others via our post-campaign pledge manager)!\nBut that's not all\u2026\nThe Whale Riders titles were designed by well-known designer Reiner Knizia (of Lost Cities, Pickomino, Medici, Yellow & Yangtze fame, and much much more). He knows how to make a small game fire on all cylinders!\nThe Whale Riders titles are easy to learn games that are approachable and can be played by almost anyone.\nThe production files are ready to be uploaded to the printer right after the campaign is successfully funded. We will do all we can to deliver on time!\nThe games are full of beautiful illustrations by fan-favourite illustrator Vincent Dutrait.\nCountless hours have gone into the design and development of this game to ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience.\nWe are committed to fulfilling all Kickstarter pledges before they are available at retail. And on that point: We appreciate the support of game stores and see them as an essential part of our hobby. However, in today's crowded marketplace, our titles are becoming harder and harder to find by customers. Whale Riders will appear in stores, but at this stage, we don't believe it will be widely available. Your best bet is to back now (and at our super-low price - MSRP will be $30USD+) should you want to be sure of owning the game.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nDesigner - Reiner Knizia\nDr. Reiner Knizia is one of the world\u2019s most successful and prolific game designers. More than 600 of his games and books have been published worldwide in over 50 languages and have won him numerous international awards.\n\nArtist - Vincent Dutrait\nVincent Dutrait is currently one of the most highly regarded illustrators of board and card games in the world.

We focus on reprints, and producing English language versions of great games from Asia and Europe.

However, it would not have been possible without the support of 13 of your favorite publishers who partnered with me to see their logo, as well as their most popular games turned into handmade component mosaics. Whether you want to brighten up your kitchen, geek up your office so you can have your co-workers ask you about board games, or spruce up your game room - this is the perfect calendar for you. \nEvery image I create takes between 3 to 8 hours to assemble. Sometimes I use a reference image to help me with proportions, but I also like to go with the flow for some creations. I begin the process by choosing the colors I need from the game boxes I know contain the right pieces. Once I have the correct components, I plan out where each part will go. As I carefully lay the pieces I am constantly moving them into just the right place! I use a pencil to move pieces in tight areas because it helps with precision. Photographing each image takes almost an hour. Depending on which pieces I have used for the mosaic, the angle of the lighting needs to be adjusted. There is a lot of trial and error when taking the shots, and climbing up a chair over top of my gaming table is time consuming! \nPLAY\n\n\nEvery month has a component mosaic of a well-known board game as the main image, as well as a mosaic of that publisher's logo.\nThere is a write up about the publisher, including their website so you can check out their games.\nThe calendar includes a section to write the games you played during the month.\nAt the end of the calendar, you will find a 10x10 challenge page!\n\n\nPLAY\n\nYou asked for prints, coasters and magnets; so here is your chance!

Daryl Andrews, Rob Byers and Steve Robertson, thank you for lending me games for components I needed but did not have. Helaina Cappel(Burnt Island Games), thank you for you help with the campaign.

In 2019, we brought Fire Tower to life with the support of an amazing community of nearly 1700 backers. Now, we are back on Kickstarter for a second printing and to introduce the Rising Flames Expansion to add to the core game.    \nFire Tower is a fast-paced, tactical pattern-laying game that takes 15-30 minutes to play. You must protect your lookout tower from a rapidly spreading forest fire. Dispatch smokejumpers and fire engines to combat the blaze and construct firebreaks to fortify your tower.\nBut there is a twist! In Fire Tower, you also take on the role of nature. Harness the power of the wind to push the blaze towards your opponents and unleash an arsenal of fire cards to take down their towers before they can reach yours. \nIn the Rising Flames Expansion, rapid crown fires, heavy winds, and tumultuous weather threaten the forest. Defend your tower with a powerful new deck and a flock of legendary firehawks. Beware the growing influence of the Shadow of the Wood, as destroyed towers now have a host of new abilities to claim a surprise victory. The Rising Flames Expansion adds solo and fifth player mode, along with new variants of play and a flock of custom meeples. \nThe second edition of Fire Tower includes all unlocked stretch goals and the same high-quality components as the first edition, Kickstarted in 2018. \n* Enhanced by an unlocked stretch goal (see below for details)\nThe standard expansion will fit into the base game and is made with high-quality components, like 310 gsm blue core cards with a linen finish. It comes with all the same content as the deluxe expansion. See below for the new components and upgrades that are included in the deluxe expansion.  \n* Enhanced by an unlocked stretch goal (see below for details)\nThe deluxe expansion will fit into the base game and includes everything in the standard expansion as well as an acrylic eternal flame centerpiece and cloth bag for your components. The deluxe also includes upgrades, such as screen-printed hawk meeples, a custom engraved Shadow Die, and custom lightning tokens. All cards are 310gsm blue core with a linen finish. \n Fan us on Board Game Geek (101/100) Unlocked! \n Like us on Facebook (1004/1000) Unlocked! \n Share on Facebook (310/300) Unlocked! \n Follow us on Instagram (1000/1000) Unlocked! \n Subscribe to our Mailing List \n Follow us on Twitter \nBefore learning the expansion, you have to learn the base game.

We worked tirelessly on Fire Tower to create a high quality, beautiful and fun game, and to lay the groundwork for a business. Our first Kickstarter was invaluable in helping us do that. Fire Tower was finished, manufactured, and fulfilled within eight months and all of our backers received the game by the estimated delivery date. \nWe've shown Fire Tower at nearly 30 conventions and have playtested Rising Flames with over 1,000 gamers. The expansion is a thrilling new addition to the world of Fire Tower that deepens the theme and mechanics of the game, while at the same time staying true to the original experience. We've listened to your advice, and have fine-tuned Rising Flames to be a game we are sure you'll love. \nPlaying the expansion at PAX South\nYour support is the only way we can make Rising Flames a reality!\nWe are offering Fire Tower, the Rising Flames expansion, and our mini-expansions at a discounted rate for the duration of this Kickstarter. After the campaign is over, the price will go up.\nYour pledge will help us reach stretch goals that will enhance the game even further, making the game better for everyone!\nDesigned by Firescale Studio\nYou get to fight the fire. You get to BE the fire. You even control a flock of arsonist hawks. We are the only purely competitive game about fighting forest fires that we know of (let us know if you find another one). And if that's not enough, here are few other points we think are pretty neat:\n The artwork. If you're familiar with Kevin Ruelle's vibrant watercolors, you already know that we lucked out having him as our artist. We\u2019re excited to unveil new paintings and designs with his unique style in our expansion. Check out some of his other work here.\n Easy to learn. Fire Tower takes about 5 minutes to learn and Rising Flames takes just a few minutes more. Need proof? Check out our How To Play videos above.\n Easy to set up. \"Let's play Fire Tower,\" you say. You'll be set up and playing in just a couple minutes. Time it and let us know.\n Made for visual learners. We hate reading the fine print, which is why we have simple graphics on each card to clue you into the rules, saving new players from having to constantly refer to the rule book.\n The components. Because everyone needs 135 fire gems in their life. And everyone needs that eternal flame (basically a giant fire gem). Honestly, everyone needs those firehawk meeples. We know you are thinking of buying more copies because you want to fill a bathtub with those gems. Don't let us stop you.\n Learn about firefighting and . . . fire-spreading birds. The firefighting techniques and terms in this game are all real. In fact, wildfire fighters often mention the accuracy of this game (minus burning other towers, of course). And firehawks are real and magnificent birds that everyone should Google when they get a chance.\n Replayability. With Rising Flames, we are offering tons of different ways to play. There are variants for different player counts, a SOLO MODE, and different ways to mix and match elements in your game. We want this to be the most worn-out game on your shelf.\n Lastly, this game is just plain fun. We've played the base game and the expansion a countless number of times (3000?) and we still enjoy it. This game is just that good. \nOur family portrait attempt (Fire Tower is much more photogenic than we are)\nThank you for writing us with your feedback, for sharing photos of your games of Fire Tower, for seeking us out at conventions to say hello. Once, at Essen, two people we met the day before even showed up early to our booth and set up for us, without even asking, just to give us a break (thanks Walter and Alex!). Because gamers are THAT COOL. Seriously, thank you. We could not have done it without you. \nA few other important thanks:\nJustin Oslyn, Grace Kendall, Mike Belsole, and Zach Farmer for working tirelessly at conventions to help us bring Fire Tower to the world\nHillary Giacomelli for her incredible meeple designs\nRoque Nonini for his infinite help in all things photo and video\nFirescale Studios for their beautiful flame centerpiece design. \nOur families and friends for offering their advice, storing our boxes, and everything in between  \nCredits: Video music by Voltz Supreme (Joel McLean)\nKickstarter has been a huge part of the renaissance that board games are currently going through, and we are thrilled to be a part of that. The fact that Kickstarter provides an avenue for designers to print their product is a dream come true. We want to be able to put Fire Tower and the Rising Flames expansion on your game table and tables across the globe. Kickstarter will ensure that we are able to do that. \nPhoto by Roque Nonini\nIf this is your first Kickstarter and you haven't backed before, follow these simple steps:\n1.

Only a few weeks ago, NASA and the Canadian Space Agency discovered the station's Canadarm2 had been struck by orbiting debris, ripping a hole through the arm's insulation.

So it's no surprise that the construction of the station was riddled with problems. Funding cuts, shifting geopolitical climates, engineering setbacks - these were all just part of the job. In the end, it took thousands of engineers on earth and hundreds of astronauts in space to complete the station, equipped with everything from robotic cranes and NASA-designed space-bolts to run-of-the-mill hacksaws and duct tape."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "A calm and routine day", "update_content": "Fellow Cosmonauts,\nAs much as the theme of Intrepid focuses on the potential disasters aboard the International Space Station, a typical day on the ISS is much more mundane.

While not terribly exciting, these tasks are what keeps the station running smoothly.

Bartolomeo was delivered last Spring and has been slowly working through the installation process. This spacewalk was supposed to be the final step, but a couple of faulty power cables forced the astronauts to abort. Of the six cables needed, two would not fully attach to the facility.

Just like us, the ISS crew had reason to celebrate the beginning of 2021.
